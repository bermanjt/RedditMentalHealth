0,"I've identified as bisexual since I was 15 and never really questioned my sexual attraction towards men until a few months ago. I brought it up with my therapist because I wasn't sure how or if I should bring this up with a guy I'd been talking to for awhile who I met on a dating app. He told me not to tell him since I wasn't even entirely sure myself, and it made sense at the time, but now I really regret not saying anything. We had been texting back and forth for about 7 months, which I know is a ridiculous amount of time, but every time we'd try to meet up something would come up. I abruptly stopped texting him back about 3 months ago because I felt like he had lost interest in me and I saw this as a way out of having to actually confront the issue, which was a really shitty thing to do. He reached out to me again yesterday and we've been talking about school, and I don't know how to approach this because I'd be completely fine with being friends, but I don't know if that's what he wants. We're both pretty inexperienced with dating and I need help addressing this because I don't want him to think that he did anything wrong.",13Oct2020,1
1,I love my boyfriend with all my heart and we have a baby together I wanna be with him forever but for 2 years he doesn’t believe anything I say he always thinks I’m cheating on him when I’m not I’m always at home I don’t have a job nor do I have a car nor have I ever cheated on him. Sometimes he beats me up bc he thinks I’m lyin after we have sex he says that my Pussy feels different sometimes but I haven’t did anything wit anybody then he asks me y does it feel like that but idek y and then he think I’m lyin bout it and he beats me up for it ik he loves me and he has never cheated on me ik that for a fact but when he accuses me of doin things he calls me all types of names and says he hates me and that he wish he never met me or had a baby wit me and that hurt me bc I never did anything wrong I think he is still hurt by his past girlfriends for what they did to him. I don’t wanna break up wit him bc I do love him but we were better off bestfriends like when we first met I wish it could still be like that,13Oct2020,1
2,"I feel like I'm supposed to be in a universe besides this one. I feel like I was accidentally placed here (in this universe) by mistake and that I'm supposed to be somewhere else. I sometimes feel disconnected like I or things around me aren't real and time sometimes passes very slowly or quickly for me. I also space out and get distracted a lot. But I generally know that this universe is real, it just feels like I don't fit in this universe, like I was misplaced. Basically I feel like Cinderella's stepsisters trying to jam their fat feet into the glass slipper and failing miserably. Sometimes I look at a game or character(s) and there is this empty sometimes even melancholic longing feeling. Its a feeling like something's missing or that I forgot something but also feels like a link or connection has been made. One example is Saeran/Ray from Mystic Messenger. I have a feeling commonly where it's this empty, blank, dark feeling like something's missing or that I forgot something really important and a foggy confusion and sadness is caused or created due to this feeling. And because I can't decipher the feeling or what it means makes me even more sad, frustrated and confused. And I never know what to do.",13Oct2020,1

4,"So my friend and I are planning a trip to Colorado (safely, of course). He booked the hotel without letting me know the price, without either of us getting tested for covid beforehand. He’s been down my throat about it since he booked, but I don’t have nearly as much cash in my account as he does at the moment (due to my last paycheck going to bills, dog expenses, student loans etc). I told him I’ll pay him once I have the money, but he still asks every single day and gets mad when I give him the same answer. Now I’m waiting on my covid test results and if I’m positive, I won’t be able to go, He got mad at me about that too. AITA?",13Oct2020,1
5,"So, since graduating college this spring I’ve had quite a lot of downtime. I have a part-time job but I essentially do nothing with my time besides going for walks. 

I don’t really drive so I can’t just take random drives/ trips. I also have pretty bad anxiety and depression so sometimes I find it hard to do anything at all.

6,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

My mom and I seem to always be fighting. We have never been close where we share things. Like I hate ""sharing feelings."" I'll share them with strangers, but not with people I know.

So we had an argument on Thursday, it subsided. We had an argument on Friday, it subsided. We argued on Saturday, it subsided. We argued yesterday, and she left and didn't come home until like 10pm. We were okay today and then I don't know what happened but a spark ignited and we fought again. We didn't have to fight but we just did and we haven't talked for like 2 hours.

I am 30 and my mom is 50. Yes, I still live at home but not because I want to. I am physically disabled and need assistance with things like getting out of bed, showering, getting dressed. I know that she probably didn't want this life to care for someone all her life, but I have a sister who helps me as well. 

Our main point of arguing over the last few years was me not being able to find a job. I received a Master's Degree and she thinks the field I chose was to mock her. She wanted me to go for psychology, and I did. I hated it with every fiber of my being. I didn't want anything to do with that program, mostly because the 4 psychology professors of the program played favorites with the friends of their kids, who were also in the program. If you were not friends with their kids, forget it. And making friends with them was a chore. By the time I realized this I had almost 2 years of work done and I didn't want to start my junior year in another program at level 100 classes. So I stuck it out and ended up with a 2.75 GPA (considered B+ at the University). 

So after this, I had to decide what I wanted to do for graduate school. I didn't want to go into Counseling or School Psychology. Basically the entire graduate school program that is psychology related was out. There was one section of psychology that I liked and that was Industrial/Organizational Psychology. Fancy of saying working in HR. So I decided to go for an MBA in HR Management, with an additional field of study being Strategic Management. It was an extra 2 classes, so I figured why not. I graduated with a 3.85 GPA for the whole MBA program and a 4.0 GPA for my field of study. 

I finished school in May 2017. Since then it was very hard to find a job. Since I am physically disabled, my opportunities were limited to what internships I could do (which were none) or anything that would gain me experience in the field. I did have a job on campus that paid for my tuition which I did not mind because hey, I will graduate debt free.

Fast forward through the years 2017 to 2020. My mom and I are always arguing about me finding work. I try to explain to her that my options are limited because of my limited experience, and my travel is limited because a) she has a job and b) she can't quit her job to drive me to a job where I will make half of what she makes. She just doesn't get it. I still apply to as many jobs as I can. Like 6-7 a day. So do the math what that adds up to over 3 years.

Jump ahead to the summer of 2020. COVID hit in March, my mom got laid off. I see a lot of job openings and they are mostly work from home. I apply for a Customer Service Representative at a local health insurance company. It's work from home during the pandemic. I get the job on my first try. Like I literally needed someone to just give me one interview all those years ago and I could have been working all this time.

So I started working just as her unemployment ran out. There was like one week where there was no income from me and no income from her. But it's all good because thankfully we are not in debt. So I started working thinking that our arguments would be over now that I found a job, but nope. They still go on.

I don't know what to do anymore. I am tired of the fighting. I'm tired of gritting my teeth around her. I apologized this morning about yesterday, because okay I will admit that one was kind of my fault, and everything was fine until 6pm when something snapped. 

Maybe I am the problem in this situation and cause all the arguments. 

Any advice is appreciated.",13Oct2020,1

11,"My sister applied for a bunch of schools and she wants to go to one in Southern California (we live in the Bay Area) because their programs there are better for her major according to her (she only applied to CSUs). My parents don’t really trust her for some stuff she did a couple years ago and that combined with money makes it so that they won’t financially support her if she goes to a school in SoCal (if she goes to a school in the Bay Area and lives at home she will have financial support).

My sister wants to go to the school in SoCal, though. She got a job last summer (first job) and it sounds like she’s going to move out whether or not she receives financial aid from my parents. My parents don’t have any plan to bend on that. 

Not sure if it helps, but my Mom was staying fairly emotionally stable throughout the conversation, whereas my Dad stormed out of the room at one point (I was sitting in the room when I heard my parents talk to my sister about this but I did not participate in the conversation) and said things like “You don’t know what you’re doing” and claimed that my sister was being a simp (following her boyfriend to college is what “simp” means, which my sister has expressed to me that following her boyfriend to college is not her goal by going to SoCal). I stepped in when my Dad called her a simp because I’ve previously asked my Dad to be nicer with his words in these conversations and he promised he would do that. When he called her a simp I told him he was being rude and asked him to stop (I said he doesn’t “have to use shit like that”, looking back now I realize I shouldn’t have cursed because that only escalated whatever my Dad was feeling), he told me “You better shut up, don’t even let me get started with you”. At that point I said “Alright” and remained quiet because I wanted to deescalate the conversation. 

I know part of the reason my sister wants to go to SoCal is because she wants more independence (we have strict parents who like to use Life360/curfew 8:00pm, etc), which she was able to get when my sister and I lived in a place separate from our parents for a bit. She made some bad decisions when doing that which is why I think my parents lost some trust in her.

That aside, my main worry is that my sister won’t be ok if she goes through with her plan. She has more life experience than I do, but she still doesn’t have a lot of world experience of financial stability to move to Southern California like that. She’s been looking at stuff like “subleasing” but I’m not sure how thorough she’s looked at all the stuff.

I also understand that my parents are not obligated to fund my sister’s college and that since she’s an adult, they don’t even have to house her like they do now.

Are my feelings valid about this (should I tell her I don’t think she will be OK if she moves out)? Or should I support my sister in moving out like this?",13Oct2020,1
12,"I’m female, and I’m thinking about using male pronouns, but I don’t want anyone to be confused or upset about it.

14,"
To understand where Im coming from here's some context about that I think shaped how I see things. 

When I was in elementary school I was severely depressed/had suicidal thoughts (something I only realized was not a normal state of being until after getting through it). I didnt see a point to life, and everything felt useless and hollow.

About my dad:

If my dad caught me crying and being sad id feel and be humiliated. My words where never taken seriously by my dad, whatever problems I had my dad used to always say it was all in my head or im making it up, or that im exaggerating. Those words haunt me to this day. As a physical example, one time I had tendonitis in both my calves for a year (im approximating) before my dad believed me enough when I told him my legs where in really hurt. Guess he thought I was exaggerating before.

About my mom:

Although I hated showing my emotions, sometimes it would build up and I'd have a random outsburst I couldn't control. Although I had no control, for some reason this only happened around my mom. I'd be crying and be trying to tell my mom how im feeling or how shes not helping with how shes treating me, but nomatter how much I screamed and yelled with tears my mom would just ignore me always (in my moms defense its pretty obvious her flaws came from her mother who was a terrible person to my mom). She never responded to how I was feeling or the questions I asked her. She acted like I wasn't their and just kept going about whatever she was doing.

I realized I was worthless and that nothing has meaning. But in realizing I was nothing, I also came to realize that that ment I could build myself into anything I wanted to piece by piece. Something switched because from then on I seeked out suffering, I cant explain why exactly but it felt like I was tempering a worthless piece of metal in a fire, and it was fun to see what it might become. All my best traits and achievements where born out of this view of tempering myself.

The man I am today is someone who can make the best of life, but I also kind of look toward the end of my existence (whenever it comes) with open arms.

My question is how normal are my feelings on life? Really I think Im just kinda wanting to reassure myself that my views are probably not that uncommon. 

Sorry for the long read but also thank you, this is the first time im verbalizing all this stuff.",13Oct2020,1
15,"Okay the title sounds a little f*cked but bare with;

I've always struggled with empathy. I watch a video of a puppy that was abandoned and I'm crying. A kid starving in a poor country also makes me cry.

Anything that happens irl to people I know does not. My dad's upset and crying? My brother is sick? A coworkers nan died? Doesn't faze me. I know it's sad but I don't feel anything. Logically I think oh that's wrong. But I don't feel any emotions behind it and don't understand how people can be sad about others sadness. 

Now to the point.
Today my boyfriend of 7 years found out his father sexually assaulted his older sister (she has a different dad) from the ages of 8-13. My bf was maybe like 1-7 at the time of this. His dad confessed to his own mother, and has done a runner in his car with claims he's going to top himself. 

I literally don't feel a thing. I know it's horrible what happened to his sister and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. But that's as far as im feeling. Even then there's no emotion behind my disgust other than the fact it's wrong and shouldn't have happened?

He said he was going to visit his nan this evening (his dad's mom) and I didn't understand why at first. He hasn't seen her in 2-3 years. So Obviously she is upset and she is with her other children who are looking after her. So in my head I see no need for him to go visit her? I couldn't comprehend why he would drive to see her?

He could tell me his dad actually followed through with his threat and did die and my response would be okay. (for the record my bf hated his dad before any of this, they didn't have a relationship nor did I know him well)

My bf is a little mad that I'm lacking empathy. and it is a point he had made often. He said even though I was saying things like 'are you okay' &amp; asking him to talk to me; there was no emotion behind it. It's like we're talking about the weather

Even now, the only emotion I'm feeling is annoyed that my bf had a go at me? I literally feel nothing about this entire evening except irritation that he's moaned. 

So I guess my question is three fold;

Is this normal or am I destined to become a mass murderer. Not even a joke; Google told me lack of empathy is the trait of a psychopath

How does one improve their empathy? 

How do I at least fake the empathy well until I learn how to feel it because I don't want to be a little robot person",13Oct2020,1

17,"So my girlfriend broke up with me over a month ago and been mentally spiralling since. I don’t like myself anymore. I guess it was a big deal for me to be a positive for someone, my ex, so now I’m not and also questioning if I ever was, it’s like I’ve gone one step forwards two steps back. 

I’m a person who is unintentionally always avoiding every opportunity to be vulnerable. This makes me come across as selfish and uninteresting. Not that I’m the most interesting or giving person on the planet but I wish I could have a opinion. When I was younger I used to be me 24/7. Now I feel like after teenage years of realising it’s easy to not put yourself out there, I have just stopped having and voicing opinions on things. It’s just made me a people pleaser. Even if I do have an opinion on something why can’t I just say it. 

Why couldn’t I tell my ex she was the smartest prettiest funniest angel I’d ever met? Sure I managed to get it out a couple times but not as much as she deserved or needed. Why couldn’t I say what I wanted to do just in case it wasn’t something that she wanted to do?

18,"So this is something that has escalated since we have lived here the last couple years. Late at night I can hear doors slamming and loud pounding coming from the neighbors, and my wife says she hears it during the day too. They have two small children and it sucks to know that they hear their parents fight like this. A couple nights ago I heard the husband screaming so loud  I thought my wife had the TV on for a second. 
The problem is that we don't live in an apartment, it is a split home and if I call the cops they will absolutely know it was me who did it, as we are the only ones who could hear unless someone heard them from the street. I have gone over when the pounding or loud music went late into the night and asked them to keep it down, but when the man is screaming in a rage and most likely drunk, it doesn't seem wise to confront him myself.

Back story of me and problem #1
“You can skip this part as it doesn’t relate to the title”

In freshman year of hs I weighed 260 pounds then lost 30lbs when I went into sophomore year. Then covid hit and I made sure that I was not gonna let it ruin me. So I lost a additional 40 lbs. Now I weigh 190. I don’t particularly know if im decent looking all I know is that I’m not ugly. Recently many people have been commenting about my weight and how I look better. NOW THIS IS THE PROBLEM. 

Problem #1
When im outside I really could care less about how I look I just go out to my hobbies because it makes me happy. But when im home it messes with me. 

Of course losing all this weight made me gain confidence and I do notice girls staring but it usually long eye contact idk how to describe it but im sure they looked at me. Again something that never happened to me before. 

ACTUAL INCIDENTS
Ok so here is the actual part that is important! I was always involved with sports. I play soccer for my hs. And we also have a girls team. The first day of practice I just walk and sat down and instantly noticed girls staring. I looked back and I’m 100% sure they were looking at me. (Some knew the before me while some didn’t).

Incident #2
A couple of practices later I notice a particular girl staring and I’m pretty sure she’s interested. This is because the staring and when we were running I past her and she told her friend something in Spanish and I for sure knew that it was about me. Because the whole time she didn’t say anything. 

Incident #3
The ball went to her and I went to get it and she passed it and I said thank you. She replies you’re welcome but with a lot of effort as English isn’t her first language.

Ok I know that these incidents might just be stupid or not enough proof but I just feel like for some reason what I think is true. I know the only way to find if she is interested is to talk to her. So how do I start a conversation with this girl?",13Oct2020,1

I was quite sad when I knew my dog passed and cried about it in my room. However, I went about my day as normal and told people when someone mentioned dogs over the course of the coming months. 
It didn't really occur to me that I would announce it to anyone, or cancel plans with friends etc.

28,"So we was watching a film late and we both ended up falling asleep. Abruptly woke up around 3am cause when I was half asleep I checked my phone. He got up and said let’s go to bed. I didn’t hear him say anything else but then he randomly went “oh my god” and sounded stressed. I didn’t think much of it and we both went to bed. 
Then the next morning I was thinking  about the night before and I brought up how he randomly said oh my god. And he kinda got pissed with himself and said he had said something stupid. So of course I kept annoying him begging him to tell me and he said he didn’t want to cause it might annoy and upset me. Then he just said “I called you the wrong name”. Immediately I knew what name it was. This name was the name of a girl he was friends with for years and they became intimate randomly, it wasn’t a relationship though. They then fell out and don’t speak anymore and we’d randomly brought this up the weekend prior just cause I mentioned her randomly asking why they’d stopped being friends. He said he really dislikes her now and doesn’t like the person she is. They haven’t spoken for maybe a couple years or so. 
But anyways I kinda got silent with him and got upset over it. He was hella annoyed with himself from what I could tell. He said it was a genuine mistake, he was half asleep and had a brain fart. He said she isn’t even a part of his life anymore. I could tell he felt bad. 
After a bit I said to him I wouldn’t let something like that ruin what we have and I believed he’d made a genuine mistake. I do trust him that’s the thing. BUT even after saying that I still felt hurt and I am quite self conscious so I felt like my brain was self sabotaging me. We’ve not been together long. It’s been around 3 months. He shows me nothing but love and is amazing with me. I just feel like I need advice to put my brain at ease about it and want to know if I’m being immature even getting upset??",13Oct2020,1

30,"Title is self-explanatory, but I can provide more details. Sorry if it's something of a rant post but I really need to talk about it.

So I'm something of a creative person. I lived my whole life in music, not only listening but singing as well. I've done choir and been in a group for most of my school years, and have always told myself that when I'm alone, I'll start creating more, but also posting it. Same with content creation, I've always admired well done videos and wanted to do some myself.

Now that I am truly free of all restrictions, I find myself ""not finding time"" to actually create. I literally have all the material available, but I feel like it's just too much for me. Maybe it's because I don't know where to start, or maybe it's because I just don't know what to create, but I can't for the life of me actually do something.

I have tried a few things, but it almost feels pointless, like no one ever sees it. I know things take time and I'm still so young but I can't bring myself to the realization that things take time and I shouldn't be too worried about that...

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah that was my one advice post, it's something I somehow can't do with people I know, which is why I ask total strangers on the internet who have never seen me and who I've never seen for advice.",13Oct2020,1
31,"I'm in high school (senior, female) and there used to be a girl who was super nice to me. She was really nice to everyone, so she was naturally nice to me as well. We also became somewhat friends. She would comment on my Instagram photos and we would talk in class. She would say hi to me in the halls.

Then one day this guy approaches me and says he likes me. We talk and get to know each other more, then start going on dates. He is pretty well liked and well known in my school, so people started finding out. People were kinda rude to me about it, girls I had never talked to before started asking me about him. I guess a lot of girls would ""swoon"" over him, but it seemed disrespectful in the way they asked me about him. It was almost as if they wanted to find out more information to know if we would last, and so they could know if they had a chance.

This one specific girl who was super nicer to me also asked me about him. She even saw him at a party once and asked him about me, which he apparently said he really liked me (her words). After that, the guy started to tell me that this girl and her friend told him that I'm ""weird"" and they asked him why he would like me. 

After that, she was super rude to me. She stopped talking to me in class, stopped saying hi to me, she wouldn't even make eye contact with me if we were alone in the hallway or the bathroom passing each other. I ended up ending things with this guy and I began dating another guy. The guy seemed upset that I ended it with him, but honestly the way girls were obsessed with him turned me off. I didn't want to deal with it anymore. However, he did end up dating the girl who was mean to me. I never expressed that I was annoyed about her being mean to me, so he didn't know but it was kinda funny. I knew she must have been going after him hardcore.

Then, I was at party when I arrived with a few of my best friends. This girl immediately went up to my friend and I, but ONLY talked to my friend. She went up to both of us, but did not make eye contact with me. She even began talking to my friend and started turning her back from me, so I wouldn't be included. This confused me because she came up to MY friend and I when we were standing together talking prior. 

This continued. We went on a school trip to another country and this girl was there. She would ONLY talk to the friend I went on the trip with. This lasted the entire trip. She even would ask to take photos with my friend at historical sites, and would not ask me. I didn't care about this, it was just awkward because she would always come put to my friend and I who were standing together, speaking. It made it quite obvious that she wanted to ignore me.

Also, an important detail is that I began dating my friend's boyfriend after I ended things with the first guy. This girl seemed to have a huge problem with that. We played truth or date (in a big group, mean girl was there), and the mean girl asked her friend who said truth, ""would you ever date your friend's brother?"" and her friend said ""ew no, never that is so disrespectful""

I don't know why, but this really makes me upset. I didn't do anything at all. My best guess is that she hates me because her boyfriend liked me before he liked her, but that isn't an excuse. I felt like I was harassed while with the guy, so I literally broke up with him over it. Yet, I'm still being treated poorly by this girl. She is being so passive aggressive. I just feel hurt, I don't know why. I feel half hurt and half angry. I'm angry because I can assume her reasoning, but that is no excuse for me. The mean girl is also really well liked in my school, which makes it worse. She is nice to everyone else, but pretty rude to me so it hurts. How can I stop being hurt over this?",13Oct2020,1
32,"It was in 12th grade when I found out I had a half brother on my dad side. But it wasn’t until a few months ago I started to put effort into finding him but every time I bring him up my mom and my aunt (my fathers sister) they play dumb and become all 🤭🤐. When I do ask them it’s always “why do you need to know” or “why are you all of a sudden interested in it.” I told them time and time again that it isn’t about them and I have the right to know about my brother and he has the right to know about his sister. But they always took offense to that and told me that I was ungrateful and should just forget about it. I was never really close with my father because to be curt... he was an abusive manipulator and blamed others for the things that went wrong in his life even though it was his own fault things went bad. He even had me lie several times to my own mother about things to save his own ass and in the process would try to turn me against her. Also, my father passed 3 years ago from life long illnesses so it’s too late to ask him. I’m 22 yrs old and I think he’s around 13-16 years old but I can’t find any info about him. The only thing I know about him is that he may live in Long Island, NY and his mother’s name. I’m not even sure if he knows about me or if he goes by our father’s last name. I always wanted a sibling since I’m an only child but I have no way of finding any info about him. I don’t want to cross any boundaries when it comes to reaching out to him because he is still a kid and I’m an adult, so it would be weird that some random women is talking to a child, who may not know who I am. Does anyone knows how I can go about finding him? I live in NYC so I think it would be a bit easier to find him but, I can’t afford a PI because I recently lost my job and I don’t trust those sites who claims they’re legit that ask you to put in personal info only to be told you have to pay for its services.",13Oct2020,1

35,"So let me start with the day I was exposed. We were celebrating the anniversary of my dad's death on Tuesday and usually we have a small get together at my aunt or uncle's house. My dad's cousin, her husband and her son usually show up as well because they were close with my dad, and it turns out these 3 all tested positive with COVID just today. I trust my family because we all take the pandemic seriously, amd since I haven't seen my family in a long time, I hugged my aunts and uncle, and did hug my Dad's cousin. Even though it's a pandemic I've seen all my aunts and uncle throughout the year and we always hug when we see each other and hug goodbye, so I didn't think nothing of it. That night was fine we were all just enjoying ourselves then went home fine. I spent the next day at a friends house and didn't feel sick at all, everything was fine. That night, I woke up coughing in the middle of the night drenched in sweat. I smoke a lot of weed, and I assumed I just smoked too much that day and it left me congested. I cleared my nose and spit out any phlegm I had and felt fine the next day, no congestion, no phlegm. But, I have had a Headache since Thursday morning, that has persisted ever since. My cough hasn't returned and my throat simply just feels dry. No loss of taste or smell. I feel like I just have a cold or a sinus infection (I'm prone to sinus infections this time of yeat).

To cut to the point, I tell my girlfriend about my headache, and that I've been feeling weird lately. It's not a really bad headache, and I haven't had any lung issues in fact I'm breathing just fine, but the back of my throat is a little sore. Again, nothing terribly debilitating and I feel like I have actually gotten better since the day I first started having symptoms. I tell my girlfriend my symptoms and she just brushes it off and says, ""maybe you just need to sleep and your headache will go away."" I tell her another day my headache kind of went away but It's still there. She says, ""you're not sick you're fine."" My girlfriend always does this when I'm sick. Everytime I'm feeling mildly sick she tells me its all in my head and it's not that big of a deal. Well, Saturday afternoon my Dad's cousin said her son was having symptoms of COVID. Immediately this scared the shit out of me, and I even told my girlfriend this and again she didn't think much about it because we Didn't actually come into contact with the boy. But I did hug his mom, so naturally I'm onnhigh alert. I setup an appointment to get tested by this tuesday, so tomorrow.

The icing on the cake, today we are told by an aunt that my dad's cousin said her husband and son tested postive. I tell my girlfriend this, and she immediately starts saying she hates me, its my fault for exposing her to covid, she cant take work off for this crap again because she's trying to get a promotion and now this is going to ruin her chance and its all my fault because it's my family that got COVID. And if I'm sick then that means she's sick and now she definitely has to quarantine and she doesn't have any more sick hours to use for 14 days. I told her that its unfair of her to blame me. I had no idea that they were sick, and I had no way of knowing. Not only that I have been telling her I don't feel okay and she continually brushed it off, but now that it's definitely proven someone in my family has COVID, now she believes I'm sick, now she wants to blame me for something I had no control over, and now she wants to be upset about taking time off work when she already used her sick hours after she got tested a couple months back and came back negative. 

I'm deeply frustrated because not only do I have to feel ridiculed by my girlfriend, but I also have to contact friends I have been close to and tell them to get tested. I'm embarassed, I'm sick, and now I'm ashamed and I feel like now my friends won't want anything to do with me.

So I guess I'm asking how should I deal with this? My girlfriend is taking all her frustration out on me like I am the sole cause of this exposure. I am very worried about telling my friends they should get tested, because I don't want them to feel the same way about me that my girlfriend does right now. And I just all around feel like crap both physically and mentally. I just don't know what I should do.",13Oct2020,1
37,"Hello. For some background I am 17 and started therapy about 2 years ago due to personal issues. My therapist (she is actually a psychiatrist) helped me a lot but I feel disconnected from her, unseen and feel like my current issues are being extremely overlooked, and overall I feel like I need help yet she doesn't provide it to me. 

It feels bad. One day I had a session that I left crying not due to the topic of it, but the way she handleded the situation (she was pretty rude). There are other moments like this. 

So, how do I say goodbye? I already have someone else I know and want to give a try, so no need to worry about spending time without supervision, plus I have my family on my side. The only problem is that just now I was able to open up a little more (about issues I had never spoken before, which is a big step for me) and don't want to waste this vulnerability. That moment when I opened up was the only moment I felt I was taken seriously in several months.

That, and the fact I don't know how to say I want to stop therapy with her are the only things holding me back. 

.... writting this made me realize that maybe all I need to do is tell her I want to stop. In this case, do I tell her during a session? Do I say it at the end or at the start? Do I tell her through a message? Do I tell her exactly what has been bothering me (I did tell her once, but maybe I wasn't clear enough tho), or do I sugarcoat it?

Thank you in advance.",13Oct2020,1
38,"Hey everyone! I have found myself in a predicament and I’m not quite sure how to proceed.

Back in the late 00’s-early 10’s, I made a Facebook fan page for a celebrity. I would post news and pictures of this celeb, never claiming to be him. I even posted a few times making sure everyone knew it was a FAN run page. I was 13/14 at the time, but the page ended up amassing 170,000 followers.

Fast forward to today, and the page has been inactive for 5 years. It currently sits at 120,000 followers. I wonder if I should be doing something with it?

I’m generally a creative person, but I really don’t know what to do with this page. I could sell it, or make it into something new.. this is something I’m not experienced with, and maybe someone could help me. 120,000 people is a lot, and it feels like a waste to just sit there.

Another time, my friend was telling me about drinking a bunch at a wedding with her husband and kids, then driving to the hotel after getting a 6 pack and passing out before they could drink it.

This was especially the case in elementary and middle school where I could play for hours and be totally hooked. I could play for as long as I wanted without thinking about anything else.

I think it might be that my imagination has slowly declined as I've gotten older. I'm in my early 20s and even 5 years ago I was able to enjoy video games more easily. Even more so around 10 - 15 years ago though. It's possible that mental health plays a factor but I've had good mental health for most of my life, yet the enjoyment I get from games has slowly declined over a longer period of time. I've found this to be the case with movies and tv shows as well but to a lesser extent. I'm hoping that VR with its benefit of extra immersions will help with getting more lost in whatever game I'm playing.

It was fine at first until it hurt really bad afterwards. I’ve been staying with my bio father in and out over the past four years. My father’s not really a nice man and I’m not close with my father at all. It hasn’t been good for me mentally and pshically staying with my father. When I get emotional I start to miss the good times I had my mom and stepfather.

I graduated from a different high school last year in his area. I didn’t get to graduate with my original class back with my stepfather. I was really excited to go to college. My bio father prevented me from going to the cc I was interested in. It was far and it was in the same area I grew up in with my mother and stepfather.

I spent after my graduation up until the end of February. Alone and unemployed sitting in the corner of his dinning table in his house. Mostly being on my phone for hours. I have been getting rides to work by my father. My current job isn’t far from his home. But I’m leaving my current my job. Displeasing as this sounds it’s not working out for me.

Problem is,  his family lives in another country,  and I have barely spoken to them, they don't Skype. One of his parents has been seriously ill the entire time we've been dating - in and out of hospital, grim talks about mortality kind of ill. 
Due to this, and lately all the covid travel restrictions,  I've never met his parents.

His dad is now too sick to be visited, and his health is rapidly worsening. My boyfriend is devastated that he may never be able see him again in person. I want to support my partner through this horrible time, and I also don't want to intrude on his family and what could be his last memories with his dad. 

Part of me is looking ahead,  to when the inevitable happens, and wondering if I'm going to be able to comfort my partner without any good memories of his dad myself. Like comforting someone about a stranger that you sort of know indirectly,  it feels.. not good. The two of them are very close and it's going to be tough on him. 

Another part of me desperately wants to meet his dad so he can see for himself how happy his son makes me, and just generally show him in person that his son is in a good relationship and will be supported no matter what happens.

I'd give anything to have just one awkward family dinner with his parents. To have them get to know me and judge me a bit, and pry gently about their son and whether he does his own laundry or not. To hear his dad make boomer jokes,  and ask what our future plans are, and why arent we getting married yet.

61,"Hi! I’ve never posted before and I’m on my phone so I apologize about any formatting stuff.

First I’ll give a little background, I’m (22F) a student in my last semester university. Last year was my favorite living situation during my college time. I was living in an off-campus apartment with roommates (one of which ended up becoming one of my best friends) and my boyfriend (23M) lived with his bestfriend in a different complex but it was right behind mine and only a two minute walk away. Both of our leases ended this past summer and we both moved back in with our parents (he lives about 30 minutes from the school we attend and I lived 2.5 hours away on the other side of the state).

That brings us to my living situation now. My boyfriend had always planned on living at home his final semester to save money and my previous roommate/friend wanted to move in with some girls from her program as I would be graduating before her anyways. With everything going on with covid and the fact that I don’t know many people who are still in the area by my school I decided to get my own place. I’m currently leasing a one-bedroom apartment and have been here since the beginning of August. Over the summer when my boyfriend and I would talk about this semester the idea was that he’d be over all the time as my place is closer to our school and we’d have our own space. Unfortunately things just haven’t worked out that way. We both work part time jobs and have a couple classes, plus he is also putting 20ish hrs/week into his paid internship. Our schedules don’t line up very well and my apartment is 45 minutes from his parents’ house so recently I only really see him on the weekends (and even then I usually work in the middle so it’s really only a few hours and a night spent together). My boyfriend and I are planning on moving in together late next year once we’re graduated and hopefully have decent jobs. 

As much as I love living alone (I lived alone my sophomore year as well) these last couple of months have been particularly hard on my mental health. I just don’t feel happy anymore. I think it might be loneliness, but there’s not really much I can do about it. I usually feel okay when I’m out at work or running errands but when I’m at home my default mood is just a heavy sadness/apathy. I try to do things I enjoy like working out/biking/etc but I’ve been working more and picked back up my side job as a soccer ref so I usually want to just sit and relax if I know I have to work later in the day. It’s nice to be busy but I still feel empty inside a lot. That or I just feel generally uneasy and anxious (for lack of a better way to describe it). My mental health has plummeted and this semester is nothing like I imagined. I miss the little things about last year so much, like just talking to my friend in the kitchen between classes or being able to walk over to my boyfriend’s after work and relax with him. I feel like I’m just trying to get by until I can move out of this place and get on with my life. 

I’m seeking advice on how to cope with my loneliness and low moods while I’m in this situation. I’ve tried talking to my bf about it but I don’t think he truly understands how it feels because he’s never lived by himself. He has all his family and friends within a 30 mile radius while mine are spread around the state, and the only one who still lives in the area is my former roommate. I know I wouldn’t feel this poorly if I saw him or our friends on a regular basis but life has been busy for everyone. I just don’t know how to feel better or hold onto my good moods for more than a couple hours or when I’m with other people. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",13Oct2020,1

I've always been paranoid about needles hurting and I'm terrified it will hurt so bad it will make me jump and the metal will break off inside my arm.

99,"Hi guys. I’m a 22F and I just started a job at a Nordstrom in my city about a month ago. Everything’s been going good so far, no major bumps, I’ve got along with all of my coworkers so far except for one who we’ll call David. David is a gay man and he’s very outspoken and flamboyant. He seemed nice enough at first but now I’m starting to second guess the kind of person he is. 

I’ve had people who I judged as nice at first but turned out to be catty and just toxic in the end. At work today I had a good day but there were a few moment where being around David bothered me. One of them was when I was coming back from a break and going to the fitting room where I was supposed to be and an assistant manager was walking out. The schedule has a few overlapping people working the dressing room so I stopped the the assistant manager and asked him if he still wanted me in the fitting room. 

While I was doing this David popped his head out from behind our fitting room area and said something to me but I didn’t quite hear what it was cuz I was still speaking with the assistant manager. He confirmed he still wanted me in the fitting room so I walked back there and there was another assistant manager back in that area who asked David who he was talking to. And David said my name. And the assistant manager was like “She lets you talk to her like that? You’re a bully” and kind of laughed. Then David feigned innocence and was like “No I’m not” and laughed as well. 

I just kind of ignored it cuz I don’t even know what was said to me. Later on in the day I was taking my last break and David was clocking out for the day and getting his stuff from our little cubby area. When he was leaving I said bye to him and he turned around and said bye and I was like “I’ll see you soon” and he replied with “Hopefully not” and there were two other coworkers who were sitting in the area we sit in for our breaks who heard and they all laughed and I did too cuz I didn’t wanna be sensitive but I mean maybe I am being sensitive cuz he didn’t need to say that. It felt rude to me. 

So idk if I’m reading too much into this or what. Every time I come into work or he sees me on the floor he greets me right away or makes sure he says hi to me but idk if he sees me as feeble or something. Cuz I do tend to laugh at most of the things he says even if they’re not funny which I found out today might have to do with my codependency and I need to learn how to not do that. I do this specific thing with other people as well especially if I just met them cuz I want them to like me I guess. 

But it’s only with personalities like his, with other people I can chill out but I talk to everyone. So I know it’s not a big deal cuz it’s just work but I don’t how to better establish boundaries so people don’t see me as weak or like someone they can disrespect. I’m aware the way I’m presenting myself might make it seem like it’s ok to do so.",13Oct2020,1

102,"Long post- so sorry in advance. I am a CSA survivour (though I hate saying I'm a survivour), my second step father was a narcissist and emotionally abused both my mother and myself. When we finally got out we were pretty poor. 

My mother did something really bad. She stole money from her work place and used my bank account (she had always had access to it as I was just over 18 and had it since I was 13). She was arrested, put on trial and given a suspended sentence as it was her first offence. 

She has been more than remorseful about that and I honestly hold the opinion that if we hadn't been struggling so bad and she hadn't been so defeated and depressed by my ex step father it wouldn't have happened. She honestly wasn't herself. 

I honestly gave up. I feel like I have just been existing for the last few years. My weight just skyrocketed and my boyfriend I had, understandably dumped me because of what had happened. My bank account got shut down and even though I wasnt charged with anything or did anything I was put on a black list with the banks. I couldn't get a bank account. My self esteem and any confidence I had is just gone. 

I have discussed it with 2 therapists- but honestly I don't feel like any of the advice has been useful. 

I have since moved countries because I felt like there weren't any options left for me where I was. 

Since being in my new life I honestly feel better about things. I have managed to start some healthy habits. I am trying to lose weight and I have hobbies that are good for me. 

Currently my mother is solely supporting me and wants to help me make things right. I am old enough I should be supporting myself though and it honestly depresses me as all my friends are getting married or buying houses. 

I literally can't decide what to do in terms of a career.  I am scared someone will go digging and see what my mother did and figure I am guilty by association. 

I wouldn't mind going back to school. I only did high school so I don't imagine I will have a great paying job if I dont go back. 

How do I figure this out? I ask my mom as shes the only person I haven't isolated myself from and she always says ""you'll figure it out, it is your decision, but I will support whatever you choose"" which is great but I feel like I am spinning my wheels here.

Nothing is interesting to me anymore, actually, more like everything is completely boring. Like social media, I practically can't live without it but now it's just- kinda :/.

I ended up in a mental facility for a little less then 2 weeks from a meltdown because they made me feel like shit for standing up for my daughter. They kicked me out before I got out of the hospital right when the pandemic started and my partner (23M) decided to go with me along with our daughter. 

Well Thanksgiving and Christmas parties are hosted at ET's place (entitled grandma). She is the one that kicked me out since it was her house, from what I've heard she has been obsessed with my name even when we left. I've been over there several times to pick stuff up since they offered a few things for our apartment. Every time I've gone over there she talks shit in front of me like I'm not there and I end up having mini-meltdowns at home each time. Family from out of town came and they didnt even tell my partner they came, or invited my daughter to the birthday party they had. Even though they say they love her. 

I have a history of family abandonment and PTSD from abuse and I have relived most of my truma from how they treated me and from me being homeless for a while (at least 4 months)

Just recently we moved causing me to have to quit my job, and ive struggled to find another job.

(The job pays $900 a week)

Note 1: 
i have seen it as pointless bc of the fact that i dont ever see them being even capable of paying me back due to the fact that my step mother wastes money crazily. And the main reason i even keep this tab any more is only bc my father insists he will pay me back.

120,"On mobile, sorry for format. 

My grandpa is my Father figure. I lived with him almost my entire life up until adulthood. I love and adore him more than words can express. 

When my grandpa was 35, he had a child who later died of a heart condition while still a newborn. 

His grown son (60s) has just been diagnosed with a terminal illness. My grandpa is going to see him for likely the one of the last times, if not the last time, in November. 

This will (probably) be 2/3 children he has outlived, as well as the wife he built that life with. I’m so worried about him. My mom lives with him. 


He is kind of the center and head of our family. He is the strong one who has the unending amazing advice and conveys his emotions in a strong and steady manner. 


I know he is hurting and I just don’t know what to do. I have my own reservations about it because his son treats him like crap but obviously I’m not going to say anything like that or even bring it up, but it’s in my heart. It’s just I don’t know how to handle the predicament that I found myself in. 


I want to console him but I am a mother myself now, and how do you even console such a thing? Especially when I’m his “baby” and have just transitioned into an adult (in his eyes) over the last 3 years. I graduate from college in December and I think in January I might fly home to him for a visit with my kids (Covid dependent). I SUPER don’t want to take my kids but I’m not sure what else to do, I’m afraid I’m going to lose him over the next couple years and I don’t want to put it off. 



One last thing. My grandpa believes Covid is a government something or other and is not an anti-masker, but is a crusty old man who thinks Covid isn’t real. I’m so worried about him contracting it on his trip to (through?) a hotspot. I have a lot of anxiety about it. Obviously haven’t shared this with him either besides the whole “you have to have a mask to fly and please stay safe” etc conversation. I’m freaking worried I won’t even have him by January!! 


I feel like my anxiety is just spiraling and I’m not sure what to do. Thanks.

It doesn't even matter if I pay a fine or serve time, I am essentially serving my sentence my whole life.

135,"Throw away because family and friends know my og account and obviously because of my fetish.  


Sorry if I make any mistakes while writting this post, english is not my native language. I'll be as quick as possible, a few years ago I (22M) had a friend (24F, let's call her Tanya (obvious fake name) who I got along really well, we had lots of things in common and our relationship started to get better and better to the point were we told each other numerous secrets, one of them being of course, that I have a hair fetish.  


Long story short, several months later she told me she's in love with me and I rejected her, telling her basically that ""I really love her as a friend, but unfortunatelly I don't feel the same way"", she was ""okay"" with that, but the days after she kept telling me how much she loves me, how we would be perfect for each other, stalking me, asking who are the girls that I met with (not actually dates, friends and friends of my friends mostly) and overral pretty obsesive behavior that ended up with her trying to sabotage my relationship with my other female friends.  
Needless to say that I cut her out of my life entirely.  


Fast foward I recently met a girl through twitter (24F) she's a skinny green eyed girl with long thick blonde hair up to her waist (totally my type, we'll call her Aria), we started arguing about something and ended up talking for hours about a lot of things. Anyway, we basically really clicked with each other and started talking almost everyday and decided to go out with our friends to finally meet (she knows one of my friends and in my country is allowed to go to parks, outside bars and such).  
Anyway our groups finally met each other and lo and behold, there was Tanya in her group of friends. Turns out she is one of her closest friends and as you can imagine she treated me like nothing happened in the past and we were some good friends that grew appart because of ""life stuffs"".  
I tried to act like nothing happened and focused on Aria, but Tanya kept getting in the middle and intervening in our conversations, touching and styling Aria's hair while giving me looks and snarky comments like ""She has a really nice hair, don't you think?"" and stuff like that.  


Anyway, we met a few times more with our friends and with Tanya tagging along I got very little time alone with Aria, on one occasion she even send me a pic of her grabbing and bitting Aria's hair and calling me all sorts of names, threating me of telling everyone about my ""dirty secret"".  
Recently Aria and I started dating each other and when Tanya found out she threatened me with telling everyone in our circle about my fetish if I don't break up with Aria.  
I'm really scared and don't know what to do, and I'm too embarrased to talk with anyone about this for obvious reasons.  
And before anyone tells me, I can't talk with Aria either, we don't have even a month dating and we obviously didn't talk about fetishes and stuff. I don't want her to freak out and scare her of something.  
What can I do?  


TL,DR: I had a best friend that I told about my hair fetish a while ago, she felt in love with me and I rejected her, then she tried to ruin my relationship with my female friends and I cut her out of my life.  
Now I'm dating a girl who happens to be a close friend of my former BF and she's threatening me with telling everyone about my fetish.",13Oct2020,1
136,"So I've (23F) been planning on joining the military for a while now. I currently live/carpool with my sister to our shared job at a dental office. I'm pretty sick of being around family 24/7, don't have any friends, and am a bit desperate to ""get out of dodge"" so to speak. But then I got a raise and now I'm second guessing myseld. So here are the options laid out to me

Option 1: Stay where I'm at until I figure out what I really want to do. I know I have the potential to make good money where I'm at. The office manager has been here 6 yrs and making almost $30/hr. I just recently got a raise after only working 5 months here and the girl who I replaced was there for a year and was making close to $20. I'm pretty confident I would get to that point as well and be comfortable enough to move into my own place. 

Option 2: I was talking to a recruiter since the beginning of Covid and have been studying/working out. Right before I got the raise I scheduled to take my ASVAB. I feel the benefits you get far outweighs the 4 year commitment. It would also give me the opportunity to get out of here and do something meaningful with my lack of direction.

Option 3: Quit/or drop to part time, stay at my sister's house and go to Dental Hygiene school. It's only a 2yr program here and they start high $20's and can make upwards of $45-$50 an hour. Doesn't have to be a life long career, but it would be a solid option with a high ROI and could be something I do until I figure out what I really want in life. 

TL;DR: stay in my job with garunteed raises until I figure out what I want to do, join the military, or quit my job and go to school for Hygiene and make bank in approx 4 yrs

I didn’t like the sound of that one bit because I don’t like her like that. 

Next time we talked just the two of us one night after some of our other friends flaked and I basically friend-zoned her telling her I just wanna be friends.

Her friends every now and then will ask me about her and I will still stick to the idea that I just want to be friends with her and stuff.

But lately they have been taking it too far, and there’s no point to confront them because I’ll just get called a bitch, pussy, etc. I recently quit a job that I was unhappy with, I’m young and needed to take time to focus on other stuff. While I had the job they would be rude about the place I worked, and when I quit they would and still call me lazy. I feel almost no support from them, there not really people I feel I can open up to anymore. It might not seem that bad or that’s just “friends being friends” but they will just go on and on and on bombarding me with these mean ass comments, if I leave or exit the area I get called pussy, if I where to respond they would just all join in and start being assholes.",13Oct2020,1
144,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this. If not, could someone let me know where I should post this? 

My aunt has a Pomeranian Husky mix dog. The dog is basically left outside all day, 24/7 in the backyard. The dog has a built wired fence to lock her in when it is night time, as my aunt doesn't want the dog to pee and poop all over the backyard. The dog is usually locked up at night time up until anywhere from 6am-10am (depends when my aunt lets her out). Inside the fence there is a small hut, pee pad, toys, and water and food bowl. I am in California, and the dog was still outside even with the really bad fires going on and super smokey air. 

The dog doesn't get fed much, usually only fruits and vegetables, rarely any meat and no kibbles. The dog is fed twice a day (no exact specific times). No one really plays with the dog, and if anyone does play with the dog, it's maybe only 30 minutes to an hour a day? The dog's water bowl rarely ever gets filled, and when it does it is very little water. Sometimes whenever I go outside, her water bowl is literally dry. So I'm always the one to give her water and fill up her water bowl. Whenever I can, I try to give the dog some snacks. Also, sometimes my aunt has forgotten to feed the dog, so I end up feeding her. Although, I don't mind filling up the water bowl and giving the dog food, I don't think it is my responsibility to do so all the time or even a majority of the time, as it is not my dog. 

My aunt has given the dog a bath once, which was back in April, never again after that. The dog doesn't get brushed or groomed. One time the dog was running around the pavement and my aunt said, ""Good thing she's running around. She's filing her nails down so I don't have to cut them"". 

Since the dog is outside, she will occasionally bark, sometimes for a long time. Once time a neighbor even complained and threatened to call animal control or something. When the dog barks, my aunt does nothing about it but just call her name to ""make her stop"". Doesn't always work. 

My believe my grandma has spoken to my aunt about giving away the dog, yet my aunt refuses to for some reason. I honestly feel so sad when I go outside and see the dog. She has such a sad life, and I wish she would have a better home with a much more loving family who could give her the attention and care that she needs and deserves. 

Is there anything I can do or call about this situation? If I were to call animal control or report this, would animal control be able to do anything? I honestly don't think my aunt will give up her dog, even though she barely takes care of the dog.",13Oct2020,1
145,"Long story short, I’m completely in love with this guy. I have been with him for more than a year now. However, he just finds it difficult understanding me. He can’t give me reassurance when I need them and have explicitly told it to him. He can’t be sweet to me and do small things that will make me happy even after telling him that.

152,"My childhood friend and I were like brothers growing up and we did everything together from age 8 up into our twenties. He was truly a part of my family. 

During our teenage years he was witness to a deadly shooting at his job. He was never the same again and fell into a dark place and heavy drug use. 

He and I lost contact when my wife told me that he tried to kiss her one night when she was driving him home from our place. I called him that night and he admitted it and said it was because he was high and confused. I still couldn't forgive him.

Several years later I heard from him again via FB and he said that he always thinks about me and missed our friendship. By this time I had remarried and me and my new wife invited him over to our home for dinner and drinks. 

Dinner went great and we were very happy while laughing and remembering all our childhood stories. After dinner we all began to get very drunk. After finishing off a bottle or 3 we told him to just stay the night over on our couch. 

Later that night I came out of the bathroom and saw him litterly forcing my wife down into a chair and trying to kiss her. I blacked out and started to fight him. Things then turned into a kitchen royal rumble that lasted what seemed to be forever. I got the better of him and messed up his face pretty badly..

The next morning he was crying and telling me again how horribly sorry he was and that he remembered nothing. After this we again lost contact.

157,"
I’m growing up in a household with me (m,15) my mom (f,40) my stepdad (m, 50) and sister (f, 18). My sister has a boyfriend and they have been together for 2 years. My bedroom is right next to hers so I hear EVERYTHING. Often times I hear her and her boyfriend fight. They fight a lot. They are terrible for eachother and neither of them can give either of them what they want. I hear their fights so much and one time it got so bad he left our house and walked home. Sometimes my mom will vent to me about how my sister isn’t good with her relationships and then I have to deal with a crabby sister that takes all her anger out on me. I often times get dragged into their fights when my sister wants me to pick sides. But I can’t. She’s controlling, he’s distant. She’s manipulative, he’s a slacker. Their is no “right” side. It sometimes takes a toll on my mental health hearing all of their fighting 24/7, plus my mom using me as her personal therapist and conversation buddy to beat down on my sister and her relationship. It almost feels like my parents are fighting when my sister and her boyfriend fight. It’s just a toxic environment and it’s always inside the house and never private. I hear all of it. Midnight phone calls turned into pissing matches, conversations turned into arguments. It doesn’t help that my sister has anger issues. Is this an unhealthy environment to grow up in?",13Oct2020,1
158,"My phone is a Samsung Galaxy s10e, FYI. 

Is going to the carrier a good call or should I ask someone else to take a look at my phone? And who?

I (F, 27) know that logging into accounts on other devices will show my texts and other information and I know that malware exists for ""cOnCeRnEd PaReNtS"" or other low-lifes that could remotely read messages whenever without consent. All I can find online is that the malware had to have been downloaded onto my phone and will appear as unassuming as possible, but that's it, I don't know what I don't know about default phone apps and which ones don't belong. I'm making an appointment with my carrier tomorrow to try and check but I genuinely believe my texts are being read because of the coincidental comments made by certain people and I would much rather be crazy than right.

160,"I never used my locker in middle school. I carried around a heavy backpack all day with all my stuff. So even on days when I didn’t have Spanish, I had a Spanish textbook and two workbooks in my backpack.

It would have physically been way easier on me to leave things in my locker when I wasn’t using them, but the ""mental work"" in that was too much for me to handle. I didn't like having to think about which classes I had on which day, and having to remember to take my stuff home at the end of the day.

Carrying a heavy backpack in middle school was metaphorical for how I approach a lot of things in my life. I choose the simpler decision, even if it's more difficult, and I want to stop doing that.

In serious relationships, I don't like all the thinking you have to do. You have to think about your partner, how your relationship affects your friends, how it affects your family and so on. Things also happen spontaneously and you have to think about that too. I came to this realization two years ago, when I realized a serious relationship was too much to handle, and I have not been in one ever since then. I might never get married or have children.

I could keep living like this forever, running away from any responsibilities or challenges I can run away from, but that's not how I want to live anymore. The same way I missed out on enjoying a lighter backpack in middle school, I’m missing out on deep relationships and so many other things.

Do you have any advice?",13Oct2020,1
161,"I(F20) Have recently moved moved out to study structural engineering, and I have parents who aren't the best. I've always known but I didn't think too much about it really because I had other issues which have now been sorted enough for my relationship with my parents to be my main concern, and I just am not knowledgable about how to (thanks to them funny enough) handle it because right now it is affecting my future because it makes me so sad.

Bit backstory, I know my mom really do care and love me in some way, but it just isn't enough because she has her own problems. She used to hit me occasionally when I was a kid. One story I have from when i was around 15-16 I had asked her to stop venting about a annoying colluege she had (she had been going on for 2-3 hours every day for a week) and she stopped talking to me for a week, only giving me stink eyes and ignoring me even when I tried to speak to her directly, asking what I had done wrong. 

She is alot better at pointing out my flaws and getting angry at the smallest mistakes, once I had put newly bought milk in the fridge, but had missed putting it behind the old milk because I was distracted, and I was called an idiot but when I explained the situation and asked her to stop calling me an idiot, she had gotten even angrier and said that ""I'm just trying to boss her around, she just wants to se an improvement and she will never lay flat for me"". So yeah, not top tier parenting, she is not as emotionally caring as I would need and often I feel like I have to be an adult to her because she needs one as much as I do, but it isn't a very equal relationship.

My dad is a short story, he is present in the family but he has just never been a father to me. He has never shown any kind of care or intrest in me, and I remember as a small child (like 4-5) that I got confused as to why my mom made me hug the weird smelly man who came into our home. He had a period back when I was in kindergarten when he was supposed to take care of me, but he would barely provide food or appropiate clothing for the weather, and he always chose activities he liked, such as stay at home and do his thing on his own or take me with him when he went out to fly model airplanes. My mom stopped it when she realized that I was always cranky and sad after thoose days, because I would be cold and survived off of white bread and an apple for lunch. 

Im also pretty sure that I was an accident, because my mom was pregnant at the time of my parents wedding and they had only been together for less than a year at the time, and my dad is incredibly jealous of the attention me and my sister have from our mom. My mom has even said so herself. 

Im just so sad and dissapointed that I didn't get the childhood and love I needed, because now when I have moved away from home and am attending university I do feel better because I'm not constantly belittled, but I also feel bad because I am in such need of validation and love it's ridiculus. Someone could give me the smallest of  compliments and I melt like butter, and I notice that I get so attatched to polite middle aged men in media because the seem like such good father figures.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My parents couldn't provide emotionally, and I was a victim of neglect, which now bothers me because I am in such need of some sort of loving parent figure I will latch on to anything, and it also has given me shit confidence which bites me in the bum now because it distracts me from my engineering studies.

&amp;#x200B;

**My general question is, how do you deal with needing a proper parent figure when you have never had one? I really need someone I can talk to as a normal person with, without watching what I say so I dont make my parent angry, or just someone who will actually care enough to help me with learning how to be a person.**",13Oct2020,1

167,"Hello. I have never used reddit before, but I made an account to request advice from anyone who is willing to take the time to read through this. I'm a 21 year old female who works in a very predominantly male work place. There are very few females who work with me. Please note that this is very long and will take a while to read through. Please also note that some of these things may not seem as uncomfortable for some people. I do not like physical contact, especially with strangers. If it's not as big of a deal as I lead on, please tell me.
   I joined my best friend working there about a year and a half ago. It has been the best job I've ever had because I get to do my own thing and I dont have to deal with customers. Because I am very anxious about someone somehow finding out where exactly I work, I will not disclose exactly what I do. However, I will say it falls under the lines of construction.
   Around a year ago, I began to strongly dislike one of my co-workers. I used to be quite the optimist when it came to people, and I was also in a bit of a dark place back then so any time someone was nice to me, I'd think well of them without questions. But eventually, I came to realize he was kind of being weird. 
   The first week I worked there, he would not stop staring at me. I get very anxious when people stare, so it bothered my quite a bit. But I decided to ask, ""Did you need something?"" And his response was, ""No, I'm just staring at you because you're beautiful."" I guess the compliment wouldve been better recieved had he not been my dad's age. This man is in his mid-late 50's.
  Since a few weeks in to working there, I acknowledged that he was kinda mean to some of my other co-workers. But he was nice to me so I thought it was okay. But then he just started being creepy. I probably don't remember all of it to be honest as forgetting is a coping mechanism for me. First of all, he would act like he ran into me and would rub himself onto me. It was really weird. Not like grinding or anything, just uh... it sort of reminded me of a cat I guess. It was really annoying and I got really sick of it, but I would argue it wasn't the weirdest thing he had done. But it was something he did nearly every day.
  Usually at work, I have my earbuds in until someone talks to me. So, understandably, people will sometimes tap my shoulder or something to get my attention. However, this guy would come get my attention by rubbing my stomach. It was extremely creepy and made me very uncomfortable. This was also an everyday thing, just for the record.
  One more instance that stood out to me was one day, he was telling me that there were mice that lived in the building. And then told me, ""Sometimes, they even crawl up your leg,"" and slid his fingers up my *outer* thigh. It definitely could have been worse and maybe it's not as bad as I felt it was, but it still is a pretty uncomfortable memory for me. But this was still the mere beginning of what I've tolerated.
    Eventually, I became very unfond of this guy. One day, he went to touch my stomach and I smacked his hand away muttering, ""Don't fucking touch me."" I get very quiet when I'm mad, so maybe he didn't hear me. At least, that's how he acted. He completely ignored me and carried a conversation while proceeding to do it many times after.
   I suppose I should add that I showed obvious signs of discomfort. Eventually when he'd come up to me, I would take a step back. I would avoid eye contact. Not on purpose either. I only noticed because he'd call me out on it. He'd get mad when I didnt have a happy look on my face or avoided eye contact with him. He'd say things like, ""Why do you back away when I come up to you?"" ""Why don't you look at me?"" ""Don't look at me like that."" I hated it. This guy was intolerable to me.
   I really hate narcissists. People who think they are perfect and who can't ever take an ounce of criticism. This guy certainly was one. Whenever someone in charge would try to tell him he made a mistake, he would get pissed off. Not only that, but he would go and essentially harass anyone else who would make one. He went off on how bad of a worker one of my work buddies were and it really made me mad. I decided I didn't want to pretend to be his buddy anymore, and I started avoiding him.
   I've dragged this out for a while, so I will try to summarize this bit. He eventually figured out that I didn't like him even though he'd still try to get my attention and acted like I needed him because I suck at my job. He'd hunt for any mistake, even if I wasn't making one just so he could talk to me/get my attention, or so it felt like. He could tell I didnt like him finally, but things got much worse.
   I dont remember when it got bad exactly, but he started being such a piece of shit. He would do nothing but stare at me and talk shit about me to provoke me. The first time I realized how bad it was is when he whacked arm with a piece of wood 'accidentally' and asked my co-worker ""___, why'd you do that??"" My co-worker's response was ""Uh, that was not me."" And then the guy I hate responded with, ""Okay, it was me. But ask if I care, because I don't."" This was over 6 months ago.
   I'm constantly told that people think they can get away with shit like this because I dont do anything about it. This is probably very true. I don't stick up for myself in most instances, especially when it comes to narcissists who will not admit their faults. It is just how I was raised. I'm definitely a coward for not telling this fucker off. Though, perhaps it wouldn't have changed things anyway. His daily antagonizing persisted, going on about how stupid I am or how *I* needed ""mental help"" or whatever the fuck else he'd say.
  Months later, a new girl came to work in our area. I will disclose that I was initially the only female working in our area, with about 11 guys with night crew and day crew. I wanted to be her friend at first because she seemed cool. But I am very scared of talking to new people and I wasnt sure how to talk to her. But one thing I noticed was that the freakshow wouldnt leave her alone and took it upon himself to be her teacher. I was scared he would treat her similarly to me, and I mustered up the courage to confess how I felt to the office and told them everything that happened.
   I thought the people in the office were taking me seriously. I told them how I'd prefer to keep it anonymous because I didn't trust this guy. They respected that and decided to have a meeting where they told everyone that people have been going to them for sexual harrassment complaints and it is not okay and to respect others. Unfortunately, this did nothing, and one of my co-workers that talks to the guy told me that the guy I dislike was pretty sure I was the one who went and complained to the office and said that he didnt really care. Nothing changed. I continued to endure his rude comments that progressively increased in number.
   My best friend and I finally invited the new girl out to lunch and I warned her about him. She said that he told her not to talk with me because I'm weird, which kinda pissed me off but I wasn't surprised. We went out to lunch every Friday and eventually she said he was treating her similarly to the way he treated me. I told her to tell the office about it, and she asked me to go with her. We both went together and it seemed like they were going to do something about it.
   I thought everything was going to be easier because he changed for a couple days. He left me alone, left her alone, and I thought work would finally be peaceful. But unfortunately, it got worse. He was still nice to the other girl when she actually showed up, which I'm glad for. But any time anyone would talk to me, he'd go accuse that person of talking shit about him with me after I walked away. I didn't say a single word about him after I thought he was cleaning his act up, but he seemingly became so insecure and took it out on everyone else. It was more than just a daily thing. And it lasted for a couple weeks, until he went back to his usual antagonistic self.
   There was one day that one of the two people in charge of my area was gone. That made him think he was in charge. He got mad after I called him out on commanding me to do something the wrong way. He  took the thing he told me to work on and chucked it across the table, throwing a tantrum like a child. I said not a word, but he must've convinced himself I did because he came back mere seconds later to say, ""Did you say something??? Because I will go to the office and tell them right now."" I'm not sure what this guy's problem is.
   I am not the only one who has a problem with this guy. Everyone who works with him hates him. A month or so later, one of the guys in charge left a little bit early. I kinda consider him a friend since we talk a lot. The guy I dislike was talking to another co-worker and was saying that my friend should kill himself. I was so, so pissed about it and I decided to go to the office again. Yet, still, not much action was really taken. He still did not change. In a work place, the way he acts should not be tolerated. That's how I feel anyway. The office even told me that so many people go and complain about him and they're scared a fight is going to break out. If so many people are complaining, why won't they take action?? I thought the lady I was speaking to was taking me seriously because she said she wasn't going to put up with him acting like that, but clearly her words weren't true.
   He really bullies that guy who's in charge. He pulled down his pants at work the other day and thought he was being so funny. I absolutely hate him with my entire being. My friend went and told the office of his experience, and they didn't take him seriously at all. He left work ""early"" the next day because of the work toxicity and that fuckhead gave him a phone call at work to harass him further. I put early in quotes because he still got his 8 hours of work, we just generally put in more. Fuckhead told him that he was going to go to the office and tell them he left early because of him and was making fun of him to other workers the entire day afterwards. It is not okay.
    It's hard for me to list every thing he says to me or about me because I try so hard to ignore it, but every time I walk past him anymore, he tries taunting me, yells in my ear while I'm carrying something heavy, talks to himself about how stupid I am while literally no one is around, tries getting other co-workers to dislike me, belittles me with anything I do, etc. I swear I'm not exaggerating when I say multiple times an hour he will make some comment or do something directed towards me. It has gotten so much worse since I've been given a promotion. He stares at me all god damn day every day and it makes me so uncomfortable. This has been the case for 6 months now. And he seems to have some sort of immunity to facing any consequences for it.
   I do not remember for certain what it was, but he said something about my ass today, which by the way, is funny because I dont have one. I walked past him I'm pretty sure what he said was on the lines of, ""look at that ass move"" and then following with a ""badonk, badonk, badonk"" with every step I took. So, I decided to go to the office again because personally I can't fucking handle that. This time, rather than just talking to the office lady, I asked to speak to both her and the owner. I told them my situation, and the owner's response was, ""Can't you just ignore it?""
    Well, yeah, that really pissed me off. The office lady said she'd deal with it, but I have no reason to believe this time will be different. I was on the verge of tears when I spoke with them as well, but clearly they do not care at all. I call my dad every day after work and I told him about this. He really wants me to sue my company but I do not want to do that. Not only do I have several friends where I work who I do not want to be affected in this, nor do I want to put the owner in debt or anything. I'm not a sue-happy person. But I'm really not sure what to do at this point. I can leave and find another job, but this is the only job I've had that I've enjoyed and its hard for to consider leaving. I have made very good friends there too. Plus, everyone else who he harasses still have to endure him. I just don't know what to do and any suggestions would be appreciated.

Also, the owner is my neighbor, so thatd be awkward lmao",13Oct2020,1
168,"i'm sixteen, nearly seventeen.

i'll lay it all out.

when i was a toddler, my dad left my mom and she got into hard drugs. it messed with her mind and she got abusive, breaking my bones and kicking me around for years. when i was nearly half done with second grade, she thought the teachers at my school were plotting against her somehow, and un-enrolled me. after that, she locked me in my room. i got out of that room more than two and a half years later, when my dad and stepmom decided to take me in.

my stepmom was awful and abusive and hated by her older kids. school was awful. i had no social skills (because i had been locked in a fucking room for nearly three years) and i immediately became the outcast, even from the outcasts. i didn't know how to talk at first (no red flag for my step family at all). i didn't know how to dress or clean myself, and i didn't know how to shower until i was thirtteen. all of this i was yelled at for constantly. to everyone i met, i was the most disgusting thing that they had ever set their eyes on and now, a junior in high school, their attitudes haven't changed. 

as soon as i had the ability to leave my stepmom's house, i did. i moved back and forth between hers and my mom's house because there was no lesser of the two evils. they were both awful, but bearable at short times. 

the repressed memories came back and my mom and i fought hard. she hit me, i hit back. she bit and slashed herself with knives and called the cops on me to get me into jail, and it worked. three years later, i still have that record, which could prevent me from getting into the navy, which is the only thing i want to do after high school. it's hard to talk to her now. i live with her until i get my own apartment. the fights have died down, and the raging insanity is gone (for the most part). i wanted justice. i wanted revenge. but now all i have is a confused old woman who doesn't remember what she did and doesn't know why i can't love her. 

i got a friend. i didn't know how to keep a friend. he was a jehovah's witness and i knew the organization was bad. i never shut up about it. i talked about it to the point of nagging. i told him, begged him to leave. i was afraid he would get in an accident and, unable to get a blood transfusion, he would die. i was afraid that they would tell him the apocalypse had begun and he would go into a bunker like they had planned and i would never see him again. it was selfish. i lost him over it.

172,"I have a friend who is what I would consider a porn addict. He watches live webcam models and recently came across someone he went to high school with. I did not go to school with them. The model went by an online alias but my friend used their social media pics and videos to confirm it was them. They both grew up in a small town where everyone knows each other. He said the model was very religious in high school and looked down on him and others for being ""fake christians"" for drinking, partying and other random stuff.

Now, he wants to reveal to the town that this person is in porn and essentially ruin their life. Tell their parents, the church, etc... He was planning to do this secretly through a fake account so as not to reveal his identity and expose himself as a porn addict. The town has a community website and he was going to post the models webcam link and info there. He talked about mailing a version to the model's parents and the church also but I was able to talk him out of that part.

But I told him not to post on their website too and that I will not allow him to ruin someone else's life. I understand that they may have been a jerk to him in high school, but he needs to get over it. So I said if he tried to post it, I would find a way to contact the webcam model to let them know it was my friend that revealed them.

He told me I need to lighten up, but I don't think what he's doing is right. That person has a family, a spouse, kids, and friendships within their community. If they truly are as religious as he claims, that would surely devastate all those around them. It could lead to harassment, violence, or worse. I feel like me revealing my friend's identity if he reveals someone else's isn't really the best approach since the same consequences could possibly happen to him also, but it was all I could think of in the moment and I'm not sure what else to do. I wish I didn't know about him planning this, but now that I do,  I can't just stand by and let him ruin someone's life over some pettiness he experienced as a kid.

176,"TW: mild mention of pregnancy loss.

—

My partner and I have considered trying for a baby. We’re nearing our mid-20s, and have raised my biological, his stepdaughter, from birth together. He is an amazing father, and we love each other deeply. We have been actively trying for over a year. I knew it would take us a lot longer. I’ve been pregnant six times now, and only one made it to term. Since the birth of my daughter, I’ve lost two more, but we held fast with a “maybe next time”.

His family was less than supportive when they found out. We had been engaged for a year, and spent Christmas with his grandmother. My daughter calls her Nana, and had since she was little, so we got her a throw blanket with very sweet words about her being a wonderful great grandmother. She cried and said it was so beautiful. I thought being welcomed into the family - all the kindness and “you’re like a granddaughter to me”, tied in to the gift as a “thank you for being family”. She pulled my partner aside a few months later and said that trying for a baby would “ruin his life” and destroy any career or education opportunities he might have. I was floored. Pissed, even.

His parents are another story. Partners who didn’t use protection, didn’t get an abortion “this time”, and were still unwilling to stop partying. Both parties find children to be “a waste of time, space, and money,” and have said as much to his face. They are not involved in our lives currently. The cut from his grandmother was especially cause for a second thought to him. She has been supportive of us otherwise. Begs to babysit. I wear her engagement ring she gave to SO to propose. She loves us all. But that made him think twice. “Maybe she was right.” I don’t think she is one bit. 

It’s taken a toll on our mental health around the topic. He’s gone back and forth on whether or not it’s the right decision. We don’t want to stop trying, but we feel like even if we succeed, his family will be unkind about it. As far as my family is concerned, the more is merrier. My dad respects that I want to follow his path; two kids and then I tie my tubes.

We really do want another one, when the dust settles and we are one on one. He feels the pressure to put it off when his entire family looks down on him for it, but I’m trying to encourage him to find more positive people in his corner. I really want to stay on track with our timeline, so that I can find work again without stopping abruptly. I’ve taken on most of the parental duties, and have agreed to do so with our second. That’s not to say he isn’t an amazing parent. I guess what I’m trying to say is that, he wants to go back to school and he currently works full time, so I’m encouraging him to follow that path and taking on the load until they are in school. I’m okay with putting my life on “slow” for another few years.

It’s hard to know for sure that we’re doing what’s right. He’s worried about our age, a wedding, going to school and working. I’m doing everything I can to find cheap and meaningful childcare outside of the family, but I do still pick up the financial slack. We each have our own finances and we make it by with some to spare every month. I don’t think we’re making a mistake. I think he could use some positivity, but I know I’m biased.

Any advice is much appreciated.",13Oct2020,1

178,"First of all, I’m 23 years old. I have a sister who’s 28 and a brother who’s 31. 

Long story short, 32-33 years ago my father was at a party with a bunch of people, apparently slept with a woman (neither of them remember it), she got pregnant and had a son. They were never in contact again so my dad had no idea. 

A little more than a month ago my father received a message said woman, asking if he would like to pass a paternity test for her son. He was far from the first as she asked any dude who were at the party. My dad agreed because he was convinced he wasn’t the father. However when I was shown the pictures my heart sank because he really looks like my father. 

And thus after a little over a week of waiting the test game back positive and my family has been in shamble ever since. We’ve never really been close as my parents were abusive and my sister would take it out on me and my brother was the only real parental figure in my life (despite being the typical Older Brother troublemaker trope) but after going through a lot of therapy I had the strength to work on my relationship with my family and we’ve been doing a lot better, we became really close especially my sister and I. 

My brother got super drunk, my sister had a panic attack and yelled at my dad for cheating on my mom, my dad has been refusing any help (he has the “I don’t care about me, it’s your mother I’m worried about” attitude which I respect but I want him to accept help) and my mother spent nights crying and days fighting with my dad. 

And then there’s me. My mother often reminds me not to put too much on my shoulders, especially with my past of self-harm and suicide attempts, but I can’t help it. I have to care for my mom, my dad and my sister (my brother lives far away) because they are all doing worse than I am. 

After we found out my parents went on their already planned 2 weeks trip and I was left to care for the house and our 8 pets. Since it occupied my mind I didn’t have time to think about how I feel about it all and I got high every single day for those 2 weeks so I could think about something else. Especially since it meant I was home alone for my birthday dealing with all this. 

When they came back is went the fighting really began and one night I saw my mom sleeping on the couch and I went back to my room, got high, and burst into tears for the first time. I felt *angry*. Angry at the woman and her son for ruining my family while they are so happy that their search is over. That they get to be happy and we get to be miserable. 

Things got worse. My mother, stalker as she is found out what one of his (half) sister did a #MeToo post and it was incest. It rotted in my mind for a week. My mother told me not to ask but I had enough and contacted her (nicely and respectingly). She was very sweet and kind and she said that yes, it was indeed my half-brother that had raped her years ago. 

Being a rape victim myself of more than one occasion I nearly threw up at the idea of being related to a rapist. That my brother is a rapist. I broke down again. 

I keep putting my feelings aside to care for the others. I am meeting him for the first time this Friday and I don’t know how to feel at all. I know he’s trying his damned best to fix the wrong he’s done in his life but this goes against my morals but I know I need to meet him at least once to get my own opinion. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to feel. All my life I knew, I *always* had a feeling that I had another sibling somewhere but now that it’s truly happening I have no damn idea how to deal with any of it. 

Has anyone been in similar situations? Or like, divorced parent getting with someone else that has kids? How do you even deal with that? I am at a complete lost...",13Oct2020,1

180,"This is gonna be a long one: 

My brother (23M) constantly talks shit about my (21F) boyfriend (23M) to his friends &amp; mutual friends. 

They came from the same school previously but didn’t quite know each other. They have quite a number of mutual friends. 

Just a bit of context:
My bf loves my mum to bits. He brings her out for meals and constantly texts/calls her. When he’s over at my place, he’d have a chat with her for at least an hour. 

My brother on the other hand, barely talks to my mum unless he wants to buy something. When my mum left home for a while (due to family issues that doesn’t involve the parties mentioned), he never visited nor talked to her unless he had to. While I’m struggling to fix things up at home, he totally washed his hands off things &amp; did not show an ounce of concern. Meanwhile, my bf met with my mum a few times &amp; tried to cheer her up. 

I’ve been with my bf for more than 3 years and at the beginning of our r/s, my bro told my mum that ‘it’s as if we have another family member now’ and he was so jealous &amp; insecure abt my mum’s love for him (my bro). He would not say it outrightly, but you’d just know. He even told his ex gf that his parents don’t love him at all. It’s the stupidest &amp; most childish thing I’ve heard because EVERYONE knows how much my mum loves &amp; gives in to him. She also ALWAYS try to start a convo with him (because he’s always dead silent &amp; uses his phone during meals) but gets shot down every time. He’d just give a short answer &amp; continue doing whatever he’s doing but my mum won’t say anything. All my relatives think it’s so dumb and ignorant for him to say that. (Do note that he’s TOTALLY different when he’s with his friends.)

My bro recently told mum that he doesn’t want to take care of them when they get old. (We’re Asian so it’s quite normal to stay with our parents to take care of them). This of course broke my mum’s heart. 

Ok so this is where the problem lies:
We recently found out that he has been talking shit to mutual friends about how weird my bf is. He said bf is weird for going for family gatherings, for being close to my mum and told ppl that he made things bad between him (bro) &amp; his family (which is freakin untrue, he’s (bro) the one who isolated &amp; victimised himself) I’m almost certain that he twisted the facts to suit his narrative. Honestly. I think it’s a HUGE compliment if someone says that my bf is close to my mum. I love how he’s so close to her. And I think it’s a good thing. So I really have no idea how much he twisted the facts because those ppl he talked smack to, really thought my bf is a terrible person. 

Also, he said how it’s weird that my bf is friends with his (now ex) girlfriend. And actually told her to stop talking to him. (If this isn’t insecurity I don’t know what is. I’m totally okay with them being friends)
My bf made friends with her coincidentally because they were in the same class. At that point, he didn’t know who she was until he so excitedly told me that he made a new friend in uni and told me her name. 

We told his ex gf what happened and she was not surprised at all. She said that he’s always blaming everyone but never reflecting on himself.

I think it’s extremely hypocritical for my brother to be so insecure and jealous abt the r/s my mum &amp; bf has &amp; its disgusting for him to be talking smack when he’s not a good son to begin with. My bf’s reputation is tarnished from something that’s so twisted and untrue. 

I have no idea what to do and any advice would help. We have yet to talk to my mum about this. I feel like if we confront him, he’s just gonna severely victimise himself again and will continue to talk smack about my bf. There’s just so many other things that happened as well- this post would be a friggin novel if I wrote everything. One thing to note about him though: he’s super petty &amp; would remember every single detail that happened in the past and harp on it in the future 🤷🏽‍♀️ he has a problem letting go of the past.

Since the summer my boyfriend and I have been hanging out with this friend and we haven't had any problems until recently.  I know I can leave my boyfriend alone with her and nothing is going to happen, I trust them both but things have just gotten to the point where I want to cut her off.  My boyfriend plays with GTA with her and other friends all the time and I don't mind because he still talks to me during that time but ever since we've all started hanging out more, I get ignored from 30 minutes up to 2 hours with no explanation and he'll just text me like everything is okay.  By this time I'm usually upset but he always cheers me up without knowing.  What I didn't know about these gaming sessions was that he was telling all of them everything that was going on, even stuff that deals with our relationship that hasn't been discussed with me.  I am always the last person to know anything which honestly hurt me.  I brought it up a few weeks ago and I thought we came to an understanding that we would talk about things before telling other people, especially her.  Well today I went to deal with a problem that dealt with our relationship and she immediately jumped in when I told her not to, she continuously brought up the idea of fighting the girl that caused the problem and I told her 4 times we aren't fighting.  On the way home my boyfriend gets a call and she gets closer to listen in, I can't hear anything since I'm driving and my truck has a loud rumble, I asked him what she said and before he could say anything this friend started talking and telling me everything when she saw and heard that I addressed my boyfriend.  We get back to her house and she brings up the idea of fighting again and I nearly yelled at her that we aren't fighting and she got upset that I said this.  This is the most recent incident that really set me off, there have been others that should've made me just end that friendship but I decided to let it slide.  Whenever my boyfriend and I are talking about things between our relationship he always brings her in almost like trying to make her the mediator.  I've tried talking to him so many times because he's the one that is bringing her into our stuff but he doesn't stop.

186,"I have an excruciatingly annoying coworker. He talks constantly (from the moment I enter the office until I can’t take it anymore and leave to go “use” the restroom several minutes later). He overshares. He’s a conversational narcissist who will talk for 10 minutes nonstop, but then not pay attention to what I say in reply. The list goes on.

When I first started this job, I was really nice and friendly in that wanting-to-make-a-good-impression kind of way. That included tolerating this maddening behavior, because it felt too soon to let him know how irritating he was to me. It quickly bit me in the ass though, because within weeks this person started considering me a friend, making little comments about random things going on in my life (he is WAY too observant and has a comment about everything), turning the smallest things into “inside jokes,” getting me a birthday gift...

It has been several months now and I absolutely dread going to work because of this person. Everyone else seems to love him and are buddies with him, and because of that I feel unable to complain about him. Maybe it’s “just me” but I haven’t had a problem like this with any other coworkers ever before.

187,"I’m going to be 35 weeks in a couple days. I feel so exhausted, and I’m soo happy I can’t wait till my baby is finally here, but the only problem I have is that Significant other hasn’t finished putting the crib together or cleaned out his mess in the spare room. We got the crib when I was 33 weeks. He put part of the crib up and still hasn’t finished it.. he rather play video games I guess. A couple days ago I put the pack &amp; play together myself because it was just still sitting in the box, and i just feel the urge to nest. I want everything ready and prepared. I feel like Im asking for too much so I try not to bug him about it thinking to myself that he might be too tired or he’ll get it done soon. I have gestational diabetes so I’m getting monitored twice a week. My doctor hasn’t said if she’ll induce me early so that’s another reason why I want everything done around the house just in case. Now another thing is we moved in together a month ago I used my own saved up money for the down payment plus mine and his rent because he was low on money which I understood I never complained, but along with him came his clingy misbehaved dog. I love animals, but since we first moved in together his dog has seemed to put so much stress on me she’s constantly growling at me, snapping at me. If I tell her any command she will not listen to me especially when significant other is home it’s worse. She jumps too much she already jumped on my stomach a few times she recently started sleeping in the living room with her dog bed, her toys, and food and water. Because I wasn’t able walk into my own room without her growling at me it frustrates me to the point where I want to cry. I’m to the point where I can’t stand to be in the same room as her. I would never ever ask him to get rid of her, but lately I been over thinking about when baby arrives like is she still going to be growling and not listening. Significant other doesn’t bathe her, she sheds like crazy he doesn’t brush her to at least help control the shedding a little bit, he sometimes forgets to put food and water in her bowls. He doesn’t clean up after her it’s like once we moved in he put the dog on me, and I already have a dog of my own I don’t need or want another one. He says she’s not my responsibility, but I’m not just going to stop cleaning my house cause HE SURE ISN’T GOING TO CLEAN THE HOUSE!! I’m not going to just be living in a messy hairy house or messy back yard full of poop and pee. Even when she’s growls at me I try not to show my frustration or even complain I just go to my room and close the door because I understand that’s his dog and he loves her, but how am I suppose to deal with the constant stress and feeling constantly worried that she might hurt the baby when she arrives? We talked about the dog and how she is but it seems like he doesn’t see a problem, so I’m to the point where I’m done talking about it to him, and if her growl turns into a bit then I’ll just deal with it and not make a big fuss about it.. I just felt like I needed to vent I have no one to talk to and I feel sooo overly stressed it feels like a weight is on my shoulders, and I just want this weight to be released 😣",13Oct2020,1
188,"I have this problem where once I have a thought, I explain it to myself as if I don't know anything about it. Which obviously I do, because I'm the one that had the thought.

Once i start thinking about it, I can't stop until I'm done. I do this constantly, and I've only managed to stop myself half way through an explanation about twice, and it took all of my will power. If I forget to mention something, I go back in the explanation to where I was meant to mention it, and repeat the entire thing from that point. It's so fucking stupid, i so often waste 20 minutes of productive time, explaining something to myself that I literally already know. I can't stop.

Good example from recently would yesterday. In the shower, I had a thought about Clash Royale, a card game I used to play. I went on to spend the next 30 minutes slowly explaining my deck, why I started using it, how I used it, etc. But to no one at all, it's just my internal monologue that won't shut the fuck up, ever. I literally already knew everything I said, and I haven't cared about the game for nearly 2 years. But I spent the entire shower and the 15 minutes after it, completely zoned out so I could talk to myself about the meta back then. And I can't stop it mid conversation either, it makes me feel so twitchy. Once I start it, I have to finish it. Finish it properly, no cutting out info or talking too quick.

I've already designed this post in my head like 10 times over. Once I start thinking about it, I can't stop until it's done. It takes me a split second to have a thought, and then another 10 minutes to explain it to myself... even though I already understand it all. I don't think loneliness is the problem, I have friends, family, and a girlfriend to talk to. I don't know what the problem is, but I'm sick of wasting literal hours each day doing this. There is absolutely no point in it but I can't stop, I try so hard to stop but I cant

189,"Please help.. I was in a longterm relationship for over 7 years but was beginning to get really frustrated as there was no marriage or children on the cards - that is, he wanted to, or so he said, but was just not growing emotionally so incapable of moving forward in the relationship. He had been dealing with depression and I tried to be as supportive as I could for years. I ended up breaking thing off as I knew nothing would change anymore if I didn't change it. He was absolutely devastated but he finally decided he would get better. 

In the meantime, I had was dating someone else.. Anyway, my longterm partner during this time really appeared to have changed so I broke it off with the the other guy as things were moving a bit too quickly and thought maybe the right thing to do was give things another shot with him. I was away for work so I didn't say anything to my longterm partner at the time and thought the best thing to do is just wait till the summer break and give myself some healing time from the other guy. So, summer break comes around and I finally tell him let's give it another shot - as he had been begging for 10 months - but he didn't know how to handle it and he reverted back to his old ways. The summer ends and it didn't go great as he wasn't able to give me clear answers on the things I want (namely children, as I am now 34 and my age is becoming a worry).

So, I had to go back away to work and was calling him and trying to get something off the ground but he just shut down and couldn't handle me being angry and resentful towards him (mind you, this was an absolute first and I have always only been very gently and probably too understanding with him). I just kept getting more angry at him which probably made things worse but this was one problem that I couldn't just deal with myself - I was looking for us to work through it together, as it was his actions/ lack of that I was angry about. 

This year ticks along and he really just wasn't making any effort. The other guy was still interested so I guess I caved and filled a bit of a void (which really isn't like me normally, I've just been really hurt from all this). This guy ends up getting me pregnant, it is still really early though.. I say he got me pregnant as I specifically said to him before to please be careful as I knew I was close to my ovulation date - but no, he didn't listen and came inside and just said oops sorry afterwards, I swear this guy has always just wanted to get me pregnant. We dated for about 8 months and he wanted to get married and was talking about kids together etc, while the relationship was actually quite sweet I know deep down he is not my forever.

Now I am in this huge pickle, I am 34 nearly 35 and have been desperate to have a family for years, also don't know whether to terminate the pregnancy (still very early) - even though I always said I would NEVER do that and keep a baby under any circumstances but here I am thinking I should do, I don't know whether to tell my long term partner about this as I know he wants to get back together still, I think telling him will push him away though. Any advise on whether I should tell him, keep the baby and be a single mum as a result, or not say anything to him and terminate that baby and start a family with my longterm partner?

I’ve lived with this girl for a few years. Things were always fine. Then in March COVID lockdown came along and she was super irresponsible with how she was behaving, partying at clubs and whatnot. I called her out, turned into her screaming at me and we ended up having a massive falling out. Since then, there’s been endless disrespect from her towards my partner and I (we’re the other two roommate in the house).

My best friend knows how much stress this has caused my partner and I, cause I’ve vented to him about it throughout. He recently decided to go on a date with my awful roommate. I talked to him at length about how it made us feel and he agreed to not continue to see her at the risk of ruining our very close friendship.

Awesome, right? I was chill with the girl and I wasn't a little bitch like I thought I would be. Some things obviously did not go out as I planned, one major thing was she wasn't nearly as attractive as she was in her pictures, (a bit chubby) and I'm big into fitness so body image is a big thing for me, it was hard for me to get hard unless she sucked me off even though I was eating her out for a whilst (which I thoroughly enjoyed) but then I got sorta flaccid after a few minutes. Whilst trying PIV I don't think I could necessarily get it in comfortably, as in her thighs were a bit too thick (I'm only 6""), I don't know if I was doing something wrong but does anyone else have a bit of trouble with thicker girls, and any advice? I think that since there was not the attraction I ""needed"" it was harder to get hard.

also, when I was eating her out she wasn't dripping or anything, and the outside of her pussy wasn't wet; as I was fingering her she was a tad wet inside but nothing crazy, can that be normal for some girls even though they came or no.",13Oct2020,1

The same person who read that liking one or two members of the same gender didn’t make you gay so all those pretty girls who made me blush or people I wanted to get closer to were quickly plopped into that special bucket of exceptions not to ponder about. I hadn’t realized that bucket had become not entirely empty.

The same person who forced myself sternly to never fantasize or imagine myself with a girl not because I didn’t think I would like it.... but because I was afraid I would.

The same person who spent the last 21 years of their life completely and utterly sure they were completely straight, with a prior boyfriend and many male crushes to prove it.

The same person who has now fallen completely for this amazing, beautiful, and utterly charismatic girl.

I keep going back and forth from complete denial, sure that I don’t feel that way at all, to trying to figure out what to do next- I guess I’m in the later category at the moment. I’ve had lots of crushes, lots of people I found charming, and a boyfriend I loved spending my time with when we still dated, but I’ve never been this captivated by anyone in my entire life. 

Literally it started within the hour we met, and though that sounds ridiculous, it’s true. She smiled and laughed and reached out to others and showed interest in the same things with such a genuine air. Everything was just so genuine. I found myself instantly drawn and I spent the first couple months in denial trying to convince myself I just wanted to become close friends with this person, something I still do want. But I also began staying up at night thinking about how wonderful she was, getting distracted in the classes we shared, and just staring. And also feeling like an utter creep. 


I’ve asked her to coffee and she said yes and I... ugh... I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t know if I want this. If she’d even be interested. I know she had a prior boyfriend. But so did I....

Ugh I just don’t know how to ask her what type of person she’s interested in. Or how to go forward. I just.... the only thing I KNOW is that I really like and care for this person and want to be around her. I also don’t want to weird her out. I would still want to be close friends if she wasn’t like that. 

My little brother ended up being super wise, and told me that it was ok to try new things, if I didn’t end up liking it, just don’t do it in the future. He’s right. I just don’t know how to proceed.

I deleted the comment, but because I tagged her in it, she got a few DMs saying the same. I took the post down at her request. She said it didn’t get to her, but I could tell it did. I know she lost  40 pounds her first year of college so I get why she's a little more sensitive. I just don’t understand why they would say that. 

She cut back a bit on food right after the post, chose healthier options, started working out a bit more which was fine, but now it seems like it’s becoming more of a problem. She refuses to go to restaurants anymore, there are instances when she has gone to her classes, saying she was going to get something at school or on the way and when I come home her stomach is growling and when I ask she says she “forgot” to eat all day. There have been days when I will make dinner for us and she says she’s not hungry, but I tell her to sit with me anyways and she’ll just watch me eat and I can tell she’s hungry, but she insists she’s not.

Sunday was her birthday so I went out and bought some cupcakes to celebrate at home since she didn’t want to go out to a restaurant. She refused to eat one. I got a little frustrated and was sort of like “it’s not gonna hurt you to eat one” and pressed her on it for a bit asking her why she wouldn’t have one before she just started crying and I feel terrible about it the whole incident.

Not to get explicit, but she doesn’t swallow anymore if you know what I mean but when I asked her why, she said it’s because there’s 25 calories in it. As a side note, when I looked in her little logging notebook where she logs everything she eats, she recorded it down with everything else. It’s also very clear that she’s not eating nearly enough calories in a day to be considered healthy. It was all a little disturbing, for lack of better word.

It’s just really frustrating because I can tell she’s hungry and she’s losing a lot of weight. I mentioned something about maybe seeing a dietitian because it would help her balance out her meals while still remaining healthy and she got super defensive about how she’s doing just fine on her own.

She’s around 92 pounds give or take right now and she’s 5’2” so she’s now underweight.

I don’t know if I should mention anything or just leave it alone or how to bring it up to her again. Part of me says I should just leave it be and see where it goes and if it gets better, but the part of me that minored in psychology says that she needs professional help and the sooner she gets it the better.",13Oct2020,1
226,"Not sure if this is the right place for this but hope I’ll get some neat advice over here. 

My neighbours have been having dogs for the past 8 years, mainly to protect their house. These dogs are very aggressive and they will bark/chase anybody that comes in their area. (In this case it’s basically become the whole neighbourhood). They’d always leave their dogs out to roam around and this has caused stray dogs to come as well. We have trash lying around everywhere because the dogs have been rummaging through them. (I don’t even know how since the garbage is kept behind a metal door)

The neighbourhood has reported on them years ago and they had to pay a 1,000$ fine but they still do it anyways. We’d hope that the dogs would just die of all old age and this issue wouldn’t happen anymore. But they just bought new ones instead. 

And the new ones are much more aggressive. It feels like the neighbors have never trained their dogs. There have been many cases where my family had to stay in the car for half an hour because the dogs would chase us when we got out of the car. 

I’d really like your input in all of this since telling them off didn’t really do much and they’d rather pay the fine.",13Oct2020,1
227,"My Best friend recently has had a really bad break up and I don’t know how to help him. I feel really bad because of it. We are both 18. Both my Best friend and his now ex were good friends of mine and have been dating for 4 years. I find helping one hard without betraying the other. I’m usually a very passive person and find confrontation difficult. My best friend is taking it the worse, as the story goes his ex was with another dude who so happens to be in our friend group. He has many things going on his mind before the break up, and finding out about the betrayal just broke him. He is no longer getting out of bed, and the one day he went to school he cried on my shoulders and I did nothing to help him. He has not been going to school after that day. 

What’s worse is that his ex is playing the victim. He is not making it better for himself by constantly wanting closure and constantly thinking and trying to message her. He could be overbearing at times due to his conditions, but she has been neglecting him for months on end during quarantine whilst talking on discord with his friends, which he is not invited to.


I just want help on what to do as a friend, even if it is very minor. Like it’s been a month, and I want to slap him out of it, but I feel it is not appropriate.

If he texted me asking me to listen, I’d without a doubt listen to whatever he wants to get off his chest but I feel really uncomfortable when I come upon something heavy like that in an unsolicited manner.

My grandmother and I are really close, and she is definitely one of those stubborn ladies that would never move out of state and has guilted me several times about raising my children in a state where she could never visit. She’s the type to refuse to be on planes or be on long car rides, so the onus of visiting with always be on us. 

Our family is really small but means a lot to me. I am also very excited at the prospect of raising our family in a state that is more suitable and supportive of children, LGBT people, etc. So, if you’ve moved far away from your family permanently to settle in another state, how did you do it?

234,"We've been together for about 5 years now. We met in highschool and always had a rocky relationship. Ever since the beginning she was sending nudes on snap and skyping loads of guys she met on omegle. I didn't know until 4 months after we started dating. 

She would hang up on me just to skype other guys and call me back naked because she ""just got out of the shower""

Every time I caught her she was so sorry and ""was the last time it would ever happen."" I don't know why I always believed her. 

Well fast forward a couple years and we had an argument. I told her I need time to myself to think about things. she went on tinder and met some guy that recorded her giving him oral. He sent her the video on skype and I found it 1 year after it happened. We had already moved out of the state and in our own house. 

as time progressed and I became immune to her manipulation I realized that she has never loved me and only used me to get away from her parents house. she Is the most toxic person I have ever met. 

I don't want to be with her anymore but if I tell her to leave she will be on the streets homeless and jobless. ever since I told her that I don't want to be with her anymore she has completely changed. She told me that her phone no longer has a password and that I am free to look at it whenever I feel like it. She deleted all the guys from snapchat. 

part of me wants to forgive her, but the other part can't get over her past or all the time, money, and effort I put into the relationship that I will never get back. I want a clean slate with someone that will truly love me and make me feel special (sorry for cheesy but I feel so broken)

should I believe her and give her yet another chance? Should I just tell her to leave and be in the streets? I don't know what to do.

I'm sorry if this post is messy as I'm very new to Reddit and I'm not sure how formats or anything go about here, but I've been trying to get through all I have listed, but I don't know how anymore. 
I've been dealing with (what seems like) bipolar disorder, hypersexuality, gender dysphoria, and a gore addiction. With the bipolar, suicidal thoughts, and dysphoria I've noticed they seem a bit tied together (depressed and suicidal because I won't be able to transition, manic and angered by transphobia and dismissal from my family) but the hypersexuality and gore addiction worry me most- especially with having a girlfriend who I don't want to hurt during sex or sexually charged activities nor do I want to murder or something. I don't wanna hurt anyone or myself, but the thought of blood being around me and people I loath being dead by my hands feels nice sometimes. 

I hate everything here, I don't want to be labeled a murdering, nasty, greasy freak but I also need to seek help before I view real gore and not guro. I wish I wasn't so depressed and disgusting, and that I could shower and brush my teeth like actually functioning people without gagging or crying by the look of a thigh or waist. Over the past weeks I've been looking at those insomnia aid medications for guidance and I fear I'll seek temporary situations soon. I can't even trust myself with my blunt knife I keep for self defense now.

I'm sorry if this is a ramble or something and its unintelligible. I've done my best to state what I need help for. For a little more context I'm a young teenager and I have no access to therapy or mental help, I just have a guidance counselor who I mentioned being transgender to.

I encountered this woman (this took place at my work. Mind you, she's also an employee there) who is suppose to come by the evening to clean up the building I was in. She took off her mask and said, ""I can't wear this.. I have had the flu twice from wearing this mask. You know, people have died more from the flu than the coronavirus."" Me, being confused, I wanted to talk to her about it and thought maybe we could give ideas to each other and maybe I can try to inform her in a kindly manner. I was fine with her disagreeing and I was thinking we'd have a cilvil convo.. Hell no. It went like this:

Me: Hey, I have some concerns. What kind of flu were you talking about?
Her: The flu. 
Me: ...Influenza?
Her: No. Flu virus. The flu virus.
Me: Uhm.. it isn't coronavirus, right?
Her: No, no. Don't worry about it.
Me: But.. There are different types of flu. What type are you talking about?

At this moment, she got offended and said I don't have to worry about it because she worked at a ""home healthcare"" for years. This doesn't tell me jack shit? I mean, I worked as a CNA in a hospital and have worked in a COVID unit. But you don't see me saying that for some damn reason??? What does that have to do with my question? So at this point, I got annoyed and said that I worked as a CNA with COVID patients, so I don't get what she's trying to say. 

The convo ended there and I just thought ""Welp. I guess that's it then."" So I just stood at the info desk and went on my phone. She came back 3-4 minutes later and asked how old I was. My dumbass didn't think much of it and said, ""Oh! I'm 21."" I kid you not, she then shouted at me after that saying that I'm still young. I don't know anything in the EntiRE WoRLD. That I don't know anything in gENerAL+ she's older than me and has more experience in the ""home healthcare""  so I shouldn't ask her questions. I then told her that I didn't need years of experience and to be older to understand the coronavirus?? and wtf?? how TF DID WE GET HERE LOL. ALL I DID WAS ASK WHAT FLU IT WAS WTF?? And she kept talking and said that she is offended because I ""questioned"" her ""experience"". My brain froze because I was losing brain cells and told her I never once asked about her experience, nor did I question it. I only asked what flu it was. That I only asked because I was concerned for my health and my husband's (who has respiratory problems). She got angry and said she had the right to not say anything. Sure, I agree. She didn't have to answer my question, but her reaction wasn't necessary either. Then said she didn't care about my health or anyone at my home, lol. 

Anyway, she tried to end it with the hand-on-one-hip and the other in a stop sign and said to me, ""I am older than you. I know more than you, end of it.""

I talked over her saying ""That's not how it works"". In the end, she put her mask back on and I think she left work earlier than the time she was suppose to leave. 
Anyway, some parts of me replying to her was childish and I am embarrass that that happened. It was my first confrontation with a random stranger and I could have handled it better. 

What's a better way of me dealing with people like this? Was I in the wrong for asking her that question in the first place? Maybe I should have just asked her to put her mask on and that's it. Idk.

I had another huge mental breakdown last night and it ended up causing me to break up with my s/o against my will. I know that doesn’t make sense but when I have a breakdown it’s like someone else takes over my body and I can’t stop it. I am going to get meds so that’s not what I’m asking about.

They won’t even go to the kitchen in fear of looking at me. I understand the reasoning for all of this but it still hurts a lot. I need to heal too but I can’t do that myself. I need to be with people and I need support which I don’t have at all. I can hear them and they’re just having fun together and it hurts so much. I feel like it’s unfair of the three of them to gang up on me when I also need to heal too. I know everyone needs to heal but I’m getting pushed out and it feels like I’m getting set up to fail.

I have been unemployed since the start of the year and im currently studying engineering but im just starting to lose motivation. I feel like i might start falling behind on my studies as well

At least in prison i wont have to worry about not having a roof over my head and not having any food, at least it takes the pressure off me finacially. There is even a free gym in prison (i dont even have any money to go to the gym which i was using as a cope for my mental health problems)

I cant go out and socialize, i cant go to the gym because i have no money, cant speak to people in stores because everyone is wearing a face mask, cant get a job because the economy is fucked and its even hard to seek help right now.

I’m a great father and we do 50/50 for parenting time. Recently we’ve been texting more about our son and seeing each other more and seeing her more and talking to her is making me miss the good times we had together. 

She was my best friend and the best girlfriend I had actually. The only problem with the relationship was that my family hated her and that caused some problems. 

The other day when I dropped off my son she introduced me to her new boyfriend. I saw him before in her car but I assumed it was her cousin or a friend. I was shocked when I met him because she seriously downgraded like the lowest she could go. 

I’m a pretty fit guy, tall guy and get told I’m handsome a lot and her new boyfriend is morbidly obese and at least 400lbs. I doubt she really wants to be with him but I feel like I fucked up when I broke up with her. 

I think about her all the time and I’m wondering if there’s anyway I could possibly get back with her?

For some backround info, he is extremely dry with me. We argue a ton. But it gets talked out. He is a big ass liar too. He never asnweres my questions when arguing. Overall sus. 


The other night He said he’s going to bed so I said okay. He cut it mid convo too. But anyways I had my active status turned off cuz I feel comfortable with it off but I decided to turn it on just cuz and I saw he was active. Then he wnet offline and went back on 20 mins later. I got frustrated and kinda hurt ngl. But again it’s understandable that people wake up and go on the phone for a bit and go back to sleep but he kept going offline then back on. I talked to him about it saying I said i saw him active but it seemed like he ignored. He said back “I was talking to my family, plus I wasn’t ignoring you, I just didn’t want to talk to you” but why is he texting them when he can just go up to them? I don’t understand that part. 
Then I pointed out how it’s sus on how he didn’t wanna accept my friend request in face book and how made a whole fuss just so can’t friend me. I asked why and he ignored the questions. He dodged it before and now today. 


He then said how he finds it funny how it doesn’t say I’m active or the last time I was active. Idk why it mattered to him cuz he never cares about the things I do. Never. He immediately thinks I’m stalking him when I just turned it on because I felt like it. I asked why does it matter and he said idk and he finds it Weird. Then I said “I knew you were gonna say that. You find everything I do weird. Every little thing” 


Idk if he was kidding or not but he said back “not really. It’s u” I said back “Ohhh boy you calling me weird? Let’s not make me point out all the weird things you did” I guess it offended him and he called off the friendship and I said “Yeah I don’t want to be friends with a liar. And someone who used me for sex” he said he didn’t use me. But every time we are done sexting he gets distant and dry. We did have acruel convos but he made it like he didn’t wanna talk to me. 
 I said back “U one time got jealous of me, and makes me the bad person all the time. Do your friends do that? No I don’t  think so”
Then we started talking about HIS friendships. He told me how his friends do do that...but he said he didn’t mind. So he doesn’t mind gettin mistreated? He said he doesn’t talk to his friends, so in turn they don’t talk to him either...I’m the only one. 

The arguing slowly fades off and we have a nice convo. I said that it hurts when you’ve been friends with somone for a year and made so much memories. He said back that if he doesn’t text someone for a while then he knows we aren’t friends. 

Then he said “but I’m sorry but i don’t think we should be friends rn, maybe another time so we can start fresh”  And I confessed I thought the reason why he was acting the way he was to me cuz he didn’t wanna be friends. He said “No it’s just I want to take a break” 


tl;dr my friend of one year were arguing, told me he don’t wanna b friends.  Then changes it to he doesn’t think we should be friends right now, maybe another time so we can start fresh. Thennnn
He said he just wants a break. Hesaid he will delete the chat then hit me up. Wishing me goodbye and he will see me in the future. Idk what to think of this. Why did he say liek 3 different things?

253,Hello everyone. I need some help. For some back story. Me and my boyfriend have been together for a little over a year. We are both college aged and living at home during the pandemic. I have spent lots of time with his family and have a good relationship with his parents. My mom is very high risk regarding the pandemic so at my house we have been taking it very seriously. His parents don't think it is any worse than the flu and think the stats are mess with. Here is where it starts. They are heavily involved in the church as his dad is a pastor. They had a small group at their house last week...no masks. My boyfriend and I have it worked out so if his parents have a large gathering where there is lots of exposure then we refrain from seeing each other for a little while. It's not great but it's what we have worked out. He just today told me that they will be having these small groups at their house every week now. Our plan we had worked out no longer works as we would never be seeing each other. He tried to talk to them and explain that their actions directly affect me negatively and could be solved by wearing a mask. They told him that they won't live in fear or put their lives on hold (I'm not sure how they got those things out of me wanting them to wear a mask). To which he told them that I don't want them to live in fear or put their lives on hold just that they use common sense and wear a mask. They cannot do that. The only options we have is: 1. Never see each other. Or 2. We see each other but I have to wear a mask 24/7 at home to keep my family safe. Do I speak to them about this? Am I wrong to want them to wear a mask?

On my 19th birthday (19) she was the one who made it very special and exciting. She paid for my cake, baked me cute cookies and took me to an amazing arcade while the others just partied, drank and ate.

This small act of kindness stormed into my head as a memory and whenever I think about this I get an overwhelming responsibility to make her birthday worth it.

Furthermore, last year I did not attend her birthday as I was extremely overloaded and could not make time to visit her and eventually forgot to present her with a gift. She was not flustered by my absence, but did question it at times, when it was unnecessary.

Down to this year, I have proactively told her about my interest in participating in her 20th birthday. She as usual, acted excited and told me it would be a pleasure to have me. But I insisted on just spending a bit time with her so that she feels good about it and does not hold a grudge on me for not attending the last one. Which she was convenient with initially.

But for last couple of days whenever I try to talk to her or text her at times asking her how she has been or anything she is looking forward to on her birthday. She completely ignores me and says nothing. She just said you can talk to my friends if you want to do something for my birthday. Otherwise, completely dozes me off.

This has been completely agitating my personal opinion upon her and I am having various thoughts about attending her birthday; forget buying her a present. I lost my urge to be part of her amazing day or even get her a gift as a token of appreciation. All I want to do is just ignore her back and fancy some lies if she questions me of why I did not attend her bday.

That aside, a part of me is also scared that I will lose a friend if I don’t attend this birthday party and will still be indebted to gift her something considering how much interest she shown in my birthday.

Looking for tips and suggestions. Any help will be appreciated.",13Oct2020,1

257,"The other redditor said the following:

""I'm a psychotherapist and Borderline Personality disorders is one of my specialties. One of my professors is a top therapist in the area of personality disorders. 

Also, THE BEST person to read about it is Theodore Millon. He goes beyond regular diagnosis and noticed several subtypes of all the personality disorder, which are worth reading about. 

Also, you do not ""have"" BPD because it's not a ""thing"" but rather a state of mind. Your personality is based on ideas that you believe in that shape how you think and act. 

The good thing is that the same things play out over and over, and that's why certain events produce the same kind of people. Typically, abused children turn into Borderlines. 

The syndrome is, in a nutshell, that Borderlines hate people. That's the core thing going on. They like to attract people and then hurt them. That recreates the abuse they experienced. They also like to tease people, typically with love, sex, excitement, then hurt them until they flip out. Once that happens they can accuse their victim of being the bad guy. He's a psycho! He's a stalker! In fact, you set all of that up to make him into that. 

That's the core hate at work. 

I equate Borderlines with vampires. The classic vampire is good looking, rich, sexy, exciting, charming, etc and then they drain your life. 

In Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, a Borderline is seen as having ""Black and White"" thinking, which means everything is extreme. That thinking triggers extreme mood swings. 

So, the goal is to look at the ""gray areas"" in life. 

You would meet me and go ""He's a handsome genius and humanitarian!!!"" and get all changed up. But, when I said one wrong thing, maybe had something in my nose, etc then I'm a gross, fake, stupid jerk. That's how Borderlines think. 

The way out of that is to start telling yourself that no person is all or nothing. We are a mix of good and bad things. A person may love you, or just like you, or not much, or hate you. Tomorrow, they might want to be your best friend. You don't know but you can know there is no 100% anything kind of person.

If you go on a date, you are sitting there hating the person. You are tuning them out, you aren't really on a date with them, you're on a date with yourself. Instead, try BEING ON A DATE. That means you aren't getting married or getting divorced on the date. You are with another person and the date should be fun and it is a moment in time to enjoy. 

Borderlines RUIN EVERYTHING FUN due to their hate. So, confront yourself about it. No one is perfect, everyone makes mistakes, and you don't have to commit to extreme relationships just getting to know someone. 

On a side note, nearly every Borderline female I know dates scumbags. That's so they can constantly be disappointing. I am telling you to be open minded about people but DO NOT BE OPEN MINDED about scumbags. That will only help to recreate past trauma. 

A Borderline needs a soldier type to date and by that I mean someone who doesn't lie much, genuinely likes you, does good things for work/school, and doesn't have substance abuse issues. If you do what I say and not find petty faults with this kind of guy, things will go well because a person like that can heal beliefs that people are bad and kill your hate.""

I feel like their response is putting myself and others that have similar issues into a box and saying we're all the same and not individuals with different thought processes. I feel like they're telling me that I'm a shitty person at my core n to suck it up n deal with it. It's like they're projecting on me saying I'll ruin everything I touch and only hurt those around me and deserve scummy people while discrediting the good, wonderful people I have dated who just didn't work out.

Am I being too defensive?",13Oct2020,1
258,"I (f18) went out with some friends tonight at the park from across my college. Everyone had a few drinks, although I only took a sip because I am a lightweight and I know what happens when I’m drunk so I just don’t get drunk. I am completely sober the whole night. 

So there is this one guy (call him Guy). So in the beginning I did like guy but it’s was nothing serious. Once I got to know him I only thought of him as a friend and nothing more. Guy tagged along with us tonight. He got totally wasted and was also high. Like always I’m in charge of music because I like to think I have the best taste in music, but I’m reality I probably don’t. 

So I am playing the music and every time Guy walks past me he touches me. Not inappropriately but just rubbing my hair or my shoulder. Made me feel a tad uncomfortable but I put up with it. Later in the night, when everything had settled, he hugged me from behind and said “OP I think you and I have some things to talk about”. But they way he said it is he whispered it in my ear and it honestly triggered me. I have had instances in the past when things were done without my consent so I’m really skeptical about men in general. What he said to me was something that someone else had said to me before and it’s like I relived a memory I’ve tried so hard to forget. It all came rushing back to me and I burst into tears.

All of my friends got quiet and saying it was time to leave, and they were asking if I was okay and I said yeah I just needed to go back to my room. But Guy goes “No you just need a hug. Come here OP” and I just cried more. 

I feel like I killed the mood, well I know I killed it, but I couldn’t help it. Where do I go from here? Do I talk to him about it? Or talk about why I reacted the way I did? My friends are all worried and have been texting me nonstop and I’ve been ignoring them for about an hour. Do I talk to them about it? I already see a therapist but she is honestly no help and I want to get a new one. 

But Reddit please give me some advice to help me, I guess lighten the situation a little more.",13Oct2020,1

I have a very basic idea of what I want to do, but not much of an idea of how to get there. I want to create something, art. Not really sure what kind. Im most talented at drawing and digital art. (I just posted a little video I did while bored at home during quarantine you can use as a sorta reference.) I want to use my art to tell stories and the only way I can think to do that is movies and TV. My problem is well I just don't think there's any money in this. How will I make money while trying to get something like my own show? It just seems like my goals are too high.

I just don't know what to do really, I dont know what degree or classes or any of that I should be taking, if film or TV is really even the right medium I should be pursuing, how I will make money during all this.

264,"Yeah I know selfish and stupid of me. It’s been 3 days since and we have fucked. I kind of knew her from social media she came up to me at a music event and we hit it off I was with my group of friends so was trying to be funny when she asked my age I said 22 (I didn’t even know she was 22 thought she was my age but said it as a small joke) a small joke I thought I would reveal in the next 30 seconds. For some reason I didn’t because she said she’s 22 after I asked hers. I liked this girl and didn’t want to ruin the chances as we were hitting it off well. We were all abit drunk and at the time I didn’t think a big deal of it. Eventually I lost her at the event but she took my sunnies when we were dancing and texted me to get it the day after at her apartment. So I went and completely forgot the age ordeal didn’t even come up went back home and Later that night she tells me to come to the clubs with her and her friend so I do and night 2 of drunkness begins. We were getting busy the whole night physically she nails everything on the head for me. That night was the night I realised I fucked up badly with the age thing. Because while we were drunk and dancing she said you pass all my tests then she lists out her “checklist” for a potential guy she says this and she says that then she brings up age and says you’re Atleast the same age as me I’ve never dated a guy younger. That’s when I remembered the age thing and that I fucked up. I didn’t know what to say to be truthful because I felt like if I told her then and there while we were having an amazing night it’d ruin everything. I then get into a fight later in the etc forget all about it and we go back to hers and fuck and in the third round I accidentally came inside her as I was too drunk and didn’t realise I didn’t put the condom on right and it fell off. She had an annoyed tone and lightly pushed me off. Completely understandable and I regret it. I wake up the next day realising how badly I fucked up with the age thing. But I get home telling her to Keep in touch. I can tell allot of the attraction died from what I did in round 3 as her texting is getting drier. 

I just want to know the best way going about telling her that the lie about the age was meant to be a joke that just snowballed and that I’m sorry for cumming inside her by accident. She wasn’t on any birth control and had to take Plan B after.

281,"I used to be in a group of 2 other guys. N and B. We were best friends. N introduced me to his girlfriend's best friend. It resulted in her and I dating. 

After her and I started dating, our relationship started going amazing. On the contrary, N's relationship started going downhill. I've known him a while, and this relationship somehow changed him and he became psycho and jealous. She needed his permission to leave her house, was not allowed to wear shorts, had to respond to him within 5 minutes, was not allowed to miss his call, had to delete every guy on her snapchat etc. he was PSYCHO. I'd known him for a year and he was a loyal and nice guy so it shocked me how he became after they started dating. It wasn't her fault he became like this, she was the nicest girl. I still hung out with both N and b at once but distanced myself a bit from N and didn't hang with him alone. 

Eventually, her and N broke up. And once they did, both my girlfriend and N's ex started interrogating me. During the course of their relationship, he made up a bunch of lies about me and apparently he constantly told her that he wanted me and my girlfriend to break up. I think he was jealous that he introduced me to her and that our relationship was going much better than his due to no fault of his own. Anyway, he said I lied about my age and that I was actually older, he said that I talked and flirted with other girls, and he said a bunch of other shit. 

Basically, I covered for him a LOT to his girlfriend. Basically, he switched our roles and said I was the one that did all those things and he covered for me. He flirted, he tried to cheat multiple times (but got friend zoned), and he lied about many things. He tried to say I was the one that did those things.

The reason my girlfriend never brought any of this stuff up with me was because N threatened to break up with his girl if I found out. The girl is her best friend, so she didn't tell me for her best friend. 

So they interrogated me, I had to defend myself, and eventually they realized that I was the honest one and he was the liar. 

This happened 7 months ago. I mentioned that our group was 2 guys, N and B, along with me. N and I obviously stopped being friends after this event. B remained both our best friends. According to B, N talks shit about me every single day. Like he said N brings my name up at least 10 times every time they hang out just talking shit. When they hang out with other people, N talks shit about me to them as well. B says that he mostly just makes sounds but doesn't agree or disagree when N talks shit because he doesn't really know what to say since he's both of our best friends. 7 months ago and this dude is still talking about me. 

It's been getting on my nerves lately and I want to drop B. Even though he's both of our best friends, I don't think it's right that my best friend allows N to constantly talk shit about me. He can be both of our best friends, that's fine, but he shouldn't allow N to talk shit about me to him. 

If I drop B, I'm not really going to have any other friends though. I can't be 'casual' friends with someone. I can only be friends with people I can trust my life with. 1 year ago, I had 5 of these people. As of right now, I only have 2 of these people, one of them is B. If I drop B, I'll basically only have one friend that is in another country right now for university. My girl and I are still dating but she's in a different state for school. So I'd have nobody to hang out with.

284,"I'll preface by giving some background that is relevant. I moved in with a friend from high school and whilst living together I rescued a stray cat with the help of my bf (cat was going to live with him) my housemate was upset I rescued him because she felt I was taking him away from the elderly neighbor he would visit and disrupting the way of life ""he chose"". Eventually she said to bring the cat back and have him live with us so the neighbor could visit him. So Frankie became my cat. I have been responsible for him barring the occasional night or weekend I am not home when my housemate will feed him (I clean his litter when I return).

Today my housemate surprised me with a photo of a kitten in our home. That's her cat that she has already bought food for. I was very upset. Not so much due to her getting a pet as much as upset she didn't ask or discuss with me beforehand. Of course I'm worrying about all kinds of things now (fleas, vaccination, how much financial burden I'll end up taking on having another cat in the home) but more than anything it's how spontaneous she was with this.

Talking to her through text she feels this is normal and compares it to me bringing Frankie into the house. I'm concerned she hasn't considered whether the cats will get along, financial burden, medical needs, what it takes to look after a cat, or even if our real estate will approve of another pet but perhaps I'm overthinking it?

We will be discussing this more when I'm home but honestly I'm lost and particularly feel I've lost my trust in her as a friend. Am I being hypocritical here? Is there any advice redditors can give me?

Apologies if I made this difficult to follow I'm not the most concise and am in a rush to fit the right details in :)",13Oct2020,1
285,"I (20F) decided to room with three random females (19F, 20F, 23F) when I signed with an off-campus lease in my university’s town. Unbeknownst to me, all three were best friends and constant parties. 

They partied and went out a lot at the beginning of the academic year in August, including having house parties without my knowledge or consent. I spoke to them about it after a few weeks, since I figured they were all cooped up at home all summer and wanted to get it out of their systems, and they agreed to keep it to a minimum. That didn’t last very long. 

They get plastered nearly every night and constantly still have people over pregame and drink, which doesn’t bother me as much as the god-awful loud house music they play late into the night. I bought earplugs at first, which helped, but they bought an even bigger and LOUDER speaker that makes the floor shake with every beat. Which isn’t a problem in it of itself, but it and their music keeps me up into the night until 3, 4, or even 5am. 

I’ve asked MULTIPLE times for them to please turn it down, as I have morning lectures, and none of them do it!!!! 

The kitchen is constantly trashed as well, leaving me to clean up after them. They never wash dishes, either, and I have to pick a dirty one out of the sink and clean it in order to use it. 

They’re also constant users of drugs and illegal substances, such as cocaine (which they’ve offered me more than once, to which I denied). 

What should I do? I’m planning on talking to building management to switch units, but I’m not sure I can this late after move-in. Should I get law enforcement involved? I have no idea what to do. I’ve been driving home or sleeping on friend’s floor more frequently than I’d like to, and my patience is wearing thin. 

Thank you for reading, sorry this was so long.

286,"This is a long one. July of 2019 I met this guy, H. We’re both 18 and attend the same school. At the time he was dating this girl. Him and I were just friends but he was definitely flirty. I dated this guy, we broke up. A few days later H and his gf broke up as well. We immediately became more serious because we had already been friends for so long. However we weren’t dating. I had gotten mad at him about something I can’t remember now and we didn’t speak for a couple of months. I moved to his town at the start of corona (we live about 2.5 hours apart). We hung out frequently and hooked up. He constantly told me he wanted to marry me and he loved me, all that. And I truly love(d) him. While there I found out he slept with another girl. It wasn’t that he did it more so that he lied about it for so long. We both agreed to tell each other if we were seeing other people at all. I kept true to my promise and told him the morning after I kissed a guy at a party. After that I started seeing a new guy but ultimately couldn’t get over H. We reconnected before school and just fell back into place together. I would see him almost every day. Same thing, I love you I want you in my life. We still weren’t dating and I was willing to wait. I didn’t do anything with anyone, I cut all guys out of my life aside from guy friends. His phone is full of girls and I saw messages of him texting his ex but he played it off as her trying to get back with him. After we got sent home from school due to covid I went to visit family in a different state for a month. I came back and went to see him the first chance I got. It was great, I met his parents and it seemed like they really liked me. I was staying with a friend and her friend knew some information. Long story short he was seeing this other girl before during and after college. He lied to me about it when I asked him. And lied until he realized I knew everything. He said he loved me and was begging me not to leave him. He said he was planning on asking me out that night and that’s why he wanted me to meet his parents. I called his best friend and he said that was true. I was fine until His best friend called me this morning begging me to give him another chance because he truly is sorry. I believe you don’t hurt the people you love. But I really just feel like I need him and I don’t know what to do? Should I forgive him and try again or just leave it be?

I’ve tried my professor’s office hours, school tutors, and youtube but nothing has helped. I feel like my professor and the tutors could help if I was the only one but they have to help other students as well. Since I am no longer working and I don’t need to commute, I spend many hours trying to practice physics and try to make sense of things but nothing has worked. My professor said that our midterm would be similar to the homework so I studied hard on the homework and knew how to do them. When the midterm came it was nothing like the homework. Maybe the concepts were the same but the problems were completely different. Since I only memorized the process of working out a specific problem, giving me a brand new one I was clueless. I ended up with a 40%. I’m wondering if there are lectures posted online that go in-depth and really do a good job of explaining. The physics class I’m taking is called Mechanics and Heat. I really do think if I was to study correctly, since I have so much time now, I could turn things around. Thank you in advance.",13Oct2020,1
292,"To put things in to context, this was my best friend from middle school (I am 23 now). He was always the kid in detention, and was just always on the wilder side. From early on you could see he had anger issues but it only got worse as life threw its problems at him. The incident mentioned in the first picture was at his house, a mutual friend we will call Rufus was whispering in his ear that I was saying bad things about him being a father (what I expressed is I hope he gets control of his anger issues for the sake of his kid) He took this as ""talking shit"". We were sitting out by the pool when he gets up and acts like he's going to throw me in the pool, I had my new phone in my pocket and didnt want to get thrown in and it get ruined so I kind of pushed back. I thought this was all fun and games and a little joke, but when I pushed back he snapped and threw me to the ground and got behind me and put both hands around my neck. Afterwards I left and didnt talk to him for a few days but he kept messaging me and apologizing and eventually we made up and went on about our freindship. But now that I am older and I have matured I realize that you are in fact the sum of who you surround yourself with, and I didnt want to be involved with a hot headed guy who is constantly talking about negative things that revolve around his anger issues (i.e. road rage, relationship issues, and other things) He never once asks me how I'm doing, just basically uses me as a way to vent about his problems. Here are some screenshots of our conversations. https://imgur.com/a/FF8aECD Part of me feels like I should have given him an explanation before, but the other side says I don't owe him anything, and in actuality I was worried if his reaction could turn violent.",13Oct2020,1

299,"I (23F) am a first-year teacher at a small but high-performing school in my area. Because of the pandemic, students attend class at home via Zoom while teachers are required to come to work every day. Because of this arrangement, most of my colleagues stay inside their classrooms all day and only leave to use the restroom or go home for the night. I am a naturally shy person and have always been terrible at introducing myself to people. So far, I have only met the four other teachers in my department, and we have been in school a month already. There are about ten other teachers on my floor who aren’t in my department who I still need to meet. In particular, I really want to introduce myself to the two teachers (both male) directly across the hall from my classroom. The other day I heard them chatting as they were leaving work about video games and I would like to at least introduce myself because I do want to get better at meeting people. Our classrooms have these big windows so I constantly make eye contact with them throughout the day, which just makes me feel even more self-conscious and awkward. The problem is, I never know the right time to introduce myself. I don’t want to just randomly enter their classroom and possibly interrupt their lessons. Also, I don’t know how comfortable some people are with others entering their room with the pandemic going on (although I live in a relatively low risk of exposure area). I thought about introducing myself over email but that feels weirdly formal and also strange to do now that we’ve been in school so long. I realize this is probably a dumb question but I am legitimately just this awkward of a person and would appreciate some advice on how I can introduce myself to my colleagues.",13Oct2020,1
301,"(This turned out be really long. With a lot of background info and I wrote this while pretty upset so its not well edited. So, I’ve added a summary of what is going on, in case you don’t want to read through all of my ramblings. Grateful for any type of advice!)

Summary: My stepfather used to massage me and would eventually stroke over some part of my underwear/area near my genitals when my mother had gone to bed. Now, that they are divorced he wants me to visit him alone at his house. We used to be really close. Am I overacting by being anxious at the thought and should I go?

Background: My parents are obviously divorced. I've known my stepfather since I was 5. For a long time, I was closer to him than either of my parents (they are both kind of dysfunctional). Also, relevant to note is that I have PTSD and some other issues. I've previously been sexually abused by a stranger in public and it offset my PTSD. However, it was a combination of a lot of different things that had happened during my childhood. Anyways.

I think my stepfather might have been inappropriately touching me, but I worry too much that I'm just overacting due to my past experiences. Another part of me thinks I'm just avoiding the reality of it because I don't want to face the fact that it might be true. My mother left him about a month ago and he wants me to visit him at his house alone. One part of me wants to because I have always talked a lot with him and known him for years, another part of me is terrified of being alone with him. Because I have never been alone with him like that. There was always the knowledge that my mother was coming soon or was in the house. But now it will just be us, and he lives out in the woods, so there are no neighbors. So, the actual thing he has done: He started out by massaging my feet or shoulders or something like that. I was okay with that (I tense up when I'm stressed or anxious, so I'm pretty much always stiff). Then around when I turned legal, he started also touching me over my underwear or tracing my crack with his finger. This would start out as a massage to my feet or shoulder but end up around my privates. I have always looked away, so I've never seen his expression. I found it uncomfortable when it started but figured it was just my past experience kicking in. Also, as a child I was always taught not to say no, and I just generally never say it. I’ve never implicitly told him no and, in some ways, I was morbidly curios to see how far it would go. I also figured if something more obvious happened it would be easier to determine that it was wrong. It only ever happened when it was just the two us alone in the living room. I guess that is kinda what makes believe that he might’ve thought it was wrong as well? Cause he would never even rub my feet if my mother or older brother was there. Which, to me, seems kinda suspicious, but idk. A different part of me I guess was afraid that if refused him, something more drastic and noticeable would happen instead. Something worse that I wouldn't be able to ignore as easily. I also just never felt like it was that big of a thing that was happening, not enough for me to say something in case others thought I was overacting. So, I guess I'm just very conflicted about visiting him because now there is no safety net in place in case it gets worse. I guess this long rant is really just a complicated way for me to seek advice on whether I should visit him alone or not? I guess I'm also wondering whether he has done something wrong or not?

Thank you so much for hanging in there if you've had the patience to read through all of this. Sorry, it got so long. I would be really grateful for any type of advice/opinion. Still, I think it helped just to write it out, so thanks anyway for reading.",13Oct2020,1

307,"My ex and I dated for 4 years on and off and she pathologically lied, would get violent occasionally and cheat a lot.

Years later we reconnected she asked to stay with me for a month after moving out from the current guys she was dating house. I still had feelings for her despite the shit relationship, she knew that.

She moved in. We had great few days had sex and decorated my apartment with her things. It felt like we were really reconnecting in my mind but taking it slow and not jumping into a relationship. Still had plans for her getting her own place. 

Within 4 weeks the following happened:

-on my birthday she tried to take over my spare bedroom and move in there instead and I didn’t know if I could live with her like that.I felt rejected and got upset so she started screaming and breaking shit. Called the other guy in front of me saying “I was kicking her out because she wouldn’t fuck me” was a huge argument with her saying she didn’t give a shit about me and she “deserves her own room”.

-Week later she flies to home town. Has sex with guy. When we are about to have sex says she can’t because she might be pregnant because the condom broke. I say I can’t do this shit anymore. 

-I got upset at that and went to play guitar. It was late on a Saturday but I didn’t care. I wasn’t being obnoxious and it’s my house. She demands I stop because she wants to sleep. starts slamming doors screaming at the top of her lungs until the neighbors call the police.

-Acts nice to me the next week. “Loves me again.” Is intimate with me again. Cooks me dinner etc. Asks me to plan an outing with her on the weekend. I Plan the outing. Ghosts me entire weekend. Never comes back never texts me. Turns phone off. 

-comes back lies about it. Said she was with a gf. Turns out she left her journal open. She met a guy and they are now in a relationship a day later. I see that gives me an anxiety attack.

-she calms me down. Then later proceeds to pack her bags to leave. Says some guy was supposed to pay her for nudes. He Didn’t and now “has to go fuck guys for money”

-leaves for 3 days to go to the new guys house. Asks me for a loan for 1600 dollars so she can get her apartment down payment finished. “And get out of that relationship.” I said ok and make her sign a contract at least. 

-That week she comes back and is nice again loves me etc. But starts acting mean as ice off and on. Asked to plan a date again on Saturday, once again ghosts me to be with the other guy, the day before she’s supposed to move out. 

-at this point I am so livid. I send her a bunch of angry texts and this new guy who is a lawyer starts threatening me basically.

-she BRINGS this dude to my house to help her move out when I specifically asked her not to do that. Insanely stressful and weird situation. 

-Next day she comes over to get her last things and is super nice and friendly as if nothing ever happened. 

-next day blocks me. I flip out because I realize there goes the loan also. She’s obvs not going to pay me back. Final knife in the back. I threaten I’ll take her to small claims court if she doesn’t work it out with me through another phone number. I get upset send a ton of texts. She answer and uses boyfriend to come up with a scheme to sue me for harassment. Kept answering saying “I do not wish to speak to you.”

-I just finally tell her keep the money. She then calls me and says she loves me and I’m a good person. Then proceeds to tell me her boyfriend was looking into filing frivolous lawsuits against all my business to bankrupt me but she “won’t let him do it”. 

After that call I basically have a mental break down try calling her a million times and texting. She never responded. Told everyone I was harassing her. 

That 30 days I didn’t sleep at all in my house. Had so much anxiety. I felt fuckkng terrible. I loved her so much and all those events were like knifes in the heart over and over again and I was trapped in it in my own house. I’m going to therapy for the last two months.

309,"Up until now I’ve only ever got one C and nothing below that before but this semester my mental health has been BAD and I have all Fs and Ds mostly because of missed assignments and I haven’t a clue what to do. Literally no one knows about this and I don’t think I could bring myself to tell anyone, especially not my parents who are a little crazy. 

I’ve been telling myself I’d bounce back and turn my grades around all semester but it’s becoming apparent that’s probably not going to happen so I need a contingency plan of some sort. The end of October is the deadline to withdraw from the semester so I don’t have long to make a decision.

I want to be an ecologist but getting a decent research job in ecology is very competitive now adays and I fear it’s time to move on to a more attainable goal before I end up washing beakers for $13 an hour my whole life which is what happens to most bio majors even with grad school. Plus I’ve realized ecological research is effectively pointless other than informing little fun/depressing fact articles since policy makers, corporations, anyone else with any power, and the general public are all pretty much indifferent to what science has to say unless it supports whatever they already believe or want to do. Despite this I love ecology and can’t think of anything else I’d enjoy doing so idk.

The only option I can think of is withdrawing from the semester and accepting Ws (for withdrew) in all my classes and just not telling anyone. I can afford an extra semester of college but I’m worried that this would affect my future career, especially if I apply to grad school. I don’t think my parents would have anyway of finding this out but if they did it’s possible they won’t pay for anymore of my college so it’s still risky. Plus I’m not sure how I’ll explain when I need another semester of school to graduate.

Also I’ve somehow come to be known as the smart kid by friends and family alike even though the truth is I just have a good memory when I’m not brain dead from depression and adhd. Failing an entire semester is not something I want to admit to. Yes I know that’s not healthy or whatever but being “smart” is my only redeeming trait and I’m not going to just give that up. Pretending to be going to school when I’ve actually withdrew seems beyond pathetic tho and idk how I’d cope with it.

TL; DR : Lost and want to get back on track for my last two high shool years + College.


I’m 16y/o, and I’ve recently started to try and climb out of my 3yr depression grave. Up until 8th grade, I was on the A-B honor roll, and was constantly praised for my good grades. Starting 8th grade, I hit a bump in the road and completely went downhill. My grades dropped to an all-time low, and as of now I’ve basically only been passing through the years by grinding at the last minute to at least achieve a low D so I can pass. I’ve sabotaged all my friendships and every relationship in my life.

319,"So I’m 15 M and I recently had sex for the first with my girlfriend 14 F, we both never did anything before so she really wanted to try it 

So we got to on the weekend, I got condoms and she came over when my parents were a couple hours away shopping.

So we started having sex but I came really quickly (under 2 minutes) and she was disappointed in me.

I don’t know what to do for the next time we have sex, how can I last longer?",13Oct2020,1
321,"Hello everyone. I need some help. This is my first reddit post so be nice if I mess something up. For some back story. Me (F19) and my boyfriend (M19) have been together for a little over a year. We are both college aged and living at home during the pandemic. We live in the U.S. and the pandemic has hit us pretty bad. I have spent lots of time with his family and have a good relationship with his parents. My mom is very high risk regarding the pandemic so at my house we have been taking it very seriously. His parents don't think it is any worse than the flu and think the stats are messed with.

Here is where it starts. They are heavily involved in the church as his dad is a pastor. They had a small group at their house last week...no masks. My boyfriend and I have it worked out so if his parents have a large gathering where there is lots of exposure then we refrain from seeing each other for a little while. It's not great but it's what we have worked out. He just today told me that they will be having these small groups at their house every week now. Our plan we had worked out no longer works as we would never be seeing each other.

He tried to talk to them and explain that their actions directly affect me negatively and could be solved by wearing a mask. They told him that they won't live in fear or put their lives on hold (I'm not sure how they got those things out of me wanting them to wear a mask). To which he told them that I don't want them to live in fear or put their lives on hold just that they use common sense and wear a mask. They cannot do that. The only options we have is: 1. Never see each other. Or 2. We see each other but I have to wear a mask 24/7 at home to keep my family safe. Do I speak to them about this? Am I wrong to want them to wear a mask? I feel so trapped and really need outside opinions.",13Oct2020,1
322,"My first sex lasted about 1.5 hours,but I couldn't cum.I didn't feel as much euphoric pleasure as she did,probably because the condom was thick or something else was going on(I was also using an  antidepressant called Dyloxia at that time). My penis was erect during the whole time(approximately 2 hours)but no matter how many different position/stuff we tried;I couldn't cum.At one point,I removed the condom to see if i'm really feeling any pleasure at all,and I was right,but it freaked the fuck out of me since the thought of having a baby this early would fuck us up.We decided to use birth control pills and try it condomless,but she wants children in the future and doesn't want to be infertile.The next time I'm at her place,I'll also be bringing a slimmer condom in case she changes her mind about bc pills,but I also need advice on this since I don't want to affect her future.Please help me /r/Advice.",13Oct2020,1
323,"Well, maybe not 100% but a lot of things circling in my head. Before I start explaining and ask for some advice, this will be quite long so be ready to read as I will try to simplify. 

Currently, I am a 23 years old male. Throughout the years, I've lost so much patience with people and my personality warped big time. I used to be a social butterfly to a person who literally despite humans. For example, I could be outside, and often in my head, I'd be like ""I don't know you so I hate you.""  

Now I'm not diagnosed with Narcissism, but I think I am based on taking some online quizzes. I'm aware it's not a diagnose and just an estimate. We are entitled to our own opinion but I think so many things are so corny. I may not say to some people depending on what it is but I do have a sense that I like myself better than many others.

Why do I think am a recluse? Big factor, I deleted my Facebook and Instagram a while ago because I just got fed up with people. I am still on Snapchat but it's not too bad because I don't have many friends on it. With social media, I used to love showing off things to other people to view but now I can care less because I'm pretty much trying to stay under the radar if possible. Days when I leave the house, I feel like just ignoring many people by not even saying hi to them. Only a few I would.

While I still do a few good friends to hang out with, I totally decided to stop making plans with people. It's more if they want to plan, they have to let me know but I'd more likely rather not have plans. Hanging out by myself is starting to be more fun than hanging with other people. I'm not saying I will never hang out with others, I'd rather be myself.

I can be excited to leave my house to go skate but some days or even more often, I suddenly change my mood and say I hate people, why did I do this?

Probably too much to point out and my head circles with too many changes often but I want to ask, how has your patience been throughout the year? Sounds like a silly question but do you think I am a narcissistic? I don't care if you say yes because I am already admitting myself I am. 

What do you think? Thanks",13Oct2020,1

326,"My brother is 5 years older than me and has Aspergers, I honestly don’t know that much about the details of it, he is fully functional but just thinks differently and doesn’t understand social cues and is much more immature than someone else his age. I feel like it also doesn’t help that we were raised kinda secluded with parents that were very loving but very coddling. I feel like I was even shocked by the real world in my teens when I was able to start living my own life and experiencing new things. He just has not had the chance to experience things like I have and is just able to live at home with my parents and not pay for anything, and is really reliant on my mom to do things for him. The worst thing though is his social skills, I know it’s not his fault but he’s honestly just become repulsive to be around since he doesn’t understand social cues at all and is always super rude and just behaves like an asshole which he calls “edgy humor”. Growing up with the internet has probably not been the best for him too, now he just stays up playing games all night and it’s impossible for him not to do it without getting frustrated and yelling awful “shocking” things to random people online, it’s just so disgusting to hear him yell things like the f** word and even the n word, it also gives me anxiety to hear. I know I may sound like I lack empathy for his condition in this post but it’s just exhausting, I’ve had to move back in with my family recently and it sucks that I feel like the only person in the house that can think rationally, and like I can’t be myself and just have to be the level-headed one. I’m just worried for him in the future for the point where he won’t be able to depend on my parents, they’re willing to let him live at home forever but I know the day will come when they’re not around any longer, and I honestly wouldn’t be willing to take him in. I don’t want to make my parents seem like they’ve done a bad job raising us but honestly they didn’t do a great job at encouraging us to go make new experiences for ourselves.

328,"Hey, this is my first post but I really need some advice. I think my boyfriend might want to break up with me but doesn’t want to hurt my feelings, and I’m not sure what to do. 

A little backstory: we’ve been together about 3 years. About one and a half years into our relationship, we moved in together and everything seemed to me going well. It became apparent through talking with him and through hardships in our relationship that I was suffering through sexual assault trauma and severe emotional dependency on my boyfriend, but it seemed to me that he was okay with it and accepted me.

About 4 months ago we had a really difficult discussion where he basically told me living with me was affecting him emotionally and that he thought I was a different person than before I met him. All at once I started to realize how much of a burden I had become and felt the heaviness of my guilt and shame for how I’d unknowingly had an effect on his mental health. It was horrible. He expressed wanting to break up, which I said was okay because I wanted what was best for him. These were really hard times for us both. 

A few days later, I asked him if he wanted to break up with me because he can’t handle living with me or because he simply didn’t want to be with me anymore. I told him maybe we can try living apart and that I’d go to therapy and we can see how it goes. He was really hesitant and told me he just didn’t think we were meant for each other. Eventually though, we agreed to live apart and still see each other. 

I haven’t gotten much better since then, despite therapy. I don’t want to be a burden on his life anymore; I love him more than anything in the world, and part of that means I want him to be happy above all else. I am so afraid that he wants to break up with me but is afraid that I’ll be too upset or even that he won’t be able to handle it either since we’ve been together so long. Every time I think about bringing this up to him, I’m afraid how the conversation will go and that I’ll just come off as anxious/paranoid. Also, when I try to bring up what happened, he gets really uncomfortable and I can’t talk about it too long without us changing the subject. I trust him unconditionally but it crosses my mind so often that he might feel a certain way but can’t express it to me — especially after learning how long he was feeling unhappy before without being able to tell me. 

Any advice in general would be appreciated. It’s been really hard writing this but I’m just really not sure if I’m being paranoid or not and what I should do. Thanks.",13Oct2020,1

332,"Me (23M) and my girlfriend (22F) are going to meet my parents in Reno, NV for Christmas this year after we spent Christmas with her parents last year. As with everything else in 2020, this Christmas might be difficult. Throughout the pandemic, my parents have followed some of the CDC guidelines (wearing masks, hand sanitizer) but have also done things that are definitely not recommended (maskless indoor dining, traveling on packed planes without quarantining, attend public gatherings regularly (indoor fitness classes, dinner parties)). For example, my GF and I went up to a lake near Reno on the Fourth of July to stay in a cabin with my parents which we thought would be isolated, they totally disregarded all social distancing guidelines and precautionary measures. They invited many of their friends to a barbeque at the cabin and never wore a mask while at the lake, and questioned why my girlfriend and I were uncomfortable. At one point my mother masked shamed me because I wore a mask when outdoor dining at a restaurant. With the holidays coming up they will be flying from Denver to Reno and will visit my grandparents shortly after the flight, who are 87 and 92 years old. My grandparents have been quarantining and sanitizing to an extreme degree, and have found my parent's actions during the pandemic to be very irresponsible and dangerous. 

My GF and I were laid off from our jobs at the beginning of the pandemic and had to move in with her parents in Las Vegas. Her parents have been very smart about the pandemic and we have barely left the house since March. Her parents are worried that if we go to Reno, we could catch the virus from my parents and bring it back to her family. COVID has already spread through two branches of her extended family because they still participated in family gatherings.

I understand why my parents would want to have Christmas regardless of the COVID situation come late December. They have had a very difficult year because of the pandemic and they want to do anything to regain some sense of normalcy. They want to pretend like everything is normal, if only for a few days. However, that attitude has been proven to be dangerous and I really don't want my grandparents to possibly be exposed to the virus. No matter what happens, my parents are dead-set on making it out to Reno and having a normal Christmas celebration.

I don't know how to confront this, and I am asking for advice on how to make everyone happy and keep everyone safe. I'm worried that my parents will disregard my worries or even become angry with me if I vocalize my opinion of their behavior.",13Oct2020,1

338,"I'll try to be brief.

I sat around, watched TV, played games, and didn't do any schoolwork this semester. I barely salvaged last semester which started off the same way, telling myself and my parents (who pay for my college) that it wouldn't happen again. 

I know there's something wrong with me. How could I procrastinate all my classes for multiple weeks? I've not been this way when it comes to planning events or things outside of school. Long term, I know I need therapy or some way of seriously fixing my attitude/motivation/brain.

What I need advice on today is what are my smartest most realistic steps from here.  I can't bring myself to face my parents (this is my junior year of college and they have made it clear they won't stand for me wasting a metric fuckton of their effort and money), but I need to fix my school situation before it gets worse. My grades are pretty much all zeros and I couldn't realistically pass, much less get good enough grades for a college career. I can withdraw from the semester, but would still be liable for tuition, and moving on from there presents its own problems. I know whatever my next step is, it's going to hurt. I need to figure out the best way to pursue a degree (which I am thinking about switching majors), not put myself in a hole too big when it comes to student loans, and most importantly, I need to fix myself so I don't end up laying a huge shit on my own life and my parents' faces again.

I don't consume caffeine or stimulants *at all*, my diet life is very very inconsistent and for the time being (and the majority of the year) I only eat one meal a day and usually it's less than what my body requires me to eat, although I should mention that even when I do ""undereat"", my body never feels bad, I'm not in a bad condition...

Yesterday I picked up **(what I thought was)** a can of watermelon flavoured water. It only said ""healthy, vitamins, stevia, no sugar, etc"", but I didn't notice that it was an energy drink until after I finished it and started to read the can. It was 500ml.

I didn't feel anything different, in hindsight, I was more energetic and awake, but it didn't feel *weird*, not something that would alert me. I didn't exert any more energy that I usually would though, I don't remember consciously doing it. I did feel a bit quicker than usual, more *awake*, like I think faster or process thoughts quicker.

Finished work as I usually would, nothing at all out of the ordinary, except that my energy was just about depleted right as I came back home. I'd usually have a few hours before I'd sleep, but I slept 2-3 hours earlier than usual. Was dozing off while trying to read my messages on my phone, and my phone kept falling off my hand, almost felt like someone slipped me a roofie, cause I wasn't ""drowsy"" or tired, not at all, it didn't even feel like I was ""resisting"" sleep, just started sleeping very very suddenly. I tried getting up to get a few things done before I sleep, but right as I put my foot on the ground I felt so weak, and noped out of it.

Woke up with a throbbing headache, terrible one, my whole body is aching, everything in my body feels so heavy. I *can* move, but it doesn't get any less painful the more I do, it's pain with every single step.

**Skip the first two paragraphs if you want to get into the story right away. These two paragraphs are just context in our relationship with each other and context for the event that day.**

*He's 28 and we'll call him Vincent and I'm currently 19 F. I don't really see him that much, I only saw him once this year, his parents are divorced and he lives with his mom (my grandpa's sister) in a different state, his mom is the youngest of all my grandfather's siblings and he's also the youngest in his family. He only catches up with the family quite rarely since his mom is sick and he has to take care of her often and I'm also not really into family gatherings since my time is either spent being a student and part time working or full time working under my aunt's small retail store. So we rarely see each other even when we were younger. This year though was different, it was one of my cousin's (his niece) wedding who I'm very close with and so I felt obliged to attend the small reception. I also had to stay in a hotel alone because it was so much cheaper and efficient than going back and forth from my family home since its a block away from my current school and fast food where I work, that hotel is cheap, above a mall, and just a few hours drive away from the reception of my cousin's wedding.*

*I was just getting out of my last class for the day when I got a call from my aunt (my cousin's mom). She asked me if I could pick up a relative on my way if I only had half day of school, I was about to lie and say I have no plans of stopping by the hotel because I had a full day of school. I actually only had half day, I also hate being with other people in my car, since its not the best looking one and I feel quite shy about it. But she mentioned Vincent's name and I don't know why but I changed my mind and said yes. To be honest I really don't know how I felt about him even way before this happened, I don't feel and see him as a relative and definitely not as an uncle because I rarely see him and we're in the same age range, we never talk or ""catch up"", the most interactions I've had with him were eye contacts, nodding, and smiling. What's weird though is that he definitely stares at people, when I catch him looking, we smile, I look away, and when I look back at him he's looking back at me and smiles again. It isn't weird or creepy for me, but from those very small interactions, I definitely felt tensions between us. Sexual or not, I don't know but its definitely there.*

**Now enough with the context, and into what really happened that day.** I picked him up from the mall lobby and asked him if he was in a rush because I still had to get my stuff upstairs. He said ""not really"", I nodded and motioned my hands to let him follow me. We got up in the elevator, walked the halls, and into the hotel lobby without any conversation, just typical for the two of us. I then asked him if he wanted to stay here or come with me, I also asked if he had breakfast for the day and that I had some food in my room if he wanted to grab some and just lounge here waiting for me, as we can just go to the reception earlier. He just answered ""yea sure"". Again, very typical. *My room had a very small living area with a couch, a table for eating, a microwave, small television, and a tiny fridge. The living area also had a toilet but is clogged, so everyone, including my guests, would have to use the toilet and bath in my bedroom. I also don't have a solid door separating my living room and bedroom, just an entryway with a thin curtain over it. It definitely adds to the tension between us, knowing those things exists.* I told him that the leftover pizza was in the fridge and he can grab those, I expected him to go outside because I also had to change clothes and take a bath, but he just asked if he can turn on the tv. Sure. *At this time I was already contemplating if ""things"" are happening or if I'm only being weird and crazy.* I was quietly undressing when I suddenly heard him asking where's the toilet. I quickly ran to grab a towel, covered myself, and told him he can use the one in my bedroom because the one in the living area is clogged. He got in, I'm in the corner just awkwardly standing with a clumsily put on towel over my naked body. I sat on the edge of my bed, waiting, contemplating what the fuck is happening, is this really sexual tension or is it just an-ugly-room-embarrassment-tension and if its the latter then why am I so fixated on impressing him?

He got out of the restroom and asked if he could have the soda in my fridge, I said sure, stood up to get in the bath, avoid him. He said thanks and pat me in the back, his hand lingered a few more seconds long for a pat and my body quickly tensed and froze, I felt blood rush into my face and I'm betting 10000 I was blushing hard. He looked into me and asked ""are you okay?"" while his warm hand stayed on my back, knowing well that my back was bare because I only had the towel tucked near the armpit. I slowly nodded as I moved forward, expecting him to let go of my back and step away, at the same time something deep down inside me wanting him to do something else. I didn't know why I wanted that. Thing is, he's standing in front of the door, the handle to the door on his right side, his right hand still on my back. I had two options, one was to maneuver to the left and let him step aside so that I can reach the handle on the right, making it seem even more awkward than it already is. Or to just push towards the right expecting him to drop his hand, risking my body being closer to his body if he didn't drop his hand and move to the left. Well he didn't move away or drop his hand as I pushed forward, we stuttered and fumbled through words as we both can only incoherently say ""yeah"" and ""oh I"". We smiled again and looked at each other as we we're both filled with tension and awkwardness. It all then happened in a matter of seconds, I tiptoed as he is much taller than me, and he grabbed my back with his arm, his hand sliding down just above my ass, as I placed two of my hands around his neck. We kissed, it was just so good relieving all sexual tensions. It must have been a few seconds or minutes even as I realized what was happening, he already carried me to bed, sitting on the edge as I sat on his lap, his clothes and my towel still intact but our hands were all over our bodies. I pulled away, in shock, I stood up, and went to take a bath.

As I was in the bath, I was filled with tension again, this time confused if it was bad just because or was it good because it felt so good. I was so damn wet at the time as I was touching myself, but I was convinced that it was wrong.

I went out still dripping from the bath and hurried to the living area where I was about to say sorry about what happened, when I saw him masturbating. I froze looking at him and his thing. It wasn't huge like in porn but it was definitely more than all of my exes. He also hurriedly tucked it back in his pants when he saw me come out the entryway and muttered ""sorry"" too. I also apologized and was fumbling with words again and slipped ""its okay"", he asked ""yeah?"", and I answered once again ""yeah its fine, I'm sorry about that"", he said ""yeah"" again. It was very very **very** awkward but then he stood and just kissed me, again, and I kissed back. And it was just so good to just say no. This time we didn't stop kissing and started fucking instead and it was so fucking good. He was so good at it and I was definitely enjoying myself with how good it was. We had four (or five?) rounds, and were exhausted from it. We had a nap and I woke up to him kissing my neck, I said we had to go because we're going to be so late. We were in my room since 1:00 pm, it was already 4:00 pm, and the reception would start by 6:00 pm.

We hurried, dressed up, got in the car. We never talked during the whole ride, it was deafeningly silent. He tried making small talk about my school and how similar it was to his work but I didn't budge and just said yeah, focusing on my driving. We reached the reception, it was a short and quick one and we had fun without talking to each other and I was avoiding him the whole time we were there. After the reception he ran towards me and asked if he could get a ride because he was meeting friends at the mall below my hotel. I hesitantly said yes. He didn't meet any friends, he followed me to my room and I didn't decline. We fucked again, now with alcohol. I didn't even go to school and work the day after that because he just spent the whole day in my room, fucking like rabbits. He hesitantly went home the night because his sister had to work and his mom can't be left alone in the house. He promised he'd get in touch because he liked me so much and maybe we can make this work out.

Now I'm stuck in a problem I was complicit in making. The sex was so good but I didn't want to make this ""work out"". I don't want to make this a regular thing and I definitely don't want to make this into a romantic thing either, which he himself is strongly suggesting. I just liked it at the time and maybe a few times in the future(?) but I really don't want him to be constantly in my life like this or more. He keeps on calling and texting me, asking when he could come over or if he could take me ""somewhere nice"". This week he's also been hanging out my school after classes and knocking on my door twice, I avoid him or pretend I'm not home. How can I stop this man from being obsessed with having sex again? Two days jam-packed of wonderful sex with my uncle was great but it doesn't mean I want him to be my fwb. Even if we were mostly distant with each other before this and to an extent, didn't really know each other, I know there would be risks with messing up the family if we let this keep going on. And I honestly don't want to. How?",13Oct2020,1
350,"Title mostly says it, but a fake ""girl"" on snapchat added me making small talk which led to her sending me nudes and asking for pics of my dick and vids of me jerking off. Me being horny and through a lapse of judgement I fell right into the trap and sent videos. ""She"" saved them and then blocked me right afterwards. I reverse image searched the nudes she sent me and they're all pics from online, so I 100% got finessed but I'm worried about what's going to happen with the vids I sent her. My real name isn't on my snapchat but it shares a username with all of my main social media accounts, so while not easily findable can be sleuthed through a little research.

I figured this was an extorting scam but ""she"" saved them and then blocked me and all my attempts to contact ""her"" have fallen short (making a new snapchat account, finding social medias etc). I'm not sure if I should be worried or not since I don't know what their intent is.

I suffered from really bad acne all through out high school it started to get better my senior year after being prescribed acutane during my junior year of high school. I still suffer from acne but not nearly as bad as I did during my time in high school. I was made fun of constantly by my peers and close friends and my self confidence really took a hit because of it. I don’t like looking at myself in the mirror because I always fixate on my imperfections and I beat myself up because of it and it makes me think that everyone else just sees me for my imperfections as well. My confidence level is really low. I’m also not very good at talking to girls due to a lack of experience. I attend the local junior college and since we have transitioned to online school due to the pandemic it has made things even harder. I have avoided using dating sites because I’m not interested in having casual hook ups with strangers, I’m interesting in starting a meaningful relationship with someone.

356,"Hi folks,
lately, I've been thinking a lot about the question of whether I want to have kids. I am 30 years old and many of my friends already have kids, some of whom I kind of helped raise, so I have at least some idea of what it means to have children (of course you can never really know what it's like). Also, I'm a teacher and generally, I like children and I get along very well with most of them. Growing up, I was always so sure that I'd have two kids one day but since the last couple of years, that feeling has somehow changed although I still can't picture being old and not having children.
I've been together with my husband for 6 years now and it's just so perfect. I think my biggest fear is that our relationship will change significantly once we have kids and I know that you probably can't prevent that from happening. 
Also, as egoistic as it sounds, I love my independence and I can't really imagine my life totally revolving around a small human I have to take care of. 
Honestly, I don't even really know what advice to ask for....I know that ultimately, my husband and I will have to figure this out. But maybe experience? Has anyone of you ever had doubts about having children and then had them anyway? I've often heard parents say that children are a lot of work but also, that they give you so much joy. Is that really something you cannot imagine when you don't have kids?
If you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read it.",13Oct2020,1
357,"I'm really struggling to make a decision with which route to take. I currently only have a 3.0 GPA, and have considered just going to a community college for two years and then transfer to a University for the last two years. But there's one BIG problem I have with that.

I haven't had a single friend since I was 9 years old, back in 4th grade. Not exaggerating here. However, I have been able to get through all the bullying in middle school and the beginning of high school, and the overwhelming loneliness for all those years that I still feel to this day by looking forward to a new experience in college. 

Whenever I asked my mom if I would ever be happy and if I'd ever have a friend, she'd always tell me, ""Everything will be so much better when you go to college. You'll meet people who like you whether you're quiet or not.""
And whenever I asked her if I'd ever find a girlfriend, she would respond with, ""I can almost guarantee you'll find the person you end up marrying in college.""

So basically, I've spent the last eight years of my life lonely and depressed at times banking on the fact that it will all end the second I attend a four-year college. And if I decide not to go to a community college I know that it's going to be another two years of depression for me. I'll then be 20 years old, having had almost no experiences in life with other people at all.

I know that I'd technically still have my last two years at a University to make friends, but it's just not going to be the same. Everyone will have their friend groups by then, have experienced parties, found partners who they very well may end up marrying, etc. Some 21 year-old who hasn't done anything social in life isn't going to make friends in that situation. And if you don't make friends in college, or have any relationship experience by the time you graduate college, good luck doing anything in life.

Maybe I'm overexagerating things a ton here, but this is just how I feel. It's a tough decision for me.",13Oct2020,1

363,"I just started college (online) and overall it’s been a great experience except the fact that I have not said ANYTHING in class even though it’s been a month since our lectures started. I am an introvert and I have always preferred to listen rather than speak. I don’t think I am shy, maybe just a little, but mostly I don’t feel the need to say anything. This has never bothered me earlier as I have always preferred to sit alone and have a small group of friends (by small I mean 2 friends) but now I feel like I’ll be left behind if I don’t participate like everyone else. Any advice on how should I start speaking up? I should also mention that a lot of times I actually know the answer or have something substantial to say and my professors are very open minded who always encourage us to speak up or even interrupt them if needed. I just overthink about whether I should say it or not and eventually lose my chance. Online mode should have been easier but for some reason it has not helped me a lot. This not only applies to my classroom but any big group in general. I am a very quiet person who doesn’t like to share their thoughts and ideas. It’s also affecting my ability to make friends since I generally don’t approach anyone unless it’s ABSOLUTELY necessary. Due to all of this, I am feeling a little alone and upset and I wish I could just be more open and outgoing. If anyone could give me some advice I would be very grateful 😭😭😭",13Oct2020,1
364,"First time posting, let me know if anything's wrong.

I (22f) moved in with my fiancé, ""R"" (23m) who still lives at home with his dad, ""A"" (58) and brother, ""J"" (21). Myself and my parents, would have preferred if R and I moved into our own place but we don't earn enough together yet to rent a place and live comfortably so we decided that I would move in with him. 

A was ecstatic from the beginning because he likes me and thinks I'm a wonderful person - he usually says this when he's drunk, which is every day. This constant drinking is one of the problems I have with him. A lost his job earlier this year and it hit him really hard because he hadn't mentally prepared himself for retirement, so he went a bit heavy into the drinking. He got a contract job recently which has helped him manage his mental state better but the jobs are sporadic and don't pay as much as his old job. He spends half of his day at home watching Netflix, then spends the other half at a pub.

R has been the only one earning a solid income for most of this year, so he's been giving A almost half of his salary every month to help support the three of them and now the four of us. Since I moved in, R has increased how much he's been paying. I was also going to pay towards rent, but a few days ago, A got home from drinking and he was very drunk. He went off at R for just relaxing on a Sunday, saying R doesn't do anything around the house and is less of a man than J because he doesn't spend 15 hours working in a shitty pub.

It turned into a huge shouting match between A and R while I was stuck in the middle trying not to breakdown because I'm not the best at dealing with conflict. R fully shat on his dad and told him that the only reason we're still at home is because R wants to look after A to make sure he doesn't have a mental breakdown or drink himself into a coma. That managed to snap A out of it and he calmed down, thanked R for setting him straight and proceeded to pass out (he's a very strange man).

After that, R told me not to pay any rent, because A doesn't deserve it. R feels even more strongly about it since he chatted with some co-workers and found out that some of them pay a lot less to their parents. I was a bit apprehensive at first, but after seeing how he goes to the pub every single afternoon and spends a lot of money on alcohol, I really don't want any of my money going towards A's addiction.

I still feel bad, but I'm so sick of A coming home drunk every single day and I'm just waiting for something random to set him off and he starts shouting at us again. 

Should I pay A rent even if it goes towards alcohol or should I rather pay R since it's his money that's covering most of our expenses?",13Oct2020,1
365,"I've (28f) been with my partner (BF) for 7 years, living together for 2.5. I'm super close to my parents and we've never spent a Christmas apart. Pre-covid I would see them once a month (they live about two hours away by train, I can't drive), but since March I've only seen them for a family holiday over the summer.  


Me and BF are very concerned about the virus, but with the news and government in the UK atm I have no idea what's safe and isn't safe. I'm high risk, as are my parents, but I'm not sure they're taking it as seriously as we are. My mum's a teacher so has been going into work as normal, and my sister, who lives in the same city as me and BF, has still been going to visit about once a month (she lived up there during lockdown).  


Starting to think about Christmas, we don't think it will be safe travelling. BF's mum lives in the north so they are in 'phase 3' right now. BF's dad lives in the same city as us, but is remodelling his house so will have no kitchen over xmas. BF can't come with me to my parents as he's allergic to their cats (and tbh doesn't get on with them that well). So with all this, it makes sense for me and BF to spend Christmas together for the first time. But I have no idea how to tell my parents without them getting upset!   


Looking online for advice, it often mentions going up the week before or after Christmas, which I would love to do and would make them feel better about me not coming home for xmas, but I have no idea if that's safe or not?

My manager and the company are okay with employees getting tattooed, as long as its not offensive/derogatory and if I will not be getting one on my face. I will be going back to study in college abroad (preferably to the US) in another year or two. Already have 2 tattoos on my wrists. The one I'm planning of getting will be on my left hand. I am committed with getting more tattoos on my body, but not above my neck. This is not a spur of the moment thing.

376,"There really isn't a way to explain this without sounding like a massive creep, but I ask that you hear me out because despite the creepiness I believe my intentions are good. Just a few minutes ago I was on a certain website looking for porn. In my search, I came across a video that showed a girl's college locker room being filmed candidly. The video did not appear to be faked in any way as all the girls on film seemed to be unaware they were being filmed nude as they went about their business. The clothing and jerseys of the girls allowed me to determine which sport the girls played as well as what college they played for, and a timestamp in the corner of the film showed exactly when this was filmed. I've drafted an email containing these details that I intend to send to a number of relevant people within the athletic department of the college in question with the hopes that they can identify any person who may have been capable of planting that camera. Doing at least that much was never in question.

However, there is one other thing that I'd like other people to weigh in on. There is one girl in particular who is up front and centre in the film. Her jersey number is clearly visible, and this jersey number in conjunction with the other information I already had made finding her college athletic profile a triviality. This athletic profile included her full name, college major, age, and home town. With this information it was possible to find nearly her entire dox, including her facebook profile, partner's name, place of employment, personal phone number, and even her home address. 

Obviously I have no intention of using any of this information nefariously, otherwise I wouldn't be bragging to reddit about having it. But I'm uncomfortable being in possession of enough information to blackmail a person, because it wasn't hard for me to come across, meaning it wouldn't be hard for any bad actor to come across it as well. 

The question is whether or not this individual person has a right to know that all of this personal information is out there. Should I inform her of the situation similar to how I will with the college? If yes, how can I inform her without freaking her out?

377,"I'm sorry if this post doesn't fit here, and I'd be thankful if you guys could redirect me to a proper sub for it if this is the case.

So, long story short, I'm like many of you here. Sucked at being social since I can remember. I feel like in the past year, and most of it the past few months since the lockdown started, I've managed to be more social. However, I attribute this to interacting with people online. It's 1000 times easier for me and I feel more comfortable interacting with others online, where I feel like I can truly express myself in a way that irl, f2f interactions just won't do it for me. This way I met online a few people on a server, and we sometimes voice chat too, but yeah... I'm probably  the one speaking the least when this happens. I just feel like I have nothing to talk about... But moving on to the reason I'm here....

Many of my new online friends are Americans, but there are also a few Europeans in our group (including me). I met everyone at the same time they met each other, but only really started some sort of friendship a few months later, when it seems like they already got at least a lil accustomed to others. One of the Americans is a pretty great person and they said they want to learn the languages of the countries us the Europeans come from, and I see them often practicing with the native speakers of said languages from our group. One of the Europeans didn't exactly say such a thing, but I see them do this less often too. But they only made 1-2 attempts to show me they are learning my first language and trying to practice with me and I feel hurt by it. I understand the other guys from Europe speak useful and spread languages like Italian, French etc and that my first language can be seen useless since it's not spoken by many, but I am still hurt and it feels like I'm left out this way. And in moments like these I just wanna give them the cold shoulder and pretend that I'm busy, but it only feels like I'm isolating myself from them and creating a gap, which is the opposite of my initial goal to become better frieds with them.

Am I right to feel this way? How can I slowly become better at interacting with my new online friends, given the advantage that I feel more at ease interacting with people online?

Addition: I feel like most of them are closer together and discuss more in private too, not only on the common chat. Also, most of them have shared pics so we know how they look like, which i feel it's an extra step.to show they feel confortable/safe with others and may be another reason they feel closer to each other than to me? I've sent one of myself too, but with my face censored. Anxiety about exposing myself online is following me even if these people have proven only to be well intentioned.",13Oct2020,1
378,"Hi im from Malaysia and yesterday,  i got caught by police for comitting some sort of light crime but it is considered somehow a heavy crime in Malaysia due to customs.  Ofcourse  i wont share what i did. These 2 guys caught me and said they're  the police but they show nothing, no badges, handcuffs, uniforms.  At that time i really thought it was the police because  i was so scared.  In the end i bribed him. And im free to go.  So did i just got caught by just a normal person?  Any advice?

379,"My (22F) sister (20F) is a literal disaster. She has been preparing for the university exam for 3 years and she got in eventually this year, draining everyone around her in the process.

He has to pay for it too.

These are all okay but now she is diagnosed with depression and paranoia, and doesn’t want to attend the online classes because they want her to open cams. I understand her condition, really, I was suicidal and depressed before. But she’s caused so many problems already that her not attending online classes because of not wanting to open a cam is just angering me so much. 

My family didnt make me go to a private school or my dad didnt want to pay for a private uni, so i did everything by myself. Everything. Now I see her being spoiled this much but still not putting any effort into her education is just feels unfair. My mom and dad are divorced so my sister stays w my dad because her uni is closer to his home, and both my parents call me to vent like its my problem. Idk what to do really.

382,"I’m not sure where else to post this. Just found this sub today. But I went down the rabbit hole now I’m curious.

All these guys being “being Nice Guys” is this typical of how women think actual nice guys are? I’m not trying to step on toes or anything, but I consider myself an actual nice guy, but I have never done any of these things, except maybe a time or two drunk off my ass in my younger days. I always apologized profusely for being an asshole. But I was just wondering is this why I have a harder time finding females I’m compatible with? Because they view every nice guy as a very potentially not very nice guy? I know that’s not the only reason ladies, I am an introvert and I find it sometimes quite hard to approach women I find attractive. But I was just curious if maybe some of my problems may be that the women I do approach may think the nice guy thing is just Fake? This is really just a question please don’t roast me to hard. I’m just genuinely curious if that could be an issue. Sorry forgot to mention. Trying any online dating has been unfruitful for me, and I was wondering if this could be part of the reason. My small town bar I go into to eat, and yeah I get drunk on my bday, those bartenders are always very nice to me and even on my last birthday started me a profile on tinder and went through some ladies with me. They say I’m very sweet and kind hearted, but this is small town Montana. I was just wondering I guess if more woman than not thought that real down to earth nice guys don’t exist because of some of the not so real nice guys. Sorry about the book I meant it to be shorter, but evidently I thought I had to make you understand a little bit more of context about myself.

With the pandemic I didn’t think they were going to be calling subs so I took a homeschool teaching position for one student.

So now I’m at about a 70% pay decrease by staying in this homeschool position. It’s only teaching 3 hours a day but I’m not being paid for prep time or any material costs, not even to supply the child with the books required by state. It’s all been out of pocket. I literally cannot afford to stay in this position and want to go back to the school district but I feel SO guilty leaving this position even though I should be doing what’s best for me...

Me[19M].

My ex[20F] had a rebound on some senior guy in her college after we broke up,and she ended up sleeping with him. I didn't knew any of this things and it was all good for me. One day my ex's bff [20M] comes to me and tells me that she is not well after the break, she sort of started drinking and keeps getting high, doing every bad thing.

He asked me to return to her,like as a friend and also told me about that Senior guy who was hitting on her.

My girlfriend used to be very frank with her bff[20M] so she used to share everything to him.
So her bff tells me that she apologized for every thing she did and also this girls say that it wasn't what she wanted (about having sex with her senior), she says it just happened. She also ""promised"" him that she won't do that again.

So I decided I'll help,and i went back as a friend but her bff tells me to not tell her that you know everything, I agreed!!

Everything went back to normal. We sorted out and got back as friends, and soon we were more than friends. I kinda started feeling for her.

 I used to indirectly keep a check on her so she won't like go back to that Senior guy.

After a month, one day i went to her place at 5pm cuz she called me. She said she just woke up.
As soon as i entered she started touching me like she was tryna make out.. it was Normal so i started playing along!
And while playing along i saw some hickeys around her neck!! Then i was shocked ... I didn't ask her out directly but i asked her --what were u doing last night?-- to which se replied --i brought some whiskey--

So the next thing what i did i asked her to get a shower, and while she was in the bathroom i took her cell went through chats of last days( i know its unethical but her bff told me to do it, so i dunno i just did.) 
And it was again that Senior guy... I am very shook now.. i dont know what to do.. how to deal with this. 
Its like she replayed the whole night with me the other day.

I'm feeling like i was there the last night .she just showed me every fuckin thing that happned the last night.
I know i have no rights to say anything to her but i feel like cheated . I keep having those mental replays in my head whenever i see her.

I tried talking out to her. And she simply says she is guilty she won't do that again. She also says that she wants me and begs not to leave but also doesn't want to clear those things she says she don't wanna recall those things.

I'm stuck, i dont wanna become friends without clear stuff out cuz it'll become toxic friendship.

I know it was bad of me to check her phone. But if i didn't do that i wouldn't have known.

I'm seriously worried that most men secretly feel attracted to their daughters. 

It would totally break my heart if my dad was. I'm 21 and he has never acted creepy. The closest he got to weird/creepy is jokingly calling me ""a fine young bird"" in front of my mom and a family friend, when we were all discussing how much we hate referring to women as birds.

It has all info with interest calculations and shows balance,  also if someone has taken loan twice and different amount as interest amount and total would be different for each instance I used some fucked up logic made it work to show balance end of this list.(it has to calculate interest for each transaction and and deduct amount from total balance ,when some amount is paid;calculate the interest for only the initial amounts and show total amount,  at last when whole amount/s are paid with interest correctly the last balance would be zero) 

This was all doing good , but now as I would be going back to college and  my dad can't  keep working on it like I did, when I showed him how to entry at two places and how to see how much balance for each person, he was very confused and asked me to do his Excel to something like how Contacts work in phone.

It’s not a ton of $ and I only extended it because: 1) I know where she lives; 2) I know her real name; 3) I have her cell phone; 4) other personal information; 5) I have friends that live in her town. 

This girl makes her living in sexwork, is apparently diagnosed and on meds for ADHD, GAD, depression.  On the outside, she’s witty, smart, charming.  She’s also very curious about drugs and has a habit — she owes her dealer $.

The debt was to be squared two weeks ago and the recurring excuse is “I get a pay check on this day, etc etc.”  Either that, or she dodges the question when it’s brought up.

398,"So I have these friends, 5 of them 3 girls and 2 boys. Separate groups of friends.

The girls: I speak to via WhatsApp 2/3 times a week and meet up maybe once a month, however within that we send memes and share tiktoks and stuff like that constantly.

The boys I see at least once a week and we speak every single day all the time.

With all these things I’ve seen them through many issues over the last 3-5 years - break ups, a car accident, fertility treatment, career moves, redundancies and relationship issues.

(I’m just trying to explain the level of these friendships)

So over Covid I have been very very worried and paranoid about keeping my family safe, I’m the only one who’s not in the high risk category so it’s been a very scary time for me - my friends are well aware of all of this.

So about 2 weeks ago my mum tested positive. I informed all my friends. 

Fast forward a week and I’ve spoken will all of them about other things. (one I also helped through a breakdown she had about her adult acne flaring up - which is a valid concern and I did what I could to help - honestly it gave me a welcome distraction) but we get to day 7 and not one of them has asked or said anything, “hows your mum? How are you doing? Just checking in hope alls good!” Nothing.

So by day seven I’m pretty hurt and angry so I come off social media and mute all my message accounts. So I don’t lose my shit :)

Day 8 I have to call my mum an ambulance because she can’t breath. Which is honestly the worst 48 hours of my life, I didn’t sleep, eat drink and just cried because I was so scared that I was going to get a call saying she was gone. I’ve lost a parent already so this resurfaced a lot of hidden trauma.

Mum got home on day 10 and is slowly recovering ... it’s going to be a long road but hopefully we are over the worst now.

All of this I still haven’t heard a thing from any of them - they all have my phone number to sling a text since they haven’t heard for me in 3 days.

So now I’m thinking about going back on social media and messages and I’ve stopped myself because I am not really sure how I want to proceed yet. I’m angry and I’m really hurt ... but I don’t want to lose my temper with any of them, but I also don’t know how to address it or if I should.

I understand people have other things going on ... but none of them have mentioned anything going on so how would I know? And I am not expecting loads of sympathy or a big gesture but I’m annoyed how long does a quick message take when we’re so close.

I have some other friends who know what’s going on and some who don’t, and all the ones who do, have checked in and been amazing.

So what do you guys think? There’s no right or wrong I just don’t have a clue where to start or how to feel.

I have discussed this with two other people who have noticed the same unusual behaviors. I don’t know what these symptoms are. Could it be low IQ? Mental impairments? I don’t know. Maybe she’s just strange? Whatever it is, it is becoming INCREASINGLY difficult to hang out with her. It is getting to the point where I no longer want to invite her to things, as I feel I am almost acting as a babysitter. I care for her, but sometimes I feel she needs help I can’t provide her. 

I feel like it’s wrong to tease her about being slow, since I’m starting to think this isn’t just someone being occasionally dumb (as we all can be). Please let me know what you think, anything helps. Thank you in advance.",13Oct2020,1

416,"I've been at home for 6 months out of work and quite isolated, my social interactions aren't great.

An electrician knocked on the door and said he was here for a check up, I asked if he was scheduled and he said yes. I was confused because mum usually lets me know these things.

I let him in and showed him the cabinet then quickly rang here (being worried). She told me nothing was scheduled. He was a bit weird which got my suspicions going more asking me 'How old are you?' in a strange way and forgetting things in his car.

For some reason in my anxiety I put the phone down and told him 'Get out now' 3x without much explanation, until I eventually said nothing is scheduled, my body language was very territorial and a bit aggressive, although I didn't approach him.

Outside, he showed me that he was scheduled for the town next one on to us, with the same house number. I apologised and said you hear bad stories about fake electricians and how I reacted. 

I still feel really bad, and also a bit anxious because our house is quite isolated and I may have made an enemy here.",13Oct2020,1
417,"He is at a situation, where he think that he helped himself by helping her get to the extreme measure of dumping him. Because  she had given him signs of psychological predation and also was very alienated to  what they went through, being too naive to the dirt on the fingers. And she have also said that they don't get along but yet responds in a way, that contradicts this. So instead of being in a cycle of emotional discomfort and clinging on to getting some where better he decided to make action for the ""not get along"" saying of hers and made her delete any contact of him. But yet his loneliness problem is consuming him as did before. So did this guy has done good for himself and his well being.",13Oct2020,1
418,"The first fight, he was many times stronger than me, got me in a headlock and started punching me in the stomach. He emptied my pockets in his grip.  I struggled by pulling away from him, he kept his grip intimidating me yet no longer punching, finally got out of his grip and took off running after noticing how much taller and stronger he was than me.  The whole time was terrified of how strong he was and just wanted to run.

The second fight was against a girl.  I was bear hugged from behind, one of her hands went for my crotch attempting to grab my testicles, I freak out and with both my hands block it, break free turn around and immediately pushed against the wall I struggle defensively then tackled to ground finally with her on top and my head in her grip to bash against the concrete. That’s when I give up and let her rob me.

I’m slim, tall, athletic, young male.  What could I do differently?  Any tips to stop this from happening again?  How to recover after suffering from the first hit?  Am I being too defensive/scared about getting hit in the groin when I could focus more on offensive shots or is that justified and a vulnerability of being a tall skinny male? I also felt kneeing her while she was on top wouldn’t disable her like it would me and would just make her mad enough to bash my skull.  What are go to effective moves besides shots to the groin and eyes? Should I try pepper spray? Gun or knife is out of the question for me.

Thanks.",13Oct2020,1
419,"My mate's getting married next year, months ago he asked one of his oldest mates to be his best man, all was good with that. A couple months later he then asks me and another one of his mates to be his best men too, meaning he'll have three best men. He said that he felt bad on not choosing us originally, but I pointed out that he'd been mates with best man #1 for longer so it totally made sense. 

I don't know, it just feels like an after thought of his, preparations for the stag are underway and no one is aware that there's more than one best man, he hasn't told anyone, the group chat is a bit awkward for me atm.

I'm also not a big fan of his fiance, absolutely none of his friends are, for reasons too long to go into here. 

And the idea of three best men seems strange to me but it's his wedding, whatever makes him happy. I just feel a bit strange, like I've only been asked because he felt bad. I don't feel very comfortable making a speech for his marriage to a woman I'm not keen on as an after-thought-best-man, I feel like I'd be lying and being dishonest. 

Ive tried keeping it short, and I'm probably coming across as a bad friend right now. I just need some advice, do I just go along with the path of least resistance and do it or do I tell him I'm not super comfortable with it all and let the other two best men be the best men?",13Oct2020,1

422,"I'm going to try my hardest to make this post legible. Here is the situation:

1: I'm sitting here suffering severe flu like symptoms. I went to a prompt care yesterday and was tested for flu and for Covid. 

It is not the flu. I'm waiting for my covid results (should be available today).

2. I just got a new job, at which I work with my sister and my nephew. The nephew, while he hasn't said he's a Trump supporter, acts like one. ""Covid is not serious, the government has everyone but me fooled"", etc. My sister has a long history of what I call ""family killing and life ruining inaction"". (I could go on and on about this. Oh, the stories I have).

3. My nephew is in charge of the maintenance of the company's forklifts as the main mechanic is out with a bone infection. Due to this, I am his pair of helping hands. 

The main mechanic came in the other day, over halfway through my work shift (10a.m. to 10p.m.) and let slip that the wife of the boss tested positive for Covid-19. Yet, there sat the boss, in his office, maskless with the door wide open. (Office is quite small, he sits perhaps 4-5 feet from my sister and she has asthma).

4. I also find out that my sister has known the wife was sick for three days, AND ALSO KNEW that the wife tested positive for Covid at about 8 o'clock that morning. She. Didn.t Tell. Me.

OR HER SON. (keep in mind we all work together)

5. I confronted her. Reminded her it was Friday, reminded her I was supposed to get my 10 year old daughter that day for the weekend and now couldn't. Yelled a bit. Got a little angry.

Her response? ""Two things: 1, a mask wouldn't do any good at this point and 2, I didn't know for sure who the boss wanted me to tell.""

6: That's pretty much the story; I sit here with flu like symptoms (severe, even having a bit of trouble breathing as I, too, had asthma when I was younger). I'm scared that MY results are going to be positive for Covid. I'm PISSED OFF that my boss is such an idiot for not masking AFTER his wife tested positive. I'm PISSED OFF that my sister didn't tell her only bio-brother (me) or her fucking son about the situation, and to be completely honest,

I'm not sure I want to ever interact with her again outside of work if this is how she weighs options and chooses a course of action. Even if it's NOT Covid, am I overreacting?

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: New job, boss's wife tests positive for Covid, my sister knows about it. She works with her son and me (her only bio brother) and tells neither of us and doesn't plan to. Now I'm sick and it is confirmed NOT the flu.",13Oct2020,1

First of all, I care about her so much that I just want her to be happy. But while spending time with her makes me happy, it also hurts me. I've never felt this way about someone before. I've had crushes but this one feels like something else. I feel a sense of comfort and satisfaction. Crushes usually makes people feel nervous and all that. But with her, I just feel like my mind is at ease. All worries and concerns are gone. I'm just, at peace.

But it hurts me because I wish I could tell her. But I'm holding back. I don't wanna ruin anything. I still wanna be friends but at the same time I don't really know what I *truly* want because it also hurts.

I've thought about just leaving the community or group that connects us. I thought of just cutting off any contacts or connections with her. But I honestly don't know.... 

She's also going through something and I have been trying my best to be there when she needs someone to talk to. I wanna keep doing that for her. But it just gets really heavy for me sometimes. Still, I wanna be okay and strong for her.

If she was hetrosexual and tempted she could also cheat on me so it wouldn't make a difference that she is bisexual right? Seeing her around any of her friends also makes me really sad, and not just in a jealous way because she spends alot of time with me and I apreciate that. It's more like a fear of losing her. I'm starting to feel really selfish and I've asked her if I'm not asking too much of her time and if she wants some space but then she says that she doesn't.

430,"I made another account just for this.
TL;DR below.
I am a med student in Korea. For those of you who don't know how you attend med schools in Korea, I'll explain it for you.


In Korea, we take a big exam at the end of our highschool. Depending on your test results, you can apply for colleges and majors you wish.
If you are accepted at med school, all you have to do is not fail any classes(not getting a F), and 6 years(2years of premed, 4 years of med school) later, you take the med license test and boom, you're a doctor.

When I was in high school, I just focused on studying because that's what students are supposed to do. I sacrificed everything that didn't have to do anything with studying. I didn't have any goals for which college I wish to apply for, nor did I have any set goals for the score I wish to get.
It paid off and my academic results were enough to apply for med schools; which I did.

It's my third year and I should be studying in med school with my colleagues but I've flunked my second year in pre med and I'm studying with the sophomores.

My life has been a downhill since.

I can't focus on studying and just play games everyday.
I just can't muster myself up to study like I used to at high school.

One of the two reasons why I believe that I'm like this is because of my goals.
When I successfully graduate, I'm  going to be a doctor regardless of my score.
I'm going to live alone without getting married, so I don't need a lot to manage my life.
I have a few hobbies, but they do not consume a lot of money.
All I have to do, is become a mediocre doctor and that's it.


Here's another reason why. I only chose to go to med school because doctors are a preferable profession due to the fact that it has a long lasting career and make decent money.
I tutor students and I'm beginning to see that I enjoy teaching and that I'm very good at it too.
I just couldn't give up the opportunity to be a doctor as opposed to being a teacher.
And I still don't want to give up med school.

I need help. My life lost it's meaning, and I'm wasting my time playing games which were fun at first, but now feels like a habit.
Some of you might think that I should never have chosen to going to med school, but I believe that most of you would have made the same decision if you were in my boots.

I need a motivation to study. I need a reason to live on my currently meaningless life. I gave advice to many people on this subreddit but I can't give one myself.

This was written mobile and english is not my first language. Please understand if was hard to read.

TL:DR : I'm a med student who lost any reason to study or live. I need motivation for it.",13Oct2020,1

So basically, I am an undergraduate Industrial Engineering student in my senior year at UMass Amherst. Technically, Ive been in college for more than semesters now (Fall 2020 is basically my 11th). Im taking five courses as of right now (for the Fall 2020 semester),  and afterwards I would only need three more to complete my coursework. I was emailed that because of this, a hold was placed on my account that would prevent me from registering for future semesters unless I filed a petition for trying to gain an extra semester. So I emailed my Dean. I recieved a response stating that I wouldnt have to submit an appeal for an extra semester, but now they're saying that I should submit an appeal form for 'Satisfactory Academic Progress' as they state that I havent made satisfactory academic progress. Also, I I had two semesters which lowered my GPA, but as it stands today, I currently have a 2.6 as a cumulative average (for all of my years of college). I realize that my GPA isnt that favorable, but does it satisfy the basic requirement for a 2.0? Or is it that the College of Engineering only accepts students with a 3.0 GPA including those that need to take extra semesters? Also, if my GPA isnt ideal to be accepted for an extra semester, what should I do? Any help would greatly be appreciated.",13Oct2020,1

435,"I've been experience some severe fatigue lately, I do need to mention that I have Myotinic Muscular Dystrophy (MMD) it does cause general muscle weakness and pain so sometimes I cannot get up and around like usual and it's best that when I am in pain that I limit my activity because it will only aggravate it more. Lately though I've been experience more fatigue than normal and difficulty falling asleep (I have aa CPAP that breaths for me at night which helps a little) I used to get up every morning do some housework, make meals, play with my dogs, etc. but I just feel so tired and weak all the time. I've spoken to my doctors and they tell me it's the side effects of my medication and just the general symptoms of my MMD and there is not much they can do about it as there really is no treatment just some medications to help my heart function better and vitamin supplements. I really WANT to try and increase my energy level but I'm not sure what I can do to help my situation.

Just FYI I can pretty much do what other people do unless I'm having a bad day and the pain is too much for me to move around. I have limited mobility but I am NOT immobile and I do not require a wheelchair only a cane from time to time.  I can exercise but that tends to just wear me out in the long run and then I am even more unable to do daily tasks that I want to do, doing chores and such I actually WANT to do them because I want to take pride in my home and I hate a messy household because if I need to use my cane, (my walker on occasion) I can't have things all over the floor and it just makes things more difficult for me.

Any advice to increase my energy level would be much appreciated, if you have some meds to suggest feel free and I'll run them by my doctor to see if they are safe for me to try.

438,"For the first two years of our relationship he was always discussing marriage and when it would happen. I told him upfront in the very beginning that I wanted to settle down with someone who was going to eventually marry me due to the fact that I wasted 11 years on my ex who had zero intention on ever marrying me. So now I feel like he was only talking about marriage as a way to keep me around because he knew if marriage wasnt in the cards, it would be a dealbreaker for me. Petty, I know, but everything has their thing.

So last year we were actually talking about marriage and he brought up that maybe it would just be best to elope. It wasnt exactly what I wanted because I want the dress and reception and my ""big day"" but hey, at least I would be marrying my best friend, right? So it bothered me but not enough for me to dwell on it.

However, last weekend one of his buddies was over who lives this hippy, love everyone lifestyle. Him and his long term girlfriend have a very open relationship and he was talking about how marriage is a lax idea and that basically no one should ever get married because marriage is between one man and one woman and it rules out the possibility of ever ""loving"" someone else, if you catch my drift. At that point my boyfriend said ""I get your stand point but I dont have any intention on loving anyone else.""

That must have changed because as of last night he started saying that marriage is just a piece of paper and another way for the government to gain more control and more money from you. Which, I will admit I had looked this up myself some years ago and it is true that the government taxes married couples more than singles. But either way, it threw me for a loop. So I asked ""So, you dont plan to marry me then?"" And his response was ""Well, I dont know. I mean I just think that it's stupid. Why waste money on a wedding when we could just stay together and never have to worry about it?"" Apparently his plan to elope is out the window now. 

This bothers me a great deal. I WANT to get married. I have always dreamed of the perfect wedding and people being there on my special day to see me marry my best friend. It bothers me even more that I told him in the very beginning that no plans of marriage is a deal breaker for me and he discussed marriage with me so many times, just to change his mind.

After the door closed with L, she immediately deleted my stepmom, dad, and a family friend of mine from her Facebook and Instagram, leaving me and my husband only.

I haven’t been able to bring myself to unfriend L and I’ll occasionally see that N is liking, loving, and commenting on L’s posts and it really hurts me because I feel like she’s betraying me in a way.

I'm nervous because of school and thanks to my impulsiveness (which I try to work on but... Sometimes I just fail) I sometimes yell at them and we fight. They also ask me whether 'I have a lesson rn' and if I say no they simply tell me to do X because I'm 'not busy at the moment'. Telling them that going to lessons is not enough and I need to study a lot doesn't help is usually met with 'it'd take you just 30 minutes' which either isn't true or is, but I have another lecture in said 30 minutes and I'll lose the time that I could spend studying. 

Ranting more probably won't help, I think y'all already understand what I'm trynna say. How do I approach this, especially after fighting about it a lot?",13Oct2020,1
445,"I don't feel the motivation to do anything. I don't feel any motivation to keep on living. I don't look forward to anything in life anymore. I feel like life is not worth putting in the effort for anymore. I don't know what to do. I want to fall asleep and never wake up. I want to wipe myself clean and reset.

 I feel trapped. I've looked forward to being 18 for half a decade because I thought I'd finally be able to ""live"". I looked forward to college, to getting a job, to living in my own apartment, to going on vacations, and to other normal life things. I had a whole bucket list and goals that made me excited to live no matter how stressful life became. Now I've reached 18, my whole mentality had already shifted. I don't care anymore.

446,"Hello everyone, this is my first reddit post and I got reddit so I can get some advice. I am having trouble deciding what to do with my life. To shorten, is 3 years ""Just 3 years..."" or, ""A whole 3 years!"" for more context please read on. Im 18, nearly 19. I have a beautiful girlfriend who I've been in a commited relationship with for almost 2 years. I am currently working as an ""apprentice"" at an Automotive/Mechanics workshop. I spent a year studying Automotive engineering after leaving school a year early because I thought it was what I wanted to do. Since I've started working I've started to doubt my abilities as a mechanic because my boss doesn't give me any encouragement whatsoever. I don't get a ""good work"" or a ""nicely done"" but he does. I often find I'm complimenting his work and giving him encouragement which my girlfriend has said ""Should be the other way around"". I can easily say he is a cool dude but not a good boss. He seems to be really stressed and he takes his stress out on me which I think is very unprofessional, my other work colleague has mentioned this to me and I quote, ""he picks a fight with you because theres noone else to pick a fight with"". Don't get me wrong, we have good moments at the end of the day when we stop working, but thats about it. I have only been working with him for 3 months and it seems like he expects me to be as quick as him, when hes been doing it for 20 years. I feel like he wants to get rid of me but feels pressured not to because we share a mutual friend (who gave me my now bosses contact) and doesn't want to let one of his life time friends down. I don't want to say I'm smart but I know I'm not dumb, but working there makes me feel like I am, and doubt my own abilities as a future mechanic. My head tells me to continue working and put up with it to finish my qualification which would take around 2-3 years and earn something at the expense of my happiness, but I'm also conflicted with the idea that I should leave early now before getting too invested and wasting my bosses, or my own time. Would staying be worth it? Will he/it get better with time? Will I get better? Perhaps if I were in a different environment I would feel more enthusiastic, but I have never felt so unenthusiastic to do something I thought I wanted to do for such a long time. Maybe I'm too young and naive and need to toughen up. I have had my fair share of ""life experiences"" but that doesn't make me wiser than anyone else. If anyone else has had a similar experience let me know.",13Oct2020,1
447,"My dad is really disrespectful. He doesn't know what it means to respect others. He always thinks that he is right, and he never admits being wrong. For example, he always drinks milk straight from the container, and then he rips out a loud fart. It's so gross when he does that, and he thinks it's funny. Similarly, he drinks about 40 bottles of beer every day, even though my mom limits him to one bottle each week. He tries to flush the beer bottles down the toilet, and it always smashes the glass and throws glass chips everywhere in the bathroom. He also stomps really loudly on the stairs because he weighs almost 500 pounds, and I can see the stair steps bend under his weight.

He is really gassy as well. He farts all the time. For example, if he's in front of someone at the food court, he rips a nasty fart on them. If we're at church, he just puts his feet up on the seat in front of him, and he squeezes out a violent fart. Or he would be talking with someone, and he turns around, lifts his butt up, and toots in their face like 20 times. He burps in people's ears, and he has terrible breath and rotten teeth. He has a gross, fat face and a ton of wrinkles all over his body. He has an ugly unibrow and wrinkles that make him look like he's 80 years old.

He has anger issues as well. When he gets mad, he takes off all his clothes, storms up and down the stairs, and screams profanity at the top of his lungs. He pounds his chest and jumps up and down, while wiggling his head around. And then he farts and burps non-stop, and he even p\*sses or sh\*ts or vomits on the carpet. He throws plates and bowls around, and he kicks down tables and chairs. After about 3 hours of violent behavior, he slouches on the dog bed and screams at people, while smashing the palm of his left hand with the side of his right hand, as if it was sign language for cutting bread.

He eats a lot of food. He eats a heck lot of cookies, chips, beef jerky, and donut holes, and he farts on the couch. The odor is stuck in the fabric, so we have to buy a new couch every day. He watches TV and drinks a lot of beer, and he doesn't work. He throws his dirty clothes in the trash can, and he never flushes the toilet after he uses it. He goes to the bathroom about 50 times a day, and he doesn't even bother to close the door when he uses the bathroom.",13Oct2020,1
448,"I don't know, this may be an odd question really, and I might be rambling a bit... but maybe somebody can give me some insight or an opinion on this:

About 10 years ago my stepfather turned out to be a pedofie, and attracted to girls about the age I was when he got married to our mum. We didn't find out about his pedofelia till I was well in my twenties when he got caught trying to groom another girl around the age of 13 via WhatsApp. (Mum divorced him after that and we don't have any contact with him anymore)

Growing up I always felt uneasy in certain way around him, in hindsight I can recognise this more, at the time I thought this was what puberty did to you. 
Ever since 'discovering' he has actual pedofelic (?) urges, certain things clicked in my head.

But here's the thing: I don't actually know if I was abused. It's like there are holes in my memory. But I'm not sure if I'm mindfucking myself and talking myself into a trauma, or if there's actually some shitty stuff that happened.

One thing that has come back to me is remembering laying in bed and being afraid to move because somebody was laying against me, and as long as I held as still as possible I wouldn't be as aware of the skin contact as opposed to when you move. I don't know when this was, or with who, or what context, I just remember that bit.

Another thing is that when I was about 18, the first few months in my first serious relationship that whenever we got intimate my mind would zone out entirely and I'd really have to fight to stay present. Otherwise I'd get lost in what I can only describe as a moving Mondriaan painting (white background with colourful geometric shapes moving around on it). Over time this did get better and I haven't experienced the zoning out like that in years.

There's some more but I don't want to ramble on too long.
I'm 34 now and at times I still struggle with intimacy, though I can't pinpoint why.

I'm not really sure what to do, it feels stupid to try and find therapy for something I'm not really sure even happened. Something might've happend, but might as well not have happened.
And do I even want to risk remembering or should I be happy I'm blissfully ignorant?
I've tried therapy (in the form of talking with therapists) in the past for other issues and it never really worked for me, so that adds to my hesitation about trying therapy now. 
And I'm just not really sure what to do, so if anybody can offer me their thoughts I'd appreciate it.",13Oct2020,1

456,"Throwaway because I don't fully understand what could come of this, I feel absolutely sick as these repressed memories have come up, and I don't know what to do. Long post ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

The incident occurred when I was only 6 or 7, I can't exactly remember, but it was 100% not older than 7. The other person involved would have been a year younger than me. The country in which I live has the age of criminal responsibility at 10 years old, but I am not convinced that I am safe from it. It is a few decades later now, I have lived most of my life with this secret buried. My extremely close friend listened to my story and fully believes that I am not to blame, and have no criminal liability.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to play with a distant female family member as a child growing up, I am male. Like all children do, we used our imaginations to put us in situations to act out. Children imitate what they are exposed to, or so I am told, like playing war after seeing/hearing about the army. We used to play at my house, and at her house. We also liked to explore and be nosy, like most children, and would go through drawers in the storage rooms etc. At some point when I was 6 or 7, I believe that I stumbled across pornography VHS tapes. Nobody showed me them, I never watched them, nor did anyone know that I found them, I put them back where I found them. But, as a very curious and confused child, I saw the many pictures on the covers of the tapes.

&amp;#x200B;

All I knew is that whatever I had found, what I told myself is what adults must do for fun. Of course, at that age I had no concept or understanding of sex, or even how reproduction would work in people. And like I said, children imitate things to appear more grown up, or to act like adults for fun.  Children play ""doctors and nurses"" or explore their bodies sometimes but are usually caught and told not to do that as it's inappropriate. We took that further. I remember suggesting that we play a new game, that we play sex like the adults. With only the photos that were burned in my head to go from, we played a horrific ""game"" trying to imitate sex. I feel absolutely disgusted with myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

The snapshots of memories that I have, I know for 100% that neither of us were ever physically hurt, I don't think I ever physically forced myself upon the other person, but may have emotionally manipulated them to ""play"" the game without knowing what i was doing. Penetration never occurred to either person. I remember thinking that these parts must go together based on the photos but after a look between us we realised that ""no that can't be it"", standard children's toys were never even considered to be used. I hadn't even started puberty so not only could I not get an erection, thankfully, I couldn't even be stimulated or achieve pleasure. However, the part of the ""game"" that both of us understood, was involving the mouth. I remember receiving oral sex, but nothing happened and we got bored pretty quickly, I do not remember ever reciprocating.  I remember, like kids do, we got bored quickly and carried on playing after getting dressed again. This ""game"" occurred a few more times over a few months, still at 7 years old max, still with nothing ever stimulating, and still getting bored and moving on to play something else. At some point we just stopped ""playing sex"" and never did anything like that again. We were never caught, and nobody we ever told, as far as I am aware.

&amp;#x200B;

A few years went by and we still played together, with this game forgotten as we didn't even understand we did anything wrong. At some point our families clashed over something, completely unrelated, and everyone from that side of the distant family were blocked on social media. I haven't seen the person in question in decades. It was only when being given ""the talk"" in school and at home when i was old enough, did i realise how much I/we fucked up playing this game, and the awful memories flooded back. I still never told anyone. I buried them as a repressed memory as much as i could. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've lived my life with this shameful event. The memories have come back full force recently. I don't know if it counts me as a sexual predator or whether it truly was child innocence and not understanding things. If i never found those pictures I would have never come up with the game. I've lived a respectful life, and treated all women with respect like everyone deserves. It hasn't affected friendships with people, or the limited relationships I've held. This event might not even be remembered by the other person, I would have no way of knowing if it has affected them, and there's no possible good that could come from reaching out. I'm truly alone with these dark thoughts. I don't want to feel this way, I didn't mean to do anything illegal (if classed as), I was just a kid trying to imitate the adults with a new game... I don't know who I can talk to. I don't want to be arrested and would rather take this to my grave if its on the table. It was a stupid mistake from ignorance and naivety and not representative of who i became growing up. I don't know if i can talk to therapists or if they would need to report it. I'm anxious as hell and depressed beyond belief.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't mean to do anything bad, and I'm so sorry for it, and I know I can never apologise to the other person. Is there anything I can do, or where I stand with the law? Do I even deserve to try and forgive myself and move on?",13Oct2020,1
457,"I need help with how to deal with the situation without escalating things. 

My older brother (33m) got divorced about 2 years ago. His ex-wife (33f), Caroline, have borderline personality disorder, and have been very nasty to some of my relatives since, but never me. 

6 years ago Caroline was still with my brother and she got pregnant but had a miscarriage.  Some mouth after I got pregnant with my first child. Caroline had some baby things. There was a cradle and a cot and some other things. Caroline didn't want them in her house, and I got them. 

Some days ago Caroline text me and asked 9the baby furnitures back. I gave the cradle away about a year ago. My youngest who is almost 2 still sleeps in the cot, and one of the sides is a little broken 

Caroline want money for the furnitures I can't give her back. I remember it like we already paid for the furnitures when we got them, but I could be mistaken. We have some other baby things like a stroller and a carseat we don't need. 

I didn't know Caroline wanted the furnitures back. It is the first time she has mentioned it as far as I can remember.

460," Hi,  I've been going to a psychologist since January this year, and have  been diagnosed with PTSD. I have no contact with my mother and her  boyfriend (her boyfriend is mostly to blame for my PTSD). It doesn't  really matter to the story, but my biological father died a few years  ago.

My psychologist has done some EMDR (a specific way to work with traumas, by holding a big traumatic moment in your mind, while in the meanwhile having a light in front of you go to left and right, making your brain work in the process) (the only thing it's worked on properly was the old nightmares).  She keeps either pushing the EMDR, or she asks me how I want to deal  with my issue, but the problem is, my mind has been this way all my  life, I don't know what kind of things could help me be more normal.

Anyway,  a few weeks ago, my mind made a new nightmare, one where I was being  assaulted sexually (by him), and it made my PTSD much worse. I'm not  daring to go anywhere near the showers right now (my fear for parents  kinda flows over to housemates, and I live in a dorm), and going  outside, and being alone is horrible for me (I'm looking into getting a  dog for these things). But as I have a weak overview of my own emotions  or feelings, as I don't realize most of the ones I have are there, I  mostly mentioned the showers (as I don't have to go outside for much,  cause corona, and my fear of being alone I can handle). So my  psychologist thought to do 'flash forward' EMDR, to see what would  happen in the showers mentally (most of my problems with the showers lie  in the fact that it's shared space with others, and I don't want to be  outside of my own space, in the nude. It feels unsafe). But where she  ended up was asking me what I hated about the showers before, what would  be the worst that could happen (in the past there were cameras in and  around the house, so I've grown up with a constant fear of them being in  the bathroom as well). So I said, worst thing that could happen is  someone recording me in there.

Then  she asked, what's the worst thing someone could do with those images.  And well, of course it would be to see them sexually and 'do stuff' with  them. And then she was like ""so take the image of him pleasuring  himself to your body in mind and we'll start the EMDR.""

I  could not even last a second before I started crying and everything in  me said 'this is wrong, this is not what I'm having a difficult time  with, I can't handle this image!' and she tried for a few minutes to do  that EMDR with me but my mind had shut down. I tried talking about it,  but she sees this as THE thing to go forward with, and I just can't  handle and my PTSD and anxiety and everything has since flared up, I've  been more scared when I was with my boyfriend (while he's always made me  feel safe), I'm having an even more horrible time being alone, cannot  let myself fall asleep unless I'm literally drifting off while I'm  standing or in my chair. I have an even more difficult time to go  outside by myself, giving myself excuses to get groceries another time  (because I still have \[insert food\] to eat, so I can go tomorrow, or in a  few days, or whatever).

So I've  been thinking about finding another psychologist, since I haven't made  much progress with my current one, and I don't know if I want to keep  going to my current one since this happened. I feel betrayed and unsafe  with one of the few kinds of people I still tried to trust. My boyfriend  also thinks finding someone else might be a good idea (I opened up to  him about this). What do other people think?

tl;dr:  My psychologist wanted to do EMDR with a mental image of my childhood  abuser 'having fun with himself' while looking at images of me  showering, while this is not something I've struggled with until now. But now I do.",13Oct2020,1

465,"I posted the same a couple of days back, so sorry if it looks familiar. Basically, after university my friends all moved to London. I didn’t because I didn’t get a job right away, and I wanted to go back and spend time with my family since I’d been gone for four years. I was pretty down at first, I felt like I was left out and I was desperately looking for jobs in London to join my friends again. Now I have a good job and I’ve moved there... and I absolutely hate being away from my family.

My mum was recently diagnosed with early stage cancer and was luckily booked quickly into radiotherapy and has finished her course. I came back from London a month after moving there to help her whilst she was going through treatment. I was miserable that first month in London and was glad to go back, I stuck around for a while to wait covid out.

Well now I’m back in London and miserable again, but even worse now is that I had a real realisation when I was looking after my mum and the whole fear with COVID that I want to be close to my family. To be able to pop in for lunch or dinner, to give my mum a hug when she’s down. 

The thing is being close to them means I will be away from my friends and will need to search for a new job. The area isn’t the best career wise, the next big city is 40 ish minutes away which is where I could be transferred to if wanted to stay with the same company. I’d need to buy a car and somewhere to rent, likely on my own because most of my home friends have moved on. 

I’m honestly not sure what to do. I can’t leave for a while anyway because my lease doesn’t end until late January. I also don’t want to leave my friends and my social life, I’m happy around them but that’s okay for a day or so a week.

I'm just feeling super bummed, not because of the rejection, but because it's been so long since I've had ""feelings"" for someone (last time was 8-9 years ago), and I missed this feeling so much, and I suspect it'll be many more years before I feel it again (and who knows if that time will work out any better than these times, lol).

I've never been able to get ""dating"" going for myself, and I don't see that happening any time in the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, I expect the girl I'm crazy about will have a new boyfriend within the next few months.

And that's the other thing I'm thinking a lot about. She's indicated to me that I'm very important to her and that she wants me in her life long term, but we were fortunate that me and her ex had stuff in common and got along well. I feel like the odds of that happening again are slim, and I think she's so used to me and her ex being on good terms that she hasn't considered that that's not necessarily going to happen again.

What if he and I don't have much in common? What if he and I don't get along? What if he doesn't like me and doesn't want her spending time with me? Granted, I don't feel like she'd ever be like ""Sorry, my new BF doesn't want us to be friends, so see ya!"", but it's not reasonable for her to choose a good friend over a guy she could build a life with.

My last quiz bowl match was in February of this year and I haven’t studied for quiz bowl since. I recently got back into quiz bowl for fun, even though I’m obviously no longer on my high school team; I just wanted to see how much I retained. Although I haven’t studied in over 7-8 months, I couldn’t seem to remember or recall some topics and terms that I looked over and over again at while I was still on the team. 

For example, I remember reading the entire summary for Theodore Dreiser’s novel “An American Tragedy”. When the name of the novel came up, I couldn’t remember who wrote it or the names of the main characters. I also studied opera and couldn’t remember Verdi’s “Rigoletto”, even though I got the question in an ACTUAL match and I remember being so hard on myself for missing it back then, yet it still escaped me once again. I also couldn’t remember the first name of anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski after seeing his last name. I couldn’t even remember his famous books, even though I read the summaries. 

I understand it’s been 7-8 months since I last looked at these in depth, but is it really normal for these bits of information to escape you, especially when you made an effort to constantly look at them and memorize them before?",13Oct2020,1
468,I'm fairly shy but lately I've had a really big urge to make some new friends but I have no idea how. I'm 14 and I'm a female. I think I'm too shy to just walk up to somebody and introduce myself. Does anybody know any other way for me to make some new friends?,13Oct2020,1
469,"Some background.  


My boss has been giving me a hard time since the beginning of the pandemic, and has pointed out to me in one-on-one meetings the amount of days I've taken off since it began to hit where I live. I was forced into a position of taking a month off against my will when it first hit since I had developed a strong fever, and trying to follow the testing procedure was a pain since the phone lines were constantly jammed, and they lost my results somehow once I did manage to finally get through. Since then, I've also been following the legally enforced isolation procedures each time I've developed a symptom, and have been taking the option of ten days isolation rather than going to a testing facility since I don't drive, it's far off, and I keep having my Uber and taxi requests denied left and right since I legally have to inform them of what I'm doing.  


I explained all this to my boss, and he told me he just needed me to stop getting sick, and his body language seemed to imply he didn't fully believe what he was told, and since then work has been incredibly stressful to the point where I'm beginning to think he and some of the other managers are just looking for an excuse to get rid of me. Just recently I was made aware by a third party that he had threatened to write me up in their group chat for the method I was clocking in, when I wasn't made aware in my full year there now that it was something I wasn't supposed to do, finally being informed by one of my superiors only after I was told of the chat messages.  


I'm beyond worried. I do everything my job description entails, and even more since people continue to pile their tasks onto my own. My boss has told me in our meetings to not take on those tasks since it's their job and not mine, but they never seem to get reprimanded for the tasks not being done which in my work position directly affects the customers negatively, which in turn isn't good for me because they assume I'm not doing my job and get frustrated with me since it's close to where I'm posted. I lose no matter what.  


I want to find a new job. I can't get through to my boss no matter how hard I try, and the work environment is too stressful no matter what I do. However, I'm scared that if I'm considered for a new position that my boss will give his unfair thoughts of me when asked reference questions. How can I avoid this type of situation from happening so I have better chances of finding new work?",13Oct2020,1
470,"Hey :)

Im really dont know what to do so I hope some people out there have maybe the same problem or good advice.

( a little bit stuff about me that is important to understand)

I'm 22 years old and have to fight with my period cramps verry badly since the first statans bloody suprise. I never took birth control or anything else and i never cared until 18 about my body or sexuality because of a drastic sexual experience with 14. I just took some medication against the pain and only went 2 times to a doctor for woman but I had really really bad pain while examine so i never went there again till this year because I cant take the pain anymore it also hurts really bad and pain killers are not good with my antidepressants (citalopram). I also have a very great loving understanding relationship and I want to sleep with him but it hurts really bad when he gets inside. 

And there comes the question:

The doctor said everything is fine mit my organs and that I should take birth control (Maxim is the name of that product) against the Pain of my period but I dont want my body give more to do you know? The antidepressants have already really heavy side effects and birth controll too.

What would you do?",13Oct2020,1

473,"Hello. I am writing because I need advice on how to reassure my partner that I am not cheating on them.

Some background: My partner has told me about three previous relationships, and apparently in two of them their partner had been cheating. In the first, it was unfortunately their first girlfriend and they were cheated on three times total, with my partner only finding out once the relationship was over. In the second, I only know that it happened and as a result my partner has, in their words, “gotten used to it.”

The other day, my partner asked if we could not do anything that day since they wanted to go skateboarding and we had been spending a lot of time together. (We had been together from 9am-10pm for the past week). I said it was fine and arranged to spend time with a friend.

Towards the end of the day, my partner showed up in my dorm suddenly. When I asked why they said that they had become suspicious because I hadn’t texted them all day. I told them I had been busy and had my friend confirm that I was with them all day.

While this isn’t really a huge issue, I thought that I should get some advice before it turns into something bigger. I want to reassure them if I can, and if not, I want to be able to spot possible situations that may make my partner insecure in order to avoid them.

More details: my partner has not tried to go through my phone or restricted who I can see, but they do frequently ask if I like a mutual friend of ours. I always answer, “Yes, as a friend.” No I am not cheating on them. 

Thank you for reading.",13Oct2020,1

Because my mom says “you go to grandmas to stay with grandma not to go out”) my mom hates that we have a good relationship with my grandma (that’s why my sister usually begs for us to go, it doesn’t really matter with me) anyway if I went with my friend on Thursday we would have went to grams Friday night not Thursday night, my sister begged me to reschedule meeting my best friend but I refused, so you know what that bitch did? She fucking calls my friend without me knowing, and tells her to not go out with me and she fucking says yes, so my friend calls me and tells me she got busy with her mom (not even tells me that my sister said that) so I said ok even tho I was so excited to go out with her (btw by even tho she’s my best friend we don’t go out much that’s why I was so excited) so we went to my grandmas from Thursday to Saturday, then on Sunday my friend texts me to tell me everything And I Freaked The Fuck Out, I call my mom right then and tell her everything, that week (the Friday that was coming) my mom was planning to take us to the beach and my sister was so excited, she said she would not take my sister only me, then I waited for dad to finish he’s shower and told him to, HE WAS PISSED, he yells at my sister so much then HE FUCKING HIT HER, bruh I was so happy because I was so hurt by what she did, anyway I blocked my best friend and one of my cousins (because she new all of this and didn’t tell me) and know my sister isn’t even looking me in the eye, did I go too far?",13Oct2020,1

477,"USA- My family just bought a home and deed restrictions were not mentioned once after lots of asking nor was it in our closing paperwork. Well we contacted the attorney who did our closing paperwork and he sent out a title abstractor to look into the property history again. They come back with a copy of deed restrictions. We would have NEVER bought this house had I known this. It's the type of deed restrictions that ""run with the land"" The document was created in 2000 it expires in 20 years but gets automatically renewed for 10 more years. 
This attorney real estate company and everything has been a bit shady all along. I have been told to contact the title company but the attorney contracts them out. Now we do have an owners title insurance policy but that policy hasn't even been processed yet. And fun fact only 1 owner and his family have had this property since 2007 a d they claim to know nothing about this subdivision!??...I call bs. Because the neighbor to our right is ""grandfathered' in and is the only one in area with a fence. 

So what can be the outcome of this? Can we take this up with the county and get an exemption? The county zoning rules are fine. Can we get restitution from the realtor company and the for a fraudulent sale? I'm only looking for 2 things the ability to build my fence and garage or to turn the house over to the realty company and get our money back...not some big lawsuit. 
I am getting confused I think Is the title insurance company who has our policy the ones we call or the undisclosed title company the attorney contracted out.",13Oct2020,1
478,"My spring semester just got cancelled.

I'm currently a senior at a 2 year early college boarding school for high school juniors and seniors, and the admin just announced we're not returning for spring. I've been quarantining strictly since March (I have immunocompromised family members), so I've been waiting for spring semester to save me from boredom and loneliness, but that's not happening now.

I know it's totally out of my control, but the university is currently operating with students living on campus with few Covid cases, so it just blows my mind that they're shitting on us so hard. I think it has something to do with legal liability with minors, and I'm sure most students would waive their rights to sue or whatever, but the admin isn't hearing it. Since the announcement, I've been super angry and sad, and also angry.

As I'm a senior, I'm literally never going to return to campus, and out of 4 semesters I've only spent 1.5 on campus (and I loved every single day I spent there). I don't know how I can get over this. I will never see my friends again.

479," We've been getting an old furnace removed and a new one is being put in in the floor below. When they removed the old one they discovered a thick mat under it. Unbothered, they sketched out the hole needed to connect the old ducts to the new system. They didn't bother to move the loose pad and cut through it. In this process they cut through some old wiring (30's), that no one knew was there, knocking out power to one half of the house. As it was before the long weekend they said they couldn't get an electrician out to fix it until some time after the long weekend.

When they left we went to inspect the progress/damage and we immediately suspected the mystery mat they cut through was asbestos. We immediatly contacted the company and sent them info and pics, spending the long weekend worried that some young lads with young families had just exposed themselves to, and contaminated the working areas with, asbestos.

They roll up today to finish the work and we inform them of our concerns. ""Oh yeah, we think it was asbestos too, but don't worry, *we* wore masks."" They did not inform us nor use any safe removal methods beyond your classic dust mask, hand carrying out waste bits to huck in the back of their truck. Also no eta on an electrician 'might be a few days' but they intend to finish today with no power to test their work.

What the heck do we do? Are we on the hook for the expensive asbestos removal/clean up from all areas they frequented? In 10yrs can they come after us for exposure to something we didn't even know was there yet they still cut through despite their own suspicions?

484,"Me  and my girlfriend (in our mid-twenties) currently live in my girlfriend's great aunt's house in a small town in the north of England.

We were only planning on staying here temporarily but for various reasons we've now been living here a couple of years. We feel like we're stuck here and we really want to move out as soon as possible but not sure what our options are.

We have a few thousand pounds saved up, enough to rent and pay living expenses somewhere for a few months.

Also in the next few months I am going to inherit money in the region of £100,000-150,000. I'm hoping to use this to buy a modest flat/house. However I can't really begin that process until I have the money and have figured out where we're going to be living, and I assume it will take 3-6 months to buy property. I don't really want to keep living here for that long.

My girlfriend works full time. I'm unemployed. 

Our current plan is this: She'll find another job, either work-from-home, or based in a city somewhere in the north of England. Once she's secured that job we'll find a place to rent for a one-year rental contract (ideally shorter, but in my experience landlords never want to rent for less than a year).

My girlfriend has much better job prospects than me. She has a master's degree in biochemistry (frankly one of the only industries that seems to be doing well right now) and a current good stable job. Her job search is going pretty well; she has already had a call back. Meanwhile I have been out of work since January since I left my job working as a carer, and I really do not want to go back into care work. So I think that what will most likely happen is that my girlfriend will find a job first, and I will find a job near to wherever we move.

My concern with our plan is that as the holidays approach, my girlfriend's current workplace is going into peak season. It seems like things are going to get much busier and more tiring, and she will be asked to work longer hours. I'm not sure if she will have the time or energy to find another job without it stressing her out a lot. I think it's going to be a really depressing time for us, especially if we are going into another lockdown.

We have some other options but they all seem to have major drawbacks:

* We could just move now. My girlfriend could just quit her job. We could find a rental contract for a flat in a city with good prospects and live off our savings until one of us finds another job. I think that even in this economy, one of us would be able to find a new job before our savings run out, but if not, we won't be in dire straits - I'll receive my inheritance before too long, or we can borrow money from family until I have the money to pay them back. The major downside is that obviously it would be quite an insecure and uncertain situation. It would also mean we would need to commit to finding work we could do wherever we decided to live, and wouldn't be able to move for a better job.

* We could find a place to rent in our current small town. That way at least we wouldn't be living with family anymore and we could have our own place. The major drawback is that presumably that would involve committing to continuing to live here for 6-12 months, and we really don't want to do that.

I'm not sure if I'm missing any options. I would really appreciate any input or advice.",13Oct2020,1
485,"Hi there. So um, I'm just going to tell you my story from the beginning. I really loved school, I was always so excited. So, I was always the kid who would always, answer questions, help others, volunteer, in school. I always felt good about myself, doing good things. I would always do this because I knew it would give me a chance for everyone to get along with me, and get understood. I guess this started in 5th grade. Now, which is in Covid 19, We would have lots of meets. And I would always do the same as usual. Help people, answer questions. Because a lot of people wouldn't participate in class. Or they would need help with something. And I would always kindly help them. But as time went on, I felt like I was doing something wrong. And I felt like people thought I wanted attention, and i was just a show off. Which was not what I was thinking.  I always tried to be friendly. But I felt like I just wanted attention.. My mom also told me that ""Stop helping people so much when you have to take care of your self."" And, ""If you help somebody, and they get it wrong, its your fault."" To be honest, I can say she was wrong. Because when I thought about it, my confidence sinked .I didn't feel like I was doing anything right. I wanted to just be a nobody. But it was kind of hard cause my friends always asked me for help, teachers, and classmates. But I didn't want people to think, ""oh she is such a showoff, who wants attentions from teachers.""

The school gave us all the resources but didn’t tell us what to do with them. There is no schedule or guidance.

Spelling pages 

Two math books

A reading book

A writing book

489,"I’m in my first year of fully fledged college. Coincidentally my boyfriend goes to the same college (not planned but it happened, two entirely different programs lol).  We both stayed home this first semester since classes were all online, but I don’t get along with my mother and want to move out. BF wants to move out because he can, really all that is to it. 

The plan was get on campus housing this spring, but it was recently announced that only those that were on campus in the fall at the beginning (housing was eventually shut down because stupidity on the students part) are going to be given priority. We didn’t go to campus, but we thought we’d be okay.  Then we realized we are classified as 3rd years.  This is because we were part of an accelerated program in high school, and we are indeed third year students technically.  Priority is given to first years, and with the housing plans our schools announced there probably wasn’t going to be enough space for 1st years in the beginning. 

Our housing acceptance or denial is supposed to be announced this week but the odds are stacked against me and my bf.  We live two hours from campus so commuting everyday seems kind of dumb.  We are making plans for an apartment. With our housing refund (since we did probably won’t get housing) we should be able to afford a one bedroom with enough money to spare for our utilities and expenses (I have crunched the numbers thrice).  Of course, both of us would try to get jobs in our new area ASAP so we wouldn’t be budgeting what we have each month.  

I have been dating BF for two years nearly and feel very solid in our relationship and our ability to live together and not kill each other. Of course, this will need to be tested but we’re at the best place in our relationship. We have had the “what if we break up” talk so we’re not going into this blindly in love, we’re realistic. 

The problem here is my mother is very conservative.  Living her with her right now I cannot be out past 10 with my BF because she thinks I’m “doing things I’m not supposed to”.  Not a hard leap for you all to guess what she means. I know she’d freak at the mention of me moving in with my BF, but I can’t afford an apartment on my own and I don’t have any friends at university to roommate with. Lastly, my mom doesn’t really like BF, only because he comes from a poor (yet now upper middle class cause America is *opportunity*) ranching Hispanic family.  My mom considers him lower class and a different breed. We’re also Hispanic but from a different country.  She considers his family inherently “lower”.  It’s not like we aren’t poor too lol. She always wanted me to marry a white man, and once she realized my relationship is serious she has started to lash out at me about it. Also there a lot more emotionally abusive crap she’s doing daily so I am trying to get out. 

Last of all, I really like my boyfriend. Our relationship is amazing right now.  I’m excited to try the next step. His parents were kind of vocal saying they’re excited to see him get an apartment, to be out “on his own”. It’s not that they don’t like me (they love me), but I think they wanted him to be on his own first which in the city we study in, is financially impossible. Our hometown, yes. Big city, no. 

So, how do I breech the subject with my conservative Hispanic mother? It’s more of a “I am going to” instead of a “what do you think of”. 

I’m afraid of her lol.",13Oct2020,1
490,"I had a troubled childhood/adolescence due to family life which led me to make a lot of horrible decisions. I tried and failed to kill myself when I was 18 (i'm 25 now). The things I did as a kid and teen hurt and weigh me down every day and I feel as if I don't deserve forgiveness:

&amp;#x200B;

\- When I was 13\~16 I bullied a kid on my bus who had autism. This included dropping all his stuff from his runescape account, pretending to be a girl and texting him then showing it to other people on the bus and generally just harassing him every day. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Around 14 my sister and I stopped talking completely, this is because any time we would fight (as siblings do) my parents would side with her and i'd often get hit really hard. My wrist feels permanent pain from a time my mom hit it with a solid metal vacuum cleaner. I didn't want to be hit anymore so I tried to stop talking to my sister completely. We have not had a conversation in at least 10 years and it hurts me thinking of how much I've completely failed as a brother. When I see her now I get nervous even talking around her, it's pathetic.

&amp;#x200B;

\- When I was 18 I was at the height of my depression, my parents divorced after a lifetime of abuse but it only got worse as they fought in court and took out their anger on my sister and I. I dropped out of university and became addicted to online gaming. I met a 14 year old girl there and started dating her and using my depression to manipulate her to giving me attention 24/7, she broke up with me after 4 months. A few months later she asked for me back but I had realized by that point what I did was wrong and denied her request.

&amp;#x200B;

\- When I was 19 I started dating another girl who heavily emotionally and verbally abused me, she would constantly tell me to kill myself knowing the extent of my depression. After 4 months I snapped and started abusing her back until I was finally fed up about 8 months in. She said she would kill herself if I broke up with her and sent me a video of herself swallowing a bunch of pills, I told her to fuck off and blocked her on everything. I'm not sure if she really killed herself but it's in the back of my mind all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I ponder on this stuff constantly, and I feel an extreme amount of remorse and regret for the actions I've taken. I've tried apologizing to the person on my bus and the 14 year old I dated but have not been able to get in contact with them. I don't know what I can do to take steps to forgiving myself, or if I even deserve that luxury.

494,"This is a bit of a long post, so I tried to shorten it as much as I could and I included a TL;DR at the end.

I know this probably won’t mean much given the nature of everything I’m about to say, but I tried to be as truthful as I could in this post. I think my biggest reasons for lying are my fears of abandonment, criticism, and confrontation. Before you comment, please keep in mind that I’m admitting to all of this because I want to be a better person. If I’m not welcome here, I’ll leave.

I’m really good at lying and being manipulative. Like, I’m *alarmingly* good at it. I rarely lie about big things, but I lie about small things. One example of this is that I’ll lie about what I like to do for fun, and I’ll make up stories about things I’ve done with my friends. I do this because I hate how boring my life is and I feel like if everyone knew just how boring my life really is, they’d abandon me.

I think this is one explanation of why I’m so introverted. I have a fear of disappointing my family and a fear of my close friends abandoning me, so I intentionally isolate myself because I lie so much that I worry I’ll eventually push them away. I’m aware that this creates a self fulfilling prophecy, but I only keep them at *just enough* of a distance that they don’t see that side of me. I do have fears, worries, and regrets, so I don’t *think* I’m a sociopath or anything like that, but the thing that really worries me is this:

I rarely, if ever, feel guilty about lying. At least, I don’t feel guilty about the actual act of it. I feel guilty about things I say or do if I find out they affect other people negatively, but otherwise I don’t care. I’ve lied so much in my life that I’m not even sure of who the “real me” is. Or maybe I do know, but I’m just scared to face that person.

My stepdad was one of the most manipulative people I’ve ever known. He put my mom into almost $300,000 of debt by using her identity to attempt to start about 10 different businesses over the course of their marriage, and all of them failed spectacularly. He was a pastor for the first few years of his marriage to my mom, but most of the time he made money from his job as a used car salesman. He lied with such ease, and he almost never showed emotion when he lied. His biggest problem was that he was impulsive. He had trouble with keeping his stories straight, but whenever he got “found out” he always managed to recover quickly. He was an abusive drunk, and he would scream profanities at me and my younger brother (his biological child) if we did anything to upset him. I tried telling counselors, teachers, and even police officers about the abuse so many times over the years, but because he was so good at lying, he managed to talk his way out of trouble every single time he was questioned. He’d always convince everyone to give him time alone with the counselor, or the police officer, or whoever it was he needed to convince. They always gave it to him. I eventually just accepted the fact that we would never get away from him, and stopped trying. My mom, my brother, and I eventually did kick him out of our lives for good, but because this post is already pretty long, I’m going to leave that story out of this.

As I’ve learned this year, my bio dad was also really good at lying. I mean, he played poker for a *living*, and he apparently made a lot of money from it. He also cheated on his wife constantly for years, and was so good at lying to her about it that to this day she’s *still* in denial about it.

I’m good at lying because not only does it run in my blood, but I watched my stepdad do it  every day for almost 2 decades straight. I feel like lying and being manipulative is the only thing I’m good at...and I don’t really know what to do about that. I was raised in the church, so I have a very deep seated belief that lying is bad. So why am I so good at it? Is it wrong to put that skill to use? What if it is wrong and I shouldn’t do it, but it’s the only thing I’m good for?

TL;DR, I’ve realized that I’m really good at lying/being manipulative and I’m conflicted about it. I rarely feel guilty about it, but I know it’s considered “wrong” by society. I feel like it’s the only thing I’m good for so maybe I could put it to good use, but I’m worried about how it will damage my relationships with family and close friends if they ever found out.",13Oct2020,1

Here’s the thing. I have checked with the coordinator for my course at Uni and unfortunately cannot take classes around the work schedule, however, classes don’t start until February. I have decided I am going to accept the offer for Uni but am unsure if I should take the job offer (provided I do actually get it) knowing I’ll only be able to work full time until February, then having to either leave or maybe try to organise part time hours?

501,"Hey,

A little background: I'm 23 M and from South East Asia, working a corporate job and want to become an artist (pretty okay and traditional art, not digital). But since the methods I've tried for making money haven't panned out (freelancing, emailing craiglists listings, Guru.com, Fiverr) so I thought maybe high ticket affiliate marketing might have been a good enough way to sustain myself. But to get a good chance at that without an audience I need a tool to send emails. 

I'm scared about spending money online. $67 even, is a lot of money where I'm from, that I'm just not comfortable spending online. But I know it could be the best way to get on track so I can quit this job I hate.

507,"okay, so i am 15 years old, and in high school. I have this one birth deformity that caused my chest to essentially cave inward. for as long as i can remember, this has caused me to slightly struggle to breathe sometimes. Before my mom was smart enough to grow a brain to realize that i was deformed, i would tell her that I would struggle to breathe. She would just say to breathe through my mouth and leave it at that. Recently, i have noticed that i have been struggling to breathe much more than i used to. I am more than certain that it is this deformity. I have not told her of this yet because of what happened during the past three days. Two days ago, during a hockey game, i got slammed into the wall while fighting for the puck. It hurt like absolute hell, but i walked it off, assuming that i was fine. Then the day after the game, i was in the shower when i noticed a dent on my rib cage. The dent was right where my body impacted the wall. I assumed (and still do think) that i broke a rib. So, i went downstairs to my mom and showed her. She didn't even give it a second thought and said, ""look, it is the exact same on the other side"" (it absolutely was not, she just barely looked) and that was that. I went to bed but couldn't sleep as i know for a fact that something happened to my ribs during the game as that dent was not there before it. So, today i brought it up again and all she said was, ""well, if it doesn't hurt, then there is no need to worry"" What the actual fuck. That is not how anything fucking works and now I'm livid. Now I'm here. At my desk, on my computer, turning to Reddit because my mom wont listen to my medical concerns. how does the possibly broken rib tie in to the first story? well, as im writing this, I am kind on struggling to breathe. like, i cannot get a full breath in. I didn't tell her because i know she is just going to say some dumb ass excuse to make me breathe better. Oh yea, she used to be a nurse, so you would think that she would know how to handle this kind of shit, right?

TL,DR: ribs are deformed, have had trouble breathing my entire life, mom didnt listen. might have broken a rib recently, mom just blew it off twice. I am struggling to breathe again but I didnt tell her because i know she will blow that off too",13Oct2020,1
508,"I graduated two years ago with a bachelors in Communication Studies and PR. I chose those fields because I’m introverted and I figured the communications degree would break me out of my shell and I also like to write so I figured I’d do something with writing! 

I haven’t had the best of luck after graduation with jobs and now I am thinking about going to grad school for elementary education, school psychology or reading literacy (I’m pretty sure you need a teaching certification for it though). 

I’ve always thought about doing something with kids and I have some experience in the past. I guess I’ve always been scared to go for it since I’ve struggled in elementary school myself, and im an introverted person so I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to handle a classroom.

515,"So I’ve been waiting a car for a while now since I’ve started working, my job is an 1hr - 1hr 30 min away from home when taking public transportation but only 10-16 min away when driving, some mornings I would have to wake up extremely early (2-3am) just to make it in time for work (5-6am) and there’s days where I’m scheduled to leave late taking public transportation back home at 11pm-1am, mind you I live in NYC, it isn’t safe to be out at that time.

So I decided that I wanted a car and it would make my life easier, so I called up car leasing companies to start leasing a car but leasing a car doesn’t include insurance, I would have to add that on my own, only issue is, I’m only 19 years old, insurance for me goes up to $1000 - $1900 every MONTH. So I didn’t want to do that, instead I was going to finance a car then have my dad co-sign with me and so my insurance rate can drop lower, and I was going to be paying it all off with my own money I did a bunch of quotes and they were around $300-$600 which was a much better range for me

So I went to tell my dad about it and at first he made it sound like he was okay with it but literally 2 days before I was going to ask him to go to a dealership, he then tells me he has an issue with me getting a car.

He says that I’m not supposed to be working and making over $6,000 a year because of the fact that it will raise the rent bill and was basically saying that having a car will ruin everything for me, also stating that he put me as a dependent on his tax paper and that I could come off of it if I decided to work and make over $6,000 also stating that my financial aid for school will not be covered anymore because I’m working

But my thing is, he never said anything or never had an issue with me working until I brought up the car situation, and it sucks because I was planning on getting it without their help but it’s just insurance that’s forcing me to go to him, I was also planning on paying for everything and not letting him pay for a dime on the car

I’m very upset at the fact that he waiting literally 2 days before the day to go to the dealership, mind you I already paid a down payment for the car

What should I do?
Any suggestions to make my insurance lower?

522,"Some backstory for you. I met my girlfriend on Tinder late 2018 we were both attending college. About 2 hours apart, but her family lived near where I went to school. We very quickly fell in love and eventually she transferred to school near me. I did not ask her to do this she did this 100% on her own. I unfortunately, flunked out of college as my family can not help me much financially so I started working full time on top of going to school full time. This ultimately led me to miss classes and fail out. I’m not very well off, but my girlfriend’s family are REALLY well off. We come from opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum. After I flunked out I was passionate about chasing my dream still which was to be a police officer. I am incredibly passionate about it and really wanted to do it. Where I live after you are hired you have 5 years to get a degree. I have half of the credits necessary for a degree so my plan was to get a full-time job and apply to police departments in my area to get hired. I had about 4 interviews for various jobs lined up when my girlfriend’s dad offered me a position at his company. The pay was very minuscule and I really did not want it, but he promised to teach me a lot so I went ahead and took it. I busted my ass at this business for over a year and a half now. Really working hard and learning, but their have been multiple occasions where I feel in my heart I don’t want to do this job anymore. It’s not what I want to do for the rest of my life as I want something that is secure and has a retirement plan compared to the instability of a small business. The business has been around for almost 60 full years. There have been so many occasions I have mentioned I wanted to be a cop(all outside of work), but he has threatened to fire me if I even mention it. He is very much a guy who NEEDS to be in control. He wants her and I to run it one day and be this power couple. The owner definitely thinks he knows more than most people. So I stopped talking about it entirely. I even stopped talking with my girlfriend about it for a really long while, but with agencies hiring near me again recently. I had a talk with my girlfriend and I chose to apply again. She supports me, but I feel stuck. Her family has helped me immensely in life lessons and has taught me so much, but I really don’t want to be here anymore. There is a supervisor of mine here who is just an asshole. He has threatened to punch me in the face once when a customer wanted something quicker than anticipated. He constantly barrages me with any small human mistake. I treat him the same way I treat everyone else. With 100% kindness and respect, but that dude makes me hate my life at work. My girlfriends dad/owner loves this guy as he pushes everyone to not mess anything up, but I don’t think it’s worth it if he treats people like this. Whenever we have meetings he will call people out and throw underhanded comments. Maybe I’m just naive, but I believe there is two ways to approach a situation. A.) calmly and respectful to those around you. Handle the situation as a team and move on. B.) Yell and intimidate people to listen and make them feel small about how they are wrong. I have always tried my best to choose A. I applied to two different departments especially after this supervisor started treating people like this and I’m waiting for application review. I’m just nervous as if I do get the job I have no clue how I’m going to approach that situation. Nor how am I going to avoid the inevitable drama from my girlfriend’s dad.

526,"Hello guys, got a slightly weird question on my mind that I wanted to get some outside logic into. To start, some background.   

In recent years I have learned of current events going on in China and as such made personal commitments to boycott products and services coming from the country where feasible. I don't push this on anyone else and mostly keep it to myself. It's more recently picked up steam in the last year with the Blizzard Hearthstone HK debacle that.  

Now, how that is relevant to the topic at hand has to do with friend groups and such. There are naturally a lot of games and services that come out of China that are popular. And this is starting to cause some distress. When said groups of friends start playing new games and invite me, I end up personally mentioning that I can't play it because of such and such. This is becoming more frequent as of late and is leading to me kind of becoming the ""wet blanket"" in many cases. As previously mentioned, I don't push my views or decisions on other people, but it's still causing a lot of negative impact.  

So what I wanted to ask you guys is if my personal boycott here is silly and if it is something I should give up. Like, is it having an impact? Is it doing anything other than making myself feel better? Or am I just alienating myself for no real purpose.  

Sorry for the odd question and I hope you guys can help me sort my thoughts.",13Oct2020,1

547," 

Okay so I feel embarrassed talking about this since it's rather trivial in the scheme of things but it's been eating away at me all year. To give some back story, I have been a huge fan of heavy metal music since I was a teenager. I'm currently 36 and while I still love the music with a passion, but I've been fed up with the scene in my city for a while. I guess the main issue is that the scene seems to have a club mentality in the sense that if you aren't in a band and/or don't book shows you're looked at as some dumb fan that's only good for buying merch as I have seen band members in other settings around town and have attempted to initiate conversations with them only to look at me like I was scum.

I haven't ruled out the fact that maybe I'm taking things too personally and it could also be on me to put more effort into socializing. Admittedly I'm very introverted and unless I've been drinking or unless a band is actually playing it's difficult for me to initiate small talk. I've also said and done some pretty dumb stuff over the years but nothing too serious, mainly youthful ignorance.

I do have to admit there was an incident last year where I asked a girl out over Facebook and I took it upon myself to act like a douchebag when she said she wasn't interested. Nothing too serious, just telling the girl ""There's other babes out there, deuces!!!"" and after attempting to apologize to her the next day she screen shotted the conversation onto her wall and I received a hostile message from a girl in the scene who could rightly be called the scene police, but she laid into me about how disappointed she was that I did that and that she has ""destroyed careers"" and if I ever do something like that again she would see to it that I never got a date in this city again (like I need her help not getting a date, tbh).

Anyway she kept laying into me and eventually I told her enough was enough and what I did wasn't cool but at this point she's just bullying me. So as soon as I actually stand up for myself she blocks me only to message me hours later basically saying ""Sorry, but men are assholes"". She's also the former door person at one of the main local venues and when she's actually working we hardly interact other than I give her money and she gives me a wrist band but on nights she's there with her boyfriend and drinking there's been a time where she started screaming at me from across the venue while one of my friends was talking to me about another hobby I had taken on. While I feel I got what I deserved with the whole ""you'll never get a date in this city again"", I shouldn't have to take being screamed at while my friends were talking to me, especially after she indicated it was water under the bridge (unless it happened again, which it hasn't).

As easy as it is to pinpoint that incident on the general indifference I receive from the scene, I've had that treatment long before that occurred and with an upcoming Halloween heavy metal cover concert I know I'm gonna have fun hearing covers of some of my favorite metal songs but I've been asking myself why do I want to put myself in a position to be around people that frankly I don't like, and I'll be spending money for the privilege to boot.

I could go on and this post is already disjointed as it is but it's something that's been bothering me for a while. I don't know how many of you reading this are familiar with metal culture but they try to paint it as being about community and except when I was in my teen years I've never felt that sense of community. So I'm just trying to figure out if I'm an introverted douchebag that's envious of other people's popularity and success or if I'm just fed up being surrounded by emotionally stunted posturing douchebags.

Anyway, thanks for hearing me out.",13Oct2020,1

It doesn't seem like his parents do anything either.

His family is rich and some of his relatives live with him. He told me about the times that his relatives felt like they owned his things and owned the house. It might seem shallow but I know how much his things meant to him. Not because of the prices and how expensive they were, but because it was the only thing he could put himself into.

He has an Ipad. It was the only gadget he had. He uses it for everything like online school, music, reading, etc. His relatives deleted every single thing he had enjoyed and used to distract himself. And now it was taken from him. It wasn't my problem but I cried when he told me he lost the one thing that made him happy. He had always told me he had always felt like the world was against him.

553," Hi. I’m looking for advice on the following situation. Any insight/suggestions would be great.

Last summer (June 2019) my boyfriend took out 5 layers of floor in the main room in the middle of the house, which is probably around 350 square feet. One of these layers was linoleum with black mastic attached to corkboard. Above this layer was foam that lay beneath carpeting, which he used an ice scrapper to remove, which damaged the linoleum. He eventually took at all layers, with a few areas where the linoleum didn’t come up.

Last month I decided to test a piece of the linoleum that didn’t come up and it came back as 20% asbestos and the glue came back as 5%.

We had the few remaining pieces of linoleum professionally removed and had the floor vacuumed with a HEPA vac. We also had the air quality tested after removal and are in the clear.

My concern is that any fibers that were released are now in the radiator by the floor and were tracked on our shoes throughout the house and all over our things.

Even though the air quality was fine when they tested it, should I still be concerned about residual fibers that could possibly become airborne? I’ve read that asbestos can really stick to clothing and washing doesn’t necessarily do the trick. Again this is the center room of the house and we walked through it every day, multiple times a day. Luckily for this situation, we have no central air or duct units in the house.

I know there is a low amount of asbestos everywhere but I would rather not expose myself more than I need to, especially in the comfort of my own home.

I’m trying to think through next steps. What should I do? For peace of mind I want to hire a cleaning service to go through and clean the house and our things with a HEPA vacuum. These are the options that I know about:

A). I received a quote from Servpro for $2,000+ for a whole house deep clean and HEPA vacuum. This seems really expensive to me but if this is a real concern and will give me peace of mind I am willing to pay. However, I don’t want to be ripped off.

B). Hire a local cleaning woman who said it shouldn’t be more than $300. She has a rainbow HEPA vacuum but have no idea how good these are for asbestos clean-up.

C). Any other options I’m not considering?

Thank you!

555,"If you come from a country in which you are mature at 18 years old (for example legally allowed to drink etc) and then at 18 move to the US are you allowed to drink, go to job, live on your own?",13Oct2020,1
556,"Ok so let me provide some background information:

* I (M) has been known this family friend (F) since we were both 9
* We were very close as friends so we didn't feel as though we had to act around each other and our parents are like best friends
* We have always lived in different cities, despite this our families met up a lot
* We haven't met since last Christmas 
* We are both 17 now, almost 18 ( she is a couple days older than me)
* I always had underlying feelings for her 

As I mentioned before, I always liked her, I have never felt this way for someone before and my parents are against teenage relationships so I was too ignorant and scared to acknowledge these feelings until it was too late....

The reason why I say 'too late' is because  every time I saw her over the past 3 years the stronger my feelings were towards her ; at the same time I was going through this phase where I wanted to 'cut irrelevant people out of my life' (pretty stupid and arrogant I know). So what I did was - since like two years ago - every time I saw her I would mainly talk to her younger brother who I don't have anything in common with  (I don't even really care too much about him in the sense that he is barely a friend). And I got worse and worse by doing this to an extent where, last Christmas when our families met around each others houses on two different days, I basically avoided her and in hindsight I think I didn't just avoid her because I am an arrogant prick but also because I felt really shy being around someone I like so much.  

Jumping to around the beginning of September this year, despite not seeing her for like 9 months and avoiding her before that, I somehow made this crazy delusion up that we definitely *haven't* completely lost touch with each other and that I should **totally** ask her out. So I did it! In the most outrageously, ridiculously, senseless way possible. What I did was out of nowhere, from 9 months of radio silence and like 2 years of being weird as fuck, I popped up to her on snapchat (which I almost never used to do as we talked in person a lot) and I had this 20 minute shitty conversation - stretched over 2 hours because I was on a train and didn't always have signal - that consisted of really basic questions like ""how is college"" and ""what are your subjects like"" and then I just dropped *it* out of nowhere. I just blurted out over snapchat ""I feel like we should talk more and meet up"", she opened it... left it on read for 1 minute... typed.. stopped typing... and then finally ""\[REASONABLE EXCUSE ABOUT HAVING TO TAKE CARE OF FAMILY WHILST PARENTS WORK\]"". After reading her response my mind was all over the place theorising why she basically said ""no"". I responded with ""ok no worries"" and she said "" yeah  🙂"" , I waited a bit and then I reiterated about talking more and she said ""sure will do"" and that was that. 

It would be two weeks before I snap her again but during those two weeks I did something random, although I don't cringe at it I still think it was a bit strange, I added her to my private story where I post random stuff that she can't even snapback to as she has no idea what I am even talking about/ wouldn't care that much.

Anyways, this is the worst part and I still get paralyzed from cringe every time my brain reminds me of this: two weeks after that disastrous conversation I randomly snapped a selfie saying ""hi"" at like 9pm, she responded at 11:30pm or something and I responded like 18 minutes later because I was in the middle of an Among Us game, she said ""hi 😂"" as a blue text despite me snapping her.  What I said next is pure unadulterated cringe and I don't know what I was thinking: I snapped a quick selfie with me smiling and said  ""aww are you too shy too shy to show your face🥺"" and underneath ""btw when does your school start again?""  (I AM FUCKING 17 AND SENDING SHIT LIKE THIS WTFFFFF I LITERALLY WINCED WHEN TYPING THIS OUT AGAIN).

I haven't spoken to her since then, which was around 3-4 weeks ago, but ever since then I feel this overwhelming sense of pain, shame and envy every time I even see her name on snapchat like when she posts something.

 And the reason why I am posting this here is 1. To get this off my chest and 2. I really need help advice about what to do next, I need an outside perspective as clearly I do not know how to handle this and I don't want to do something reckless again.

Additionally, this has been eating me up from the inside I am very miserable right now, every time  think of what happened I feel so much pain and I have been thinking about it everyday, I am planning to confess all of this to her the next time I see her ( not sure when however, because of corona) and I need to know if that is even a good idea.

I would mainly like to see comments about assessing me as a person from what I said, this story I just told you, whether or not I over thought the deepness of our friendship/delusion about asking her out and some advice I asked for in the above paragraph, however anything helps.

&amp;#x200B;

p.s. I didn't know where this piece of information fits there so I will mention it here: for the past 6 months I would occasionally go on her Instagram and basically masturbate to her pictures, as I felt really bad for this I deleted my Instagram as her account is private, but I seemed to have developed an unhealthy obsession with her and this took over so I found her on her friends tik tok and repeated what I did. I also am only just coming out of this misogynistic, insecure mindset I had about female sexuality and when I found her tik tok I saw that half of who she follows are these hot men (thirst traps) and this got me extremely jealous so when I was horny I convinced myself she was a *sexist slur used against women* who would post things on the internet and masturbate to that fantasy.  But let me say this before you judge me ( which I definitely deserve) , despite the fact that I am extremely hurt that she has no interest in me - even though I had this coming- I would like to say that this experience has been humbling and I am working very hard to have a more positive mindset on sex and relationships, and I won't be such an idiot next time (hopefully).

557,"I (17m) am at a strange point in my life. I have became uninterested in sharing what I want to talk about with people or jokes i find funny, I used to be the most outgoing extrovert and it seemed like everyone cared about my opinion, but over the past 2 years it seems like no one even cares about me anymore. 

Let me give some examples from people who say i dont speak and should open up: 
my girlfriend has a lot of problems and complainins a lot, anytime i do the same it instantly becomes her conversation. 
My best friend puts down everything i say. if i moan, he has it worse. If i feel proud about something, he’s done it but better or thinks its stupid. 
My mum can’t even respond to my replies in conversation, dismissing it so she can carry on with her gossip. Everyone at school has just kinda gone off me and whenever i speak in a group i can barely finish a sentence before they interrupt or change subject. This is what makes me think its a problem with me and not these people as i seem to be the common factor here. 

I try being such a nice person and act interested but then its my turn to talk and it lasts about ten seconds. I DONT stutter and i believe I’m the same person i was before this, the only thing i can think is that it slowly made me depressed and now im stuck in a slump because i dont have the motivation to say anything as it wont get heard and no one even tried to listen because they dont think i ‘like’ talking. 

I know you don’t know me so you may think im an asshole and tbh im not sure? Maybe im annoying, maybe i come a cross as judgemental, i really dont see why i would as i honestly try to relate to people and make them feel happy. I notice this just leads to me getting the piss taken out of me because thats how most people my age interact with each other, im a pretty sarcy person and usually take the piss back but it seems they just get offended and say things like “alright calm down i was just joking” but I’m just carrying on the joke. I really want to feel like i matter again but i dont know how to achieve it. 

Should i be a conversation hogging asshole and demand respect? 
Should i carry on being nice in the hope they will eventually learn to listen to me?

558,"  Hello Everyone!

I’m on mobile so deal with it!

So to start off. I live in a house and my neighbors  house is facing a different direction than mine is.

So my neighbors back yard runs along the side of my house.

Said neighbor has a Cement weight set. 

If you’re unaware of what I’m referring to let me briefly explain.  A cement weight is made by pouring fresh cement into a plastic mold. Them left to dry. Each mold varies in size thus varying in weight.

So my neighbor does his work out at around 6 am!

Should be no problem!

Except the way this person does their work out, it makes for a very noisy event.

Let me explain what the issue is:

There is a loud thud sound that resonates through the ground. Every time this person let’s go of the weights. It’s like they let the weights fall letting gravity take over. Not a great use of the weight if you’re letting it fall instead of guiding it down slowly!

So this has been going on for Months now. 

It started worth the pandemic. 

At first we thought it was construction of some sort like breaking of a cement slab with a sledge hammer. But as the weeks passed and the sounds remained identical. I found myself at the conclusion that is was a work out routine. 

I feel sorry for anyone who may have a newborn baby near by. 

This person is just oblivious to the amount of noise he is making. 

I’m ready to buy them a set of work out bands!!

Any Advice short of actually going to said neighbors for a neighborly talk. 

Which we can all imagine how that will go. 

To top it off. This neighbor of mine has 2 or 3 small campers whom they rent out and one of the renters is the person working out.

It’s all kinds of fucked up! 

After his 1 hour work out, my head is still feeling the thuds.",13Oct2020,1
559,"I am 16 years old and still live with my parents and my older sister. I feel very distant to my family. It's not a recent development because of puperty... It has ALWAYS been like that. Since I can remember. 

My family and I all have really fun personalities. We are very open and like to fool around. When I am with friends or new people that side is very dominant. But when I am home I am silent, I don't joke much and I am distant.
This is hard to admit, but I am just not interested in talking to my parents. Like I said, they are generally quite fun, but if you have to listen to them every day they get boring and repetitive. 

They talk about the same things every single day. There are rarely new conversations. If someone tells a story about their day it's technically a new story, but the kind of storytelling etc is the same and it makes it so uninteresting. 
I often catch myself not listening AT ALL and just daydreaming or getting lost in unrelated thoughts. If an interesting topic comes up, I really enjoy it and engage in the conversation, but it doesn't happen to often. 

My parents have been toxic in the past, so I don't really like to tell them about my day out of fear of being called names or getting in trouble for not reacting 'right' in a normal situation. 
I really like discussing and debating and it catches my interest in the conversation, but my mom cant take criticism or accept other people's opinions. We always start to fight. 

If im actually engaging in a conversation it's never a funny situation tho. When I am with friends I am making a joke out of everything and am always laughing and I can talk and joke about the stupidest things. I am always quite serious when with my family. Seeing me actually laugh is a rarety.

This sounds bad, but I do enjoy just sitting with them and spending time with them. I do like them, but I don't like the person I am when I am with them. I WANT to be interested and fun, but there's a blockade in my head. The way I act probably also makes them act differently, so no one is being funny. 

I don't know what to do, they love me, but I know that they don't like me. My sister and my mother have a much closer relationship. When I am with my sister and her boyfriend I am like I am with my friends. What can I do to stop this? I feel like we don't have that much in common, so is it even possible to have a good relationship?",13Oct2020,1

562,"Quick reference I’m an Australian in my early 20’s. the dress beautiful but I haven’t worn it since graduation and I’m currently a student at university saving every penny I can, so I decided to list my dress on a few platforms, including eBay. I had finally gotten a buyer (at a much lower price than I wanted) but I still took it. We emailed back and forth organising postage and payment. Seemed genuine enough. I even went to the effort of getting a thank you card and some pretty pink gift wrap to post it to the buyer (Nancy). I had set up payment via PayPal. Anyway sorry - I was emailed through a verification of funds transferred (which while I was doing 10 things at once looked very believable) and sent it via post straight away. Half hour goes by and I’m having trouble actually viewing “pending” funds and have not had a message back from the buyer. Yes I realised right had been scammed. I go back through everything and realise a toddler could have spotted the fake “email confirmation”. I feel so embarrassed. I have contacted both Australia Post and PayPal but I’m still not sure what else to do. And it’s 2am is Australia so I have to wait until morning for responses. But I’m freaking out in the mean time.

I’ve known him for like 10-11 ish years?Lately, we’ve both been getting into petty arguments lately. They’re about all sorts of stupid things, but what I’ll mainly go over is the majority of the time. Basically we’ll be playing super smash bros ultimate, and I’ll beat him or kill him. Doesn’t matter. No matter what I do he constantly complains about everything. “I hate this, I hate that. I hate when you do this, I hate when you do that”. Now because it’s been all the time I’ve gotten a tad snappy, okay, my bad. I’ll offer to switch what I’m doing, change what I’m doing, or defend what I’m doing to try and fix the problem. From my point of view: if you complain about something, you want it to change in some way. Instead, he gets pissed at me for being overly defensive and obsessive. All I’m trying to do is mitigate the problem you’re having so that we can vibe. Why would you just senselessly complain about something, yet still want it to persist? I don’t understand. This happens all the time lately with all sorts of things, this is just where it happens more often. Am I the asshole here? Thanks in advance",13Oct2020,1

574,"I'm a 21 almost 22 female who lives with her grandparents, mom is in the picture but is rarely around. I've lived with my grandparents for practically my whole life minus 2 years (I lived on a campus of 2 different Job Corps, loved those years) and most of my life with them was happy from my point.. Aside from being bullied due to my ADHD and Aspergers.

 But when we moved to the country quite a ways from the town things changed.. I didn't want to go outside as much since there wasn't a lot to do and there were wood ticks and all kinds of things I wasn't a big fan of outside, and my grandparents didn't want me going away since wild animals.. And unfortunately I couldn't invite any of the rare friends I'd have, over since we lived so far away. I was pretty much isolated. So I got more into video games and anything online for entertainment and.. I gained weight. Fast. I would usually eat out of boredom or stress from school, and at first it wasn't a big deal. Then I'd get poor grades in middle school which I started after we moved, and I'd constantly get yelled at for having poor grades and my grandma would constantly say ""I never got a F in school because I chose not to, you have no excuses for your bad grades"" I literally had a learning disability.. And with that stress I'd eat more and get bigger, then the body shaming started. I'd be told ""No boy likes fat girls, you'll never get a boyfriend"" all the time, and if I got a new shirt and I'd show my grandpa after putting it on, every single time he would say ""Your tummy is sticking out a bit"". Yeah grandpa, thanks for telling me that for the hundredth time, the fat shaming continues to this day also and I'm desperate for losing weight. Later on I stopped going to church (the church was full of many people who'd judge you for literally opening a door, which happened to me so I disliked it there) and then my grandpa would go at me for ""Not being a good Christian girl"" yes I am Christian, however I am a extremely chill one, I do pray occasionally, but I do cuss (they do not know) and watch things that wouldn't be considered ""Christian friendly"" like Hazbin Hotel. Anyway, this always goes on and every Sunday I'd try to just hide in my room and hope and pray my grandpa doesn't drag me out to watch a lecture- I mean preach on TV. Because I know I'll get yelled at about my attitude. Every day I'd get yelled at by them about something, even petty things. Things got pretty tense when I first got a boyfriend... That's a story all in itself..

Now I graduated High School (I didn't go to the graduation which upset my grandparents), and I went to Job Corps for two years, those were the best years of my life. I made friends, I got more social skills and I felt happy, sure there were some bumps but it felt great to sorta be on my own. I'd visit home every now and then, but I noticed something every time I would go home, the chores I'd have to do seem to have never been done (mostly dusting and vacuuming), but the first time I went home for a visit, I was excited to see my pet dog and my pet bird... But when I asked how they were doing, they became quiet. I asked them what was up and they told me that my bird escaped and flew away. ""How did he fly away if he was in the house?"" and my grandma said ""Your grandpa took his cage outside and was going to clean the water, but it snagged and fell down, it spooked the bird and he flew out.""..... Funny thing is that.... I have REPEATEDLY told them to NOT PUT THE CAGE OUTSIDE. But I was just a kid in their eyes and did not listen to me, it's been 3 years since it happened and grandma still tries to convince me that the bird will come back, he probably is just in another state, no way, he's definitely dead... I miss my bird so much, I hope he didn't suffer. But the funny thing is, they kept the whole thing a secret, they did not tell me about it for 3 weeks. THREE WEEKS. They never told me why they didn't give me the news sooner. It ruined my whole visit, I cried the whole 2 hour trip home. RIP Kira, RIP. (a good thing that came from Job Corps is that I'm now dating a guy online, who's been chatting with me since my freshman year of high school, he's the best man ever.. And yes he is legit lol) 

I finished my time at Job Corps after getting a job that.. Was a total sham (long story), I just stayed at my grandparents since I had nowhere else to go, and I'd just try to relax mostly.. Then the pandemic started. I'd often get to stay home alone since my grandpa worked and my grandma would go to the church to make masks.. I'd still be body shamed even though I would exercise and try to not eat so much (my exercise bike broke so I don't have that anymore unfortunately), and she'd always make me do chores around the house while she's gone and normally it would take a while to finish and I'd barely get time to myself.. Petty I know but when you barely get time alone you wanna savor it. And if things weren't done the way my grandma wants, she'd start to yell at me, and I would talk back to try and defend myself and she'd tell me how ungrateful I am and I cannot talk back to her.. Basically talking to me like I'm a child. Now recently I finally got a job that pays 13 dollars an hour. The hours aren't quite set so my pay is different every week, I also just got my license and I use my grandparents car to go to work (I don't want the financial stress of having a car, but I do pay for gas of the car), before I got my license I was afraid to drive, but my grandparents would often say ""if you had your license you'd be able to just take the car and go to town whenever you wanted"", but after I started to use the car they wouldn't allow me to use it to go places on my day off. I ask them why can't I go places? And I'm told by my grandma ""If you want to go places you need to go early before you go to work, or go somewhere after you get off work"" which I also started to do.. Now my grandma is demanding to know my schedule so she knows when I have to go to work so I don't try to leave early..... I just feel like I am on a leash and she keeps tightening it. I am nearly 22 and my grandparents bodyshame me, treat me like I have no logic or need for interests outside of work (unless it's /their/ interests), they constantly go on like  ""she's in her own fictional world and she needs to grow up"". Growing up they'd compare me to my mother, who was a bad girl type, she'd do drugs, skip school, smoke cigarettes, run away, sleep around, drink, etc, she also dropped out of school. I graduated, don't like alcohol (tried some when I turned 21), don't like cigarettes, never skipped class, I'm punctual, I'm.. The opposite of someone who sleeps around, always followed the rules (one's that are logical anyway), and I actually graduated from high school and Job Corps (twice). They don't see that though, they just see a girl who loves stuff online and is a weirdo, is also fat and is a bit unsocial. I can't talk nicely to them anymore because I have absolutely no patience left for them anymore, I know I need to work on it but I'm mentally exhausted from their abuse.. And they don't see what they're doing as abuse. When I try to sleep at night I can hear my grandma yelling at me, even though I know she is asleep.. I also have mini panic attacks that my grandma will come bursting into my room and start yelling at me for something (happened a few nights ago and I couldn't sleep at all afterwards), I have nightmares every night about them..

But maybe I'm just overreacting and need to be better, suck it up and take their criticism..
Am I overreacting? Or is this actually abuse?",13Oct2020,1

581,"Okay, my friend got into a terrible accident with a fatality. They were driving after drinking on the highway and two different vehicles were street racing on it too. Well something happened(not sure of all the accident details) and it ended up being a pile-up with a motorcycle fatality. It's terrible. I feel so bad for my friend who is a good-hearted person and would never mean any of this. They fucked up, bad. It's worse because my friend had prior arrests for drinking while intoxicated. It's not good like I said, they do deserve time. It's not really clear how the accident happened. An article online says the drunk driver ran a red light but all the pictures are in the middle of the highway. I'm not defending being drunk and driving, the situation is sickening. This is my friend though, I've known them for almost fifteen years. 

Now to the point of why I am pissed. A mutual friend of ours posted on FB a link to one of the articles and say verbatim, 

'I hope [they] get life in prison . This is not [their] first DUI either . DONT DRINK And DRIVE!!!'

Sigh, I get it. My friend has fucked up - royally. It makes me sad for them because I know it was not intentional and my friend is probably feeling so bad. It was an accident. I'm really pissed by this mutual friend who while simultaneously friends with my friend is also just throwing them under the bus :/ what sucks is the person who wrote the post is not even that good of a person. I don't want to talk shit but when you abandon a kid for drugs and alcohol who tf are you to judge? People make mistakes. 

I guess if you want to give me advice that would be cool... I'm on the verge of dropping this person indefinitely over this.  I guess I just want to defend my friend who I've known for years but I realize they fucked up and will receive backlash. It's just disappointing to see a mutual 'friend' act so low towards my friend.

585,"Hi there. I have a question for childcare workers. 

I’m a first time parent and my husband and I have been sending our now 13 month old to a woman who has a son a few months younger and takes care of one other toddler from her home.

Last week, the parent of the toddler brought her child over and the child was displaying symptoms of sneezing, etc but she said it was just allergies so the childcare worker took her.

Well the child did NOT have allergies and ended up getting my baby sick, my husband and I got sick, the childcare worker’s baby got sick and so did the childcare worker and HER husband.

As a result, we have not had childcare for 2 weeks due to not only keeping our baby home until she’s better but also giving time to the childcare worker and HER family getting better.

My question is this: we paid up front an entire month of childcare only to have half of that month wasted to this sickness — what’s the typical protocol for a situation like this? Should we ask for our money back? Should we ask for it to be rolled over?

I asked her to please come up with a policy for illnesses and she has from this point going forward

589,"Long story short, I cut my dad off about 4 years ago for making my teenage years hell. Name calling, body shaming, manipulation and just overall general bullying and I never want to have to spend more time with him than I have to. The only times I speak to him now is when it concerns my grandparents.

But earlier today, I got a call from him asking if I wanted to do anything with him for my birthday. If I said no, he’d get offended, tell my grandparents and I’ll have to argue with them which is something I really don’t want to do given that my grandad’s health is declining and I don’t want to cause him or my nana more grief. 

So I said maybe in the hopes of eventually coming up with an excuse or finding a more painless way to tell him no. I did, however, agree to go out with him for my grandad’s birthday because it’s more of a favour to him instead and it’s looking unlikely that he will live to see his birthday next year. 

My mum made it clear that she understands my position and why I hold this unloveable grudge because she experienced the same things while her and my dad were married. But she doesn’t seem to understand why I won’t give dad the satisfaction of spending a couple of hours with him and take birthday money from him. 

She says that because he’s trying to rekindle a relationship with me and that I took birthday money from him in the past, that he deserves my time. That the least I could do would be to give him a chance simply because he asked nicely. 

I reminded her that I gave him more than enough chances to treat me like a human being for the best part of a decade when I was still in constant with him. I went to dinner with him, I stayed over at his house, I went on vacations with him, but all he ever did was was treat me like shit. I’ve had enough and refuse to be sucked back into his cat and mouse game of manipulation. 

But mum just won’t hear it. “You don’t have to be his best friend, but it won’t hurt to spend an afternoon with him a couple of times a year.” She says. 

Is there any way I can better communicate to her that I’m sick of being the bigger person and that he doesn’t deserve any of my time?",13Oct2020,1
590,"I just finished my undergraduate degree in the midwest at a school in the middle of nowhere, where I was so depressed and trapped. I was so unhappy that when covid happened I gladly took the opportunity to finish courses from home and not in Indiana. Through my senior year I applied to graduate schools and am now in the first year of a program in California. I have spent so long looking forward to finally being around people that would be more like me as I had an unideal time being queer in Indiana for my undergrad. 

But I have anxiety and am introverted, so it is hard enough for me to make new friends, without considering the fact that there is a pandemic and I'm trapped in one 10'x15' room since no classes are in person and I am in a completely new environment. 

All things considered though, I thought I was ready for that. I was so excited to forge my new life when I moved here a month ago. 

But it is harder than I was ever prepared for. I go days in a row without seeing a real human being through anything other than a computer screen. It's sunny all the time and that should make me happy, but everyone I know is getting fall weather and my jealousy of that is only making me that much more homesick. Then there's my course work which is incredibly more difficult than my undergrad and I am so overwhelmed and stressed that I only eat one meal a day and that is because I force myself to eat something. 

Last week, my sister's partner was having mental health issues that left me inclined to go home and support my sister. But I worked with her through that and resolved to stay. Or so I thought. 

On Sunday my aunt passed away suddenly and it is making me so aware of how far from home and alone I am here. I have tried to be less alone but I am not succeeding, being so new and not having routes to meet people that I can handle as someone with crippling social anxiety. 

All signs point to me going home. Not forever, just the last four weeks of the quarter, then I an return in January. All of my meetings are online so really nothing would change. The two hour time difference would be inconvenient sure, but manageable. And I would probably have an easier time being productive (staying with my sister who works regular hours) and honestly just eating. But I can't help this nervous feeling in my stomach. I don’t know if it's cause finishing the quarter from home feels like quitting, or like I may be disappointing people (parents and professors),or maybe I'm afraid of seeming immature to my peers for leaving campus, but I simply cannot shake this feeling.

I just want to do what will make me happy and I don’t know what that is. How do I act when I think I want to go home but also feel like it is the wrong choice?",13Oct2020,1

I knew he was gonna say that cuz he says everything I do is weird. He came at me saying it’s not weird, I’m just weird. So I snapped at him (btw we argue all the time so this is another regular argument) saying don’t make me say all the weird things he did.
Long story short he said he didn’t wanna be fined anymore. Then we talked some more, he changed it saying he thinks we shouldn’t be friend RIGHT NOW. And maybe another time we can start fresh. I stated I thought he was acting like this cuz he didn’t wanna he friends but he says he just wants to take a break

I don’t get how he went from saying he didn’t wanna be friends to we shouldn’t be friends rn to maybe another time we can start fresh  to he wants a break. I thought he just said he didn’t wanna be friends. He did say he will delete the chat and hit me up tho..does that mean we will talk again?
This argument was just another regular argument but he told me before he ended the friendship before cuz we kept arguing...now this might be it.",13Oct2020,1

I’m not sure why but I was pretty upset. I went back in my head and thought of times where we were fighting and called each other dumb or stupid. Or even when we have talked like that in a joking context (I think most people who have siblings can relate). I don’t want her to look back and think I was trying to be hurtful. 

I contacted my sister last night and she didn’t seem too bothered by it, she wasn’t crying or anything. She was actually mostly making jokes. I’m not sure if this is just her initial reaction and she’ll be upset later, or if she’s actually ok. I really hope that she is ok and feels like she has some answers.

605,"Hi guys..  


I'm 28. I live at home. I work retail.

I'm pretty much scared, desperate and trying to figure out things while dealing with some GAD which make things even worse; but anyway, I'm trying to figure out how to move out of my family home and/or pursue some kind of different career.   


I'll give you the run down.  


My family, specifically my mother and middle sister\[\[Lets call her P\]\] (oldest is moved out,) have always been controlling and P is very vicious verbally. I literally cannot talk to P anymore, especially if its asking a question. (I.E, did you wash/can you wash the dishes?) Asking a question is like poking lava whilst standing in it.  


I work in a smaller big box store (Its a 6 Bil. company tho) make $13.80. I'm a manager technically but I'd say in regular stores I'd be a ""supervisor.""   


I have..Absolutely no idea what career path to even go forward on. I have no degree, school is where I discovered my severe adhd and anxiety. I also started college at 17, I think it was too early. I'm unable to really go forward towards a degree due to money, but at the same time, I'm trying to move the F out of my emotionally/verbally/mentally horrible home.   


Don't get me wrong, I love my house, my fam has given me many privileges and we are not lower class; def a weird middle. I appreciate them for letting me stay for this long (We moved here when I was 3) even in my late twenties.  
I just, need to find my own way and I cannot convince...Anyone in my family that its a good idea to go ahead and throw myself into an apartment with my friends aka roommates. I know how big and hard of a step it'll be, I know it can get harder but my family clearly have no trust in the fact that I could do it even on the pay I'm on.   


My experience is literally animals. I've never been without animals my whole life and did lots of rescue work, behavior/body language studies on dogs and cats..so on and so forth; but theres certain things I know won't work for me.   


I cant do surgeries..Not a vet. Its not the blood, its the scalpel.

I'm no good at training dogs. I'm too passive with customers/clients.  
I'm not a great manager, but I do try my f-ing hardest to do what I do.  


I'd prob be a shitty groomer, I cant stand anal glands and I'm again, no good with customers.

I just, have absolutely no idea what to go forward in. I love my job, even if it is retail. I really enjoy telling people about the animals in the store, learning about said animals and then just--its nice to have customers to come up to you and you already have something you both have in common, the love of having pets!  


At this point I've no idea what to do. I'm both desperate to get out of my family home but at the same time I'm clinging here. 

I'm basically lost and my anxiety fuels my overthinking adhd brain which kind of fuels my depression.",13Oct2020,1

I was looking forward to focusing completely on myself for once and working towards my own goals. 

And then I met someone... totally by accident. I wasn’t looking for anyone at all. We’ve hung out a few times as friends (I made that very clear) and I didn’t expect us to hit it off like we did. Now, he’s asked me on a “real date” and I have no idea what to do.

this boyfriend has been physically and emotionally abusive to her for what seems like most of their relationship and we have tried our best to get her out but she will not listen and our advice is wasted. they have explosive arguments where he is very loud and violent. 
our main issue with this is, as he failed his previous year of university he is only in two days a week as he is resitting that year part time (not sure of the technicalities of it but i know he has university two days a week - monday/wednesday). he decided NOT to get accommodation and just to commute to our city and get air b&amp;bs for the two nights but this has not been happening - he has been staying in our house.
we are staying in our house which we pay rent for and we agreed as a group and told E that he could stay here one night a week. he has been here for four nights now, we have told E we want him out but i'm not sure if she's not telling him because she's scared or what - but we want him out.
we discovered mid last year that he carries a knife for self defence and he has been very aggressive with us girls before when we have politely asked him to stop smoking indoors and when we have been playing music IN OUR OWN HOUSE!!. he doesn't pay any rent, none of us want him here but we are all too scared to approach him incase of getting hurt by him, we do not feel safe in our own house- and we certainly to not want him alone in our house either.
shall i call the police as a precaution? how do we go about this? we have tried speaking to E but nothing is happening so either she's not telling him as to not upset him if he is ignoring our requests and no one wants to deal with him directly.
we have told E we will always support her and love her, but we will not support him, it isn't our fault he didn't get accommodation sorted - why can't he live with friends? aside from the fact he is vulgar, smokes indoors, swears loudly infront of our neighbours who have young children and the fact he treats E so badly - it is mainly because we don't feel safe in our own house.

Right now i’m (M 19yo) and in 3rd year of med school, but through out all my life, i have lied to my family and others that i’m ok, and didn’t tell them about being bullied everyday and getting sexually abused at school, and living everyday with that lie, and the problems that arose because of it, i feel more and more like shit, by the problems i basically mean the fact that my personality and my ability to defend my self got weaker and weaker, and i’ve let many chances through out my life be wasted because i’m not the kid i wanted to be, and the kid that my family wanted me to be, so i just wasted my life on devices, and would get back from school saying everything is alright, while actually being mad and sad all the time, and would lash out on my supportive family, my mother loves me, also does my siblings and father, but the more i lie about being great, and sometimes getting mad at them, the more i blame myself because i know its all my fault , that i haven’t tried to fix my bullying problems, and i know that i’m a good student, but when i get sad and mad and feel very unsafe at school, so i basically started to lose grades, and seeing myself go down this hill each day and fail more each day, kills me on the inside and makes me feel so guilty about everything in my life.

My dog was recently diagnosed with a grade 3 (out of 4, 4 being the worst) luxating patella. In essence her kneecap pops out of place, and is difficult to go back into place. Our vet said the only realistic option was surgery. 

The problem is, I’m in college and already working to be able to pay my main bills so this was an unexpected extra cost. (Also rehoming/surrendering her isn’t a viable option in my opinion as I can afford all the rest of her care, this was just an extra unexpected issue) I have already determined what amount I’d be able to put down should I be able to finance her surgery, and I created a Gofundme to raise some extra money. I’ve even called around my area to find a place where it would be cheaper than the place my vet recommended, I’m not sure if those places finance through care credit or not though. I do plan on asking when we have a consultation with them where they will tell us a more specific price we’d be looking at paying. 

I have also looked into pet assistance funds, but am unable to apply at the moment due to not having a specific price or vet who will do the surgery.

I am not really sure where to start and I feel horrible for even thinking this.  I have been with my husband for 13 years we have a good marriage, he is a good man. I stay home with the kids, and he works a lot that's not the problem here.

The problem here is that 5 years ago he had his only parent pass away, very suddenly very tragically and since then he's changed. Since then I've become a caregiver to my children and also my husband. 

He works hard, hes still a good man, he's still a good dad but I miss the lightness, the fun, I miss being able to let go and enjoy. 

There was a time he was the one I enjoy things with but now I feel like he just can't enjoy anything. He promised to start therapy which he did, unfortunately therapist retired and he has yet to find another one. He was told about this at th3 end of July.

He has had a few issues with alcohol over the last 5 years, like drinking and freaking out at me, being mean to me, saying things that are awful I know that it came from being depressed and angry so drinking allowed him to release that and unfortunately I was the only person to release it to.

He had a drug history growing up so all of his friends who he grew up with are no longer his friends as he changed his life, but now he has no friends and I get made to feel guilty because I spend time with my friends enjoy myself. 

Lately I've been thinking about going to a bar, find a man I could hook up with like not sex but just make out, enjoy my time I know it's still cheating but just something. My husband is very attracted to me, I am very attracted to my husband but this marriage is just not fulfilling me in some way. Maybe that's me maybe I will never be fulfilled I have my own issues from childhood lot of issues of abandonment abuse and addiction through my dad. I don't know what I need, or what I am looking for I am sure you all say I'm awful but I know I'm being awful which is why I am here I just don't know why I feel the way I do.

I cant bring this up as hes already insecure and slightly possessive.

Has anybody ever been through something like this that could explain why I would feel this way or is it pretty much just all the reasons I said.

I'm scared I'll do something that will jeopardise my entire family not to mention I'm his sole level of support and if something happened to our marriage. I dont know what would happen to him, and I never want my daughters without their father because my father was such a mess.

624,"So I started my bachelors (writing my thesis) a while ago. Before that we have to do an obligatory 6-week module for which you need to write a protocol (or something similar) about what you did. I picked bioinformatics (as a biochemistry student). He gave me the best grade possible (1.0) on that protocol (which was neurobiology related). I did not do any real research in a lab but rather a summary of a specific topic. The problem already started during this time. The first week I managed to stay productive but after a while I just could not get myself to write or research anything. Only until week 4 I managed to get a grip again and started writing something. As I already mentioned, I got lucky and he still graded me with a 1.0 (which I definitely did not deserve in my opinion but I kept my mouth shut). After these 6 weeks I took a short break and we met again to discuss the topic of my thesis. The topic itself is ""current research and model of memory"" (not the final title). So I have to write about the most complex thing in the known universe. The same things happened again. I started with a productive week and managed to slip into a state of complete procrastination. I am sitting at home all day and just can't get myself to read or write anything. 

There are a lot of issues with my topic and one of the the major problems is the fact that there is not a single person/team/institute that actually knowns how the brain actually works. Not even a real theory, just guesses. And I could read as many papers as I'd like it would just be more mysterious the more I read. No matter how much effort I'd but in my thesis wouldn't even scratch the surface of it. That demotivates me so much it almost makes me crazy. 

There were days in my past (last years of school and first years of university) where I had a fire burning inside of me thinking I can achieve anything. I just had to focus and my motivation would skyrocket into outer space. As if I could do anything I'd want. But right now it is just the complete opposite and I don't know how to change that.

If I could I would take a break from everything and just go to work for a few months (which I can't because the thesis already started). I don't know how to get out of this state of mind that I developed and I don't know why it happened either. Maybe it is because of the last years and how my left turned 180°. I was a really lonely person with no friends whatsoever and no perspective on doing anything at all. Having no education and only shitty jobs. Just until when I became \~21 years old my life turned around by randomly applying to evening school. It took me 1 year to get my qualification for A level and 3 more years to actually get the A-level (with more or less good grades). Did apply for university (far away from home) for biochemistry, got the spot and started studying 2 months later. So my life turned around extremely in just a few years. In those years of school I've become more and more confident with myself and finally had perspective and was just so happy that I could get a nice paid job once (unlike my family that migrated to Germany when I was half a year old) living in poverty for more than a decade. I always had enormous respect for people that studied and even more so for people with a PhD (which I more or less lost since I now know how academics work) and would have never even dreamed of studying myself. So with that kind of backstory/past, shouldn't I be extremely proud and happy of what I have achieved? From 0 to ""something"" in just a few years. 

And now that I am so close to finishing my bachelors, I am about to give up. It would only take me a few more months, not even 3 more months. But all I do is sitting at home, going to the gym once in a while, working like twice a week, sitting all day in front of my screen trying to get myself to start but instead try to sabotage myself by playing games or watching videos. I have hundreds of hours which is more than enough to write a thesis but I don't use them. 

And now my prof (who graded my previous work) is expecting a finished work from me (or close to finished). I already told him I'm having a hard time but that is sooo understated. He mentioned the topic I work on is tough and he would bear that in mind when grading, but still. I wish I could just tell him that I need to take a break for a few months and just empty my mind and not think about the stress that it is giving me. Just have a normal life for once (again), focus on things like sport and traveling (which I didn't do for over 4 years now) or just taking a break and earn some money, buy myself some things instead of always watching all my income go down the drain for rent and food and other fixed costs.

I wish I'd knew how to proceed here. Maybe someone does or had similar experiences. I guess trying it on reddit won't hurt.",13Oct2020,1

628,"Probably the easiest/dumbest question to be asked on here but figured I would inquire anyways.

To put a long story short, I sold a PS4 locally through OfferUp, but prior to the sale I purchased a game for myself and mistakenly placed it in the box I gave to the person I sold the system to. My system included 3 games in the bundle. When I got home I noticed the game I bought for myself was missing and realized I mistakenly placed it in the box I gave the buyer. I asked the buyer if I could meet them to retrieve my game but they told me they did not have it. Knowing this was a blatant lie, I offered them some of their money back if they would just let me pick my game up (I did not want to spend another $50 dollars) but they stopped communicating with me entirely.

Today I went to check the customers profile only to find they listed and sold my game they told me they did not have. I'm beyond furious for obvious reasons, but did not know if I had any additional options to pursue this further outside of filing an OfferUp report.

634,"Hello,
I‘ve been asking myself this question for a while now.
The reason why I hate my brother is simple, he is abusive and aggressive towards me.

It all started with my eating disorder (bulmia).
For those who don’t know about this eating disorder, well basically I eat something and then I throw up afterwards (I know it is bad for me but I can’t help it) and my brother often complains about how it smells or asks me in a rather loud voice why I do this and stuff and I can’t really explain it to him because he wouldn’t understand.

Also my brother treats me like I deserve nothing, no rights I am not allowed to say my opinion and stuff and he also sometimes gets violent.
I can’t speak to my parents about this because they are both disappointed in me because of my disorder, and I am worried that I will get so bad that he hurts me so bad that I eventually end up in the hospital or that I can’t deal with it anymore and I kill myself.

I don’t know what to do so any advice would be nice

Situations where people said/did mean stuff to me, that didn't really bother me in the moment it happened or any time before social distancing really, but has really pissed me off having more time to really dwell on it and think about it.

I confronted these people about these things. Some of them apologized, some never apologized and claimed they never did it, and others flat out blocked me.

It makes me upset knowing that only some people, like me and some other people, get treated badly by others, and other people like Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, never get treated badly by others. I could've belonged in the latter, luckier group.

My parents have a long history of fighting after my mom divorced my dad. My mom claims all my dad wanted to do was party and sleep with other women and beat her and us as kids. While my dad claims my mom would go out and party and never be there for us I am not sure who is right. They are constantly fighting in court and one of the most major things to happen was my mom told my older sister to tell the court my dad r\*ped her. If it was true my dad would have went to jail for about 30 years and after that was proven false the court stopped believing just about everything my mom had to say and she kept switching up stories about what happened.

That was about I'd say a year or two ago and now my mom is facing 2-3 years in prison because apparently every time my dad took me to the doctor he would mail my mom the bill in the mail and he sent it to the wrong address on purpose then said she did not pay the bill and about 5 minutes ago she told me all of this and showed me the papers in the mail and I'm not sure what exactly to do every since my dad got the upperhand in court hes been using it to ruin my moms life but my mom has done the same thing anytime they get the upperhand in court they use it to their advantage and try to bring down the other parent they care more about their revenge than us at least thats what it feels like. Any chance they get at destroying the other persons career or life they take it my dad could send my mom to jail and not care that we don't have a mother and the same goes with my mom and I'm not sure who is right in this scenario or if their both wrong (which I'm assuming they are) but even if I do know who is right an who is wrong it wont change the fact that my mom might go to jail and there is almost nothing I can think of that I can do. Another thing I would like to say is I wanted to go to a different school but My moms house burned down and we had to move to another school district and after we moved I had told my dad I was unhappy with going to that school I didn't think I did anything wrong by asking but then it started all this mess over a school and my mom said i should have just told here about it but when i did she was screaming at me for about 10 minutes of why I couldn't go there instead of just talking with me.

I’m not english so excuse me for any mistakes.

Right now i’m (M 19yo) and in 3rd year of med school, but through out all my life, i have lied to my family and others that i’m ok, and didn’t tell them about being bullied everyday and getting sexually abused at school, and living everyday with that lie, and the problems that arose because of it, i feel more and more like shit, by the problems i basically mean the fact that my personality and my ability to defend my self got weaker and weaker, and i’ve let many chances through out my life be wasted because i’m not the kid i wanted to be, and the kid that my family wanted me to be, so i just wasted my life on devices, and would get back from school saying everything is alright, while being mad and sad all the time, and would sometimes lash out on my supportive family, my mother loves me, also does my siblings and father, but the more i lie about being great, and sometimes getting mad at them, the more i blame myself because i know its all my fault , that i haven’t tried to fix my bullying problems, and i know that i’m a good student, but when i get sad and mad and feel very unsafe at school, so i basically started to lose grades, and seeing myself go down this hill each day and fail more each day, kills me on the inside and makes me feel so guilty about everything in my life.

So now my last straw has broken, because in college, i have not made any friends, because i’m self conscious all the time and have really low selfesteem, and spent most of my time on my phone, so when this semester started, my depression and my guilt throughout all the years have been piling up, so I didn’t care much about anything, so when i got to the time to pay for my tuition, I got the old account number for out university, and didn’t care much to check for the new account, and basically paid 1950$ to the wrong account, and just left the payment without checking on if it actually went through with my university, i knew something would go wrong, and today i got the message from my university that they haven’t gotten any payment from me, that’s when i felt like it’s the end, that i have reached the lowest point in life by wasting money, i have never wasted money on anything because i already feel like i don’t deserve it, and now i feel like i’m a piece of nothing, a leech, i basically wasted 2K$ because i’m a loser who couldn’t speak out on his problems with anyone, and it’s all my fault that have led to this moment in life, where I basically wasted 2K$ on being inconsiderate and not caring, i tried to do something horrible to myself, before writing this, but i decided to call my sister and mother and tell them what i have done, and told them that I don’t deserve to be in this university, and I don’t deserve anything they do for me, that i wasted the money, but when they told me it’s ok, i felt more like shit and more like fucking shit because i have let myself reach this point, let my anxiety and low self esteem and my inability to tell my problems, destroy my life, everyday i feel like i shouldn’t be alive, what should i do",13Oct2020,1

644,"4 years ago I met this girl who I thought was perfect. We immediately had a good connection and had a great time. After that weekend ended I got her Snapchat and phone number, and continued on from there. We talked for ages, Skyped and called. I really thought I found the one. 

We live far apart from eachother, which is why we have only met 4 times(!) during the 4 years we've known. But every time we meet its like a spark that is re-ignited. And yes, at one point it got sexual. 

Fast forward 3 years and we are getting more and more out of touch with eachother. Or by that I mean: I send texts, but only occasionally get an answer.. 
I start to understand that maybe she doesn't want to continue this ""thing"" we have. 
And by one point it just stops.. dead silence...

Heartbroken I continue my days as normal.

Now fast forward to just 3 months ago. I see she have updated her Instagram story. This is not unusual, but the content is. Its a photo of a commercial promoting rape-awarness.

I immediately text her up to check upon her (thinking maybe a phonecall is too much). She answers and tell me that she has been a victim of rape while she was asleep, and that she has been struggling the past year... !!!
I made it clear to her that if she ever needed someone to talk to about it, she could call me at anytime, anywhere.
After these texts she starts picking up on Snapchatting again (yes we still use that here).

Its nice to see her again on her photos, and she seems happy. Until one night where she just sends a photo of her crying, and with the text going something like ""There is nothing you can do"".

I quickly call her and she picks up on the first ring. She is having a proper breakdown, and there really is nothing I can do except talk to her. Make her smile. Make her laugh. Just something. It's the first time I hear her voice in ages, and its the most heartbreaking thing I've ever heard. Just a voice in despair. 

During this call she also tells me she has a boyfriend. The news is heartbreaking on my part, but I try to push that away from my mind while talking to her. This is about her, and not my stupid love problems.. It is what it is I guess..

We agree to call up on eachother again, and we do so some days after. Now the mood is ""back to normal"", we laugh, crack jokes and just plain out having a good convo. 

We begin texting again and I notice that she sends more texts during her working hours, than while at home. I understand that it has to be about her boyfriend.

During this whole rollercoaster I have been at work, for weeks. Couldn't talk to anyone about what has happened and those feelings that I had of her is resurfacing again.. It kind of fucked me up.

645," For starters, I am 18m, 145lbs, 5'9"", I have ADHD and depression, and am on Vyvanse to treat my ADHD.

I have only had sex twice in my life with two different people (19f) &amp; (21f), and both times lasted 1-2 hours with me having absolutely no feeling of even being close to ejaculating and ended at the request of my partner both times. This also happens for other sexual activities such as hj's and bj's. This problem only happens when there is a second party involved, so I have no problem ejaculating while masturbating. This has lead to me becoming somewhat frustrated with my self and sexually frustrated, as well as worrying weather or not I am pleasing my partner after the fact, which both said I did when I asked but I'm still worried, and has also lead to me being worried about whether or not I will ever be able to ejaculate during sex and if this might actually prevent me from or make having kids really hard. As much as I do enjoy sex, it really bothers me that I am unable to finish because I feel like I am not getting the full experience, I feel like there is something wrong with me, and it has also been somewhat emotionally detrimental.

In addition to all that, I had sex last night which like I said above lasted about 1.5-2 hours, towards the end of which my partner (21f) said something along the lines of ""I'm tired, I'm just going to finish you off now"" so then she stared blowing and rubbing the tip, which was extremely stimulating, but after about 10-20 minutes of that I started to feel a tingling/ numb feeling in my left arm, almost like tv static. However, this was different from if my arm was falling asleep for two reasons, there was no reason for my arm to fall asleep because I was actively griping the sheets with them and wasn't laying on it in a weird position, and because of the fact that I started to lose all motor function in my left arm. This really scared me so I asked her for a quick break which she took as it being over as I started trying to be able to use my arm again. This numbness in my arm lasted for about 30 minutes.

so I'm at a stage in my life where I've fucked to no return. And I just want some advice as to how I can embrace it and move on with my life. 

So a bit context: I've graduated recently in a master's in business and a bachelor in science, both of which I hated and don't want to work with. My whole life, I've always wanted to engage in a more creative field like content production, but I was too scared about the employment opportunities. Also, I live in a small city. 

Fast forward after I finished my bachelor's I got a job in a the local university, in the communication department. So basically my job was just to create fun content for students. Fun! I wasn't super good at it, but good enough that my stuff could get published. I did, however, lack video editing and graphics skills.

But then my master's hit me and I got into this identity crisis. Being surrounded by business students I too got swept into their den, and of course they exploited the hell out of this naive kid. This led to my neglecting my job as I was too stressed, and I got swapped out with another full time worker.  This means I will never be able to get this job again. My boss has made it obvious that it's not a position I will get back. 

Now I'm floored. I don't know what to do with my life. I'm depressed. I'm working part-time in some useless project-based job, I still don't know graphics or video editing, and I don't think I'll ever be able to get a communication job again since I don't have the formal competency. The journalism degree in my hometown lasts 3 years, and I'm already in my mid-twenties. Plus, the job market is crazy.

So now my last straw has broken, because in college, i have not made any friends, because i’m self conscious all the time and have really low selfesteem, and spent most of my time on my phone, so when this semester started, my depression and my guilt throughout all the years have been piling up, so I didn’t care much about anything, so when i got to the time to pay for my tuition, I got the old account number for out university, and didn’t care much to check for the new account, and basically paid 1950$ to the wrong account, and just left the payment without checking on if it actually went through with my university, i knew something would go wrong, and today i got the message from my university that they haven’t gotten any payment from me, that’s when i felt like it’s the end, that i have reached the lowest point in life by wasting money, i have never wasted money on anything because i already feel like i don’t deserve it, and now i feel like i’m a piece of nothing, a leech, i basically wasted 2K$ because i’m a loser who couldn’t speak out on his problems with anyone, and it’s all my fault that have led to this moment in life, where I basically wasted 2K$ on being inconsiderate and not caring, i tried to do something horrible to myself, before writing this, but i decided to call my sister and mother and tell them what i have done, and told them that I don’t deserve to be in this university, and I don’t deserve anything they do for me, that i wasted the money, but when they told me it’s ok, i felt more like shit and more like fucking shit because i have let myself reach this point, let my anxiety and low self esteem and my inability to tell my problems, destroy my life, everyday i feel like i shouldn’t be alive, what should i do",13Oct2020,1
653,"Long story short my roommate of 6 years is moving out of the country at the end of this month which leaves me (24/F) to find other living arrangements. I know I cannot afford to live alone and do not feel comfortable living with a stranger, so months ago I made plans to move into the spare bedroom at my Dad’s apartment for $300/mo. This worked out for me because my long term goal and plan was to live at my Dad’s for a year, save money, and travel for a few months until ultimately settling in a town that is not my hometown. The plans were agreed upon until a few months ago everything was disturbed when my younger sister (19) and her boyfriend broke up. They had gotten an apartment together so they both had to break the lease and she moved back into my Dad’s spare room. I didn’t even know until after she moved there and she told me it was an emergency situation and she had nowhere else to go, and that it was just until I was going to move there and then she was going to move and split an apartment with her best friend. I was okay with that but then my sister took out a loan for a cosmetic surgery and is now saying she cannot move until February because she cannot afford it. I was pissed but what else can I do besides yell at my sister in this situation, it’s not like I can force her to move out. 

So here is where i’m at, my Dad who is (to put it nicely) a completely pushover when it comes to my younger sister will not say anything and is now trying to overcompensate by saying he is going to move in with his girlfriend of 6 months so that I can have his bedroom and he will continue to pay the rent, utilities, etc while also having to pay his girlfriend a bit for staying at her house. My Dad is not the best with money and i know is in soo much debt and i just feel like he cannot afford to do that. I keep refusing but he insists that everything is fine and he’s okay with this but it just does not sit right with me. So essentially in this situation I would be living in the smaller bedroom paying $300-$400 a month while my sister lives in the master for free and my Dad is booted out. 

My other option is to live with my Mom. My Mom lives about 30 minutes out of the way where I currently live in a very rural redneck-y (for lack of a better word) area. I love my Mom but do not support her lifestyle as she she lives with her boyfriend who is an alcoholic and fights with all the time. On top of that she hangs around people and distant family members who i feel are racist and overall not good people and is passive when I bring it up. She swears that she doesn’t hang with them anymore and that her and her boyfriend don’t fight as much since they both had a near death experience a few months ago but I just don’t know if I can believe her. Living here I would have my own decent sized bedroom but as my mom works from home she will be there basically 24/7. However in this situation I have the best financial outcome as my mom is offering to let me stay completely free.

My last option is to live alone which would cost me well over $1100 a month (way more than what I currently pay) and would not allow me to save much money or complete my goal of being able to travel and move out of my hometown in a year. The upside of this situation however is that I would be comfortable in my home and would not have to deal with the bad sides of the other options. 

((Also as it is worth nothing, it is not possible for my sister move into our Mom’s house because her and my mom do not get along and fight constantly.))

I don’t know what to chose, I keep going back and forth. Any advice on what I should do? 

TLDR; I have to move soon and have to chose between booting my dad out of his own home and living with my sister for $300-$400/mo, living for free at my moms house who lives a different lifestyle than I am comfortable with for free, or live alone for well over $1100 a month but be comfortable in my own home.",13Oct2020,1
654,"It's just been a thought in the back of my mind ever since someone brought it up in a conversation. I seem to match a lot of the behavioural symptoms listed online and it'd explain why I have such serious trouble with school work, but i'm just not sure if its worth getting looked into or not y'know?

655,"I’m in a serious dilemma and I only have days before it’s too late and I lose both of them. Here’s the situation:
 
I began talking to a guy back in June (during the middle of the pandemic) and I fell HARD. I liked him a lot. Unfortunately, he lives hours away from me and I knew this would be an issue at some point. He came into town for business. It’s not like we were supposed to meet and let things go this far, but it did. It has been weeks since I’ve seen him. For 1, he hasn’t made an effort because he had things at home to take care of. Getting a new job, med school, etc. 
UNDERSTANDABLE BUT: why could he not tell me where I stood in his life? 
I’ve made multiple efforts to drive out of my way for him. 

The next weeks that pass by, I haven’t seen him. I’m starting to detach myself because I felt he wasn’t really in for it anymore and I’m not going to put miles/ wear and tear on my car. 

Jump forward:
I wind up meeting someone new and we vibe REALLY well. We’re total opposites though. He has an old soul, I don’t. I want to live in a big city and pursue a career in the medical field. He’s very mature though and knows exactly what he wants. I start seeing him as often as I can and he’s great. He then asks me to secure the bag and slap a label but I need just a little more time to figure out who he is......

I still kept in contact with the guy who lives far away but I haven’t told him anything. He knows I’ve been off though. 

I just need help or advice deciding what’s best for me. I don’t want to lose both of them.",13Oct2020,1
656,"this year is my last year at university. I have always been an invisible person. During classes. or tutorials, it seems everyone does their own stuff, no-one talks to anyone, but on campus, I see people from my group have friends with others, and I see couples walk together. I mean how did they know each other? How did they become friends?

657,"This has been hard for me to wrap my head around so I apologize for the ramble...

My roommate and I have been living together for a few years now.  We're friendly with each other, but I find her difficult to talk to at times. We share mutual friends, but I don't feel like we click as people and while I like her I don't think we'd naturally be friends. She also displays some characteristics that are hard for me to handle. She can be short at times and seemingly judgmental. She's somewhat controlling and likes things a certain way. 

This is compounded by the fact that I'm conflict averse and very go-with-the-flow. I also tend to keep to myself and hang out in my room most of the time which she's taken the opportunity as to make the shared living/kitchen area her secondary space. 

After work she spends her time watching TV in the living room. The way our apartment is organized, I have to walk in front of the TV each time I want to get food, water, or go outside and I always feel like I'm 'disrupting'.

I also historically haven't cooked much and order out for meals. While I want to change that, I have very little refrigerator/cabinet space since she does cook and has grown into the space more. I currently have about 1/5th of a shelf in our food pantry.

**I don't blame or condemn her for any of this, I'm just setting the stage**

Since the pandemic, we've both been working from home causing the above to escalate. 

While I work in my room, she put her 'office' in the shared living room. She has a desk in her room and this was done without asking me. I now have to ask permission to make coffee or food in case she has a call. I feel driven to tiptoe around my living room while she's working. 

All of this together has created an environment where I'm not comfortable in my own home. I don't feel welcome to be outside of my bedroom. I feel like a guest trying not to create burdens or conflict. Some of this comes from unresolved childhood trauma, but that's another issue. 

The easy answer would be to get my own place, but I live in a big city and with the pandemic, that's not financially or logistically viable at this point in time.",13Oct2020,1
658,"So, i know him since 2015 and we are best friends since then. He has really bad sozialphobia and i am one of the only people he let in his flat and i was always proud of that fact.

In february i was in a homelessshelter and got dragged down by one of the workers there. She called me a liar and a bitch in front of the other clients and made my only friend i had there (not the friend this story is about) make him turn his back on me. 
My best friend and his mother drove  over 400km and helped me move out and i moved in with both of them.
Now, over time it got really hard with the covid stuff because his work got shotdown and i didnt have a job so both of us where stay at home all day. Over the next month we really got on our nerves.
We have the same friends and i heard from them that he told in teamspeak that i sleep with him all the time and i talked about it with him why he said that and he was like ""oh, thats a misunderstanding. I will set this straight."" I was like ok what ever. I know he has feelings for me but i didnt understand why he said that.
Over the next days he told me it would be better i would start looking for my own Apartment, so i did.

Here is the big thing, i know it is stupid to argue about a game but we both play MonsterHunter and on Oktober 1st a new update was made and i finished the new monster before he did. Posted a screen about it in our friends whatsapp group and he came over in my room and demandet i show him how i slay the monster. I asked him why and he said ""i dont believe you"" ""you cant be the first one to actually get him killed"" i got really angry and said he is just jealous because i got better them him. He left the room i wrote in the whatsapp group ""that screen i fake. Maybe (worker in the homeless shelter i told you before) was right about the liar part.""

659,"Hi Reddit, so I had to copy in my recent online exams because I couldn't answer anything and I could really fail in the exam if I didn't cheat it . Unfortunately, the test was too hard but I answered nearly all the questions which were hard because I googled them.

I don't even know how to solve them tbh. Since it was hard, most of the legit people left them or didn't write them properly but they can pass the exam. 

Even if teachers may or may not get doubt on me, my parents would definitely get doubt on me and I would get some harsh punishment.

Most of my classmates did the same, they copied as well. 

I regret doing that but I need to get out of the situation. Accepting the mistake isn't here an option since the consequences would be worse. I need to over come this situation but how?

I'm asking this because I suck at lying/managing my shit.",13Oct2020,1
660,"More than a month ago, a friend/workmate asked to borrow a relatively large sum because her uncle needed to be hospitalized. At the time when she borrowed, she told me that her uncle's kids worked overseas and that it was not easy for them to send the money right away; she told me that she would be able give the money back the following payday or the end of the month at the latest. Sensing the urgency of the situation, and reassured by the fact that her uncle has working children, I sent her the money she needed.

I asked her at the end of last month whether she would be able to pay me back -- she said that her uncle needed to be hospitalized again (and that her mom is also going through some treatment) and most of their income just go to medical bills. She said that she'll find a way to pay me back, but wasn't actually clear as to how or when that will happen.

I have refrained from messaging and asking her about it because I really don't want to add to her worries. However, I do find myself feeling frustrated at times. For one thing, I feel that she misled me by committing to return the money sooner, and for another, I know that she makes significantly more than I do, but has never made an effort to set aside money for emergencies such as this.

I also don't appreciate how when the day that she committed to return the money came, I didn't even get a message from her, I had to be to one to message the next day and ask whether she can pay me back. I have expressed to her how I had to take out a loan for myself just so I can pay my own bills. If she had asked for a donation instead, I would have just given her a portion of the amount and forgotten all about it.

Am I just being a complete jerk? Should I just respect that she's going through something serious and wait until her situation improves? Who here thinks I would still get my money back?

TL;DR: Friend borrowed money due to medical emergency that is still going on; not sure how to get my money back.",13Oct2020,1

i thought by this time, I'd have my own home, car, money to spend, lots of friends, living life, enjoying life. instead, i'm just stuck living with my mom and brother. my brother spit on me the other day. he is damn crazy. I think he is mentally 1/2 adhd or something bipolar. he's not dumb enough to be dumb, not smart enough to be smart. i'm not here to vent on his character, but it is one of the big issues and I have done everything within my power to handle it. God Knows, there is nothing I can do, And my family will do nothing for it either. I'm left with the burden, and I'm and the one least qualified to handle it. he has something against me from the start so, nothing i can do. and my mom will baby him till death so, i'm not sure where to stand.  


aside from that though, for myself, i feel like my life wasn't able to take off.

I had a dream that I was running, but I was only running in slow motion and everyone around me was just walking by at normal speed. I was being held back in a sense. If i remember correctly, I was sprinting, in place, but no matter how fast i sprinted, I could only move in place at the speed as if I was walking slowly.

671," 

For context: **In my country, first cousin marriage is legal\*.** I am a 26 year old male and my cousin sister is 29. She is my maternal first cousin. I'm from a relatively conservative country.

Since childhood, me and her have always just naturally clicked and had great chemistry. She has helped and been there for me so many times when everyone else had abandoned me. I think I have always lowkey liked her since over a decade now. I don't know, man. I have always rejected this thought instantly whenever it's come to my mind, because I'm from an urban city with very strong Western influence, and the west largely regards it as ' morally wrong '. But now it's reached a point where ignoring and suppressing it no longer is an option. I have to address this. inb4 sweet home alabama.

I will not bore you with more about myself. Anyways, I want to ask:

1. Is marrying / romantically loving your first cousin ' okay '? This is the first and most important question because if it can be factually deemed that it's not okay based on strong logical grounds, I will completely drop this thought and this will be the end of it.
2. IF, we can come to a majority consensus that first cousin marriage is acceptable, how do I even handle this predicament and decide how to proceed?
3. I have searched this sub for ' incest ' ( I fucking hate it that what I feel comes under this tag ) - I have read similar and related topics and most people have expressed that two individuals can only consent to physical relationships when both are over 18 / their frontal lobes are fully developed.

Also, most people do agree that certain forms of ' Incest ' are pretty much universally frowned upon and wrong for eg Mother-Son, Father-Daughter etc. Would the same be true between first cousins?

4) Can the legal status of certain things in our respective countries cloud our logical judgement and introduce personal bias?

For example, If I lived in USA where first cousin marriage is illegal and highly frowned upon, Would I still feel the same?

5) Do human emotions have a logical component to them? Do they even have to have a logical backing? Are most emotions ' wired ' into humans or are some of them developed because of societal morality?

My efforts to find the answers is just raising more questions.

I would love if people could even add their personal advice on what they would do if they were in my shoes. If you've read this far, thank you so much, it means a lot to me. Hope you all are having a great day.",13Oct2020,1

677,"  I’m a 28-year-old man.

I’ve gone to university several times and I’ve tried with maths, physics, chemical engineering and even psychology.

And although I managed to finish the first year of engineering with very good grades, particularly in maths and physics, I couldn’t manage to continue, it was just too much.

I lose interest very easily and I really, really dislike people around me, teachers and students alike, because I find them annoying and very different from me.

I get bored and I start to think what I’m doing there, I don’t think that’s my place.

The routine, the classes, a future I don’t look forward to, because I don’t want to spend my days sitting in a classroom just to get a degree and then to get a regular job I probably won’t like either.

During these years I’ve read, watched videos, listened to the radio and tried different activities, mainly on my own.

I’m quite introverted too.

I kind of like maths and physics very much and I usually learn bits of them.

I’m interested in computer science and for the last months, I’ve been very interested in cryptocurrencies, investments and finance.

I enjoy films, some books and philosophy.

Currently, I’m learning how to play the guitar as well, using videos and an online course that I use at my own pace.

If I could choose, I think I’d like to make a living doing business, as I call it, in the cryptocurrency world, but that’s just too far away and too vague, I think.

Sometimes I think of learning more about computers and try to become a freelancer.

I like to use different pieces of software and learn about them.

Lately, I’ve been learning some GIMP out of curiosity and because I wanted to edit some drawings I had.

People that have talked with me and know a bit about me say I’m quite intelligent and usually ask me why I’m wasting my time and why I’m not using my potential.

I’d say because it’s boring because I see no reason for doing something I don’t like and that I find dull and very monotonous.

I don’t know, I just like to hear some fresh advice from someone.

Thanks.",13Oct2020,1

Option 2 - Protection of personal data (it might be interesting because we live in digital age, I just don't know what to expect from this one)

682,"Need dental procedure

So, I came into a new country to study and go to college here. I’m a student so money is extremely tight. Parents are in the lower-medium class and the standards are way higher here. I can’t get a job until my papers (residence permit could take a month or two) are done so I don’t really have an income except the money that my parents send me. 

All of this has been survivable and I’ve been relatively happy. However, the past few months I’ve been getting an occasional toothache and it’s always the same tooth, but I didn’t think anything about it and didn’t go to the dentist cause it’s expensive and I didn’t want to bring additional expenses to my family. I just tried to keep my dental hygiene as good as possible and that’s it. Today, however, a small part of the tooth fell off. I took a pic of it and realised that I’ve had a cavity there for a few months now and it’s gotten worse now. 

I’ve looked up the ways to fix it and the procedure cost and I don’t think I can afford it (I think I need a root canal, as I don’t think a filling would do). I could maybe go for a tooth extraction (to just pull the tooth out and be done with it), but then its gonna leave a hole and I’m gonna be even more self-conscious than I already am. 

I am extremely worried that the tooth might go beyond repair and that I’ll never be able to fix it and will be force to pull it out.

Constantly sneaking around. Sneaking girls into the apartment. Always trash talking. Never invited to hang out. I try to put out any fire that arises but it seems he doesn't really care about being brothers. Him and his girl have taken over the apartment. Now it seems they are throwing shade to try and get me to leave. They dig up dirt from the past. Most which is not true and just take other persons side.

688,"I have a lot of built up anger against my roommate because I didn't confront her when the problems started. Now it has gotten so bad that I do not know how to tell her how I feel without causing an argument. Here is a summary of what has been going on: 

My roommate moved here from Cameroon. Her parents sent her here to get an education. They give her a monthly allowance to pay for her house, school, and other expense, but she has been lying to her parents because she  is not really in school. She instead uses their money to party, buy expensive clothes, and travel. 
I live with my boyfriend and when she moved in, me and my boyfriend told her that because of the pandemic we prefer to keep everything separate besides the kitchen. We both have separate living rooms and bedrooms. We asked her to buy some of her own kitchen utensils and other supplies (This was all agreed to before she moved in). We told her she can use our stuff until she gets her own AS LONG AS SHE ASKS. 
Even though her parents give her more than enough money to live she will not buy her own things. She started using our living room space all the time even though she has her own space for a separate living room. I was okay with her sitting there because I didn't want to be petty. It only started to become a problem when she started inviting multiple different friends over to sit on our stuff during a pandemic. It is literally a new friends every day. I am just not comfortable with that so I told her I would prefer she doesn't invite so many people over, but if she does I would prefer they sit on her furniture not mine. She told me she does not want to buy her own furniture and she should be allowed to use mine instead. She can definitely afford to buy it though seeing all the other stuff she wasted her parents money on... 
She also continues to use my stuff without asking, and whenever I offer her anything she takes advantage of it. For example I told her she can have some of the cake someone made me, but not even a day later she ate the whole thing and left the dirty dish in the sink for me to clean. 
She does not take out the trash ever, never sweeps the floor, leaves the door wide open which lets bugs in and walk around the house in barely any clothes in front of my boyfriend. 
She likes to also post on social media that she is successful and in school which is just not true and it annoys me so bad! She likes to post my things and pretend they are hers. She even said that my pet was ”ours”! 
The most annoying thing she does it she lets her friends walk in the house without knocking on the door. They just walk in like they own the place. We are not supposed to be having this many people over during COVID. One day she got sick and I told her to get tested, but she refused. My boyfriends parents live upstairs, and Ironically they ending up getting covid a few days later. 
After they got covid I told her she needs to get tested and stop allowing people over. She said ”they will be fine”


Today she crossed the line. She let some guy come in and sit in my living room. Not only did she not say anything to him, but she let him put his feet up on my couch on my nice pillows. I only know this because I saw it happen on the cameras I have in my living area. So now I am mad and want to confront her, but I am not confrontational.",13Oct2020,1

Over the years I made a couple new friends but stayed close with my best friends I met in 7th grade. One of the friends I made was a girl and one of my best friends had a crush on her and they got really close. One night at a party he got too drunk and tried to do some inappropriate things and tried to hold her down. They both told me about it and not many other people. He genuinely seemed to feel bad (I know that obviously doesn’t make up for it nor is it an excuse that he was drunk). I had a big falling out with him and my other best friends. We were fighting in a group chat and they agreed we should both leave and calm down. I stayed friends with her but we haven’t talked a lot since graduation. A couple months later someone added me back in the groupchat and the one that did it was already back in, I’m not sure how long he was back in or if they added him back right after I left.

Im not really passionate about it, I get up in the morning and dont feel compelled to study this (not even amid the covid situation), hell I'm not even that good at it since lots of calculations are necessary and im pretty bad with numbers. Honestly I think I've tried to convince myself that I didnt want to study medicine so I wouldnt be a burden on my family money-wise. I didnt really think anything of it but recently I've been having dreams where I'm studying medicine with a buddy of mine who suffered a similar fate to mine. I havent been able to stop thinking about this the last couple of days, I just want to have a fulfilling life but I cant seem to get motivation, even though I have such a privileged opportunity right in front of me. I want motivation but I cant help but put myself down everyday. I dont know if I want to study medicine now, honestly I think I should just finish biotechnology since im already in too deep.

698,"(Throwaway for obvious reasons) I'm a sophomore student in the U.S.. My family life isn't the greatest. To start off my family is under the poverty line (Family of 5 with a income of 35k). Of that 30k, about 15k ends up going torwards her substance problems. My parents are currently seperated but still maried . My biological dad is currently in prison for drugs and has been for the last 2 years. My mother was in jail last week when she went back into a state she was wanted in (Fled bail 17 years ago) but was released a few days later. All in all, if it wasn't for food stamps and living in a borderline drug den my family would be starving or homeless. If that wasn't enough however, recently its gotten even worse. My Mom got a crack head boyfriend with uncountable issues. Last week alone I've had to deal with 3 cops as he keep bringing in issues with the law but is never home to deal with them. He is also a jobless bum who in my eyes is just eating our already limited food. The last week or two he's also been having several people occasionally crashing our tiny 2 bedroom apartment. They usuallty brig a pack of beer and sleep in the basement. You could guess what they're doing in the basement.

Due to the reasons above I was looking at emancipation as a minor. The reason I'm asking this here is to see what I should do. As I'm only 3 years away from college I could suck it up and leave once I graduate. I have the highest grades in my school and have a high chance of being an all ametican in two sports my senior year. So my chances of getting into a out of state college are pretty high. My grandparents live in the same apartment complex as us so living with them isn't an option. I have an aunt who I could live with but the problem is my siblings. All three of us couldn't stay their and I would feel uncomfortable leaving them alone. The problem with emancipation is that one of them is 12 so she couldn't be emancipated. My brother also might not be able to as he's 15. I couldn't adopt them but I would hate to put them into foster care. My brother and sister could stay with my aunt for a year until he could be emancipated but I'm not sure. If anyone who knows the system or what I should do I would really appreciate the advice.

TLDR - Home life is awful and I am thinking of being emancipated. However siblings and finances could pose as a issue if I were to see it throw. Advice?",13Oct2020,1
699,"A law was passed in England called IR35 which has completely screwed England's contracting economy. That plus the pandemic, and the fact that covid gave my Dad a stroke has completely annihilated his chances of getting a job.

I'm 19 and have many mental issues that would prevent me getting a job that would require leaving the house. I've had an intense phobia of germs since I was 11 so you can imagine how COVID has made it so I never want to leave the house.

My Dad used to make a decent amount of money and we live in a relatively high living expense area. It costs about £3000 minimum for us to pay our bills and get food and other essentials. When my Dad's last contract ended just as lockdown started, we had enough money saved to get us through to this point in October but we're on thin ice now.

Is there any possible way that we could make money online to see us through until he can possibly get a job again? I know its a longshot since I'm just a college student and don't really have any marketable skills other than writing decently well.

700,"This is a fairly minor issue but I am annoyed and trying to figure out the best way to handle this situation.

A few weeks ago, I had a flight to catch at 6 am, meaning I had to leave the house at 3:30 am for the airport (we live an hour away from it). I asked my roommate/friend to take me and she said she couldn't because she worked at 11 am that day and didn't want to be exhausted all day. I had to drive myself and pay something like $88 to get out of the parking garage.

Now my roommate and her boyfriend (both live in the house) need a ride to the airport at 4 am next week and I have class at 10 am that day. Her boyfriend kind of put me on the spot and asked me to drive them. I said I have class that day but will let them know. Now I overheard him on the phone telling someone that I agreed to drive them to the airport. 

In all honesty I don't really mind driving, but I find him acting like I said yes when I technically didn't to be really annoying, on top of the fact this exact same favor was denied to me only a couple weeks prior

706,"Dear community,

This is my first post here at this sub, so if I'm doing something wrong, please let me know (yes, I read the rules) :)

A quick overview about myself:

I'm Brazilian, 28 years old, Electronic Engineer, living in a first world country in Europe for about 3 years. I don't want to provide many more details since I don't wanna be identified (although there isn't a problem if someone manages that). I would say, I'm quite successful for someone with my age/background, specially because I already occupy a manager position in a huge company.

I have a good income, living in a good flat, safe place, few friends, but there has been a feeling hammering my thoughts quite often. My job is ok, I'm really fine with it, but I have the feeling that the time is passing and I should been doing something else... I feel like my contribution to the society is almost none (although I work at high end technology used to entertainment purposes).

Also, I'm a very emotional person. I'm writing that because this leads me to two things I would like to do in my life:

1. I love dogs, really... like, seriously... so I would be amazingly happy to work with something that makes those little creatures happy.
2. I feel very sad for disabled people, every time I see one I want to cry because I don't get it why do they have to suffer. I believe I have a great potential to use my knowledge on that, but I don't know where to start...

The thing is, I'm not really sure if I have this feeling because the time is passing and I would like to enjoy life more. I'm talking about the simple things, getting to know different countries and cultures, enjoy the nature, talk to people, be relaxed... or if this feeling is popping out because I'm not working directly to something that I would like.

So I don't really know if this is sort of work empathy or just that my life needs changes.

It would be really nice from you if you can share your opinions about it, maybe books, movies, suggestions....

707,"Basically my girlfriend and I are going through a rough patch rn (like all year but currently it’s been horrible). She has been out of work for 2 months and I was recently told by multiple psychiatrists and counselors that I needed to stop working because my GAD and depression were getting so out of hand that I was gonna lull myself. Needless to say, we are pretty broke rn and my gf doesn’t have the money to fix her car(her front right ball joint is really old amongst other things)  and get an emissions test done + new tags, on top of that my car has no brakes and I can’t afford to fix it right now so she can’t use my car, and to top it all off we are both pretty over weight and she isn’t used to being on her feet let alone walking an hour to work everyday so we kinda don’t know what to do... 


My mom has suggested we just use my gfs car despite its tags being out of date, it’s drivable but illegal. She said that the cops would probably not pull her over due to all the Covid crap still going on however I doubt that’s true, and we have a lot of cops out where we live.

The other thing is walking would be fine but it’s not the best option because she’ll have to walk home at 10pm every night and even if I walk to her job and take her home it’s gonna be winter soon and at that point I really don’t want her walking through a couple feet of snow and in below 30 weather.


Any suggestions on what to do? My friends suggested apps like Lyft or Uber but until my gf gets paid she can’t really do that, and even then that’s a lot of money.

So they arrieved at like 7pm  and all we did for few hours were partying and eating the pizza we ordered and messing around.

Then i had the bright idea to play the unholy game popularly known as truth and dare, we started playing the game in my sister's room and you should have noticed the change of colours in my face when all i got were boring dares about eating gross food and stuff while other were kissing and other fun stuff.


So i bailed making a excuse, i went back to my room and started looking for my phone, it was nowhere, i then hitted my head againt the wall and remembered that i left it in my sisters room.

So i went back there and firstly i took a sneek peek to see what my crush is doing, but holly molly she was half naked dancing in front of them, i -

I couldn't move for a second, then i bailed as soon as come to my senses, but it was too late i was full of those emotions, i was ducking too much horny, you cam say ungodly amount of horniness was running in my blood, i have to do something, i couldn't use my hands as they were still paining from last week accident so i started searching for anything, anything that i could use, all the stuff toys were in my sister room and all i could get was a knife and apple, i'm straight so knife wasn't a option and i was too horny to think any other thing so i decided to go with the apple.


I dug a sizeable hole in it and went back to my room, i started the deed, i was going good.

By as god hates me my crush sneeked into my room at the same time, at first i got surprised, then she looked towards me and got more surprised, our eyes meet, then her eyes meet the apple then her smile dropped like the bomb dropped in Hiroshima.

I have no real clue where to start looking. apperantly he was in the air force but back when files where on paper and the building conveniently caught fire. when he died the apartment was emptied by managment so we have nothing there. the only thing we really have to go on is that one family member thinks they saw him on one of those criminal top 10 shows in the 80s, his finger prints were burned off, his mother was a dancer of some kind, supposedly he killed a gaurd in prison during an escape, he might have been in the Korean war, and that he told us to never go to Pennsylvania because of family reasons up there.

715,"For some background, we are a family of four. My dad, my mom, me (15m), and my sister (12f). I needed to use my father's phone in order to turn in my homework assignment, and I found a video of child porn open on his phone. He wasn't involved in it or it's production, I don't think. The video had two girls engaging in various sexual activities. One looked 9-11 years old. The other, 12-13. I'm very scared but I played it smart. I recorded a video of myself talking about it and holding up my dad's phone with the video playing so I had incriminating evidence. I sent that video out to several secret emails. Now my question is what do I do. My sister is very attached to her mom and dad. I told her about what happened but she didn't seem to react too severely do it. She was slightly worried but not as much as she should be. She's young so I don't think she understands the gravity of the situation. When I talked about having to go somewhere, she teared up and was very against it. She loves her parents, but her dad is a pedo, and she's within the target age range. I don't know what to do from here. I'm truly at a roadblock. I don't know what to tell my sister and how I should move forward without her hating me. I don't know if this is even worth reacting to the way I am. I'm only 15. My household has been relatively stable. I've never been in this situation before. I don't know who I can trust. I don't know if I can go to my mom. She might be in on it. She might not be. I don't know what to do and I need some help. Somebody please help me. I don't think I or she is safe here.",13Oct2020,1
716,"Background:  My friend is depressed and have been depressed for probably years, he doesn't self harm as far as I know and see.

My friend is very open about his depression and always tells me how he hates everything such as school, how he is ugly and how he wants to die by saying how he wants to jump and so on. I of course get really worried for him and try to talk him out of descision that I know will put him in an even further negative mindset. 

This also quite triggers my suicidal thoughts since I've also been depressed and had several issues since I was a child. And I, especially now that I just got kicked out from my dad who has been manipulative my whole life to living with my mom who is never home and generally having a really rough phase in life just can't handle it. 

 Him talking about his problems which is important but still not quite the same as getting kicked out makes me compare myself to others. I know and recognize that his struggles are valid but I just can't be around him like this since it just reminds me of the way that I don't really wanna live anymore and are just so tired.

717,"For a little backstory: I live in an European country and until I got the house I'm at, I used to move from one place to another a lot with my boyfriend. The house I've got now is the house my boyfriend's parents used to live in, but for various reasons they moved back to our home country and when we found out about that, we decided to take the house for ourselves. 
Side note: my in laws gave us each (my bf and I &amp; boyfriend's brother and wife) a key to their house.

Their family, unlike mine are very attached of one another (mine is too, but we value privacy more than them), the only one who went ""astray"" is my boyfriend but even if he doesn't talk to them much (as they'd like to) they kind of pretend that he is and whenever something happens in our lives they feel the need to voice their opinion, which is usually that we're wrong. Anyway, I'm moving away from the subject here, sorry!

When my in laws moved out, like I said we took the place, but didn't ask the key back from my brother in law (he didn't offer it either). I thought at that time that it's a good thing to give ""an emergency"" key to someone, boy was I wrong!

Since we moved here, they seemed to have forgotten that now WE (my boyfriend and I) live there, and not their parents. When the in laws used to live in this house, everyone used to enter as they pleased with needed to even call beforehand, I wasn't used to this. Now, as I said they seem to have forgotten that this is no longer the hous of my in laws and they still enter as they please. Up until now, they at least would ring the doorbell and wait for us to answer it, they still didn't call or anything, but I never said anything. Today however, I was in my kitchen and suddenly my sister in law comes in through the dor and says that her washing machine broke and needed to put some clothes on. I'm not an asshole, I have no problem with the clothes thing but I hate when people don't respect someone's privacy, she should've at least rang the doorbell.
  

Now, my question: how do I ask for the key back without starting a fight? Because they will obviously get offended by it.",13Oct2020,1

However, these are always full. I am being told that, in each building of less than 20 apartments, there are at least 6 physically disabled people who need these spots, in a building with no elevator...

Bf's kids with us during the week for virtual school and every other weekend. I have minimal contact with the mother and no drama. No communication really at all. All communication is handled between Dad and Mom. I'm just here and assist with kids, play with them, and keep them safe. I am white and the mom/kids/ and my bf are black and I acknowledge and am aware that this can be a sensitive dynamic.

Some believe I should reach out to her/extend the proverbial olive branch but I don't think it's my place to do so. I'll support her in any preferences she might have for her children and I know my limits (for example, I would not do anything to her child's hair) but she has not personally reached out to me about anything.

When I do see her, I wave and am cordial. In front of the kids, I'll speak kindly about her (not that I know a whole lot about her story) even if I personally disagree with some of the choices she has made.

What is my responsibility as a ""step parent"" (we are not married) in order to build a relationship with her (if at all)?

725,"Hey,

I am a 24 year old guy who has a 32 year old sister. She has 2 children aged 10 and 8. She is super strict on them. I don't mean the regular, bed at 9pm and eat your veggies. These kids haven't seen a movie ever. They aren't allowed to play with toys like bionicles or super heros on it since it promotes violence. I totally get no video games like first person shooters and such for kids of that age, but not letting a kid watch cartoons like spongebob and play with Legos is kinda stupid. I also try to take them out for ice cream to have an uncle nephew moment with the kids, and my sister got super pissed that I took them out for junk food. I told her that I made them eat an healthy meal before and all they were doing was having a scoop. The older boy saw me box in my basement gym at home one day, and I let him wear some smaller gloves and punch the bag. I found out that she hates the idea of the kids doing any sport because it encourages a competitive nature that can cause them to be selfish. With all due respect, that is the stupidest thing I heard, and I told her that in private without the kids. I told her that the kids are gonna be a bag of hormones and need to do a lot of physical exercise to grow healthy during that time. She ended the convo saying that they are her children and its up to her how she raises them. I asked my brother in law and he has this look like he is defeated and is on the verge of asking for a divorce because of how much my sister emasculated him during their marriage. These kids are growing up without a childhood and I wanna help. The last time I talked to my sister, I took her to a Starbucks, sat her down, and said ""hey sis, I'm gonna be super honest here. I'm gonna need you to not get pissed, and try to listen to what I'm saying. You're kids are gonna grow up and hate you because you robbed them of a childhood. When I grew up, the best memories I have was going to ice cream or to the movies with you, not sitting in my room doing math"".

728,"Hi, everyone. So I have posted this on carious subreddits, but I’m hoping I may get a faster response here.

It’s been a couple months now since the initial COVID-19 lockdown and the protest/riots pertaining to George Floyd and police brutality, and I’m hoping to gain some assistance on my aunt who has been acting somewhat out of character since these initial events.

My aunt is 40yo who I’ve known to be quite level headed though out all my life. But since the events from this past summer, I find myself seeing her behavior quite odd. As I know she leans conservative, at first the jokes appeared to be light hearted pertaining to say, ‘democrats will ban coffee’, per say, has gone to somewhat of oddly out of character like that Fauci should be tried for mass murder. Antifa causing civil unrest and the destruction of the US and all that jazz. Or that ban of HCQ to treat COVID is a hoax, actually works, and is  a part of some bigger plot (mind you she actually works in medical research, so I thought she would know better on this) And so somewhat down the rabbit whole stuff. 

It’s not that we didn’t talk about politics before, it’s that now, it doesn’t seem I can’t have a descent conversation with her without her making things political or some form of political statement, which for the years I’ve known her, seems just oddly out of character.

New posts of my cousins on her instagram has since been steadily replaced by political memes and similar sorts. And I’m afraid she may getting her news from the wrong news sources based off some of the accounts that appear to follow and the information she reposts in her story. 


Even after asking her if we can change subjects, or when we move the conversation about something else. It appears that she has to add her two (political) 2 cents per say. I recently found out that since the whole COVID and George Floyd events she had extreme stress (she was also moving at the time to Washington during the protests riots) so much so she had psoriasis effecting her. I’m aware she has had medication for anxiety before (which I’m not sure if she is still taking) and has gone to therapy due to marriage issues and for herself. Who she has stopped since moving to Washington. 

But I can’t tell if this is just a sign of the times to which she’s expressing her politics, or again, something more that I should maybe tell her to seek counseling/ therapy for? 

Again, it’s just in these past few months since May with her moving and the whole political climate, that I just don’t seem to recognize this person anymore. Just a lot of out-of-character actions and conversations with her since she moved. I can use some guidance on how I should talk to her about this.",13Oct2020,1

730,"My dad has been a single parent since my mother kicked me out at 12. My mother was not mentally well, and I decided to never return although she apologized numerous times. 

My dad has made a huge impact on my life. He is the ideal dad, always active in events and truly supports me. He bought me a brand new car as a graduation present although it was a strain on him financially. He is a very good man and a I am understanding of that.

However, I’ve realized lately that I feel insecure and scared, as I did with my mother, when I’m around him. When we argue he gaslights me and tells me I’m worth nothing. He calls me by my mothers name to get to me (I’ve told him that being my mother is my worst fear) and he calls me names like fatass, retard, and stupid bitch. 

To explain his explosions, yesterday I accidentally let my pizza burn on the pizza cooker. I stupidly did not set a timer but I was trying to estimate time as I was doing homework. I was yelled at for letting my pizza burn. I fed my dogs the “burnt” pieces (they’ll literally be happy with whatever you give them so no worries). However, I gave it to them a little too soon as it was a bit too hot (absolutely my fault, was not an intended purpose) so they let the pieces sit. This was because I was trying to get away from him and his attitude ASAP. I basically live up in my room to avoid his outbursts and comments and I was trying to get to my safe space. cheese ended getting on the couch (a couch that is simply intended for the dogs to sleep on). He came up and called me a retard, idiot, and told me he thought it was a personal plan to “spite” him. 

I can guarantee you that nothing was done in an attempt to disrespect him or hurt him. I was honestly trying to escape to my room before he made another remark about me (at that point he was mad that I had burnt my own pizza and asked what I was doing to make me make such a mistake).

He talks down to me a lot. He kicked me out of my house after I retaliated because he grabbed my arms very hard (left fingerprint bruises). I did not act right and flipped a chair and slammed some doors after he grabbed me and was locked out of my house (I didn’t act right so rightfully so). He pays for my car so he said it was not mine to drive off in (I’ve never had the option to pay for my car, it’s a gift until he needs to use it against me). I walked off and found a place for me and my dog to stay temporarily. However, he has recently twisted it and said “oh I kicked you out? You were destructive and deserved to be locked out”

He twists situations and makes me seem like the problem but truly I’m not always the issue. I can be rude and moody so please don’t get me wrong. Sometimes I am the issue, 100%. 

He will blame me for things that I genuinely had no part in, like the ice machine breaking recently. He said “it was you stop lying” but I barely ever get ice for my drinks. He said I broke it after putting a pan up to the ice machine to get ice for the dogs, although that is something he taught me. 

He supports me until it doesn’t fit his standard. The car is mine until I want to leave, especially after I mentioned my plan on leaving this house. My dog is my dog, but he said since I didn’t pay for him he is not mine, so I can’t leave with him. He pays for absolutely everything of mine and refuses to take money for his payments but will take it all away when I try to be independent... especially when it comes to me leaving the house for good. 

I grew up with an emotionally abusive mother and have had a very hard time accepting my father shows the same traits. Therapists have said it would be more beneficial to take out student loans so I can live on campus and get away from him. Am I right for being upset? Am I just being an ungrateful brat? Please be real with me. I’m very lost. I’m drinking a whole lot to forget my home life. I’m not in a good place. 

My aunt (his twin) recently saw this side of him and refuses to speak to him. She told me she finally understands what I’ve been telling her about and refuses to put up with it. I still feel guilty and stupid and whiny. I shouldn’t talk to my dad in that way. I’m in a very bad place and have a very hard time understanding if I’m just being a bitch or have actual reasons to be upset. This is not the whole story so it’s hard to judge.",13Oct2020,1
731,"(29,M) I don’t know what to really say or do in this circumstance. I called the last friend I was in touch with a couple weeks ago in a rather depressed and pathetic state and vented about the deterioration of my mental and physical health. I wish I hadn’t, of course. She seemed sympathetic and tried giving advice, then abruptly ended the call. I didn’t feel upset by this, just sort of had a “yeah, it’s not cool to call someone up and dump this state of mind on them, can’t do that ever again” and resolved to apologize the next day. In the morning I saw she had called back after the call ended but I had already fallen asleep and missed it. When I called back, it went straight to voicemail. After calling in the evening and the next day with the same result, it dawned on me she had blocked my number. Checking around then, it became clear she had blocked my accounts on every social platform. “What the hell did I say/do?” — I know it was an inappropriate conversation, but nothing I could recall seemed particularly unforgivable or egregious. 

About a week later I got a hold of her for a short conversation. She was very angry and could only say she was fed up and done with me and resolved to never speak to me again after I hung up on her — as it turned out, something must have happened with the touchscreen of the phone and shut it down... so this was all a misunderstanding? When I tried to explain, she said she didn’t care and it didn’t matter and she wants me to never contact her again. 

It’s cut-and-dry, but it’s really broken me and more than anything else in my life I can’t handle the unresolved nature of this and that an acknowledged misunderstanding could have such a dramatic and harmful impact on me. Nothing has ever affected me this way before — the phone call in which she told me she’s completely done occurred around 8pm. I burst into tears when it ended (which isn’t common for me), slept until around 1pm the next day, and have had a debilitating migraine almost every day since. Previously, these type of migraines have happened around 3 or 4 times per year and have had no obvious correlation with anything mental health related. I feel physically sick and am scared. The feelings are compounded by this having been the only person in the world who was talking to me, and she knew it to.

Is this common or natural? It certainly doesn’t feel like it is. 
Is there any advice besides “move on” or “see a therapist/counselor”? I don’t know what a therapist might say besides “move on” and I don’t have the budget for rolling the dice on that. 

Any help would be much appreciated",13Oct2020,1
732,"Hey all. This is a bit of a long one but I really need some advice. 
I recently reached out to an ex from 3/4 years ago after not having much contact. He told me about his new girlfriend, how happy he was, and then asked if we could meet up as friends. He was a big stoner back when I dated him and i had been an uneducated teenager so I was against it at the time. He told me he would bring me an edible because he “wanted to see how I acted when I was high”. I agreed, thinking it would just be me acting stupid and him laughing. I told him I’d never taken more than 10 mg and that was the highest I wanted to do, and he agreed.
So anyway, the day rolls around and he texts me an hour before we’re supposed to meet, saying he doesn’t feel safe going out because of covid so he wanted to meet somewhere private. He suggested his apartment, but I said no because I didn’t want to invade his &amp; his girlfriend’s space. We agreed to meet at my hotel, watch a movie, and then call it a day. 
The first hour or so went really well and we reminisced on high school and old memories. It was fun up until the edible kicked in and I realized he had lied about how many mgs were in it. I became absolutely incoherently high. He started talking about how frustrated he got with his girlfriend all the time, and how their relationship hadn’t been genuine for a long time, and how he missed me, and the next thing I know he’s pulling my clothes off. 
I told him to stop, that he had a girlfriend, and that I didn’t want to mess up their relationship. Of course, he didn’t listen, and kept saying “she’ll never find out”. I had to keep closing my eyes to ground myself in the moment, but I could barely focus on moving my hands let alone pushing him off me. We ended up having sex. I don’t really know if it was rape, I don’t remember much about the sex itself, just that it hurt and I told him I wanted to stop. 
The last thing I remember is him getting up and going into the bathroom for a few minutes, then putting his clothes on. He said “aren’t you gonna walk me downstairs?” and helped me into my clothes and I walked him to his car. He said “I’ll see you later” and then left me to find my way back to the hotel room.
The next day I told him I didn’t want to hear from him again, and he agreed. 
It’s been almost a month since then, and a few nights ago I woke up to my phone being spammed by his girlfriend. He had told her that he cheated on her with me. She told me I deserved to die, I was a slut, whore, etc. 
I was extremely upset and blocked her. 
Last night, I woke up to my ex calling me. I didn’t answer but he sent me a text saying he was suicidal. Apparently he felt guilty so he told his girlfriend that he cheated, and she immediately moved out of their apartment, trashed most of his stuff, and broke it off. 
I didn’t know what else to do so I unblocked her and sent her a message saying that he was suicidal, and she just continued to spam me the same words instead of trying to help him. I was so upset and still am, and I feel extremely guilty. 
How do I handle this? I don’t know what to do because I don’t want to implicate him as a rapist (or ever have to see him again), but I don’t want to continuously be blamed for what he did. If anyone has any advice it’s greatly appreciated.",13Oct2020,1
733,"Hello all. I've been in the hotel industry for almost 11 years now and have been in pretty much every position you can imagine in a hotel except the position of General Manager. The whole hotel career thing was supposed to be just a one time college job but every time I've tried to get out of hospitality it seems like I keep advancing further with it.

So me and my husband moved to a new part of our state 2 years ago when we both felt our careers had gone stale in the area of our state we lived in at that time. I ended up getting a job as an operations director (AGM) at a hotel in this new area and he was able to transfer to his company's location up here in the same position. 

If you've ever worked at a hotel, you know that- like most workplaces- the hotel has its problems, staff drama, and usually some kind of issue either with senior managment or the company that owns the property. Unfortunately I experienced the latter really quick in my first job in our new town and ended up having to leave to get out of a really shitty situation. Then I got lucky and became the first AGM of a new hotel getting ready to open here at the time. It was such an overwhelmingly positive experience. I guess I was doing a great job, because the area GM asked me to accept a promotion to Area AGM for both my hotel and the new one they had just opened, both a little over 20 miles apart.

Just weeks into my newly promoted position, the CEO of the company came by on one of my days off to the hotels (he lives in a different part of the state) and only then found out that the Area GM and VP of the company had promoted me to this new position between the two hotels. I didn't know that the CEO was completely unaware of my promotion.  Apparently he hit the roof when he found this out and made it to where I was only working at one hotel full time and not at all at the other. I ended up having to work full time at the 2nd hotel and not the one that I loved and had opened as the first AGM there. 

The ONLY reason I never made a big stink about me being ""demoted"" back to just one hotel is because they didn't lower my pay rate back to what it was before the promotion. Then I find out that our company is in a serious financial crisis and both me and my front desk staff are harassed daily by bill collectors. We thought we would be shut down any day due to dwindling occupancy (how full the hotel is on a night to night basis) and how there was just no money left in the company.

And all this was BEFORE the pandemic was even a thing.

So the pandemic hits in March and both of our hotels shut down for a solid two months. I got really really lucky and was one of only 4 managers between the two hotels able to still keep their job after everyone else was laid off. I had to serve as ""security"" for my hotel just sitting in this huge empty building completely by myself 6 days a week for 12 hours a day and the great thing is they didn't lower my pay by much at all during this.

But knowing what I knew about the company's financial problems, I had no doubt in my mind there was no way this company could survive all the money problems it had PLUS the pandemic virtually ceasing all travel to our area of the state. When the hotels reopened, we brought back most of our staff, but in August managers were being let go right and left and I was convinced I was next.

In the hotel industry, you'd be hard pressed to find any company that is willing to hire a new GM for their property that hasn't actually been in the position of GM before. Even if you had years of experience as an AGM, it's extremely hard to even get an interview if you've never been truly a GM. So when I saw a job ad for an economy hotel hiring for a GM, I applied hopeful...but realistic that I probably wouldn't get it. By some miracle, I got the job as a first time GM. In the middle of a pandemic. Holy crap.

I felt like my interview went bizarrely well (a zoom interview since my company is based in another state thousands of miles away). And the reason I use ""bizarrely"" here is due to the fact that it was the easiest, shortest interview I've ever had in which not one qualifying question was asked of me to see if I was even remotely qualified for the job. I will admit that the financial side of being a hotel GM always scared me because I had next to zero training in it and had never had the fortune of working for a GM who would willingly take me under their wing to teach me the core concepts I would need to know to be a GM.

So I get offered the job and start noticing that all the financial stuff I was worried about not knowing the corporate office is actually handling and keeps saying things like ""We'll train you on this later."" OK no big deal. I've heard of those hotel management companies who only want a GM to be a physical presence at the property to oversee day to day operations and let the corporate office handle all tinancials. It's rare, but those companies do exist out there. So I started thinking that I REALLY lucked out by having this hotel be my first time as a GM. 

A couple of weeks ago, I got a call from my direct supervisor letting me know that the CEO of our company was going to be visiting one of our sister properties in the state above ours and wanted to drive down a few hours to meet the company's newest GM in person. Totally fine. We (my staff and I) bust our asses trying to get the hotel at least appearing acceptable (more on that in a minute). The CEO arrives and barely gets a few steps into the lobby after meeting me and wants to have a meeting with both me and my front desk manager.

It's at that point he tells the two of us that the company has given the hotel back to the bank effective as of that day since the company is no longer making any money from this property. For context, the city my hotel is in has one of the world's largest companies in it, and what keeps all the hotels here open are the guests coming in to see this company and try to get their products into their stores.

Well, when Coronavirus hit, all business travelers stopped coming and the hotels here are all on life support due it. Mine is no different. Anyway, the CEO goes on to say that he doesn't ""think"" anyone at the hotel will lose their job due to this. But here's what I do know: banks are not in the business of running hotels. When a hotel is given back to a bank or goes into foreclosure, typically the bank will shut down the hotel until it is sold. And usually they will sell it to the highest bidder. From friends I know who have been through this (pre pandemic), they have always let go management first if they DO decide to keep the hotel open and then bring in their own team to run it. So my job is definitely in danger. 

The reason I'm upset is because I had been on the job for a little under a month when this news was made known to me. And I feel like this kind of thing the company would have known waaaay sooner than when they actually told me about it. Which leads me to believe that the only reason they hired me was so they could get a GM in here to make the hotel look good to the next buyer before it gets shut down. I couldn't get a straight answer from anyone at our corporate office after the announcement was made as to what I should be telling my staff about this and in regards to what will happen to their health insurance and paid time off they had accrued. 

That's when it became glaringly obvious to me that corporate knows more than they're letting on...because since this announcement has been made, getting anyone to respond to me on the corporate level has been almost impossible.

There is a new hotel opening in the next few months...again about 20 miles from where I live...that's currently hiring for an AGM at lower payrate that I am now as GM. However it's the same payrate I was at as an AGM at my last hotel, so I already know I could survive on it if I needed to. I don't mind stepping down in position as long as I can work for a company that isn't going to put me in an impossible situation like I am now.

With everything I've been through working in hotels, I find myself asking if I should really be trying to keep going with it at yet another hotel. The fact that a new hotel is opening during a pandemic...a pandemic that has absolutely crushed our industry...speaks volumes about the financial well-being of that company so maybe I should go for it, but I just don't know.

What would you do? 

Any and all feedback greatly appreciated.",13Oct2020,1

But yeah usually or conversations are normal except recently put off nowhere he just told me he lost his virginity, I didn't ask, I didn't wanna know, he legit told me it of nowhere. Another time he was 'flexing' that all the latina girls like him or something like that (I'm latina) so I'm busy confused like why, because I definetly don't like him like that but he keeps bringing it up.

 Also, he sends me screenshots of good chats with his other 'friends' and they're always from looks girls that are being flirty and I always just respond with saying like ahaha funny but I don't see why he sends them.

737,"Title says most of it. I've had depression since I was a child but mostly preoccupied myself with healthy outlets and focuses (a relatively easy feat for a young man in high school and college) and had, overall a very happy and fortunate life.
After graduating with a degree in communication I worked for an advertising agency and I absolutely hated it... the stress, toxicity and personal abuse I've endured at the hands of my coworkers is pretty surreal for this day and age. Anyway, in 2018 I was diagnosed with stage 4 Cancer and have, since, overcome it, but not before it took a bit of a toll on me. I've been dealing with severe depression, anxiety and existential dread since then, exacerbated by the pandemic, a sense of hopelessness about finding happiness working in corporate America and a general skepticism of institutions for how egregiously short they fall from their intended purpose and how exploitative they can be of the average person. I'm fairly confident I have PTSD or some variation of it due to the stress and despair I've grown familiar with these last 2 years (treatment and continued mental/emotional abuse at work). I'm deeply jaded and cynical. And all of this makes it feel impossible to communicate with anyone else. They just get upset if I bring it up, but they can't refute what I'm saying... All of this to say, I very clearly need therapy, but I'm scared of worsening my quality of life in order to commit the finances needed to do it effectively (that is, consistently through the good and bad times). How do people afford therapy?! I'm 26... I have student debt, medical debt, just got shifted off my parents insurance and I'm trying to piece my life together. I'm cripplingly depressed, but I feel like the cost of therapy will spread me so thin that my depression will worsen and, if I'm being honest, I can't afford for that to happen.

Now everything is different: I am in a new institute and I chose 1st baccalaureate of science as everyone's advice and because I am supposed to like biology.  I have 10 subjects, 6 that don't matter and the main 4 that are biology, anatomy, chemistry and mathematics.  I like none of those subjects and biology, I'm not sure I like it, I'm interested in it and that, but I feel I have to love it out of duty.  The advice of one of my teachers who I love very much told me: take biology, enjoy, make an effort in it and if when the year ends you see that it doesn't convince you, next year change to social sciences (I don't know how is social sciences, but I'm interested, is my second option but I'm scared that don't like it and later I have to change.

741,"My life could be TL;DR summarized as a destructive cycle of working hard, achieving success, and then sabotaging it because I don't feel like I deserve it. At first, this attraction to chaos and self-destruction was a puzzle to me, but over the last years, I've realized that it all stems from my thinking and feeling that I don't **deserve** it. Every time I am close to achieving what I really want, I will sabotage it immediately through any means necessary.

The graveyard of dreams and opportunities is huge. I want to change, but I have no clue how. On a superficial level, I logically conclude that I deserve X, but it does not translate into a visceral sentiment that drives my decision making subconsciously. I envy narcissists and sociopaths for being able to always feel like they deserve everything... It's like playing life on cheat mode. I don't want to become an egotistical megalomaniac, but damn, if I could only learn how to accept that I deserve the fruits of my labor, my life would be 100 times better.

**TL;DR: I, a jobless 26-year-old living at home, am thinking about turning down a job because I would not be allowed to work in my industry for 5 years should something happen that ends in my leaving or letting go.
    I have a singular Client left from my COVID-tanked business that I'm loyal to, but I'd be lying if I didn't also mention that I hate the idea of closing this business completely...at least, while I still have fight left in me.**

A job that I reached the second round of interviews for just dropped on me that I would be required to sign a 5 year non-compete in order to secure the job, due to how competitive their industry is.

My parents, who I live with, are incredibly supportive and willing to back any decision I make, but I'm feeling like a major burden. Were I to take this job, I'd be able to financially support myself (i.e. covering my own car and health insurance, food, and apartment).

It would come as a great relief to myself, at the very least.

I also have a small marketing/content creation business, which was doing well and was growing all the way up until the start of the pandemic. Our usual busy season evaporated, and we had to shut down our office.

Fortunately, that was the only thing this apocalypse took from me so far, so I still count myself fortunate!

We were able to hold on to one Client, and my business partner and I still enjoy making content with him and helping him out. I would have to get rid of that Client and officially dissolve the business to accept this job.

I still want to create with and work alongside fun people and business owners who are willing to collaborate with me. Were I to get another job, only planned to do that to a much lesser degree.

I know I'm rambling, but I'm writing this 30 minutes after the call. All of this to say thay I want my future to be my own, but I also need an income that my business is just not capable of providing me at the moment.

I get that they probably see my desire to continue working with my single client as having my foot out the door, and there may even be some degree of truth there.

Should I risk my immediate financial future and double down on my struggling business, or get a job, grow up, and deal with the consequences should I end up parting ways?

748,"So, I came into a new country to study and go to college here. I’m a student so money is extremely tight. Parents are in the lower-medium class and the standards are way higher here. I can’t get a job until my papers (residence permit could take a month or two) are done so I don’t really have an income except the money that my parents send me. 

All of this has been survivable and I’ve been relatively happy. However, the past few months I’ve been getting an occasional toothache and it’s always the same tooth, but I didn’t think anything about it and didn’t go to the dentist cause it’s expensive and I didn’t want to bring additional expenses to my family. I just tried to keep my dental hygiene as good as possible and that’s it. Today, however, a small part of the tooth fell off, which I think is extremely bad. I took a pic of my teeth and realised that I’ve had a cavity there for a few months now and it’s gotten worse now. 

I’ve looked up the ways to fix it and the procedure cost and I don’t think I can afford it (I think I need a root canal, as I don’t think a filling would do). 

I am extremely worried that the tooth might go beyond repair and that I’ll never be able to fix it and will be force to pull it out. 

I could maybe go for a tooth extraction, but then i probably wouldn’t have the money for an implant and I’ve heard that it’s a bad idea to leave a hole in your teeth because of the jawbone changing.

Your straight up dumb. 
You realise that this is racist right? 
You know it is racist, and you decided to post it anyways because YOU are racist. 
You cant stand when a black person is in power. You are disgusting.
You cant stand when a woman is in power. You are a sexist peice of crap. 
You and your trumpie freinds know that Biden will win the election. Republicans are the minority. 
Because you, and your freinds are such a holes, crybabies, and straight up pieces of shit, you will do what ever it takes for trump to win. 
Its
Not
Happening.
You are homophobic. You realise that right?
You belive that a women shouldn't have a say in an abortion. Are you a woman? 
Wouldnt be surprised honestly.
If All Lives Matter, why cant black lives matter? 
Because your racist.
You are racist, sexist, homophobic, and when it comes down to it, its cause you are weak.
Behind the baby face, there's a weak you.

You must STOP.

He then said, 
Trump isnt homophobic 

I responded

Trump refused to pass the equality act. This wasn't a partisan act. It just provided lgbtq people guaranteed human rights.


Trump has appointed a plethora of extreme anti lgbtq judges to different courts. Including the supreme court.

He opposed job protections for anyone of the lgbtq community.

He refused to admit that lgbtq people are mistreated or undertreated in healthcare.

Trump rolled back Bill's that guaranteed lgbtq people education rights.

He stopped transgender people from joining the military in 2017.

Tell me, how is he pro lgbtq?

But yeah my mom has like serious issues kinda hard to pin point what it is but during the summer in August I left her house and spent a week at my bf house with his family. When I came back, her and my father did nothing but talk shit about me and my weight as well as my relationship, and still never apologized. I don’t take stuff like that lightly so I basically cut them off, and doing my own thing. I live a busy live with college and starting a business so I spend most of my time in my room trying to get things done, as well to stay away from my parents. My mom being the clingy, controlling, entitled, demanding, opinionated person she is, she takes it as me lashing out and not speaking to anyone blah blah blah. I mean what do you expect, you talk all this shit you expect me to be your best friend, and two I want space away from them theyre always attached to my hip since I was way younger and poking in my business I just want a sense of self.

Ever since the situation, my mom has came to my room at least 3 times now, and said to leave her house and go live my bf and his parents if that’s were I’m happy. She goes on to say all I eat is junk and that I’m big as a house, and how my life revolves around my bf and how he controls me and has a hold on me and how he made me quit my job and how I do drugs with him, just a whole bunch of lies, lies made up in her tiny head. It’s just so annoying having to hear this shit all the time especially when it’s not true and I don’t feel the need to explain myself to her because my relationship is none of her business and I have nothing to prove to anyone. She keeps telling me to leave and go live there and how I’m going to come home and meet my stuff outside. And I’m at a point where I just might leave again and not come back. The only reason why I’m still at home is because they pay my school and phone bill, i don’t want to be in my bf parents house because it’s not a lot of space and I don’t feel right bombarding in their space even though they don’t mind at all they told me I could stay there anytime, and lastly I like having my own space and bedroom to come to where I can be alone. I don’t have a problem living with my parents but I honestly feel that I should just leave for the sake of my sanity. The constant shit talking and badgering is annoying asf and I want to get away. 

I tried looking at things from their perspective but it’s like what’s the point if I’m still being hurt? I could apologize for being disrespectful at times or coming home late or not cleaning around the house, but that doesn’t change the fact that they talk shit about me and my bf and constantly in my business. They don’t apologize for nothing they say or do and I’m not not apologizing for anything because I’m doing not wrong but trying to live my life. They don’t see nothing wrong with their actions and it’s all me. May I add she stalks the phone logs to see who I’m texting/calling &amp; listens into my conversations outside my door(do you see know why I want space).

My question is how do I tell her off without my mouth getting too reckless, and is it appropriate to live with my bf and his parents? If I do happen to live with them I feel like it will motivate me to get things going and if I do I wouldn’t stay long I would definitely start planning on moving into my own place right away.",13Oct2020,1

About 2 years ago, I decided to create a website that was much like a blog/advice column but with a more modern emphasis on honesty and bluntness. I created a brand called To Be Honest and my site is now live and ready for submissions. The idea stemmed from reddit advice communities and segments in podcasts where views were able to write in with questions. This site is completely anonymous and I think thats one of the greatest parts about it. I don't know you and you don't know me; so when you submit a question or story, you are getting back advice that is 100% subjective and removed from that emotional charge you may get when asking a friend or family member for advice. Put simply, people can write into the website about just about anything and receive advice back on how to move forward in whatever situation they are in. The advice given is pretty direct and there is a significant focus on self-development.

My brand is in the early stages but I am trying to increase traffic to my site without being too overwhelming on social media platforms and scaring viewers away. Also, the fact that this is an anonymous service makes it very challenging to advertise for because I don't have the benefits of my personal social media account followers. Anyways, if you guys would be so kind to check out my site, I'd really appreciate it! Also open to feedback so that I can improve this business and my goals for it.

770,"Hey there. I’m in a pretty critical point in my life, 18F and moving on. I just don’t see a reason why I shouldn’t become completely unhinged. I’m so tired of being nice, I *really* just want to go apeshit.

I try to be a good person, believe me. I went through school getting bullied for being a little nerdier than most, but still went out of my way to be nice. I donated to charities, protested for pretty much every cause under the sun, all because I had too much faith in people. I really thought that, hey! Even though I’ve been abused all my life, if I can be the better person and help others it’ll all be worth it, right? 

Nope LMAO. When I was younger, I watched this cartoon where the main character was a bitter lunatic who got back at everything that wronged him, and I really think it awoke something inside of me. I remember vividly snapping once at some girl who’d bully me most days by make a one off comment about her hair and making her cry. It was pathetic, but it felt so... good? 

Really, I don’t get why I should try anymore? I’m so tired. If something doesn’t affect me, why should I care? I don’t care about most people around me, they don’t care about me, is it worth putting up with them for the sake of ‘being a better person’? Isn’t there a point when that just isn’t enough to put up with the constant bullying? I’m not a pushover, I stand up for myself and what’s right, but ‘the greater good’ isn’t enough.

Even if something did affect me, I still don’t know why I should still care. I find feminism to be a perfect example of this. I feel gross as a girl. My female ‘allies’ only care about selling their bodies and only caring about our rights when it’s convenient for them. At the end of the day, a pay gap isn’t the end of the world. I could give up trying with this stuff and completely go apeshit, and it would only benefit me. I dream of living by a ‘you hit my back, I destroy yours’ mentality, because no matter how much I stick up for myself, it never feels the same.",13Oct2020,1
771,"I suggest to him that we take a break some space time to just get over each other.

With my religion different, me and him decided to be friends. But we would still tell each other we missed each other. And we would flirt. And etc.

He’s talking to other people but I’m not. He tells me he can’t stop think about me and that he never thought he would like me this much.

We can’t stop telling each other how we feel about each other. 

And the idea of him someday moving on easy and quick and me being left behind with my feelings hurts.



This when I suggest a space from each other.

I can’t watch him see other people and like another girl.

That’s why I think the space from each other will help us move from  and then come back as friends.

I asked him how many weeks he wanted to stop talking for.

And he said 15 weeks.

Here I was thinking a month or less.

772,"Hi everyone. The friendship in cuestion was my best and almost only friend during high school and my first college years. He was a very nice friend (buying me presents for my birthday, for example) while I was not precisely the most caring friend, so as you can see I am not a saint or a poor victim. We have a lot of fun and spent much time together even after he dropped out from high school and became a somewhat bitter individual.

It started slowly. Sometimes he started ""jockingly"" calling me names but during the last weeks of our friendship he even called me retarded and things like that in front of other friends for the smallest things. He became hypersensitive in regards to being more or less intelligent than others and I tried my best to not make him feel bad. I didn't know how to stand by myself so I rarely fight him in any form when he treated me like garbage. Instead, I tried to make everything fun like it used to be, but the fun was forever gone.

One day, tired from his shit, I decided (quite impulsively) to stop talking with him and blocked his number from my phone. It wasn't the correct thing to do but oh god it felt good... for a while. All my family members asked me why I treat my friend like that while the father of my ex-friend looked at me down the street like I was scum. But I didn't want to explain anyone the reason behind this new attitude of mine because I didn't want to be seen like some sort of weak victim. I was upset because of the treatment he gave me but I dind't confront him about that and that shit stayed in my head since then.

After college I returned to the town where my parents and my ex-friend live. I was pretty vulnerable because now I didn't have my friends from college, my freedom and a job or study to give some sense of direction to my life.

And then I saw him again in the street.

I walked right into him (despite him acting like he didn't see me)  and, after and awkward salute, I told him that I am very sorry because of what I did and the bad friend I was.

He said that it was indeed a nasty thing what I did and if I had some kind of mental illness or something because during those last days together I was behaving like ""a rebel"".

I laughed.

We keep talking like nothing and said goodbye to each other. He gave me his phone number and wrote me from time to time. I instantly regret talking to him like that, like I was the bad guy all time along while he did nothing wrong. After that I wanted to tell him something like this but it would seem stupid after so many years and he seems to have move on from that time. Also he behaves differently now; during our last face-to-face conversation he told me many times that he is now an academic because he studies an online degree of history and wants to be a teacher. 

Now that I get a job, worked a lot, lost that job, fucked a lot and figured it out what I want to do with my life I no longer feel vulnerable but proud of myself. However, regarding this stupid part of my past I do still feel like a stupid and weak kid. I let myself to be treated poorly while he was probably feeling powerful or some shit like that and that makes me feel embarrased in spite of my achievements. I do not want to talk with him again but I need some kind of advice to move on and stop feeling weak and socially inept, to feel powerful myself. I know how to say ""no"" and value myself but I never confronted anyone outside of my house when feeling mistreated because I am always too polite with everyone, even with pretty rude persons, and I say too many times ""thank you"" to the point of feeling stupid while saying it. How can I change all of this? There is one tip, aside from punching the face of the next fucker that mess with me (just joking? I don't know)?

so my ex started contacting me again through tinder and now we’ve moved to Snapchat and we’ve been snapping and texting a good bit everyday and I sent a picture of my face just a normal picture and he said that pic was sexy so I said everything I do is sexy and he just sent a blank snap back, then when he was going to school I sent a picture (I was kinda stretching in my pjs and they’re satin and lace) and he said sexy and I said I know and he didn’t reply for a while but he’s been making little comments like they but not really acting on anything. I was in the bath today and sent a self to my collar bones (couldn’t see anything really) and he just said side boobies in a joke but serious say so I send a picture of actual side boob ( hand over boob) and said no that’s side boob and he just said well you learn something new everyday. I don’t know if it’s because he maybe doesn’t want to fall down the “just sex” route or he is nervous or what but I don’t know what he wants and I don’t know if I should flirt and test the waters even thought we’re always kinda flirting or just try be distant I’m not sure please give some actual good advice not just “oh he’s your ex fuck him”.",13Oct2020,1

776,"Please bear with me while I try to articulate this with as much detail, yet as succinctly as possible.

So my current situation is today I received notification from the agency I rent my apartment from, asking if I want to renew the contract for another 12 months from December - ""definitely not"", I thought. There's nothing wrong with the apartment as such, I'll even miss my autistic neighbour who speaks in an Olde English accent and has no problem exiting the building during a fire alarm in nothing but his underwear two sizes too small for him. Anyway, I digress already. I have nothing to stay for other than bills and my demons telling me I can't.  Additionally, I'm a freelancer and I have a feeling I will be out of work in December because the company is scaling back like most, which also coincides with my lease being up on the apartment - I feel like the universe has colluded into forcing me to make a decision and in a weird way, I'm glad because I've been wanting to do it for some time now. 

The dilemma is, I want to sell everything I own and leave the country (UK) with no real particular plan or aim, purely for the freedom of it and the small task of avoiding a mental breakdown. I've had the most emotionally draining and horrid two and a half years of my life, and still not out of the woods in that regard and I'm tired of being sad and anguished. Despite this, the one positive is that I somehow dragged myself through the depression and anxiety, worked my ass off with no holidays or breaks and have now found myself in a fortunate enough position to have the option to do this.

""So what is the advice you're looking for, would you just get to the fucking point already!?"" OK, rude! Well who quits work, gives up their apartment along with everything in it, leaving behind everything and everyone they know to go travel during a global pandemic and economic recession? If I wait any longer past January and look for more work and take a short term rented place, I genuinely fear I might have a breakdown, I'm already burnt out, depressed, anxious and emotionally distressed and have zero motivation to look for other work. If I wait to travel but then can't find work, I'm eating into funds that could have otherwise been spent travelling. I can't stay with parents because they are a big part of the reason I need to leave. I can't stay with my brother because he's about to have a kid and don't wanna be in the way of that and my sister has no room with her kids. Extended family is not an option either, because who has extended family these days? And even if someone, a friend or something, said yes, is COVID going to magically disappear by early 2021 or would I just slowly turn into a blight upon someone's sofa they would much prefer to have been a cum stain, instead that of a stain in the form of an actual live human being. How do you even broach that subject with someone, ""Hey, I know, we're in the middle of a pandemic, economic ruin and unprecedented civil unrest, you may even be out of a job and even this house as well soon enough, but I don't suppose you could lend me your sofa until it all blows over, could you?"" 

If I just go now, am I asking for trouble travelling during probably the most difficult time to travel in the 21st century, will it even be fun, people to meet, things to do and see? And then there's always the possibility things could get a whole lot worse? 

I know it sounds like I'm overthinking (probably) but it's such a big move that I won't be returning to how things are now, better or worse. What would you do?",13Oct2020,1

For some background information: I'm a 15 yo male, I was adopted by my grandparents when I was younger due to a *issue* that occurred in our youth.

About 3 weeks ago, me, my sister (12 yo), my Grandma, and Grandpa got into a argument. My sister had gotten into some trouble with my grandpa for doing something stupid. He threatened to *""spank her until she couldn't walk.""* Obviously, she cried and was scared but she's gotten yelled at before so no big deal right? 

Well, later on in the night, the police showed up to our house at around 10pm. I still don't know 100% what happened that night but anyways... 

The following morning, my sister told me that she called the police on my grandpa. Stupid mistake on her part. That evening around 6pm, my grandma and grandpa sat us down at the table and we had a discussion. My grandpa said that he has lost all trust in my sister, and will never do anything for her again. 

We were told that if me and my sister *""didn't get it together*"" we would be sent up to Tennessee to live with our other grandparents. 

To this day, (26 days later), we still haven't spoken to him. I don't know what to do, or how to even approach the subject about it to him on how hurt me and my sister are. I'm scared of being sent away, I don't want to have to start a new life again. What should I do? How do I tell him how its made us feel?

781,"She JUST got on her feet this year. She finally got a decent job late last year that put her on track to independence. She was able to buy a car, which she worked on her credit for like 4 years to get approved. Found a roommate and moved out of her mom's like 8 months ago, and it took her about 4 years to finally get into a position to do so. 

Now, within the last two month, all of this is crumbling in her palms. Her job slowly started getting slow as covid progressed, in turn of course affecting her income. 

Now she tells me she's had no work for over 3 weeks. She already had to defer all of her payments just to get into this position with limited income. Now she has no income and can't defer payments further. She's behind on her car already. Even if she was able to start working today, it would be hard to catch up. Thing is, she isn't going to be able to start working today and doesn't exactly have a date that she will. 

The car's going to get repo'd. When that happens, she won't be able to go to work.. When that happens, an eviction is up next...

What can she do? Shes a single mother that made a hellavu fight out of the struggle and finally got on her feet, only for some shit she can not control to say fuck that, fuck you, you're fucked. This will destroy her credit and she will be destined to live with her mom forever. 

There has got to be resources for this. I asked if she applied for unemployment, but She's not technically unemployed, work just doesn't have work for her. She doesn't want to leave the company because it's the best job she's had in her life..

Some lines are different lengths and the biggest issue is the line spacing is uneven which in my opinion doesn’t look good. My family and friends have said it looks fine and that you’d have to look hard to tell, so I feel a little better but not slightly convinced. Anyways I have wanted a black rose tattoo done, about 3-4 inches and nothing crazy detailed but obviously way more so than the star. I went in to the shop today to talk to the artist who did the star to talk about the rose that I want and he said he would have the design ready when I come in to get it done. He seems to do a lot of good work from his portfolio but I’m a little skeptical going back to him since I’m not completely happy with how the tattoo he already gave me turned out. I’d rather be able to go over what I want with him and not just see what he drew until minutes before I get it tattooed. He said if I want anything changed he will be able to do that but my thing is is that I don’t want to show up and be super disappointed with what he drew because it’s not at all what I wanted and have to make him redraw the whole thing over again, possibly fast and hastily. I called another shop and same thing, they’ll only show you the design the day of. Am I the only one who wants to be able to see the design in depth and really make sure it’s what I want before agreeing to it?

Now that we are both doing well and in full swing of our professional lives, we seem to have drifted apart in our personal one.

We still get along better than a lot of other couples I see, but there is no real bonding, no intimacy and no connection. Just two people who coexist. We, unspokenly, delegated out life responsibilities (IE chores, bills, home repairs, ect) to which I take the lions share because she is the bread winner. I guess the question is, can this be saved?

my friends unluckily got roped into a lease and one of them isnt staying there until next year. so i was debating on if i should take a break from home and my parents and head out for a little less than a month?

&amp;#x200B;

my friends have been pretty socially distant but its also a college town where a lot of people there are completely ignoring guidelines and still partying and being unsafe. i genuinely just want to be with my friends but am too worried about myself, the community im going in, and my parents when I come back. I know i cant control anyone elses actions but i think my complete isolation is mostly in part to trying to balance my parents' decisions. Both of them needlessly go out whether it be to see friends (mostly socially distant and sometimes not) or going to the store to look at and buy things. Located in the california in an area where cases have been pretty high 

&amp;#x200B;

both of them also have pre existing conditions. my mom has ms and diabetes while my dad also has diabetes as well heart ailments. I understand why they would wanna not wait for life during the pandemic but if im going to pause my life would it be okay to pause it somewhere else for a bit?",13Oct2020,1

803,"I seem to always be pursuing relationships (not strictly romantic, friends as well). I try to make friends and connections, but its seems when someone shows interest I stop responding and become less interested (typically). Even though I really want a strong connection and to make friends. I seem to put more effort in when it seems like it's hard and it might not happen and I'm not sure what the person thinks. But when someone is interested, I suddenly stop trying and often don't return their feelings, and I'll turn them down or ghost them. When someone shows interest in me I start to have low expectations and am suspicious and a little judgmental of them. It really sucks to think about this pattern because I can invest so much in the chase of one person, have interest from someone else and turn them down and not like them, and if a person I was formerly chasing starts to reciprocate, my feelings and interest for them seem to dwindle.",13Oct2020,1

811,"This is a long story and can branch for advice in many ways.
I have a 2017 hyundai sonata hybrid. On March 10th, 2020 the engine blew up. I towed it to my friends shop ive known for 20 years through our car clubs to diagnose it and repair it. Ir was approved for a new engine under my third-party warranty.
It took 5 months for hyundai to provide a new engine. New engine is installed but multiple issues still plague the vehicle from driving. Currently the vehicle is now at a local dealership for further ecu related diagnosis. Its been 7 months without a car I make payments on with no foreseeable repair in sight.
In the meantime i have been driving my 'toy' car corvette that used to be exclusively for track days and local meets and cruises. This car has extensive mods but is now also recently failing me. Every day the clutch is slipping worse and the driveline has some terrible noises and probably gonna cause catastrophic failure soon if the clutch doesnt fail first.
What do i do from here-on?
Im not opposed to selling the corvette, in fact ive had it listed a month now with only one person contacting me. Its kind of hard to sell a barely driving car that needs repairs without losing my ass in the money invested.also, its not that i cant repair the corvette, its that i dont have the time to have the only car i can drive to not be usable for a few weeks or more.
Im just not sure what angle to tackle this dilemma. If i got the hyundai back this wouldn't be an issue at all.
I could spend my savings on a downpayment for a third vehicle but that would eat my repair money.

812,"So I would first like to start off by apologizing if this isn’t the correct place to post or if I’m giving a bit too much information. So basically I practice safe sex and always pull-out aswell as use a condom when having sex with my girlfriend. We use condoms as our only form is of birth control. Basically every month about a week before her period I start freaking the fuck out about what if she is possibly pregnant, doesn’t help that sometimes her period can be 2-3 days late at times. So this month she is currently 1 day away from her period, she started to say she was a bit nauseous, a couple of days ago she said she had a lot of pinkish- white creamy discharge, and when we last had sex she said that she had a lot of pain in her upper abdomen (uterus area). So this leads me to go crazy and begin googling these different symptoms and as many people know PMS and pregnancy symptoms are nearly identical. With all that being said should I be worried about her being pregnant if I use a condom and also pull-out every single time. Also have any women experienced something similar to her symptoms and been fine",13Oct2020,1

815,"So I'm 19 year old woman and one of my friends is a 26 year old man. We met through cosplay and anime cons. He hasn't done anything wrong to me fortunately. But I hear constant rumors about him being a creep or pedophile. Alot of people claim to have evidence. I remember a girl claiming that he dated her when she was underage. I refuse to believe something when there's no solid evidence, but when a certain rumor is constantly brought up way too many times, it seems like there could be a chance that it may be true. I even notice some small signs from him. Starters, he really needs to be careful with the way he compliments others. It usually comes off as flirty. Sometimes he uses the words ""thicc"" or ""hot"" and it worries me because those words are often used when you're flirting or hitting on someone. Plus I fear that someday it will slip out of him when he compliments a cosplayer or anyone who could be a minor. Second, even though he has friends his age, he sometimes has alot or tries to befriend alot of minors. I know it doesn't sound that bad but it's a little suspicious for a grown adult wanting to befriend a minor so badly. Even though I grew up with friends way older than me and didn't get taken advantage of (only 1 way older person did that to me, the rest are good), most of the time when an adult really wants to befriends with a minor badly, it's usually for negative reasons. And third of all, I hear so many people talking abour him constantly claiming that he's a creep or pedo. They could be just rumors but when it's constantly getting brought up again and again, it may be true. Because of that I wanna see if it's true or not by trying to investigate him. Basically contacting anyone who has called him a creep or pedo, asking them what they know, their experience and possibly receipts. However I feel like that could be awkward and weird to come up to them and be like ""hey what do you know about ____? I heard he's a creep. What did he do?""

I graduated in 2016 with a Bachelors in CSD but didn’t end up loving the field enough to pursue a Masters.

821,"So I’m a 21 year old female who is dating a 28 year old male. To make this kind of short, we got together over a year ago online and we moved in together about 7-8 months ago. Needless to say, it hasn’t been going super well (should have expected that). I feel like I’m being brainwashed and manipulated in this relationship. My reasoning behind this is due to the fact that whenever we do fight, it’s always because he disrespects me. 

For example, him and I like to play video games and one day we were playing a game with some of his friends. They take the game way more seriously than I do because I like to focus more on having fun. Well my boyfriend yelled at me in front of everyone and continued to be mean to me the entire time we played. Afterwards, I confronted him about how disrespectful that was and all he had to say was “well don’t act like a child.” This then turned into a fight because I became furious and it ended up with me crying in the other room to cool off. All of our fights end up like this.

He also tells me that if I don’t have sex with him often then he’s gonna wanna leave. He also tells me that I need to run and eat healthy (which is understandable because I’m overweight). I’m on birth control because I’m with him and it causes my sex drive to decrease and I’ve also put on weight because of the birth control. I told him this and he refuses to believe me. I told him that I’ll get off of the birth control in order to fix the things he has issues with but he said he doesn’t wanna wear a condom. 

Long story short, I’m fucking miserable. I’ve tried everything to fix this. I’ve gone from communicating my feelings to doing nice things for him just to get him to stop treating me so bad. Nothing works and nothing changes. He’s impossible to communicate with and I wish I never moved in with him.

So here comes the part where I talk about washington. I’m still in college and I hate living in Texas. My plan was to finish my degree in Texas (it’s a lot cheaper here) and then go to grad school in Washington. Well, yesterday my great aunt passed away and it turns out she gave me a GIANT inheritance. It’s enough to help me move to Washington and pay for grad school. I even talked with my dad about it and he fully supports me on it.

I’m just.. terrified. It’s going to be a huge change for me and it’s going to be my first time truly being on my own and I just don’t know if I’m ready. I’m in the middle of my undergraduate degree. Do you guys think I should just go for it?

If you’ve gotten this far, thank you. I didn’t mean for the post to get super long but I don’t have anyone to vent to about my relationship. This is my first time moving out and also my first serious relationship and it can be hard for me to tell whether I’m being abused mentally or not. I started watching videos about it and reading up on it and I finally realized how much of a mess I’m in right now. I have a chance to get out I’m just terrified.",13Oct2020,1

823,"So this weekend I (19f) was hanging out in my dorm when my suite mate [R] (18F) whom I already didn't like that much but had a decent relationship with came in and asked if I had seen her dab pen, and was looking for my roommate [L] (18F). Unfortunately we were the only two in the suite and had told her No to both of those questions, well when I was coming  back from dinner she had sent a snapchat accusing me of stealing it to wich I responded that I had not and if she wanted to go through my stuff she could. After wich she insisted that I was being defensive and kept accusing me. After which I had just about enough and had threatened to get the RAs involved as our campus has no tolerance for that and it is illegal in our state, and I also knew she had a little bit if weed in her desk thanks to L telling me as they are friends. I knew that if I had confirmed a suspicion of weed the RAs would have every right to search our entire suite from top to bottom so this made her back down. But between this, my already existant disliking of her and a horrible week that week anyway I chose to do something that I knew was horrible, that would really hurt her and would be so easy to do. So R had been fooling around and was obsessed with this guy C, for a couple months but knew he didn't want anything serious. So with that bit if information and the fact that he tried to hit me up not once but three different times I finally decided that I was going to fool around with him just because I knew it would hurt her. I had made the plan and everything was going great I even had convinced him to subscribe to my onlyfans just as an added extra. the day before it was supposed to happen R had sent me a snapchat telling me to stop talking to him and I would have just ignored it and done it anyway but I was with my friends who are much more mean then I ever could have been. And with thier help I had told her that not only was I going to sleep with him, but how pitiful it is that she chases a guy who doesn't want her and how despite me being easy atleast he chased me. She had tried a few things such as calling me easy, and pointing out my unsuccessful onlyfans, as well as that she was hanging out with my crush (that despite liking I didn't necessarily care as I dont want anything serious as well as I knew how he was as I made the mistake of chasing him my first semester knowing he was talking to other girls so I was proven to be right to assume the same this year after I found out he was back. ) so with her comments to try to unnerve me with the help of my friends I was able to not be phased by anything she said but find great comebacks for everything she said. (This is something I am actually proud of as I am not one to fight with others and so being able to come up with good counterpoints and comebacks are not my strong suit. ) my favorite point being that despite my onlyfans being unsuccessful atleast C is subscribed to it. In the end nothing happened exept she pitched a fit to him and he blocked me and I got the last word in to shut her up and she posted on her snapchat story calling me out by name and calling me a hoe. Now my roommate L is telling me I should be nice and that was really awful of me to do and she's right it was awful and I know I'm in the wrong but I dont feel bad about it. Maybe its because that's not usually who I am as I try my best to avoid conflict or give into others to make them happy but with this despite knowing how mean and awful it is I honestly felt so powerful. And again this usually isn't me I apologize for everything and try to be the nicest person I know and it usually gives off the idea that I am a pushover. But Yesterday I was hanging out with another friend of mine from last year and he was telling me about how he struggled a lot during his gap year and how he got his life together and it made me remember how I was starting to do that my last semester before covid had became really bad and it made me realize what I'm doing right now isn't what I want and was exactly the reason I was not happy with myself. Not necessarily trying to sleep with this guy but just sleeping around in general and selling my photos as well as having an onlyfans. I hated knowing that people dont respect me because I dont respect myself and I did other things so I did look respectable to make up for what I do. But after a while I more or less got colder to feel more like ""who cares about these guys because they really dont care about me either, I'm using them just as much as they are using me"" and that really contrasted to what I was doing my 2nd semester. And so after hanging out with him I decided I was going to fix myself again. But the issue with that was that he mentioned how he also worked on trying to mend other relationships that were destroyed and now I know he's right and so is my roommate but I just can't feel guilty about hurting her and I dont know why I can't. And I don't even really feel guilty about not feeling guilty, I'm just more concerned as why I'm not. I want to think it's a power trip along with all the support of my other friends encouraging the behavior but I know not to blame others for my actions but I don't know. I know I need to make amends wherever I can but I also know not to apologize if I'm not actually sorry. And how am I supposed to be better when I can't feel bad about something that I knowingly did. That if anything I admit to taking pride in. That I was so happy I caused her pain. Can someone help me understand why I don't feel guilty? What I should do here because I want to be honest with myself as well as her if I was to apologize? I know I should be better and I started taking steps already to improve but I know how can I be someone that can look in the mirror and like themselves knowing I didn't do my best to be the nicest, kindest, most compassionate person I know. Knowing that I'm a terrible person who does bad things and doesn't feel any remorse. I know I'm really in the wrong here and I honestly just don't know what to do.",13Oct2020,1

831,"My mom (44y) used to be fit and active. One day she became extremely depressed and stopped getting out of bed when I was around 16 years old. I am now 23. She would occasionally try to clean, cook and drive. Then she just became more tired and weaker as time went on. At some point 2, maybe 3, years ago she had her first seizure. Her mom gets epileptic seizures, but my mom’s are not the same. To this day, the doctors still have no idea why she has them. They recently put her on a new pill to stop them from happening. We have gone over 6 months without any! Woohoo! She’s had many doctor visits and they have found nothing to help her. One doctor said she needs to get up once every hour, and all have said she needs to work out. 

My family knows this. We constantly encourage her to work out and eat better with us. I have boughten her numerous workout devices that she has wanted and she will not use them. I have to pull her off the couch myself and put her on them. I finally decided to get her a bike to be the simplest way to gain strength in her legs. She does not use anything. 

She gives up on herself more and more every single day and cries about it, about how she can no longer properly walk (sge has to use a walker to stop herself from falling) and I tell her how I am trying to help her and what we need to do together to help her gain strength. This has been on loop for years. I am so hurt seeing her get worse and I can’t help her, she does not let me help her. What can I do. 

She has been told different things by different doctors but the main thing that has been said is that she has dandy walker, and vertigo when she tries walking anywhere. All the doctors do is tell her to eat better, change her medications, and tell her to be more active and bill us.

I love my mom.. so much. I just want to help her but everything I’ve done to help, support and encourage her has done nothing. I know working out will help somewhat and show results in some way but I can’t get her to continue after a day or two. Please if anyone has any advice please..",13Oct2020,1

Yet today I was going to print out sheet music when I saw a tab with an email sent out to my friends for a surprise party. It's planned to be right after my golf practice, when my dad would drive me home straight to where they would have the party in the backyard. I never do well with surprises, and have had several bad experiences with past parties to the point that I don't want anything at all. I really don't know what to do because if I tell them they'll know I saw the email and still do it anyways, plus I'll get in trouble. If I do nothing, I'll be forced to sit through what I dread every year. Thanks so much to everyone who responds to this!",13Oct2020,1
837,"So I’m trying to get in shape (14 F) and I’ve been going at it for about two months now, which is somewhat incredible seeing as how I have a really hard time staying motivated. I would really love to get fit and get faster/stronger because it would help me a lot when I’m playing volleyball, which I do a lot (been playing for seven years). I have the drive to do the physical exertion, seeing as how I’ve been doing physical therapy for a little while on top of it, but I have a really hard time controlling myself when it comes to eating better. It doesn’t make things easier that I know how to bake, either. I eat way too much sugar and carbs, and I want to incorporate more protein and healthy fats into my diet.

838,"This is my (22M) first time posting and I just really think I need advice, help and people to talk to. So my last relationship was a few months under 7 years long, and it was filled with my ex (22F) abusing me and constantly cheating. The extent of cheating is horrid when I look back at it, for example, with 4 guys in one night when we broke up for the final time. The cheating was only one way as well, her cheating on me. Fast forward after I ended the relationship... it’s now a year later and I am in a new, happy, caring, loving relationship with a woman (22F) that I wouldn’t ever be able to imagine I would have met. So where’s the issue one might ask? I still have many problems from the past, for example; I constantly have dreams of my current gf cheating and am forced to constantly think about it because that has been my thought process for so many years prior. I still have very little sex drive at times because my ex gf has literally killed it and has made sex a negative thing to me that only really produces pain. My current gf and I are very open with each other, but whenever the topic turns to sexual encounters in the past, I always feel like she’s lying, even though I know she’s not. I think that stems from always being lied to in the past, so how can I learn to trust someone fully again? I don’t want this to affect me anymore, and if anyone has any ideas on what I can do, please share. It’s not fair that my current gf has to deal with someone else’s actions from the past, and trust me I am not trying to make her deal with it but it’s inevitable when I’m hurt and drowning in my own feelings. She wants to help but I end up wanting to push her away because that’s how I’ve always dealt with my issues, all alone. If you have any advice on how to deal with past relationship trauma and things that I can do by myself or my gf and I as a couple please let me know. She wants to be involved and supportive during my healing process, so don’t be scared to include her in the advice! Thank you all, I really appreciate your help.",13Oct2020,1

I have two close friends and we basically do everything together, it's just that I feel so left out even though we just had fun altogether.

843,"Normally I would not even consider cheating on an exam but since my university has closed their campus and it is harder to find tutoring and support. The course which I am most concerned about passing does not use an actual hardcover textbook, it uses a Wiley online textbook and Wiley PLUS online assignments. Although I have looked through the textbook power points and taken adequate notes, the quizzes and tests word the questions in a way that is different from the textbook, often confusing me. Quizlet is usually one of the best sources to use because it has similar answers and it helps me figure out how to solve the questions. The online instructions for timed quizzes also state

 ""Do not open new browser windows and/or tabs while active in a timed assignment. You may not login to another session (i.e., open a new browser or tab and log into WileyPLUS) while active in a timed assignment. Your original session will be terminated and you will lose all access to the timed assignment.""

844,"Hi Reddit, I need some advice. 
I was with my ex partner for almost 3 years. 
He broke up with me at the beginning of the pandemic I had to completely flip my life and start a new. 

Backstory to help understand: we had trust issues and just in general our communication was lacking. I tried reaching out a couple times and he didn’t want anything to do with me, saying he was moving on. So i let it be, and also knew it was in my best interest to try and move on , if he doesnt want me i shouldnt stay right? 

I did my best and tried to go out this summer and talk to new people.I talk to people online, went on a couple dates, but no one really compares to the connection i felt with my ex. We recently saw each other. I felt pathetic, but i had to ask him to give us another shot,. I want our relationship back, he was my bestfriend and because of how things ended, im just feeling lost. I dont have any friends or parents to ask for advice on this. we recently saw eachother after i reached out and talked things quickly over, how we want to try again. When things ended we had a lot of trust issues, he didn’t pay attention or show me any intimacy towards the last year of our relationship and i found out the reasons , which is why i feel apart and basically self sabotaged our relationship earlier this year. I feel like alot of things went wrong because of me. I feel like it was honestly my fault if i wasnt so insecure. (I have BPD, and actively see a therapist for treatment. I know this is also a big part of where my insecurities stem from) I can not go back into this feeling unwanted or like i’m going to be lied to again. I know love can make you blind, but he’s gotten my hopes up that what we had was real, im just scared that he was just possibly looking to hookup. Im feeling hopeful but my head is keeping its guard. I want to try again, but with proceeding caution. 

I guess i’m looking to find advice on if anyone has similar experiences...any advice on how to stay sane and communicate on a healthy level to figure out if he wants to try? 
I really don’t want to smother him with questions, as I want to treat it like we’re new again, but at the same time we do have the history we had together",13Oct2020,1

I have been following a lot of subreddits for years(especially in youtube), and really excited for my 1st post.
(please forgive my english, I'm not a native speaker)

I am in late 20s and I have been obese for most part of my life. That lead to quite a lot of psychological issues. I tried various diets in the past couple of years. Yo yo ing my way to net increase of 16kgs. A major part of dieting is creating a proper, sustainable meal plan and food logging. I use myfitness pal to track calories. That solves the later half of the problem. I have tried numerous online applications to create meal plans, but none seen to work for me. So i decided to create my own plan. Creating the meal plan manually (without use of computers) will result in me analysing a whole lot of data with pen and paper. Thats why I am here.

I want to create a database of foods that i want to eat, with their micro and macronutrients. Assign them properties, such as, 
1. Type of food
2. which two would go together, (like bread and peanut butter) and which dont (like green tea and guacamole),
3. Which foods are considered stand alone, which food combinations are allowed
4. Which foods that are good for breakfast, lunch, and dinner respectively
Etc.

Then i want to create an application, where i can enter the macro and micro requirements for the day, and create a meal plan for the day using the entered values and database.

I have next to 0 experience in programming. But, i am willing to put my food down and learn anything to do this.

Please help me, with the following
1. Programs to use to create database, and applications.
2. Languages to learn
3. A bit of guidance on how to make it

Thanks in advance.",13Oct2020,1

EVERY day, or every other day if I’m lucky, she makes me drive out and get her cigarettes and monster and papers for her weed, she’s literally NEVER left the house this entire year. No matter if I just got off work and am exhausted, she will be complaining about not having cigarettes or drinks for hours so I put up with it so I can rest.

She makes me commit time card fraud for a job I’ve only been to once, then transfer all the money to her. I only lived with her because I was inpatient for a serious mental disorder, and I feel like she’s had me when I’m down but this is too much. When the absentee ballots got sent in, she filled. mine. out. for. me behind my back. I know I wanted to vote differently than her and I told her so, but she did it anyways. 

Every day she will complain about the dishes in the sink that SHE creates, the trash SHE creates, and why I’m not doing anything about it. She orders doordash twice a day, every day,  so our house piles up trash bags like no ones business. She spends so much money on delivery that I feel like it would be more expensive than our rent every month. Why can’t she just do the dishes if IM working and she has nothing else to do? 

I think I just needed to vent. But in this day and age someone fresh out of high school can’t very well live on her own with rent being as high as it is.

860,"Im (27f) having an awful time figuring out how to end my relationship with my (27m) boyfriend. We have been together for a little over a year and a half, and I’m very unhappy. I have crippling anxiety as well as MDD (major depressive disorder, and this has all made it so incredibly hard for me to end things. I walk around with what feels like a 50 lb brick weighing on my chest constantly. The relationship has had issues. He cheated once with his ex, and I believe he may have social issues. He would put me down and make me feel stupid on purpose, as well as tell me I’m wrong constantly, even over the smallest things. If I said “milk is on sale at Walmart”, he’d probably reply “nope no you’re wrong. That’s not right. “ 

Him acting this way has beaten down my self esteem. We’ve talked about these issues, and I’ve told him how I felt, and he does listen very well, and doesn’t snap back at me. He’ll try really hard and be great for a week or so until he goes back I to his habits (giving me no affection if he’s had a bad day just to make my day worse, talk down on me etc.) 

We had one of these talks about two weeks ago and he has been really great. But the heart can forgive but the mind can never forget the way he has made me feel in the past time and time again. I want out of the relationship, but I have taken a step back and realize that this isn’t healthy. I cannot change someone. I am a person with high anxiety and depression, and need a large amount of reassurance and affection. I have told him this before and he says “well I can’t just give you hugs and be sweet when you’re sad because then you’ll just expect me to do that all the time when you’re sad”.
Well uhh.... duh yes you’re my boyfriend and my partner. I expect support. 
Anyways, it’s not healthy. I need things from him that he can’t give me because that’s just not him. And that’s okay. I have no anger towards him and it’s not his fault. People are different and that’s alright. 

Not the issues is this. I am at my breaking point. We live together and I need to get out. I have tried before but he has cried and said all the “right things” in the moment and I caved and stayed. He is going out this evening and I’m thinking about packing my things while he is gone. 

Is this cruel? Am I horrible for this? My anxiety has made it literally impossible for me to have this conversation and pack my things in front of him.

Background: I am currently attending a trade school. Our class size is small, only 3 including myself, due to COVID-19. I regularly show up to class and I am genuinely trying to learn and wanting to attain my degree. “Student A” consistently shows up to class but constantly talks about how he’s just showing up for a paycheck (gets paid from rehab program) and seems to not care about his education at all. “Student B” has not shown up for class in week and I am assuming will drop out soon. 

Issue: Student A has some issues. Not that it’s a bad thing to have issues (everyone does) but they have me genuinely concerned about the safety of myself and others attending the school. He moved from out of state after being released from prison. From my understanding he received a felony for drug related charges. He moved to where our school is located because of a rehab program he is currently in. He constantly talks about all the medication he takes because he has anger problems and to not mess with him because he will “snap”.For example, we recently changed our on campus schedule and he couldn’t understand the updated schedule. He kept telling me how he was going to “snap” on our instructor because some how it was our instructors fault that he couldn’t understand the new schedule. He constantly gets into arguments with our instructors, taking time away from my education, which is already pretty limited due to COVID-19. He talks about selling/doing hard drugs. He has tried getting me to do some and sells to other students on campus. As I stated before, he doesn’t really care about actually learning what is taught but he has told me that if he doesn’t get good grades he won’t keep getting paid from the rehab program. So he constantly has me help him by doing some of his homework for him and some exams, and in turn taking away from my time to learn. We have all of our classes together so it not like I only have to deal with them a few hours a day. I have been attending for only a few months now and tried to put up with him but I just can’t do it anymore. Most of my instructors are older and about to retire so I don’t think they pay much attention or even notice what is going on. I’m new to this college/trade school thing and I don’t know what resources I have to use. I don’t want to speak with our instructors about the issue for fear of retaliation from Student A. Has anyone else had experience with a toxic classmate? Does anyone have any advice on who I should talk to at the school? I am starting to resent going to school because I fear he will “snap” on me one day. Any advice will seriously help because my grades are starting to suffer due to this.

869,"TLDR; I have outgrown my judgemental best friend of 11 years and don't feel like talking to her anymore because of opposite personalities and needs.

I (21F) have known my best friend (21F) since we were in fifth grade. We went to the same school, spent our formative years together, grew with each other. We were there for each other through tough break ups, toxic relationships, academic failures, and I knew her deepest secrets. I have never been very comfortable confiding in her. She has had major relationship and interpersonal problems since school and I've always been her go-to person for sharing these problems. This didn't leave me with enough space to talk about my problems as I didn't want to her to worry about yet another thing. 
I've been depressed since we were in ninth grade. I used to skip school a lot, break down in between classes, and became pretty negligent towards my academic engagements. I didn't see the signs then and neither did my best friend. Also, I was so used to not confiding in her that I didn't talk to her about what I had been feeling. Still, we were pretty close-knit in school and she helped me get through a horrible break up and I did the same for her.

We had to go to university in different cities but we used to talk over the phone frequently. Now, phone calls make me feel anxious and I try to avoid them unless they are absolutely necessary. So, it is mostly my best friend who initiates phone calls which makes her feel that I don't feel like talking to her anymore. I hate to admit this but this is actually true. It took me years to realise that even though she's a good friend who cares for me, I'm not sure if I like her as a person who would be a good fit for me. She often indulges in body-shaming others and talking about superficial stuff like the kind of clothes someone wears, who's dating who. I don't enjoy these conversations. I like talking about politics, economics, mental health. I used to indulge in judging people based on their bodies in school but it was probably just an attempt to bond with my best friend. I'm not comfortable with that shit anymore.

Apart from this, she's not the kind of person I can relate with. She doesn't feel the need to grow intellectually and doesn't have as much internal conflicts as I do. That makes her a boring presence in my life.

She is extremely judgmental of a lot of things and I've never truly been myself in her presence as a result. She mocks people who pursue unconventional career paths, people who are expressive and overshare on social media, people who are trying their best at perfecting something but are not quite good at it. I'm all of these things but she has no clue because I'm afraid she'll judge me.

I feel like I've outgrown her. But, I don't want to cut her off because we've known each other for too long to turn strangers and also because it will break her heart.

Since I really love Working from home I decided I would work hard to clear all the work and manage the high volume by myself. It sucks but I can do it. I was doing pretty good and completing all the work before the end of my shift. In response my boss has added more and more tasks that I have to complete during my shift - unrelated to the position I was originally hired for. Most of my shift I am not even keying anymore. 

She has me doing training for offshore employees, doing QA for first shift and processing documents and top of that I'm in an email chain with the heads of all the departments for my branch, the branch in India and the one in Mexico where I send hourly updates every day because it ""helps her with her with her reports"". I am the only employee being asked to do this and I am the only employee in the email chain of 30 people in 3 countries who isn't in a management position.

It's annoying but I'm managing it okay and its still working from home so I don't complain. But than I start noticing PTO hours being used on my paycheck even though I never used PTO since starting employment here. I emailed my boss about this and her response was ""When ever you clock in late, pto is automatically deducted to make up for the missing time so it adds up to 40 hours by the end of the pay period."" Thats hard to believe since iv never ran into this issue in the past. PTO has only been used on my last couple of checks starting in August. Another issue is if I am late 4 minutes clocking in - I'll stay 4 mins after my shift to make up the time and yet still my PTO is being used.

Since its just me working second shift there are days where we get high volume and I know if I take a break or lunch I will not be able to finish workload by the deadline. So I work through it, complete my shift and I successfully meet the deadline even with all the additional tasks that she has me doing even though I have to skip my lunch some days to meet deadline. 

Yesterday I got an email from my boss soon as the pay period ended and before I get my check and she says that Lunches and breaks are mandatory and the system ""automatically deducts 30mins after 5 hours of working"" So that means the days I worked through my lunch I am not getting paid for the 30mins and those minutes add up fast because we usually get high volume. I already know I can't really trust her since she lied about the PTO hours being automatically deducted like I mentioned earlier. I am very confident that she is manually removing hours from my time sheet.  

I believe I am being taken advantage of and when I saw my job on indeed paying more for new employees than I currently make it confirmed that. I submitted my application to the position that I already work for and havnt gotten a response. I havn't messaged my boss about it yet. 

One last thing I have to say so you get a good sense of who my boss is. She sent me my stats (typing speed) in September saying it was low and that I needed to bring it up. It showed my typing speed for the months of June July August and September. I said no problem I'll bring it up. Flashforward to the next month October I get another email saying my stats are too low and it is ""unacceptable"". This email included my stats from the months of June July August and September like the last one did but all the numbers were significantly reduced. I asked my boss three times about the discrepancy even sending screenshot attachments to her and I have not gotten a response. 

At this point I don't know if working from home is nice enough to ignore all of this. I can ignore a lot, but im seeing it get increasingly worse. What are my options? Can I file for unemployment? One of the eligibility requirements for workers who quit is that they have to quit for good cause. I think working hours and not getting paid for them is good cause. (The website even says that its good cause). What should I do? I have no idea how to handle any of this please help. Thank you.",13Oct2020,1

876,"So I am already moved in and signed my lease. My lease states that in order to get a dog, I have to have the leasing office approve it first, then put down a hefty deposit on TOP of paying monthly. It’s an insane amount of money that’s not worth it in my opinion, especially because they rented me the apartment in awful and dirty condition (they said it was going to be cleaned and it never was). 

I live in a large complex with 60+ buildings, each with 6 apartments in them. I never see anyone from the leasing office, and I don’t think they know me that well. 

Would I be able to get away with just getting a dog and not telling them? Nearly everyone in the entire complex and all buildings have dogs, so I wouldn’t stand out by any means. I’m getting a large breed dog, and plenty of my neighbors and other people around the complex have large/medium dogs.

906,"Hello Everyone,

I need some help!  I am part of a small group of individuals in rural Maine that have been gathering to stand in solidarity against Systemic Racism, Police Brutality, White Supremacy, Neo-fascism, Misogyny, Homophobia, Transphobia, Anti-Semitism, Xenophobia, Voter Suppression/Election Fraud,  Economic Injustice, Imperialism, and Environmental Degradation/Climate Change.  It’s a long list, so we call ourselves Solidarity &gt;Town Name&lt;.  Our group stands at the only intersection with traffic lights, in our small coastal town of roughly 5,000 citizens, holding signs that range from BLM to Rainbows.

Black Lives Matter has been a very important issue for a majority of our demonstrators, and we have now been labeled BLM and ANTIFA by citizens in opposition of our message.  Most recently, a gentleman that has a history of verbal and physical interaction with our group submitted the a letter to our local weekly newspaper.  Transcript below for easier reading.

The newspaper is a small 8 page paper that shares local events, business ads, town news, etc.  This kind of hard hitting letter is very uncommon, and off brand.  This is an attack on not only our demonstrations, but also makes deep cutting references to some of our demonstrators involvement in the community.  Calling out our character, and our motives.  What fires us up the most is that this gentleman parked his car on the road, exited his vehicle, approached us and screamed in our faces.  Calling us a number of things, but my favorite was being called a “white asshole"".(We have video, and have filed a report with local law enforcement.)  Not that it really matters, but for context this gentleman is not black, and is originally from New York City.  We need to respond.

Right now I am mad, I need help formulating a response.  We are going to submit a letter to the paper, but are also going to release a statement to our community and other media outlets.

We are white, and that has been the most stated complaint by our opposition.  How do we respond and share our message of solidarity with our community, without our skin color  derailing the conversation?  What is the proper way of going about this?

I would really appreciate everyone’s input as I am struggling with this.  Open to advice, statistics, and well crafted responses...

Love and Peace.

&gt;**Making all our lives matter in this world**  
&gt;  
&gt;Why would I want to support a group that encourages violence, hatred, looting and turns their back when a black child or adult is killed by a black person.  When the time a black death counts to Black Lives Matter is when it involves a police officers.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, according to BLM, it doesn’t matter if the person shot by police was committing a crime, if a sexual assault was committed, if drugs and guns were involved, drugs sold within the community to make poor people’s lives even worse.  The majority of crimes and murders committed against blacks are committed by blacks.  Yet BLM doesn’t demonstrate against this or offer any guidance.  
&gt;  
&gt;There were people found burned alive in some of the vandalized and burned stores.  I saw a photo on one news report, I saw it reported once, but never again.  I find it hard to see the difference between the Ku Klux Klan and BLM.  
&gt;  
&gt;Violence is violence and hatred is hatred, no matter who is promoting it.  
&gt;  
&gt;I ask have you ever demonstrated, to show support for police officers who have given their lives to protect you.  Have you ever shown support for their families.  
&gt;  
&gt;So I ask the demonstrators on the bridge, what is it that you are promoting and for what reason?  Sometimes people just want to feel important and that is their only reason.  So, what is your reason?  I also ask the following, did you ever live in a black community?  Did you ever live in an apartment building that was 70 percent black?  Did you ever volunteer and go into black homes to tutor children?  Did you ever work in a home for abused children in a black community?  How many black friends’ funerals have you had to attend, some of whom had died a violent death by other blacks?  Were you ever elected by different, predominately black members to represent them?  One group did for 25 years straight.  Do you have an black relatives?  
&gt;  
&gt;Well, I can answer “yes” to all of the above.  Does that make me a good or better person?  No.  What matters is the realization that color does not make or separate people, but values do.  There are only two types of people, but values do.  There are only two types of people in the world, and that’s people that love and people that hate, good people and bad people.  You just have to choose your side.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since we are on the topic of color, to BLM, open your eyes, if not your hearts, very few people are black, very few people are white.  In reality, we ALL are just a different shade of brown.  We are all actually the same, something that BLM may find too hard to accept.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am entering my 74th year and I still do volunteer work with four organizations to try to help better the human condition.  So, here’s a challenge to you demonstrators.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last week I failed in mediating a rent conflict between a soon-to-be homeless person and a motel.  Some of you people live in large houses, with a lot of bedrooms, alone.  Why not really help, take the person in and help change their life for the better?  
&gt;  
&gt;Hey, you know, I believe there are some African-Americans and immigrants residing there.  Here;s your chance to really make a difference, I know, it requires work and it’s not as easy and as much fun as demonstrating or just making cookies, but it really makes a difference in peoples’ lives.  Let me know.

AITA because I reported a pedophile to a teacher?
To give back ground information I (16f) had an ex-friend (15f) Jay (fake names) who last year was being sexually harrased by an adult volunteer at the school. He was sending her in detail text messages about what he wanted to do to her and was trying to get her to go places with him to do things. I reported him and it was taken care of. He's no longer aloud near the school. Now here's where it gets tricky, about a month later Jay started talking about this army recruiter at our school. She had gotten his number and told me that they talked about their sex lifes. She went on to say that if she and her boyfriend broke up again she'd have sex with him. Apparently they had talked about it. I told her how wrong it was and that it was disgusting. That she didn't know what she was doing. We stopped being friends after that. This happened last year. I don't know what ever happened with that but once covid is cleared he will be coming back to the school. It kept weighing down on me. I originally didn't want to report it because this had JUST happened to Jay and the more I thought about it the more scared I got. What if they think I'm lying for attention? What if SHE says I'm lying. I couldn't take it anymore though. I kept thinking about all the different girls that could fall victim to him, so I emailed the JROTC teacher about it explaining things. Am I the asshole for waiting so long? Am I the asshole for reporting in the first place?",13Oct2020,1

911,"I’m in Australia and to get my second year visa I have to do 88 days mandatory farm work. My friend I met in Sydney had invited my bf and I over to her farm. She paid for flights and accommodation until we get paid on Friday (today is Wednesday). I’ve worked 3 days and I’ve cried more than I have the entirety of last month. My job is to grab a cardboard box and pack 6-12 melons and then carry the box to where the box so the boys can mark it and carry it away. All in 40°C heat (104f). The cardboard gives me deep cuts that are like paper cuts but worse and they all end up in the creases of my hand where they bend. My fingertips end up throbbing by the end of the day. Also, by the end of the day my feet hurt so much that it pains me to stand. But I don’t mind that as that happened to me in my other farm job and it got easier with time. 

I’ve done farm work before but nowhere near as hard or stressful as this. It gets so stressful that I have to go to the bathroom for a little cry. And then when I get home I cry. I have to get my bf to make me food that doesn’t need a fork, brush my hair and change my clothes for me because my hands are so hurt. And I cry because of how rubbish I feel that I’m letting my friend down that took me all the way from the other side of the country to be with her and work with her. To be honest, I regret coming here. I wish I stayed at my other farm job. I don’t even feel like this is worth it anymore. At this point I’d rather be happy and able to dress myself back in England than to do this for a second year. But I can’t leave because of my boyfriend and I can’t let down my friend. 

We start at 6am and get home at about 6pm. We have about 3-4 hours before bed and during those hours all I can think about is work the next day and how I’m going to be in such pain. I know that I haven’t been working here long and my endurance will get better and my hands will work harder. I know that for sure. But this pain clouds my view of the near future and all I can see is hurt for these days to come. All I’ve been able to think about too is how I want a cuddle from my Mum who’s 10,000 miles away.

All I would like from you guys is advice. How do I help myself mentally? Physically? How do I get through this initial stage? Help me.",13Oct2020,1

Backstory, I’m a bit of a late bloomer and was a virgin up until the age 26.  Reasons being due my social anxiety from bullying in childhood and fear of rejection.  I decided to go to therapy and get help pertaining to those issues.  My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost a year.  She’s the only girl I’ve ever been with and I’m her 10th partner.  I know that may not seem like much for a 31 year old woman to many of you but it took me by surprise. Her sexual past bothers me and the fact that she’s been with nine other guys makes me feel bad and down on myself.  I often feel intimated and as if she’s comparing me to them.  I’ve tried to just get over it but it’s always looming in the back of my mind.  I’m tired of feeling like shit about it.  Many of you will just say I’m being insecure, immature or irrational but I feel the way I do.  I decided the best thing to do is to end the relationship so she can find someone else and I can try to play the field to hopefully gain more experience.  I really care about her and don’t want to hurt her. How do you suggest I go about telling her?  If you have any constructive, helpful advice, please feel free to share.

917,"(Warning: Talk of suicidal red flag behavior in this post)

A friend of the family, who I will call Uncle, has not had it easy the past while. His wife passed away as soon as he retired from a physical career, then his daughter passed away of the very same condition a year later. He has several other children and many grandchildren, as well as us weird 'extended family'. Everyone just calls him Uncle. 

Recently, he has been getting rid of a bunch of his stuff at home. He had expressed that he doesn't want to live in that house anymore, which is understandable. He wants to move to a different city, *away* from his children. 

At the last get together (pre-COVID), I asked some of his kids what kind of support he has been getting at home or from grief counsellors to deal with his issues. They brushed it off and said that if he needed help, he would ask for it. 

I learned recently that Uncle has sold nearly all of his worldly possessions and signed his house over to his oldest child. He decided to move into a cheap apartment in another city. He called me the other day and asked if I would take his two cats, because he couldn't keep them anymore. I would if I didn't already have four cats. He started crying on the phone and told me he was really struggling to find a home for his cats. I offered to help, and asked him if we could meet for coffee or if I could drive over to meet him. He wouldn't tell me where he moved to. 

I called up a few of his kids and told them that all of these behaviors are huge huge huge red flags for someone who isn't planning to live much longer. One yelled at me for even suggesting it. The other two told me I was being paranoid and it wasn't a big issue and to not talk about it anymore. Even some of my own relatives (his friends) told me that I was being paranoid and that I shouldn't talk about it because it makes people uncomfortable.

I can't tell of they're in denial or just don't care? Maybe they can't even see it? Don't want to see it? Can't imagine having such a conversation?

It's an uncomfortable topic, but I did all of these things when I was planning for my own death. 

I don't know where Uncle lives now. He hasn't answered the past few times I've called. I learned that someone did end up taking the two cats. His kids say that they saw him on Thanksgiving (this weekend) and that 'he was doing well'. 

Is there anything I can do? I'm not a blood relative, and it isn't like he is in an active suicide attempt. But the signs are all there that he needs support or help or someone. I don't even know where he lives anymore though. All I have is a phone number.",13Oct2020,1
918,"So my girlfriend has a friend who for anonymity’s sake we shall call Ruth. Ruth is a horrible fucking person, and i’ll tell you why. Think of all the bad qualities a person could have. Lying, attention seeking, bad hygiene, irresponsible, selfish, etc. Ruth is all of these things. She lies to everyone about everything. She will endanger herself and others just for 5 minutes of attention (positive or negative).  She smells horrible and has month old used tampons in her room AND car. She has unprotected sex and jokes about the consequences. She will throw anyone under the bus to save her own ass if need be. So yeah, she’s the worst. It’s especially sucked because her mom is best friends and next door neighbors with her aunt (basically her other mom that she sees like every week). Because of this, my girlfriend had felt obligated to continue her friendship with Ruth, despite how awful she is. The final important aspect of the background of this story is the fact that myself and Ruth have a very slight sexual history (we exchanged nudes over snapchat several years ago). For some reason, Ruth seems to think me and her have some special connection because of it. She brings it up constantly in front of my girlfriend and rubs it in her face. I avoid Ruth like the plague because I can’t stand her and also because I realize how uncomfortable it is for my girlfriend when she flirts with me and brings up shit from the past. Unfortunately, I’ve had to be around Ruth a lot because I go to my girlfriends aunts house all the time with her. (They’re neighbors with Ruth). We’ve had a lot of drama lately with Ruth, because Ruth managed to find a man as bad as she is. He brags about stealing, is unemployed and lives with parents at 19 (never had a job), Says he prefers stupid girls in front of her, says he knows she will never leave him no matter what he does, and he has cheated on her. So basically, Ruth just recently cheated on him as revenge. He called Ruth’s mom to snitch on her when she told him and this happening kinda brought up the topic of just how toxic their relationship is. My girlfriend pretty told her aunt how toxic both of them are, so when they all had a big meeting to discuss this, her aunt brought up all she’d been told. Ruth and her boyfriend said my girlfriend is a liar and only made up all of that because she’s jealous of their relationship. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Anyways, Ruth’s parents are kinda idiots who at this point are extremely desperate for their daughter to have any credibility whatsoever, so they take Ruth’s side and accuse my girlfriend of lying. My girlfriend, although furious, has enough evidence to not only prove she didn’t lie, but probably put both of them in jail. She is kinda waiting to see how the best way to handle this situation. As far as Ruth knows, my girlfriend has no idea about this. Ruth somehow managed to have another friend for a short period of time. We shall call this friend Abby. She ended up blocking abby on everything basically because she called her out for being a toxic piece of shit. Ruth hits up my girlfriend complaining about how Abby defied her and said things that she didn’t agree with. Naturally, me and my girlfriend hit up Abby because not only is she a needed ally, but Ruth has been actively keeping us from ever meeting Abby so we assume she’s been feeding her lies about us. We were very correct in that assumption. Abby (who is just the nicest person ever) told us how Ruth is claiming I sexually assaulted her multiple times including touching her inappropriately and locking her in a room with me against her will. This of course never happened. I have never even been alone with her without my girlfriend being there. Ruth also claims i’m obsessed with her and flirt with her all the time. She also told Abby that me and her were best friends even tho I haven’t texted her or was willfully friendly towards her in any way for years. Me, my girlfriend, and Abby are furious, but we don’t know how to best handle this situation. We know that her parents wouldn’t do anything, and we know Ruth would just call us liars and frame herself as the victim. I’m really paranoid because i’ve been falsely accused of rape before and it really really sucks and has really negatively impacted my life. Part of me just wants to block her on everything and do my best to avoid her, but I also don’t want her spreading more lies. What do y’all think?",13Oct2020,1

923,"So I have been working for this company for almost 6   years, 4 of them as a""Senior"" doing customer service and luckily the company I work for was not really affected by the pandemic,   


There were a lot of changes internally and the past 9 - 11 months they kind of moved me over to also do onboarding that mostly took most of my time training up new clients getting them set up with their own system etc.  


Then my GF got a job at a Different company with 0 experience also as a customer service agent and here base pay/take-home pay was not a lot less than what I am getting after doing this for so long and being a Senior agent.  


I went to my Team lead and told her that I have been to find out what my GF is getting with a bunch of additional privileges I am kind of disappointed at what they are paying me.  
HR had a meeting with me and the rest of the team members and all but 1 person said that they feel we may be getting a bit of a low income for the work we do.  


Two weeks later my team lead contacts me and tells me that this onboarding job I have been doing for the last almost 11 months will not be a position and that they are going to hire someone that does just that, without asking me if I would be interested in taking the position that I have been doing.

&amp;#x200B;

They do, however,  ask the person that has been working here for 3 years less than me and that has almost never worked with the specific program before if she would like to have it.  
On top of that, they also made that same person employee of the month and made a massive deal about it,

Keep in mind this was the only person that said they are fine with the income they are getting.  
So starting in Nov I will go back to being a basic customer service agent.  


To a lot of you, this may seem like a basic entry-level job and it may be but you have to remember I work in a 3rd world country doing cs for a US company being paid about 1000usd a month with 0 and I mean 0 privileges.  


So by the looks of it, they are trying really hard to work me out of this company since I said something about the pay.  
I will now go back to doing the exact same stuff I did as the first day.  


I really can afford to lose this job but at the current rate, they will let me go for questionable reasons as I have seen them to this countless times with other people before.

924,"So, I hope I don’t offend anyone with this or asking this. But I think I’m going a bit crazy. So if anyone out there is Religious I recommend you don’t read. 

Essentially, I’m a man of science. I’m very science oriented and want to go into physics after I finish my GCSE’s. So I’ve always said to myself that it’s almost impossible for there to be a being out there such as God. Who created earth and all. 

I’m someone who believes in the Big Bang. I’m an atheist essentially. 

But weirdly enough a lot of events have been going on that seem to correlate to my culture lessons. Almost exactly. The other day we were taught about the story of job. How he kept being put under a bunch of negative things from the devil to essentially test his dedication to god. Eventually afterwards he was rewarded for still believing in god and not giving up.

That, is almost exactly what’s been going on here. Every week of school felt like it got worse and worse. More homework. My girlfriend started drifting away and flirting with my best mate. My other friend is moving school. My other other friend has recently been diagnose with depression. It went to shit. I felt so shit. 

But then. It’s like god answered me. I don’t know. I just felt like something out there could hear me. The culture lessons just kept making more and more sense. I felt like everything was just fixing itself. I was told I have to be off school because someone in my class got covid, as bad as it is, I needed this time off. And not only that, my best mate has to stay in. 

My friend is now getting therapy. My stress is going down. 

It’s literally like God heard me. I don’t know what it is but I keep doubting myself, maybe there is someone out there who can hear me and change things? 

Am I just going through relief or something? And if I end up still going through all of this, believing he’s real, what do i do? Because I don’t think he made the universe or anything, yet I’m beginning to believe there’s someone out there with power to do something.",13Oct2020,1

929,"Current life situation: I am working at a restaurant as a cook getting paid fairly well. I started working about a month ago. I work part time because I lose motivation and energy very fast working in a fast paced environment such as Applebee’s. When I was younger (15-16 y/o) , I was very muscular and strong, unfortunately I lost those gains ( I will explain later how), so I started weightlifting two weeks ago and so far I have been consistent and will continue to be because it’s the only thing that I really do that doesn’t make me feel like a lazy bum, piece of sh*t. Other than that my social life recently has been fairly decent. I have been going to party’s, socializing, drinking, meeting different people, etc. I have made a few friends during these last three weeks at work and at party’s but before that I was completely alone and very lonely. My life was very depressing and I had severe social anxiety going anywhere but that is getting better due to going to work and hanging out with people on the weekends. I am close with my family, but my mom asks more than what I can give. She wants me to spend more time with them and the family but I have no desire to, I try my best and spend time when I can but I want to spend time with friends and have crazy experiences. To sum it up my bad habits are , worrying, nicotine, laziness, and doubting myself. My good habits are , weight lifting, drinking water, and trying to better myself.

Back story: Three years ago, I was very bright kid, did well in school, was built attractive , boosted others with my presence, had joy in my heart. Two years ago, I started getting addicted to weed. My father passed away and two months before he passed I smoked once a week with my friend. After he passed it became a twice a week thing and eventually three times a day. The reason I quit is because I had a traumatic experience the very last time I took it, recently I did it again and it was bliss. Now that I know there is no fear of me doing it I may do it occasionally but never as often as I used to until I get my life situated. Anyways, I dated this girl ( my last ex) 5 months after my dad passed and I dated her until December two years ago. A couple of times when I smoked, I would talk to her on FaceTime and I heard moaning like she was fuc*ing somebody, but it never happened when I was sober and we would FaceTime every night. After we broke up, I made a new friend, we had good times but the last few times we hung out, things started getting really weird ( message me) So I cut it off with him, found new friends in my pursuit to quit weed. I quit successfully and I was in a state of constant depression because of it. The second half of junior year I failed two classes and failed to make them up the next summer. I had completely lost my motivation for school and didn’t care to socialize with anyone. Senior year came around and I dropped out , fortunately I graduated because of alternative school ( took me a month and a half to finish 10 high school credits ) I cheated through it, but it was still hard work nevertheless.

My concerns: I think I am starting to rebuild myself back up, I’m starting to workout again, starting to have a positive frame of mind that I can be better and believe it. The only thing that is really bugging me is money and my career life. I always had this belief that things will come to me, but I’ve been thinking about it recently, and I know that isn’t reality. I graduated this year in January, I do not think I could survive college, ever since I was young I loved computers and tech. I do not want to work a 9-5, I can barely survive working full time. What do you guys recommend, I should take my life next ? 

P.S I know this luxury of not having any responsibilities won’t last forever that’s why I am trying to come up with a plan to work out my finances and be financially independent, so I can let go of that worry and truly enjoy what life has to offer.",13Oct2020,1

I'd been struggling to find a job that paid enough for me to live on while in school, but in February 2020, I was able to find one at (what I thought) was a highly professional club of sorts. Not a night club, but a club for a particular sport.

**Background:** As I began training, I realized a few people around me were bad apples and I made sure to steer clear of them and avoid any indications we were friends. This has given me some negative feedback which my supervisor let me know about, but she understood as she was the one that told me to avoid these people.

Well, then my boss started making nitpicky comments about me after I cut my hair from a short bob to a pixie (which is what it was when I was hired). I think he's just a bit homophobic and couldn't find fault with my performance, so he went to my appearance. He told me I need to 'smile' at him and other employees more. While this targeted comment definitely riled me up, I didn't do anything about it and continued to go about with my work. Then my supervisor mentioned I needed to smile more every single day I showed up for a shift. I got frustrated because I wear a mask and it's almost impossible to tell if I'm smiling or not because cloth is covering my mouth. I didn't say anything though, and tried to be 'sweeter' toward my boss.

**Inciting Incident:** So yesterday, I picked up a shift for my supervisor in return for her working one of my shifts. Normally, she leaves me a list of things to do and I accomplish them and everything's great. But when I got to work, I couldn't find a list so I just did what I could think of to do and left. Then I come into work and she's written me up (this is my first written warning ever. like in any employment place. ever.) and says its because I didn't do anything on the list. When I pointed out that I couldn't find the list, she faltered but nonetheless began to complain about every little thing she'd ever seen with me and every thing anyone else has complained about me. This was my last straw and I calmly accepted the criticism, offered my explanation (which she didn't have any rebuttal to because I was in the right), and then returned to work and she left.

**Advice needed:** This has become an increasingly toxic environment for me to work in, but I have to stay here to pay the bills. There's a good chance I can quit in December, but until then I have to be on my best behavior and try not to piss anyone off--which is really fucking hard for so many reasons. How do I cope with this environment without just absolutely losing it? I'm scared my boss will start writing me up more and I don't know how to prevent it because I'm doing literally everything she's asked.",13Oct2020,1
933,"Cow: gross things

I’m currently having stomach problems, if you know what I mean, and I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot.

I got hired to work at a fast food place on Saturday and I was on time for every single time I got called over.

What I’m wondering right now is should I call in and say that I can’t come in? The manager said she’ll either call me to come in today or tomorrow.

934,"I've F(23) been depressed for about a year and a half, I'm currently changing medication so I had a pretty bad depressive episode that lasted about a month. During that month I handed late assigments for one subject because I felt really sad and found it very hard to do much, I was also taking a medication that made me sleep more than 12 hours a day o I didn't have much time during the day to actually do my assigments, I spent it mostly sleeping and crying.

The professor seems really nice and understanding and just gave me a heads up that I was late with a few assigments, but I feel really guilty about it. I don't know if I should because I've been brought up to keep my mental health a secret.",13Oct2020,1
935,"I had was in a group with 2 of my best friends, A and B. 

B and I were dating a pair of best friends. 

Through the course of B's entire relationship, he would make up lies about me to his girl and mine. He tried to break my and my girl up with these lies. I didn't find out about any of this until after they broke up because he threatened to break up with her if I found out about what he was saying. In the end, my girl believed me and knew he was the one lying. 

This incident obviously split our group up and I was no longer friends with B.

 A was still friends with us both, which I was fine with. B was not fine with A being my friend though, but that didn't stop A from continuing to be my friend. 

The above incident happened 7 months ago. According to A, B still talks shit about me every single time they hang out. For the past 7 months. I'm upset at A because he doesn't put a stop to it. I know what happened between B and I is none of his business, however, he doesn't disagree when B talks shit about me. He kinda just makes sounds and pretends like he understands without actually agreeing or disagreeing. 

On one hand, I understand because it's an awkward situation when 2 of your best friends hate each other. On the other hand, you shouldn't allow either one of them to talk shit about each other. Not once did I talk shit about B despite what he did to me. So I'm upset at A for allowing B to continue to talk shit about my every single time they hang out. He talks shit about me to other people in front of A too and A doesn't do anything. 

I don't want to drop A as a friend and I also feel weird telling him to put a stop to it. What would you do in this situation?",13Oct2020,1

937,"Background. I'm 32 with a part-time job at the moment. I love my coworkers at times and at others I don't however I not even mad at them for it. So I've had this job for a week or two and ik I could probably transfer if I needed to but I don't own a car atm. So I live in a place that isn't the best but manageable. I can handle most of what's going to be thrown at me over the winter time if I stay here. Well everyone involved is family and won't use there real names. so I got offered to move some where feather away(45 mins away) with a family member named jay. Jay isn't the best person in the world and the list of stuff about him is very long so here's a some of it. Jay is a pedo, he's done lots of drugs in the past including any and all. I mean meth, coke, crack, ECT. He has stolen stuff from other people from time to time but nothing of any real value like clothes, TP, ECT. Just the Minor stuff that you'd be the laughing stock for anyone to laugh at if they knew you called the cops on him for. He's even done a lot of stuff that raises lots of red flags for anyone wanting to move in with him. He also has some problems with his head which he should be taking his meds for but really hasn't in a very very long time. Also jay is a heavy drinker. Jay has reinsure me and my roommate he won't be doing any drugs or drinking while we stay with him because he can't anymore cause he's got the big C(another red flag depending how you see it). My roommate harry on the other has is wanting me to move in and has told me yes I can use jays car and jay even wants to sell it to me(another red flag cause he acts like this when he's using drugs). Jay is a nice person all around even when he's using drugs but if your around him long enough like I have you notice when he's on his meds or not. He's a lot calmer when he's on his meds and not so much in your face friendly like he is now. So I'm hoping everyone seeing this can understand what I mean. I told harry mainly no cause I don't have my own car and if something bad happens I'm kinda screwed over. Don't get me wrong I'll give jay another chance to prove himself even if he don't deserve it mainly because people have given me that chance when I needed it the most even if I didn't deserve it. So I go and eat and harry's mom(kim) is pressing me to move in as well and everyone in there right mind knows as much as I do. I really don't get it. Rent is cheap living with her, harry and my uncle(joe) They do have the space for me and harry to stay there and now 2 hours later harry is pressing me to move in with jay when I haven't even gotten my first check from my job yet. Rent with jay is almost double of what I'm paying now and Kim is giving the feeling of I don't want you to live here. I don't have any problems with anyone that i know of and I get along with them. Im not a dog person and have been attacked a few times by dogs. Twice when I was a kid(5)(7). So I'm scared for my life half of the time I'm around big dogs but if there small like a cat I'm fine with them. It does take me time to get used to a dog. But however they know I'm not to loving to there new dog mainly but that's mainly cause I can't sit down in a room without the dog being a prick or begging me for food. There's no real good way to put it. When I'm on my phone she knocks it out of my hands. When I'm sitting down she trys to be all over me and when I try to love up and one of the 4 cats she gets upset. So yeah they might want me out cause I'm not lovey dovey on there dog. If that's the reason then whatever IDC. I don't mean to say this as I'm not a dog person cause I do love dogs but I hate unmannered/trained dogs. So he's the rundown. 1 Kim and Joe want me out for whatever there reason is. 2 jay wants me and harry to move in with him even though jay is throwing up red flags everywhere. 3 harry is also pushing me to say yes even though I kinda told him no to begin with. 4 I have a part time job and have no idea what my checks will look like and I don't think I'll be able to find a place if my own. 5 I do have other family I probably could move in with but I'm unsure atm cause all this happened a few hours ago and I really haven't had the chance for my brain to process anything. 6 I really feel unwelcomed by everyone around me.

943,"Hello everyone, 

Little back story: I've been in my current relationship for about four years now, married for three of those years. The reasoning behind getting married was because my husband wanted to join the Marine Corps and didn't want me to stay behind. In recent months I've been thinking a lot about that day and how I should have simply said ""no"" due to some of the red flags such as drinking until passing out and puking throughout much of the morning, lack of initiative to get a job when he had moved in with me, and as many times as his two ex girlfriends messaged him and talking about how much they still had feelings for him and were hoping to give things another try. The nights of him drinking always went the same way, drink a fifth or most of, yelling at video games until neighbors complained, puking everywhere and be unable to clean it up, fondling himself until he finally passed out. It was only after nine months of training of him being gone between Virginia and California and a night of him drinking until passing out, that I found something new. It was during this night where I had woken up early to him once again screaming at his game that I had gone into our second bedroom where out computers are and found him attempting to call someone while masturbating to what ever was on his computer screen. I want to make clear that I am not a jealous person and didn't care much that he spoke to his ex girlfriends still and never read his messages before that night, it was only things he told me that seemed a little more then what I would have expected from someone that claimed to love me. Anyway, I admit that after he passed out entirely that I was curious to see who he had been trying to call on his phone. It was his ex girlfriend and he had been trying to do a video call on snapchat. It wasn't the only thing he had been trying though. There were messages from his ex that had been saved during the time he had been training in Virginia. Nudes and various other messages saying he wanted to do things with her. Just the same messages as I had found that night he woke me up again. I tried to tell myself that it was only his drinking that made him do that and not actually the man I married, but I was still broken that day and most days since. We argued that next morning about it and he had screamed at me saying he didn't even remember doing it. I honestly thought he would stop drinking because I really thought he felt horrible for doing it. I was proven wrong the very next weekend and this time I didn't really hesitate to look at his phone only to find more nudes not only from his ex, but from some other woman he had met playing Runescape. It was shortly after this where I fell into a very deep depression. I stopped caring for myself and stopped having any interest in anything I use to enjoy doing and very recently I've come to self harm because I feel so lost and uncertain. It has even gotten to the point that when ever he wants to do intimate things, I just lay there and let him do as he pleases because that is my job as his wife. This is why I've come here. Before we had gotten married, we took a road trip from Minnesota to Texas, where my momma lives, to Indiana, where his momma lives, and then back. We had stopped in Colorado in the Garden of the Gods and it was the most beautiful place. It was serene and peaceful and that is mostly the advice I am asking for, a way to move there to Colorado Springs and hopefully feel that again in my life. I have been trying to save up money, but with my husband buying brand new computer and all the fancy toys to go with it, it's a slow process. I'm simply lost as to what steps to take now. I am currently taking online courses in Natural Sciences and working at Michaels. I've considered just transferring stores so I would at least have a job when I moved there and I've looked up various apartments that would be suitable. Even considered living in my car for sometime, but I have a little kitty and I cannot leave her behind. She just walked in one day not long after all it happened and never left. On a side note, my husband has stopped drinking for several months now and is trying to make things better in our relationship, but I can't get rid of this pain and emptiness I feel. I've tried for so long and I've tried to be the best wife that I can for him. I honestly don't know how to do any of that any more. I don't know how to be myself or be the person that use to smile all the time and be silly and enjoy things. I know moving to another state is quite a drastic solution to my ""problem"", if you can call it that, but I have tried several other things and I just keep slipping farther and farther. I'm terribly sorry for such a long post, but if anyone can give me some advice about any of this. I'd be very grateful. 

PS: The only family that I really have is my momma in Texas, who is currently living in a little mobile home with my little brother and her husband.

946,"To give back ground information I (16f) had an ex-friend (15f) Jay (fake names) who last year was being sexually harrased by an adult volunteer at the school. He was sending her in detail text messages about what he wanted to do to her and was trying to get her to go places with him to do things. I reported him and it was taken care of. He's no longer aloud near the school. Now here's where it gets tricky, about a month later Jay started talking about this army recruiter at our school. She had gotten his number and told me that they talked about their sex lifes. She went on to say that if she and her boyfriend broke up again she'd have sex with him. Apparently they had talked about it. I told her how wrong it was and that it was disgusting. That she didn't know what she was doing. We stopped being friends after that. This happened last year. I don't know what ever happened with that but once covid is cleared he will be coming back to the school. It kept weighing down on me. I originally didn't want to report it because this had JUST happened to Jay and the more I thought about it the more scared I got. What if they think I'm lying for attention? What if SHE says I'm lying. I couldn't take it anymore though. I kept thinking about all the different girls that could fall victim to him, so I emailed the JROTC teacher about it explaining things.

I've been dealing with a pretty much constant feeling of exhaustion, which I think might be partially influenced by my depression/ADHD and partially influenced by some health stuff that's popped up this year. I'm getting treatment and stuff, but I can't keep waiting for some professionals to figure out what's wrong and the right fix for it, I need a way to cope *now.*

I'm incredibly behind in my classes, unable to do the things I'm really passionate and excited about, and my basic self-care stuff is starting to slip. I tried to bring it up to my family and my father suggested it was an issue of discipline, which I really and truly wish it was because I'd be able to fix it right now or even have one day a week where I get things done. 

My brain just feels so fuzzy and blurry and I need to find a way to actually live my own life in this incredibly sucky time. I need to get back on top of my chores, deep-clean my apartment, come up with a meal plan I can stick to even when I'm too low-energy to do a lot of cooking, but more than anything else I just want to be able to do the things I'm excited about instead of just daydreaming about them. 

I'd even take suggestions for how to manage time because every attempt I make at scheduling my day winds up with me overbooking myself because I'm afraid of not getting to do everything while I have the energy and then spending the next several weeks mostly in bed.

There's got to be a fix for this, right? Everybody else is able to live their daily lives. I know that some stuff can only really be fixed by medication and supplements and specialists and whatever, but I don't need it fixed. I just need a duct-tape solution until then.",13Oct2020,1

962,"I got a speeding ticket about a month ago for going 48 in a 35, but the cop was really nice and brought it down to a 5 over. Unfortunately, this is my second speeding ticket, and I know it looks really bad. The first instance was on a freeway, and I just paid it off and pleaded guilty. I’m really worried about how these tickets will impact my insurance. I understand what I did was wrong and by no means am I planning to try and “beat” the ticket. But I’ve never done court before. My mom isn’t talking to me so I’m kind of on my own. It’s scheduled virtually for Thursday, and I really need advice on what to say in my favor. Maybe if they’ll plead it down? I’m a great student and low-income, so this will hit my wallet really hard if the judge decides not to help me out.

963,"from the first day i started college, i knew it wasn’t the path i wanted to take. i grew to hate my computer science major and decided it would be better for me to pursue a professional music career instead. staying in college would be draining me of all the time, money and energy i could be spending to compose, record, network and promote my songs.

i wanted to drop out from the start, but me being a dumbass immobilized by fear, i lied to my parents and kept telling them i was doing fine in my classes. in reality i‘ve been skipping all of them to write songs, analyze the music i like, and overall do research on how i can make myself stand out in the industry.

i’m technically still enrolled in my first semester, but of course i’m failing every single one of my classes. once i dipped from my midterms, i knew there‘d be no going back, so i couldn’t save myself even if i wanted to.

and… now my dad’s asking to see my grades.

i knew there’d be hell to pay eventually, but i‘ve been scared out of my wits to tell them and i ended up prolonging the inevitable.

how do i rip the bandage off (as gracefully as possible) and tell them i lied about doing schoolwork and that i just want to get a job and build my true aspirations for music in the meantime?

969,"Basically what the title says I started a job last week at a fast food place. My actual work location doesn't open until early November so I have been sent in for training at a different location.

This bitch of a manager has done nothing but tell me all that I am doing wrong with the most blankest bitchiest of expressions while talking to all other members on the team like they're all long lost friends. Today I found out that she will be my manager at the new location. 

Earlier today, I was at a station next to where she was talking to another manager doing my work minding my own when I hear a shit ton of giggling and indiscernible whispering coming from the hall. I heard the word ""bonehead"" and just did a quick look kind of like ""wtf"". 
Manager who I suspect of talking shit could sense my glance she had no idea I was there very likely so the giggling continues and all I hear is ""I gotta go"" said as discretely as possible as she walks away with a half giggle. 

Now, I'm not one to get easily offended, but when somebody is in a position of power over you and has the ability to fire you this kind of gossiping has an effect on your performance. Especially since she said earlier today that if I don't memorize the whole menu by the end of the week I wouldn't make it to the new location. This is understandable because it's my responsibility to learn the menu, but it's a nasty pairing with the other events that transpired today and so I've been feeling pretty down. This is my first job in the food industry and I feel like I've been doing minor fuckups all day long in a state of panic and this cunty manager situation doesn't help one bit. 

What should I do?

The first one is **ascetic**, **cynic**, **stoic** and ***misanthropic*** and maybe religious and also wants to isolate myself from society.

The second one is ***materialistic***, ***open-minded***, ***lazy*** and highly ***manipulative*** that wants to become as rich ad powerful as possible. And also definitely atheist.

These two are two sides from the same coin and I constantly struggle to take direction.  
In any case, I have to pick one direction so I can focus on my life further. I have made already a 180 degree turn in my life so I can't put this off any longer if I don't want to waste my life.

977,"So last year (in Highschool), I had just transferred and had undiagnosed depression and lots of family issues, so I was in and out of therapy. Basically I didn’t know how to act around people or even be slightly social without being a dickbag to people around me who liked me or were interested in me. Anyway, I had been told by her friends that a girl who approached me daily was interested and wondered if I would date her. Of course, being as awkward/rude as I was , I ignored them and was told by friends of mine about how the girl would talk about me in their other classes. Anyway, I ended up liking HER friend, so instead of asking out Girl A( the one that liked me), I asked out Girl B in a very awkward daylong Instagram DM, and trashed Girl A for being a “whore” that is “used too much by other guys”. I know. I’m really, really confused to why I ever thought that was okay to say to her about her friend, Girl A, who really liked me. She ended up ghosting me and sent a photo with Girl A and her friends in the back flipping me off. Fast forward to it being about a year or so, and I have my own girlfriend, and have learned respect for other women instead of talking out of a trash can and I can’t help but feel very remorseful everyday, wanting to apologize, but never doing so. 

Thing is, would it be weird to just DM Girl A saying I’m sorry for being rude to her last year, or telling Girl B in person that I’m sorry for being an ass to her as well?

TL;DR : Last year was depressed virgin with no social skills, made misogynistic comment about Girl who liked me who was friends with the Girl I was asking out over an Instagram DM, got flipped off by both girls.

I actually did like her and never meant to lash out at her. 

I recently talked to a therapist about me replaying bad memories about anything and recently, I just remembered that I did this. Now, I realized how much of a big dick I was and realized I made a huge mistake. I want to apologize to move on and get it out of my head but I'm very hesitant to for 2 reasons:

1. I'm not sure if bringing up something that happened years ago is necessary. At the same time, I want to move on and never think about the incident again but on the other hand, should I do this?

983,"I've been far from okay for a while now, but a few weeks ago, my ""anti existential"" thoughts went from entertaining the thought of it being better if I never lived in the first place to thoughts about wanting to end things.

The rational part of my mind however, despite my self loathing ways, acknowledges there are people who wouldn't be better off if I was dead, so suicide would be selfish, and that things might end up getting better once I get to move out, making me pretty sure I'd never go through with an attempt, especially because of the guilt.

So since I'm not actually at danger for commiting suicide anyway, should I necessarily see a therapist? Cause I can't really hide that from my family and I could never open up to them about the way I feel, eventhough they do want to know, so I'd prefer to wait with therapy for a few years until I can move out, but I'm not sure wether this may be irresponsible or when suicidal thoughts actually call for professional help at all, so I'd like to hear what people with an outside perspective advise from the sound of this.

Recently I've (15m) been pretty bothered by some things that have happened between me and some of my ex-friends and I've had a few self-realizations. The thing that's stuck with me the most is that some of them called me ""manipulative"". While I'm aware that I was perhaps in the wrong for a few of my actions, I really wasn't sure if I was unknowingly being fake throughout my entire friendship with them. For context, I would talk with one of them nearly every day but I was always a bit weary when I was talking. The person I talked to was the easily-offended and very problematic kind. I usually put those feelings aside until eventually I snapped and ended all ties with this person. She was caught off guard with how suddenly I ended the friendship and she's right to feel this way. She asked me a couple days later ""We're you only pretending to be my friend?"".  I answered truthfully and told her ""No"", because I definitely wasn't trying to put up a false image of myself. However, I've been very conflicted with whether I was being manipulative or fake without realizing it and I'm now a bit hesitant with my new friends. What are the actual traits of a manipulative person? Am I one of them?

She’s said it’s to early to decide and that she doesn’t want to make any serious decisions in case it fucks up our friendship. I struggle with social anxiety pretty bad. And this made me spiral. I stopped socialising with roommates and stopped seeing her. I’ve just been in my room drinking and doing zoom lectures. We kept texting but I could tell things were different and that I put her off. During my time of locking my self in my room my roommates used to knock for me and ask if I wanted to come out but I just never replied. Now they don’t even knock or text and I heard one of them talking shit about me in the kitchen which really messed with my self esteem. 

The feelings for her are slowly going but there’s certain parts I cannot look past. As I said I have social anxiety and I thought it would take me months to be comfortable enough to sleep with someone. But with her I didn’t feel any anxiety I was just completely present and I was open and vulnerable with her like I hadn’t managed to do with even my best friend of 11 years.  

Now we’re not taking as much I keep asking her to talk with me for closure so I can stop thinking about this shit but she just avoids it. My heads completely fucking scrambled I can’t think straight and it’s just an emotional rollercoaster of wondering how do I not fuck this up anymore. How do I get her back as a friend but not push her away further by discussing how I feel about her (since no one else knows she’s the only one I can go to). And how do I start to rekindle my friendship with my room mates.

Then when she found out I was pregnant she didn't want us to go ahead and get married. Then she didn't want us to buy our first house. Then she didn't want us to get a dog. Then when my hubs friend needed a couch to sleep on and she found out he was a recovering addict she threatened to call the police showed up on my front lawn screaming at him to get out. She then proceeded to call me a whore for helping him out screaming at me. Then she threatened to call dss on me. Then hubs and I got a free vacuum for doing shows of it. We asked her to do one and she yelled at us saying we were making horrible financial decisions. My Grandmother passed over the summer and a little over a week ago I moved into her house with my uncle's (he inherited the house) permission. She yelled at me about that. She now calls me every day saying my uncle said such and such and yells at me for it. For example: the day after we moved in my uncle told her that we have a lot of stuff and the house was a mess. The obvious. She called me yelling at me that we destroyed the house and saying my uncle wants us out and that ""he just won't tell us"". She does this everyday. Sunday my BIL needed someone to dog sit for a few weeks as he's going through a messy divorce. Uncle said as long as it's temporary. My mom has called the past three days yelling at me about it. Today she called yelling at me saying that she was going to call my MIL and say that my uncle said we couldn't keep it here and to come get it. I said no don't. She yelled ""well when's the dog going to be gone!?"" And lost it and I screamed ""I don't know"" hung up and threw my phone. What do all these decisions have in common? My husband and I made them together. My husband wants me to completely cut her off and not have anything to do with her. I don't want to do that because she is my mom and I can't completely get away from her as my uncle (who lives next door) will still want to see her. I won't lie after the last call a few hours ago I've been drinking so if some of this is bleh that's why. She's drove me to drink. Idk what to do. She's my mom but she's so toxic I'm ready for her to be out of my life... but she's my mom.",13Oct2020,1
1004,"I live in the UK where there are a lot of covid-19 cases right now. I'm currently studying but it is all online at the moment and I can't even go to the campus to access the library. I lost my job so I'm basically stuck in the flat all the time and feeling really low. In my flat it's just me and my 2 friends who are a couple. They spend a lot of time together so most of the time I'm on my own. 

I don't know a lot of people where I live but recently some people I used to work with started inviting me to go indoor bouldering. It was really good to get out and see other people whilst doing something fun and I felt much better for it, but now one of my flatmates is saying she's anxious about me going as she's worried I'll catch covid. If I went now, I would only be meeting one other person but she is still not happy about it. I don't think she wants me going to cafes either. I honestly feel so trapped and lonely but maybe she's right to be this cautious?

I know this probably sounds very self-pitying as I know lots of people are struggling more than me but I have a lot of mental and physical health issues which are just getting worse the longer I am stuck on my own. Should I speak to my flatmate or is she right?",13Oct2020,1
1005,"Should I quit football my senior year?

I’ve been playing tackle football since I was 8 or 9, I’ve always loved the sport and have so many memories of all the good things that happened. I’ve always been good at football also, I’m naturally big and have good speed so I’ve always played an important role on the team but I’m not planning on playing in college. Last year though I tore my meniscus and ended up getting surgery to partially repair it. When I was out it gave me the time to really reflect on my football experience. There were parts of it I liked, like my teammates and some games but I realized a lot of the time I didn’t like it. I’m always waiting for practices to end as soon as they start, I don’t get excited about the start of a season, and I don’t have that same drive that I see in some of my teammates. It’s just been so routine and expected of me to play every year by everyone around me that I’ve just always played without even thinking about it. On top of that I’ve been told that playing this year is gonna speed up the future problems I’ll have with my knee. All in all I still love my teammates and some of the moments, I’m just not sure if it’s something I want to keep putting my heart into. My parents said they’re disappointed but will respect my decision if I choose to quit. I just don’t want it to be something I regret doing and i don’t know what the future will hold because it would be the first time since I was 8 that I wouldn’t be playing.",13Oct2020,1
1006,"I am in a new place and I think it will be a fresh start to attempt the same things and work I was doing before, without being stalked for years, harassed and dealing with the disadvantages of the fact I'm a highly attractive and highly intelligent woman (this is highly subjective, but let's say compared to all people I have met and some online). 

My hope that this place will be better keeps me motivated and I shall overcome that. I also have disdain for my previous workplaces for creating the worst toxic work environment possible for a woman or person which I only tolerated cause I was new, trying to reach for a goal and thought it was part of the industry, and wanted to be tough, and didn't want to let anything get to me. I won in the end but I'm dealing with mild burnout. I started taking care of me recently so it doesn't affect me anymore and I'm a much more resilient person and have a stronger (more authentic) network than last year. I also have full range of my emotions but I have stopped caring, which really helps. I know I just have to keep pushing ahead but I don't want to make the same mistakes again. I also learned to not treat people who are not smart or rational as people who can be taught or reasoned with. 

Some people also brought up the fact I'm a really good human being and I shouldn't lose that. I won't, I love my personality and I believe in the golden rule, it's a by product of my high openness, but I also have a brutally cold side to me, that will not stop till I ensure that environment is never toxic again for anyone else forever. 

Advice you'd give me to not attract that kind of toxicity in my life again? It wasn't my fault, but I'm still accountable for my life and as an adult I can't make excuses for what happens to me.",13Oct2020,1

1008,"Okay, so I have been in love with a girl for a little over a year. She's a very close friend of mine and expectedly me catching feelings messed with our friendship a bit. 
She told me a few months ago that she wasn't sure if what she feels for me is platonic or romantic...so I was kind of in a limbo.
But after these months I've come to the conclusion that we wouldn't work. I'm too clingy for her and she's way too independent to deal with this. Also to be honest she would be not affectionate enough for me. Because I know her pretty well and she can be quite distant and more the avoidant attachment type. And I can't deal with this. Due to my anxiety and other mental health problems I already feel like a burden to others or I'll be completely convinced they secretly hate me. I'd need lots of reassurance and attention to not feel like my partner doesnt like me (anymore).
She also spends quite a big amount of time doing her sport of choice (I'm talking hours every day in the week) and doesn't have much time because of this. And that's another problem I probably couldn't work around. Because I need a certain amount of attention and also just being around that person to feel like our relationship is fulfilled. 
So, yes I do know that a relationship wouldn't work but at the same time there's this other voice that tells me that maybe, just maybe it could be awesome and it's sooo hard to not listen to that. Because ofc I want someone to love that also loves me and a relationship would be so cool...but I know it wouldn't work.

How do I deal with this?? I need to just keep in mind that it'd be a complete disaster and our friendship would be completely fucked if we would ever get in a relationship... I need to completely realize that to get over her and I don't know how.",13Oct2020,1
1009,"This is real long, but there's a lot to it. Please be nice to me. I know I have made poor choices here; we're all human.  


My husband is a kind, gentle, patient person who tells me he/they love me a million times a day. Our intimacy is great, they are affectionate. They are extremely good-natured. They never get angry with me, never raise their voice...

But.

The March before last, my sweet-natured partner started a business as a professional dungeon master for tabletop gaming. The deal was that he would try his very, very best for a year and then we'd re-evaluate. I was already extremely successful in a difficult field; I have made my living producing my own plays, that I write, for over a decade now. It is HARD work. It is a slog of paperwork, drama, research, and hours. For years, I worked 80-hour weeks so I could have a more flexible schedule today. 

I also went to night school for business, HR, event planning, and accounting. I got a GST number. I did the work, I paid my dues. I aggressively applied for jobs and pitched ideas to anyone who would listen. I worked so, so hard for my success. I am, if I may brag a little, the hardest-working person I know. 

Sometimes I'll get a dayjob and make a ton of money over a short period of time, just so I can make more/better art. I have made my life work. I VERY rarely get into any financial trouble; the only time I ever do is if something happens, for example, like a flood closes the theatre and cancels performances or something like that. My family might help then, but I pay them back. That kind of thing happens rarely, though.

Because I am a successful business person already, I sat down with my now-husband to figure out a plan for success. I always figure, as long as you do your VERY BEST, something good will happen, even if things don't go according to plan, right? I wrote out a huge list of ideas, starting with MAKE A BUSINESS PLAN. Other things I thought of included making a YouTube channel, updating social media daily, making a Patreon, making a D&amp;D-themed immersive summer camp... I worked very hard on outlining a skeleton of how this COULD work and how my husband COULD get enough money to live. My husband didn't really contribute, as they said they knew nothing about it but would use my list as a syllabus to LEARN. I felt flattered and like I couldn't ask for more than that.

Coming from an abusive family background, I am very bad at setting boundaries, and I have a hard time trusting when I am being fair and reasonable. I REALLY try to be kind and open in all things and OFTEN go overboard in fawning over people who give me affection.

After a year and a half, my husband has four regular weekly games as a result of him putting up a poster at his serving job. People pay twenty bucks per session, and in Jan 2021 my husband plans to up this to 25.00 per session; I don't think either price is reasonable for the amount of work put into this, including letting people message with questions absolutely any time of the day or night.

Partner and I had agreed that four hours is plenty for people only paying twenty bucks, but I noticed my partner was also doing at least two hours of prep per day, plus they started wrapping up at the four-hour mark, so the total commitment was edging dangerously close to eight hours of time, plus extra D&amp;D time on reddit, YouTube, Patreon, etc. The house QUICKLY evolved into D&amp;D all day, every day, with my husband making MAX 1700.00 CAD a month when no players bail. 

They play D&amp;D seven days a week at this point; only four of those are paid games. I value social time, but I find no joy in this arrangement and have really grown to resent the game I play in once a week to engage with my partner's passion, because MY WHOLE LIFE IS D&amp;D.

No sign of a business plan, no YouTube videos, no Patreon, no social media, no building up the brand. No progress at all. Not an inch. Well, they made a website, to give them credit, and it's pretty cool. They play, currently online, in the living room or the bedroom, and I have to keep the house fairly quiet. If they're in the living room, I can't use the TV above volume 4. Before the pandemic, they played with their groups in the kitchen, cutting off my access to the kitchen and bathroom for hours. 

I tried to fix this problem by building an immersive playing space in the garage for them. I paid for materials, and painted murals on all the walls. Crumbling dungeon stones, mysterious symbols, a night sky on the garage door so the whole thing can raise for airflow and put a night sky over the players' heads. Mossy walls, skulls, interesting bottles, cool stuff, It took me six months. I paid for 3/4 of it, but I figured it was an investment. 

The cats have a bedroom for some reason, my husband now has a games room, I feel like there is no reason for me to feel edged out of my own space. They still haven't bought a wifi extender in order to play online in their new space, though. 

I am TRYING to be supportive and make this work. I am NOT a shitty, shrewish wife. I SWEAR. Well, recently maybe I've felt a little shrewish, but I SWEAR to you, I was supportive of ALL of this for as long as I could handle it.

Early days, I would volunteer to help more. They liked my idea of a D&amp;D immersive summer camp for adults? Awesome, I'll spend two hours researching and making a budget. I handed it to them, they looked at it, didn't say thank you, and went back to scrolling r/DnD endlessly. 

I KNOW they should solve their own problems, but we're at an impasse where they will NOT stop playing, but they will also NOT do any extra work on this beyond prep.

There's more. 

I worked in an office for a year, in order to save up some nest egg money as you sometimes have to do, and was making really good money. I decided and told them I wanted to help them purchase a D&amp;D table for their business, and invest a little bit, because I love them. I gave them 500.00 per month from March-December of 2019, with the understanding that any extra money left over would go toward our planned wedding.

I proposed to them, before I found out they had taken my money but after I had started giving it to them, with a massive D&amp;D-themed treasure hunt through our city that took me six months to organize. Afterward, from October 2019 until I flipped the eff out about a month ago, they declined to help with wedding planning because it's 'not their interest' and 'boring'... but I had wanted a small wedding. They asked for a big themed one, and I have to plan it alone??

\*\*\*Their dad kindly built them a D&amp;D table, and it came out that they had spent every penny I had given them on just... stuff. It let them call out of restaurant shifts so they could play more D&amp;D, basically.\*\*\* They have apologized for this. They have paid off my credit card with their family's line of credit, and are letting me not pay rent Sept-Dec... because their aunt is going to cover it. I don't think this really makes up for it, and I don't like their family paying our expenses, but okay.

I took on a job in film in September, working almost every day for 12.5 hours plus lunch, with an hour-long commute every day. I wanted to replace the money I had lost, but also, the pandemic has put the theatre industry in the toilet and I wanted to contribute. My husband's only job in September was to play D&amp;D. I left a list of six chores, easy ones, including 'put up the rainbow window decals that I purchased with my own money in your game room'. They did not complete a single chore. At the end of September, I was rewarded for my efforts with a disastrous house, a fruit fly infestation, tons of spoiled food in the fridge and on the counters, and not ONE of those six chores completed. Not ONE.

I can't imagine having kids with this person. I cancelled my appointment to get my IUD taken out, because I'm terrified that I will be trapped, with someone else having fun every evening, and I will never get to go out and direct and appear in plays anymore, even though I was already doing that and having a lot of success that I EARNED.

The thing is, though, they act SO bereft and sad every time I get angry about this unfair situation, which in turn MAKES ME FEEL SO VERY GUILTY THAT I END UP FAWNING AGAIN. They took me on a date because I got angry that they don't take me out almost literally ever, and in response I redecorated the office into a little wizard study as a gift. I KNOW I'm rewarding minimal effort, I'm just so upset about them being upset about me being angry that I have a frightened please-don't-be-mad response but THIS ISN'T HELPING ME AT ALL. I don't know how to stop, but I'm VERY aware that I should get to feel hurt and they should be apologizing and HUGELY making this up to me.

They also feel comfortable being sarcastic and rude to me, but ONLY about D&amp;D. This morning, I realized they were playing seven days a week and said it was against what we'd agreed, and they angrily replied, 'Oh, so now you don't want me to make a living? Which is it?'

After a couple of hours, I asked if they understood that I wasn't saying they shouldn't make a living, and they said yes. Now they're angrily making a business plan as if I'm their mean mom making them do their homework.

LAST DIFFICULT THING is that they have a communication issue stemming from a past girlfriend, wherein if they are remotely criticized they shut down and become silent, which further fuels my worries of me being unfair and mean. It also fosters no helpful discussion.

We are in therapy. It has helped me enormously with advocating for myself and learning to set boundaries. It has not helped the above problems very much.

**I know I'm upset, Reddit, and I know that you can never know the nuance of my feeling for my husband and their good intentions. I love them VERY much.** 

But I have become resentful, snappish, and angry. They treat me like I'm a villainous stepmother taking away their toy.

We have gone on six dates since March 2019. Three of those were the week before last when I exploded about the list of chores that went un-done.

I feel like I have lost my identity in this relationship and I am very afraid. I also really hate D&amp;D now. It's not a positive thing to have around me or my life, because it consistently reminds me that a fantasy world is more important to my husband than I am.

I have never experienced affectionate love like this. If I walk away, after all the abuse I have gone through from terrible family members to boyfriends who have hit me to boyfriends that have given me fake engagement rings and fake names to boyfriends who have sexually assaulted me, I think I will spontaneously combust. My heart will just break completely. 

What can I do? What can I say? I feel like putting a moratorium on D&amp;D altogether will end our relationship, and also... I'm not his mom.

I so badly don't want to get a divorce.

TL;DR -- D&amp;D comes before absolutely everything and I have had it. I think this game makes my partner selfish, rude, and sneaky. The whole situation has made me feel both resentful and guilty, resulting in a cycle of fawning that contributes negatively to my self-respect. Therapy has helped me as an individual, but it isn't helping with the above outlined problems very much.",13Oct2020,1

Clothing, fast food, skincare, weed, unnecessary subscriptions, homeless people, etc. I have the most egregious financial habits and I don’t know what to do. I’ve attempted to make budgets and practice self-discipline but I can never get to where I wanna be. Like shit, I’d pay someone to hold my money for me so I don’t have access to it.

1013,"So my husband and I rent our basement suite out to his brother and his brother's gf.  They just recently had a baby (4 weeks ago) and for the last 2 weeks all we hear is him yelling at his gf all day long.  She doesn't yell back often but he yells most of the day.  Our kids hear their uncle yelling at her and the whole situation is really shitty.  This girl is so sweet and just had a baby and my husband's brother is being such a jerk.  I caught her outside once and before I could even say anything to her she burst into tears and said he keeps calling her names, commenting on her body, restricting access to their money and refusing to let her take their son to her mother's when she needs time away from him.  We stood outside chatting for 10 minutes before he came out saying that she was taking a long time.  My husband and I have offered to help her by either kicking him out and she can stay in our basement suite, facilitating her leaving with the baby or getting his other family members involved in something of an 'intervention'.  She said to me, 'I'm willing to do whatever at this point.' but didn't agree directly to any of my suggestions.

To basically explain it, its like my field of view going from 70 to 90 in a videogame. I wouldn't say it's ever caused me real problems but I really wonder what it could be.

1015,"So I work at a newsagent's/papershop basically on the till. Before working in the shop I used to do paperounds for them on weekdays when I was younger. However,  (and I don't mean to sound winy) I still get asked to do them on occasion which until recently I was like whatever thats fine but I do not want to do them anymore. 

When I quit my paperound to get a shop job a few years ago it was to avoid early morning rounds. I had done my round day in day out for a while by then. Each morning I was just dreading it as I was usually very tired. Yes I did go to bed very late and that was my fault but its still something I found difficult. Before being offered a job in their shop 8 was planning to look round for shop jobs elsewhere. For this reason it's a little difficult because obviously I'm someone they know me and that I used to work rounds. Its also difficult because they are clearly tired themselves for not having a proper break running the shop for over 19 years.


So here is where I'm at now. I've been working 5:30am shifts once a week for most weeks now since at least the start of this year (or maybe even before that though I do not remember exactly). 

I know this is definitely not healthy but for a few months as well due to my late night habits I don't usually get much quality sleep on a Saturday night anyway. The Internet is my bain unfortunately. So anyway I've been staying up all night on those nights for a while. So naturally I'm more tired for a bit in the rest of the week.


I don't care if it is selfish but I do not want to feel obligated to do paperounds even though its a pandemic. I clearly cannot get to bed on time which is required for early shifts (as it stands rn anyway). As an example, more recently for one week earlier this year when I was asked to help cover weekday openings (5am) and I felt like it nearly killed me. It made me ill. I was so tired I literally felt like I had a fever that week. That was horrible. Though I should say paperounds are better in that you don't have to get up quite as early seeing as you're expected at 7am not 5am. Besides corona though I am also am anxious about my health in general as recently I lost half my hearing in one ear and I'm not sure its ever coming back. Which given my age is unusual. 

This week I have been asked to cover a round which after discussion with my mum and dad I said yes to but only for three days luckily. If I had said outright yes it would be a lot more.

I know they're probably going to struggle for quite a while but I feel as cases of the coronavirus are rising it is inevitable more if the paperound kids will have to self isolate I will be asked to cover for more rounds. Please how do I avoid this? I have been an employee at their shop since I was 13 in some form or another (I'm 21 now) and I feel I've done my duty. 

Please can someone help me? All I need is some way of politely declining, some phrasewords or something. If you do have anything else to say to me though about this situation please do. Don't worry about coming off harsh. I recognise I do sound indeed selfish here but I would rather I hear something I do not like. In the end if that helps it is better for me to hear.",13Oct2020,1
