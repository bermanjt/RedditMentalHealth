0,I’m pretty sure it’s caused by excess drinking. It made me get some hemorrhoids most likely. How do I make them go away. The amount of blood is insane,14May2020,1
1,"Even when uni is normal I struggle to be motivated, but with isolation I’m struggling even more. On top of that, my house gets no sun and my dad is doing renovations right outside my bedroom. I got really behind on my uni because I couldn’t ignore it. So I ended up risking a fine and staying at my friends house for a week because I had no other choice. I didn’t manage to get any work done there either because the dust in her house made my allergies flare up, so I came home and my dad has started up renovations again even though I’ve made it very clear to him that I’m falling behind to the point where there’s a very strong possibility I will fail or end up dropping out. I can’t stop crying. I don’t know what to do.",14May2020,1
2,"My girlfriend is very kind and caring. She's legitimate about her feelings about who she is and what makes her different. (Dying her hair, wearing crazy high platforms, more out there than most make up, just being looked at by disapproving people in public) I love her for those qualities. she's confident in those things. One thing she is not confident in is her weight. She's probably 140 lbs. Not heavy. But I know she's insecure about it and try to give her those confidence boosts here and there when she bring it up. 

After some suspicious behavior like quickly hiding phone and and closing out of apps when I come near her I did something that was probably wrong. I went through her phone. 

I found nude pictures she had taken in my apartment kitchen and my bed when I apparently wasn't around. I'm fairly tech savvy and pulled up the date stamps and they show that these pictures were only taken a couple of weeks ago. I can clearly make out things that are in the background of my apartment. I've also found some, essentially, pornographic gifs the show to have been received and saved a few weeks prior to the pictures I found of her. 

With the combination of her behavior and the pictures I found that I, by the way, never received is very worrisome. I've been cheated on two times in the past and I can't get the possibilities out of my head. Did she send them to somebody? Is that why she hides her phone or closes apps when I come near to kiss her? Since she gets off work so much earlier than me, is she seeing somebody in that time? 

Other than her behavior on her phone she's given me no reason to suspect cheating of any kind. I don't want to ruin our relationship over my insecurities or bring up the pictures I found from digging through her phone when I shouldn't have even done that in the first place. But now that I know what do I do?",14May2020,1
3,So my best friend broke up with my other best friend to be with another guy. It was a long horrible break up and she didn't tell him that he has feelings for the other guy. Anyway the dude just found out that she's dating the other guy and he's mad and he's mad at me for not telling him but honestly it wasn't my place to tell him but I can understand why he's angry but I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm on the verge of losing my friend and I don't know what to do.,14May2020,1
4,"This probably isn't what you're thinking it is- I haven't found anyone else with this specific issue, so finding resources/support has proven very difficult. My apologies if this is the wrong forum, I didn't want to post to an LGBT subreddit and have someone take it the wrong way, I'd be more than happy to edit or remove this post upon request! &lt;3

I'm twenty years old and bisexual. I've had issues with gender dysphoria before, but I more or less identify as a woman. I've known I was bi since middle school, and it was never a huge issue for me. The only ""angst"" I had was about coming out to my homophobic grandparents. The gender stuff was more complicated, but the point is, I've never had any issues with the idea of me or someone I know being LGBT.

The problem started in my freshman year of college (I'm going into my senior year this fall, for context). Most of my high school friends were cisgendered/heterosexual, so college was the first space where I really interacted with other LGBT people. I made a lot of LGBT friends, and became the secretary of my college's GSA. Everything was great... except it wasn't.

My new ""friends"" had issues. Lots of issues. I feel like any attempt to summarize said issues would understate exactly how bizarre it all was, so here's a list of various incidents that occurred during my time with this group, in no particular order:

1. Two seperate people flashed their boobs at me on three seperate occasions (my ""best friend"" did it twice, the other just the once).
2. My best friend wouldn't stop talking about having sex with me.
3. My best friend's boyfriend joked about my best friend raping me in my sleep.
4. I was shown gore porn blogs in the middle of the dining hall.
5. A guy asked to eat my ass while we were sitting in the office of a professor I respect, close enough to that professor that he could have feasibly heard.
6. I went to a friend's dorm, and they pulled out a bottle of dragon cum lube from their closet to show me.
7. That person was also vocally into pee, and would bring it up unprompted.
8. I was photographed in my underwear without my knowledge, and that photo was then posted in the friend group's group chat without my consent.
9. I was pressured into taking the BDSM Quiz in the aforementioned professor's office, again, close enough that he could have heard.
10. A girl (one of the two who flashed me) asked my best friend behind my back if I was a trans woman (likely because she wanted to hook up with me). I'm not, and I'm not offended by the question at all, but invasive and fetishizing inquiries about my genitalia are never the way to go, especially if you're too much of a coward to ask me to my face.

There's more that involves other people, but it's not relevant here. I didn't realize how messed up this was at the time, because it was very much a ""frog in a pot of boiling water"" kind of situation. About a year and a half ago (my sophomore year), I cut off my best friend because of unrelated issues, and now no one in that friend group will talk to me. Probably obvious, but I am not the secretary of the GSA anymore. Not a huge loss, I know. I actually had to get a no-contact order against another person in the group (the pee person) because they wouldn't stop harassing me in class after they cut me off.

All of this has left me with a pretty tainted view on the community as a whole. I don't want to be scared of my own community- it's the place I should feel the *safest*\- but let's face it, there's a lot for me to be scared of! It feels like any time an LGBT person is attracted to me (and I feel like it happens surprisingly often), they have to go about expressing that attraction in the most forward and creepy ways possible. I'm tired of being harassed, violated, and exposed to everyone's kinks.

I feel like I've made a lot of progress in therapy, and now that I'm on antidepressants I'm feeling a lot more stable, but that anger and fear towards the LGBT community because of how they've treated me has remained. Pre-corona, I was trying to get more involved in the community and went to a social event for LGBT people my age in my area, but I don't think my heart rate dropped back down to normal until I got home. The people there weren't inappropriate, but they were weird, in the same *""This Person Has Clearly Spent Their Entire Adolescence On Tumblr And Never Learned How to Interact With People IRL Or Respect Their Boundaries""* way that the college GSA people were.

I want to go back once everything opens up again, and I want to have LGBT friends, but I'm terrified of opening up to them in case they get too comfortable, and it's gotten to a point where finding out a person is LGBT makes me trust them less and even hate them a bit. Which isn't logical, nor is it fair to the other person, or the community in its entirety. I don't want to feel this way, but I don't know how to stop, especially when it feels like people are proving those feelings right every chance they get.

*Has anyone else experienced something like this? What can I do to get rid of these negative associations? How can I be more comfortable among members of my own community?*

**TL;DR: My LGBT former college ""friends"" harassed me so often and so badly that it created a negative perception of the LGBT community for me that makes it difficult to befriend or even associate with other LGBT people.**",14May2020,1
5,"Hey, Some background information; my mothers had a history of back pain due to a past injury. She’s had medical treatment for it but certain things trigger pain.
Due to my uncle having a sudden divorce he’s been staying with us and thus sleeping in my mother’s room. Originally my mother roomed with me (sleeping on a spare mattress) but recently she decided she’d prefer to sleep downstairs on these fold out mattresses that go on the floor. 

I noticed she was having pain and stiffness in her back again. She told me it was because she was sleeping floor but she also said that it wasn’t a big issue and too not tell my uncle. 

Part of me knows she’s not making a fuss for my uncles sake. But I feel like I should do something to help her so she doesn’t end up hurting herself. She’s turned down my offer to swap to sleeping in my bed while I take the downstairs.

Does anyone have any idea what I could buy/do for my mother too sleep on comfortably?",14May2020,1
6,"I just went for a jog in the neighborhood to get some exercise. I was on a sidewalk on a busy street almost at the end of the block. A guy turns the corner and starts walking towards me. I start to go in the street to social distance but the street is full of cars. I’m in the street close to the edge of the sidewalk, At a dead stop to find a gap in the cars so I can go further in the street and this guy keeps on walking in my direction. As he walks towards me, he looks like someone I know. I point at him as he walks past so I could wave hi and give him crap for walking in my direction (as a friend). As I got closer, I embarrassingly realize that he is not the person I know and is a total stranger. As he walked towards me, I apologized and go I’m sorry I thought you were someone I know. You have the same glasses and haircut. He then looks at me super suspiciously, almost angry and starts asking who, was not letting it go, and was a bit too close for comfort when it comes to social distancing. To lighten the mood and end the subject I said the guy I know is handsome just like you. Definitely not my type but just said it to try and lighten the mood and try and move on from the conversation because he still seemed suspicious of me. I then continued my jog, and as I got a far enough distance in my jog, I sneaked a slight, subtle, quick finger when I jogged away as I was frustrated that he didn’t seem to give a crap about social distancing and also that I felt creeped out that he seemed angry and he didn’t want to let the situation go. I was far enough and we were going in opposite directions that he most likely didn’t see me, but I do regret that part.

I am shook up about the whole situation and I’m having trouble not replaying the situation in my head.

I’m embarrassed that I thought he was someone else.

I’m creeped out by what seemed like his anger forwards me.

I’m disappointed in my awkward response of he’s handsome just like you.

I’m disappointed in my reaction of giving a slight finger, even if he didn’t see me

7,"So long story short, I work at a local video game store. The last customer of the day came in and wanted to buy an xbox one x and some games. Total was 416, and he hands me a large stack of 20s. I count them to 420, but I only counted once. I must've made a mistake and counted too far ahead, (I was moving quickly as this was after close at this point) because my manager called me on my way home and was wondering why the drawer was 200 off. We talked it out and agreed my transaction was the only one large enough to be missing that kind of money on. I apologized profusely, and insisted I would do anything in my power to make this right. I feel beyond stupid, and I'm so dissapointed in myself. I feel like I let everyone down. But now I wonder is my job in jeopardy? I really love my job and I cant afford to lose it either.

8,"I’m(28F) in grad school to become an NP. Clinicals start this Fall. I work full time mom-fri on day shift. I’ve accumulated lots of debt because of school. I’m not sure how to complete clinical because most clinics are Monday through Friday as well. My husband(29m) works at job where it’s Monday through Friday, and he’s on call sometimes. My daughter attends day care, and is watched by my mom some days during the week. My husband has been getting increasingly upset with me because of all the debt I have accumulated, and because of the time it’s going to take me to complete school. He’s worried about me finding a job after I’m done with school as well. He saying that I am the reason that we cannot move, that we cannot have another child, that he is never able to find another job or take another job because he’s worried about moving. He said I ruined our family financially and I ruined our future. My loan will be roughly $90,000 to pay back after I’m done with school. I should graduate in 1.5 years.

I have so much worry. I can’t cut my hours it seems because of the debt. If I drop out of school I have to pay back the debt now. If I complete school I’ll have to pay back the debt then. Either way we won’t be able to move, and according to my husband, we won’t be able to have another child, and he won’t ever be able to take another job because we won’t be able to take that risk.

12,"Okay, so my family fights tons. Everyday. Verbal, and physical violence. A Few days ago, my sister was fighting with my dad about her allergy testing (I don’t know what exactly happened) during my zoom conference. They have fought 3 times during 3 different zoom calls, so it’s not like I haven’t told them to be quiet and not fight. During this call, texted them and had to mute my call to scream at them. They stopped, thankfully. This shouldn’t even be happening after **3 TIMES** of me screaming at them. 

**MANY MORE FIGHTS HAPPENED PRIOR TO THE ONES IM MENTIONING.**

a few days ago my family was also arguing about a new grill that we got. My sister (22F) was angry at my (15F) dad (48M)  

Yesterday, they were fighting about throwing away a dirty rag, and the patio door was open so I can assure you that the neighbors heard them screaming. My sister came to me telling me how crazy my parents were, and I ignored it. I was sick of all the arguments. 

Today, we had to get a vet appointment for our pet bird. My sister had asked me why we always went to the same vet, and I told her that it was because of cost, and my mom always went with the cheaper option. After this, my sister stormed into the room my mom was working in, and screamed at her and called her a bird killer. She then slammed the door. 
I was pissed off because I just wanted to get an emergency appointment for our pet, and my mom and sister were arguing, once again. I went to my dad to ask if *he* could take the appointment, and then he asked my sister if she was going to take the appointment. Apparently, she was on the phone with the vet, and my dad didn’t know and called her name from upstairs multiple times. She then got mad and said “you’re crazy! I was on the phone call with the vet!”. Then, she mentioned the situation with my mom to my dad and called her a bird killer. She then went on and on about how we shouldn’t have pets if we were going to go with the cheaper option. 


After this argument, my dad told my sister that she could develop immunity to her allergies if she ate healthy and exercised. She went on and said “I eat healthy!” And she expected me to stick up for her and tell my dad that she ate healthy. Afterwards, she asked me if she ate healthy, and I told her that she ate normally. She then proceeded to say, “I think I eat very healthy”. I said, “ok, cool. Why are you getting so defensive?” She said, “I don’t know, you didn’t defend me and tell him that I eat healthy”. She was mad about his for a long while. 


After this argument, Ive had it. My sister got mad because my mom got a glimpse of a missed phone call on my sister’s phone, and she got extremely pissed and started yelling at my mom to respect her privacy. A little later, my mom accidentally bumped into my sister and she proceeded to talk about how 
she had no personal space. 

This fight was quieter  than the ones we usually have.  I’ve had it at this point, and I yelled. **I told them to be quiet and stop fighting, because that’s all they do, and that’s what they’ve been doing this whole week. Let alone this whole quarantine.** the fight wasn’t too extreme, but it was more so bickering.  I yelled, and my sister called me crazy and said that I created an unnecessary argument. She then stormed upstairs when I tried explaining why I was angry to her, and she said I was giving her a headache. 

I told my mom about all these fights that we’ve been having, and how mentally tormented I feel everyday, she didn’t seem to care. She only cared about if the neighbors heard me screaming. My dad just sat and laughed, and asked if I wanted to play volleyball. They also kept interrupting me when I was trying to speak.

This is where I'm a hypocrite because I'm going to be bringing up my mom's husband. He shares details that is completely unnecessary for people to know about. He was talking to one of his stupid church friends who asked about me and that ass hole (mom's husband) elaborated about my business such as where I work and my school plans.

17,"Tl;dr at bottom. 

Hi, I'm not the most socially adept and have never ran into a situation like this before so just looking for a bit of advice! 

Me and my friend (though closer to an acquaintance than a close friend) both study psychology at university which is how we met. We're now both about to graduate and have been looking at post-grad options, we both are interested in clinical/health psychology. 

My local university offers two masters courses:

Health psychology 

Clinical and health psychology 

I was initially going to apply just for the clinical and health psychology MSc as I wasn't actually aware the other one existed. I let my friend know about this and she told me she was applying for the health psychology MSc at the same university, I researched this course and found it was similar but with more benefits (accreditation, bursary for every student) and it was also more competitive (15 places). 

I suggested the idea of applying to both courses and she told me it was a good idea, so I did. She only applied for the health course though. 

We helped each other with our applications and I submitted mine about 2 days after her. Despite that, I heard back a few days ago. I got an email from the university saying they want to make me an offer for whichever course I preferred, and I chose the health psychology course. 

I didn't tell my friend and I still haven't; she has still heard nothing. I even went as far as hiding her from the picture I posted on Facebook so she wouldn't see, because I felt awful and I still do. If it wasn't for her I would've never known about the course, and now I've lessened her chances of getting an offer. If she gets rejected I will honestly feel so awful, but I'm worried that may be the case due to their only being 15 places, and my application likely carried more weight than hers as I had experience of a clinical internship. 

We're also now in our final exam period which lasts until the end of next week. 

So now I'm wondering if I should tell her about my offer or wait either until the end of exams or until she hears back. 

 tl;dr: My friend told me about a masters course, we both applied for it, helped each other with applications etc. I got accepted onto the course a few days ago but she hasn’t heard anything. Should I tell her about my offer or wait until after our exams/she hears back?",14May2020,1

24,"She is a supervisor, and at first things were okay. But after a few months of her joining our store she makes it seem like she is the boss. I try not to single out my coworkers, and I always know that every work place as it’s flaws. But ever since she has been working she has caused the store and customers very upset. 

She is constantly on my back and others (except her “favourite workers”) at work. She will tell me what I should do and when I go do it she just does it herself. Example, she told me that since I didn’t have a till I could stock shelves. I went to go do it but she then took over my job, and started doing it herself. When I’m guiding people to where they should go, she comes and stands by me and does it (even though she is supposed to be at the front watching self serve). And for some reason she always stand behind us while we are helping customers and it makes me extremely uncomfortable. some customers have noticed and complained to her about me. She is aggressive with customers and right now, doesn’t stay six feet away from them. A guy asked why she was so close and she said to him “I’m just trying to help you?!”. 

Her behaviour at work is very annoying, however there is nothing the manager does. She tells me and other workers not to do something but let’s her favourite workers do it. 

Anyways, everything is piling up and I hate working with her. However, one day I was cashing and she was ~~~doing someone else’s job like usual~~~ and apparently someone stole something at self serve. I DID NOT know, since I had my back turned. I was NOT in charge of watching, I was at till. A customer saw but they said that they thought they payed at first then realized their screen was still on the “choose payment” screen. The customer tried their best to explain the situation to me, and I told them that I would forward them to my supervisor for clarity. My supervisor found out what happened and she got angry. 

For a while she was talking with security and asking my other coworkers questions. Then, she asked me what happened and I said I didn’t see since I was on till, and did not hear the weight the scale buzz. 

She then said it was my fault. I got upset and said that I wasn’t supposed to be watching the self serve tills, and that I was scanning someone elses items. She said that I should “pay attention more” when She isn’t there. Technically, she is supposed to be the one watching the self serve tills. 

Yes, sometimes I do cover for my coworkers for a few minutes but she never asked me to watch the self serve. Instead I had my back turned (facing the right way). She said that it was a serious situation and that the boss will be informed obviously. 

Despite me trying to tell her I had no clue what happened, she still kept blaming it on me. I have a feeling that she will report it to the boss and throw my name as the witness.


TLDR: my supervisor blamed me for not stopping a customer from stealing, even though she was the one not watching. I was helping another customer and had no idea someone stole items. She is also can not keep her distance and it makes me uncomfortable having her watch every move I make.",14May2020,1

So does this mean I'm bisexual? Is this is normal? If my relationship works out (and I'm definitely rooting for it), then I'll never sleep with another woman. I'm a little sad by this, but it is what it is. Anyone else like this? And a threesome is out of the picture, as I'm extremely insecure, so I'll always have to suppress these feelings.",14May2020,1
28,"So recently, I posted a story featuring my best friend standing on my driveway and waving at me (obvs because of social distancing)

A mutual friend of ours commented on the story. Let’s Now this mutual friend is someone that we attended MMA classes with and would often train with both of us. He is our age (22/23) but has a STUNNING partner and a newborn.We were also invited to celebrate the birth over drinks. 

Now, he’s always been  a friendly guy and to my knowledge, he hasn’t been creepy or weird...But he did mention once how “Asian girls are funny” randomly into a conversation. Thought that was rather sweeping and made no sense. 

Suddenly he drops at how it’s on his bucket list to “try” a South asian girl and more so 2 girls at once. Then with no shame, messages at how he wants to have a threesome with myself and my BESTFRIEND WHO IS LIKE MY SISTER. 

I’ve ignored the messages from him but I’m facing a moral dilemma. He has a partner and 3 kids...do I pretend nothing has happened or do I have to tell her. I don’t know his partner personally, she may not even know us...it’s not a situation i want to be involved in!

I’m actually rather disgusted at the thought that 1) he thought it appropriate to suggest this and 2) he’s legally married! 

What do I do? I ignored his messages, should I tell his partner?",14May2020,1

30,"Ever since I was younger to now whenever I having an excited train of thought (literature plots, situations with characters I plan to write about, or comedic situations made up), or am listening to music that makes me want to move I get up and pace back and forth fast. Whenever I do this I find myself completely immersed in my head. I add a skip and have a complete goofy look.

My neighbor below us (as I live in an apartment ) has complained about it. I’ve tried to stop but whenever I’m really excited I can’t really sit down. This also happens when I’m working for something too long but only rarely happens when I’m in school. I can focus on lectures, class work, and I become very immersed into reading for long periods of times. I can sit down on my phone too.

I was out walking with my mom today and she said as I was listening to music I made the same faces when I’m normally pacing back and forth and it makes me really look weird. I really want to stop this habit of mine and now that I’m older I’ve really taken notice of it. Is there any practice which can make me stop?",14May2020,1

I am currently in bed and I keep feeling really hot and cold and I’m pretty sure I have a fever. I don’t know what this is but I know covid 19 is heavily associated with a fever.

I don't know how to care about school, and I want it to change. I was at least handing things in before, but in the past week or so I haven't done anything and I feel really guilty. I need help.

I used to stay up late every night finishing my schoolwork. I had amazing grades. I put 110% into every assignment. But for the past 3 years or so? I've barely had any motivation. I've been dissociating, so it feels like hours are passing in minutes. I haven't even had the motivation to draw or watch tv, which I used to love. It feels like ever since I've been getting treatment for my anxiety, I haven't had the constant panic that kept me on top of my schoolwork. And at home all day, it's worse. I'm suicidal enough to not care about my future, but not suicidal enough to need hospitalization. 

I currently have an assignment that's a week overdue. My teacher just asked me if I'm alright, but I haven't responded. I don't know what to say or what to do. I don't understand the question and I've pissed away the entire day worrying about what to say to my teacher. I don't want her to think I'm not trying, but that's the truth.

What do I say to my teacher? And how can I learn to have motivation, especially during the pandemic?",14May2020,1

I mean being better than all of them considering reality and its actual issues and dangers. Being better than I could ever be with this body and this mind.

I know how weird it seems but now this is the only thing I can think about although the rapes happened three years ago. Some other bad things happened too but what I'm trying to say is that I'm aiming to become physically and mentally ready. Strong to face any threat. Being at the top of all of my pre-existent skills and develop new ones, master all of them with time, discomfort, more pain and patience. Being ready for almost everything, everywhere, anytime.

And yes, all because I'm scared. Fear is undoubtedly one of my biggest ""why's"". Therapy? Yeah, I know you thought about that.

Over time I’ve learned more, been given more responsibility and have been able to complete more jobs such as restocking, reception, and even some medical help such as pulling blood and giving vaccinations.

In the last year Ive been get called away from tasks more and more to assist with something else and one of my bosses has decided that this means I can’t finish anything. I’ve been verbally berated, told not to come in when I’m already part time so hour cuts are a huge impact to my paycheck, and overall it’s been implied that no one expects anything from me.

I deleted my post about her that called her out and apologized because I felt almost scared for my own privacy/safety (when someone says something people don’t like on social media, i’ve seen lots of people get their personal info leaked), but now I regret it because I feel like she doesn’t deserve the money and fame she gets from her fake personality.

42,"So long story long I had seen this coming for a while. I love my dad and all but we don't really get along. All of our conversations almost always turn into arguments and I grew to dread hearing his footsteps on the stairs or in the hall gradually get louder as he got closer to me from around a corner or behind a door and me with nowhere to go. I was plenty shitty myself, couldn't make eye contact with him, anxiety builds up around him so I tried to keep all my responses to his questions objective and short to avoid anything slipping out (and to quicken the interaction I guess). I tried my best not to be so shitty but, I guess he could tell I felt uncomfortable around him and today that kind of blew up and we had a fight. After we had a bad argument where he got mad, started slamming things, and threw something at me. I left for a bit; side-note my dad is a pretty big guy and he's also pretty into fitness so I think it's fair to feel pretty not comfortable when he gets like that (to be fair I was pretty agitated myself and insulted him when I left after he threw the bottle at me.) and when I came back he tried to take my computer from me, (which was on my back in a backpack and I know this sounds defensive but I want to clarify I purchased this computer with my own money and use it for sending out job applications, skills training and pretty much everything.) He grabbed my bag from behind and started to wrestle it off me and I tried to wrestle it back. We ended up on the floor I got my bag, my blanket and I guess left any brain cells I had left on the floor cause now I'm living outside, in the middle of an epidemic and probably not for that long either.

44,"My boyfriend (M19) and me (F19) haven’t seen each other for about a month during this quarantine. I haven’t had much to do during the day, so whenever he messages me I basically reply right away. Even if I’m cooking or doing something at the moment, it’s usually not taking up enough of my attention that I don’t text him back. 

Him, on the other hand, sometimes doesn’t text me until 3pm (although I send good morning texts around 10am). I’m aware he sleeps in since it’s quarantine, but still. This is a bit late. I might reply to him right away, yet he will still then not send another text until maybe 5 or 6pm. Or, he will send maybe 2-3 messages back and forth before he disappears again for a few hours. He never gives me an explanation as to what he’s doing, and brushes it off with “I was with my family.” Which is valid, but if he’s gonna be gone awhile, it’s not much of me to want him to maybe let me know what he’s doing... is it?

I’ve brought this up a couple times. Usually we spend maybe a total of 15 active minutes texting all day, and then at 10pm he might say “oh I’m gonna call you in 10 minutes” and then I don’t actually get a call until midnight or later- no explanation as to why he took so long. One day he told me that he “got distracted watching a movie” - I mean, why couldn’t you have told me that? 

He tells me that I can’t dictate our relationship based on his text message game, because he’s a great guy in person. This is true, he is. Even when he calls me I could spend hours talking to him, but it’s really draining when I don’t hear from him all day, have no idea what he’s doing, and he just doesn’t really make an effort to send me a message. 

Am I overreacting? Do I need to chill out and give him some space, or is it valid to feel a little tossed to the side? I love my boyfriend, and this is not even close to enough to make me second guess our relationship, but I miss feeling like he’s prioritizing me when we aren’t together. What should I do? 

tl;dr- my boyfriend texts me a couple times throughout the day and disappears for hours on end despite being in quarantine and not going to work or school, am I overreacting by being upset by this? Or is it valid, and what should I do?",14May2020,1

My right hand can grip it with like 20% of the pain the left one has.

50,"This post is probably going to seem less serious than most posts here, but I think since most of us (if not all of us) are in quarantine, the little things are driving us crazier each day.

To make a long story short, one of my best friends (M) had a problem with another best friend (R) on Xbox, so he kicked him from the party. R decided it was best to just leave M alone for the day and I decided to spend the rest of the day talking to both of them. After all, I understood where both of them were coming from, so I couldn't choose sides.

I talked to M for most of the afternoon and talked to R for the evening. After joining R, M started saying some things to R that could be considered not so very nice, to say the least.

R retaliated and everything was going fine until some things (on M's part) were taken too far. I won't get into that since it's not my business, but let's just say I kind of had to side with R. I didn't say anything about the situation to either of them as it was happening (I was playing with R on Xbox, M was talking in a group chat with me, R, M and another friend of ours as they argued through that) and just hoped it would blow over.

A few days later, R still refuses to talk to M. M definitely took it too far, but I think R overreacted at the beginning. Since they both had valid points (and some not so valid points) I feel like I can't choose a side. Me and M have had problems with people before, some were friends, where I agreed with M completely. But with this situation, both are close friends of mine, and I can't choose sides.

Because of this, I've been stuck going back and forth between the two of them on Xbox, and it's annoying to say the least.

I should also note that M and R knew each other long before I knew either of them, so they have a longer history with each other than I do with either of them. Any advice on how to get them to start communicating with each other again would be really helpful!",14May2020,1

All of them are giant snoozefests, and I'll probably kill myself eventually if I actually have to go into a field where I'm actually supposed to care about how well a company is spending its money or everything else an accountant is supposed to do. Absolutely soul sucking. The problem is that I'm alright at accounting and not good at anything else, really. I chose accounting because I don't like anything else and an accounting degree will make money. The only other subject that interests me is astronomy. However, astronomy is unfortunately not just looking at space through a telescope, but intense math, science,  and programming. Guess what I hate? You guessed it, math and programming.

I've made the decision to join the Air Force next year. I've done a lot of research and read many of the anecdotal stories and advice. Many of those, including from family, have told me to absolutely not join the military because it is absolute hell. The others have said it was the best decision and time of their life because of the exact reasons that I want to join. I need the structure that the military brings, I need to take myself out of my comfort zone, I need life experience, I need to figure out what I'm doing, and I want to be a part of something bigger. I'm going to take the time until next year to work and get into physical shape.

I lost 100lb over three years ago by only counting calories and reached 155lb. I gained weight back up to 190lb over that time. I was a recluse and didn't actually work out except for a short stint, and I am so far out of shape that they need to invent a new one. Yesterday, I decided to get serious and just started with 75 pushups (throughout the day), 20 squats (2 x 10), and I walked a half-mile. This isn't extraordinary and I'm definitely going to do more, but I woke up today and I felt like I was hit by a truck. I couldn't get down and do a pushup or a plank, and my thighs ached. I did go for a mile-long hike and was proud even though I felt like I was dying by the end (and during). Now, I'm resting and going to walk another mile in a couple of hours.

I'm not afraid that I don't have the discipline or the willpower, but I'm afraid that my body just won't cooperate. What if I'm trying my hardest and giving it everything, but my body is just too overloaded and refuses to push anymore?

53,"Hey, gang!

Alright, so I have a boy from a prior marriage,have since remarried and am adopting the stepdaughter and we have an infant together.

I haven't seen the child in question due to this pandemic and stay-home orders. We agreed to roll-over lost time so I won't lose any time with the kiddo. We have a tentative agreement to resume parenting time (or visitation or whatever other demeaning terms are tossed out) this weekend. I did bring up that I wanted to roll the missed time in with two weeks I have in the summer (not on paper, but we agreed on).

So I get a reply that she's not ""comfortable"" letting me spend 3 weeks consecutively with my son. She's with him roughly 300 days of the year. I get hardly anything. What we have on paper is a very basic court order and is in no way what we have to abide by - it's the minimum. We've been encouraged by the judge in the past to work together and co-parent which I'll try to elaborate on why I think that isn't happening. 

So she says she's not ok with that but will let me do 2 weeks then 1 week or 1 week then 2 weeks or additional weekends. I tried asking her why she can't just agree to the 3 weeks but I've yet no reply nor do I have any understanding as to why she's not comfortable with it. 

I say tentative agreement because I also need her to meet me half-way. I drive 4 hours round-trip to get my boy when I pick him up then drop him off. My wife works at night and I'm not taking the little ones because the baby hasn't even gotten his initial run of shots as well as I'm not going to potentially expose them to anything when it's not necessary they come along. Also, baby and toddler in car for 4 hours; that goes without further explanation. 

I have my doubts she'll agree to a 50/50 meet because, well... I know her. She's in control of the situation and if I want to spend time with my son then I'll have to make my wife call put of work and potentially lose her job which will really hurt us. 

I do have a lawyer and retained her months ago before this craziness happened. I'm pursuing more time and a revisit of support since it's been many years from the original order. I support a family of 5, me included and I'm the only one with consistent pay. My lawyer wants to send her a letter to try to make a settlement so we don't have to go to court but I know where it's gonna go. Also, I'm trying to wait until she starts working again because I have no idea how the court will look at the current situation vs. what she has been earning. I can't afford for my support to go higher than it already is and I pay pretty much everything he needs. 

Should I tell my lawyer to just send it and hope the court will change support for when this pandemic is passed or do I wait for her to be working again? Do I tell my wife she has to call off work because I'm not going to make the little ones sit in a car for hours knowing I won't be able to meet halfway? Do I put off starting my weekends back up?",14May2020,1
54,"I met my girlfriend a few years back and within 4-5 months of meeting we messed up and she got pregnant. I liked her a lot then but we were both still immature adults that enjoyed partying and having 1 night stands and all the good stuff a young person can with little to now responsibility.   To be honest, I may have liked her, but i already had started to write her off a bit.  Shes not very logical and common sense I’snt all there.  It drove me nuts. I was going to end it.  I was a very hard person to impress at the time and unless you were perfect, you never stayed around long.  This why im usually single.  I was an idiot. At the time, she lived 4 hours away from me in a beach town she really liked.  She had 3-4 good friends there and a couple of jobs to make rent.  She’s a preschool teacher and the town she lived in is sort of pricey so another job was necessary.  After learning she was pregnant, we decided the best move would be for her to come up here with me and we would rent a house for the time being until we found where we wanted to land.  I live in SF and am the bread winner/supporter of all this from that day forward 100%.  
   My original intention was to get the hell out of Cali as ive lived and seen so many places in this beautiful country i knew there was better for me and also now, the family.  Unfortunately, money was not right just yet for that move and we decided to stay a year to save up and get good healthcare here in the city.  About 7 months into the pregnancy and a not so happy relationship, my ex who i had been so madly in love with prior to my current girlfriend and who i had never really gotten over decided to call me. A million old feelings came up. Long story short, i slept with her and i later told my GF.  Around that same time our daughter was born.  She had such major issues it required her to stay in the NICU for almost 5 months and crazy doc appts after. Needless to say, it took my GF into a deep dark depression.  I will never forgive myself.
   Fast forward 1.5 years and we are ending the lease on our rental and we are making plans to move.  Life has been good for the most part.  Im a completely different human being than i was then.  Ive made my life about those two and nothing more.  My GF is not the happiest but we’ve been working on it.  She takes anti depressants and admits that her head is not right and she needs something.  Ive been trying for months to workout with her, motivate her to start running again which used to bring her happiness.  Ive turned down extra shifts at work so she could visit friends and be worry free as i watched the baby.  I try talking often but shes not great at communicating. (A big problem we have been working on). Lately things have been getting worse though.  
      I recently took a position in Nevada.  So recent i still dont have a start date.  We were planning to relocate to the reno/carson area and do a short term lease to get our bearings straight and see if we like it before either trying somewhere else or buying a home there.  We both were a team in planning and home browsing. It was really nice.  The day after my paper and physical testing for this company was complete and the job was mine, she says she cant go...  She needs to move back home to the place she was last happy, her onld home 4 hours away.  Im shocked.  She says she misses it and the sense of community she once had with her friends.  Mind you, her friends have never come to visit her since the move.  She has gone down there to see them multiple times.  They rarely even talk anymore.  Her friends do not deserve her, but she has to go.  She doesnt want to break up but she doesnt want me to go.  She wants to see what its like without me. To miss me and wish i was there.  Doing this will require putting our daughter in daycare (our daughter is high risk in this pandemic), getting a roommate, and her getting a job because i cannot afford a house there and an apartment here.  I will have to work ungodly hours in order to do this and still save.  She says she only needs to go for a short while and that she hopes it clears her mind.  I dont know what this town has that is soo strong that she is willing to breakup the family and put our kid in a risy environment.  When i tell her its not smart she responds “ what else am i supposed to do?”  Be a parent and do whats best!!!  I know i cant force her to stay and if this move truly is what she needs in order to possibly help the family get back together then she needs to go.  I personally dont think she knows what kind of struggle shes going to endure and she’ll want to come back (i really hope) but what if she doesnt want to come back?  As a man that wants best for my kid, how do i not pay for everything and keep enabling her so my baby can stay safe?  She has no family close. They are about 3 hours away.  If we were to move to NV my mother would be 20 min away.  Part of me says, take her to court and fight for custody and move to NV so there would be a family member to watch her while i work.  The other part and the biggest part says, just go through with it and pray that she comes back in hopes to have my family back.  She’s made some bad decisions that i have recorded, such as drinking with the baby home and other things.  She has a psychologist and a emotional support animal, so there is a paper trail.  I make good money and cover the childs insurance while my GF is on medicare.
    I love this woman and want nothing more than to be happy with her and i thought we were on the verge of finding it by starting a new chapter in a new place but this is a huge blow that now has me questioning everything.  I dont want to take our kid from her at all or would i want to do to her what she is about to do to me but when it all comes down to it, i need that child in my life.  Where she wants to move has absolutely no work for me anywhere close.  It has little to no opportunity for her cause its a small tourist town with a college nearby and its surrounded by miles of fields in both directions.  I dont know what to do. Im falling apart cause im losing so much and i cant see taking anything from her but what are my options? I cant lose my babygirl like this. Ive never been away from her and i cant imagine this future that is starting to transpire",14May2020,1
56,"I (female in her teens) have a crush on my friend's boyfriend. We'll call him G. So G is pretty good  we have a two classes together. I get to know him and after a while I start to crush on him (mind you I'm pretty low-key and would never confess to my crush). When I find out he's dating a good friend of mine I got rid of any possibilities with him (girl code and all). However due to some messed up twist of fate, we keep spending more and more time together. The more time we spend together the more I feel like G is flirting with me, but I'm not full of myself and just brush it off. However I can't ignore it whenever he pats my head, plays with my hair, or playfully kicks me. I just can't help but crush on him. I feel terrible since G is my friend's boyfriend and I have a good relationship with both of them. I don't want either one of them to misunderstand the situation and I value my relationship with them. Please help....",14May2020,1
57,"My 25f ex 25m and I have been broken up for around a month. We still talk every day and are on good terms. We're pretty much best friends. I have no romantic interest in him anymore and the break up was mutual. We broke up because he only wanted to be intimate once a month or once every two months.

I think I'll be ready to date again in about another month or two. I was wondering about boundaries with this. My ex said I could tell him details of my dating life...is that wrong? In a relationship is that like emotional cheating because of our past? I wouldn't talk badly about my future partner to my ex as I think that would be alienating and I don't generally bad talk people anyways unless they've done something really bad. But i was wondering if telling my ex details would be wrong ...seems kinda wrong. I'm always 100% loyal to who I'm with and I don't play with peoples feelings. I know I could ask my future partner but seems kind of awkward to ask off the bat.

To the best of my knowledge I don't think my ex has feelings for me. I think he would have tried to get back together if that were the case (as he had done so once before when we broke up.) We both have a rule about only getting back together once. No multiple break ups. I think we genuinely both friendzoned each other and are happy with it.

Would your gf being close with her ex make you uncomfortable?",14May2020,1
58,"I live in an an apartment complex. I live on the top floor, no one above me, but my neighbors on both sides of me make a lot of noise:

- Very frequent thumps, thuds, banging, pounding
- Much of it (65%) I would consider ""excusable,"" as in relatively normal apartment noise from someone not particularly concerned about being quiet; Cabinets closing etc
- Some of it (25%) I would consider borderline, as in not painful, but still ""literally what are you people even doing right now""
- Some of it (10%) I would consider egregious, as in huge thuds directly against the wall that literally rattle my doors in their frames from the sheer fluctuation in air pressure, deep thuds on the floor that are uncomfortable to listen to and that i can feel through my feet (mind you the floor is a foot and a half of solid concrete in a hurricane-proof building in Florida)

********** tl;dr Is this normal? If not, should I confront both of my neighbors myself, or go to management? **********

All of the above happen every day, from both neighbors, peppered throughout the day but skewed towards the evening, usually starting at 7:30am (from my right neighbor) and often going as late as midnight (from my left neighbor). Each day, there is typically around 10 to 15 episodes of these noises that will last anywhere from 30 seconds to 30 minutes each. Each episode is a distribution of noises as outlined above; A handful of episodes each day will include a huge jumpscare (the 10% mentioned above).

I understand I can't expect silence, but over time, I have grown increasingly annoyed because I just keep thinking ""This amount of noise HAS to be preventable, my eardrums aren't busted, but why the hell should I have to put up with this anyway?""

Is this normal? If not, what do i do? Here are my concerns:

- It's coming from BOTH of my neighbors. Seems like awfully bad luck, making me worry that the problem is me, not my neighbors.
- I have never met or seen the people living in either unit. I am hesitant to go confront either of them, because I am not in a position of authority and worry they will just argue ""it's normal apartment noise"" (noisy people are not capable of recognizing the excess of their own noise)
- I am afraid to go to management because it will be difficult for management to witness the noise. The worst of it is typically in the evening after business hours; During the day, sometimes hours go by without any noise.",14May2020,1
59,"So I’m (F) finishing up this year of college, and a memory I suppressed from earlier this year just came back to me and has me wondering...but lemme give you some context.

I went with some friends from my school (mostly M) to visit their friends at a different school (who I’d met before) to just hang out and drink and have a chill night.

As the night goes on, this one boy that goes to the school I’m visiting is kinda drunk and we’re just talking and hanging out, but he’s getting kinda touchy, (ie putting his legs across my lap, laying his head on my lap, head on my shoulder) but it doesn’t bother me and he’s sorta drunk so idc. 

LATER that night tho, we both happen to be in the bathroom while his very drunk friend is doing his business before they go back to their dorm room. I was going to wash my face, but the boy says my name and his tone is kinda different...and then he says “I have something to tell you” and I said something along the lines of “ummm ok what is it” and he just started acting really nervous and fidgety and then his friend came out of the stall and they hurried out with a hug goodbye. 

I was so confused by the whole thing but I didn’t ask him about it at breakfast the next morning in case he didn’t remember.

The weirdest part of this whole thing is...he was supposed to maybe have a thing for my friend that I go to school with?! So I’m just trying to figure out what the whole interaction means. It doesn’t really matter either way I’m just genuinely curious:)",14May2020,1

Anna ghosted me for 12 weeks because i said my family was having problems again.

61,"My roommate has been a slob the past couple months, and now we have a pest problem. He just told me he plans to set off a bug bomb or fogger or whatever (are those the same thing?) in the next couple hours in our kitchen to kill his fruit flies and another in the room next to my bedroom for a flea infestation from his dog. I’ve never used one of these because I have the sense to give my pet flea control meds and wash my damn dishes. I have no idea how they work.


He said he’d let them fog the house overnight. That did not sound right to me. I asked him if it was pet safe, and he said no, but he’d wipe down everything in the morning. I get the feeling this isn’t human safe either. I did a cursory Google search and gather that I’m right to object. I want to put my foot down and tell him he can’t do that while the house is occupied because it isn’t safe for me or my pet, but his insistence that this was happening tonight and nonchalant attitude when I brought up my concerns has me second-guessing myself.


Am I being unreasonable? I really don’t do well with confrontation. Is what this guy insists he wants to do at all safe under any circumstances, or do I need to hold firm? And what the hell do I do if he tries to poison us anyway? Threaten to call the cops?

62,"So I have known this guy for about 10 years. Basically met when we were kids and now we are both about to turn 16 soon. Through all of those years, I always had a huge crush on him. I have also had crushes on other guys but he is the only one that I started to love. The thing is though, I love him even though we don't talk anymore. We were best friends and suddenly decided to stop talking to each other after we both turned 12. We have never gone to the same school except for now as we are both sophomores in the same highschool.

I have had two boyfriends and I had HUGE crushes on them. The first day I got with them, I could say I loved them a lot. I wake up the second day, I feel nothing. How did I get from being so happy to wanting to break up with them already. My relationships didn't last long as they could tell I wasn't into the idea of being together anymore and we both decided to break up. Even though I felt nothing, I still stayed with them because I thought ""Maybe this is how it feels. Maybe I will love them again eventually."" Clearly, I didn't.

I then tried dating a girl and I felt the same way. I just couldn't love anyone. Not romantically at least. I cared for them truly but I just didn't want to be with them. Everytime I broke up with someone, I never feel sad or cry. I just feel relieved if anything. I have also felt weird about my sexuality. I likes both genders I guess but only crushes happen for me. I can't love them. So I am not ace or bi or straight. I have just been saying ""I am just me. If I like someone, then I like them. That's that."" 

But this guy, lets call him Obby, I love Obby with all of my heart. I would honestly die for him. I have tried becoming his friend and everything. I even confessed once but he didn't feel the same way so I stopped trying but I still love him. He has had 2 girlfriends so far. One in summer school before freshman year and one in sophomore year. They both broke it off with him and I wish I could tell him to just give me a chance. Everytime I message him though, he always makes sure to show his sister. His sister happens to be dating my brother and will marry by next year. I will know Obby for the rest of my life and I will still love him even when we both die.

I have tried so hard to stop feeling anything for him but now I even dream of him every night. I don't know what to do anymore and I know I can't tell him or my brother and his gf will talk to me about it. They did it the last time I confessed and basically told me to get over it. What am I supposed to do? I can't get over him, I can't tell him, I can't love anyone else except him. At this point, I'm just so tired of not being able to tell him. I want to tell him how much I love him and even though he may not ever like me, I will always be there for him. No matter how many times he breaks my heart and I cry over him, I will still love him. That I would do ANYTHING for him.

It's not that I'm not ready for a relationship or anything. I'm just waiting for my love to finally realize that I'm the one for him. I would change everything for him. I know he is my soulmate. I hope this is like that one quote where ""maybe it's meant to be but maybe it's the wrong time"" or something like that. We do not have much in common but I love him. Always and forever. 

Please tell me what to do. So far, no one understands me and I think, maybe I am broken then. Something is clearly wrong with me.",14May2020,1
63,"I am in a situation where I am guessing that most people would love to be in. A old fling contacted me on my birthday and offered if I wanted nudes as a birthday present. I said no immediately. The reason being that in the past I was a very manipulative person and through that built a relationship where she would happily send me nudes.(Yes I was trash I am aware. But in my defence I was young and didn't understand really what I was doing.) But after I realized that I was trash I told her every thing and apologized profusely. I told her that it was her decision to how we would proceed and I would respect whatever. So we cut contact and then gained contact a few years later and we were building a relationship again but a friendahip this time. I would do whatever I could and we were chill. So my birthday comes around and she says that she misses the ""good old times"" and wants to send me pictures to ""update me"" on her current progress. I said no but I am not gonna lie I am tempted.

A week ago I FINALLY landed a job and get paid next week.. but the dilemma here is that my account is -$18.00 and I was curious if any of you knew of any small loan agencies that would be willing to supply my a loan that minuscule? I’m quite certain the interest rates will be sky high but honestly that doesn’t bother me. I have so much that automatically deducts that I just want to earn my pay check without having minor debts.

Okay so I'm an artist obviously, I'm also not professional, but I draw for fun. For a long time I've shown my grandma a lot of my drawings (I recently stopped because It makes me uncomfortable) and she liked them and stuff, I also gifted her some really old VOCALOID drawings (Really ugly drawings of Rin and Miku) and she wants more. Once I got over my crazy VOCALOID phase I started drawing more sad things like emo/goth men and women. My grandma kept complaining because ""It's very sad and the girl/boy looks angry!!!!"" and once again, I got over this emo phase and I started drawing what I like now (Portraits of my male characters who look normal and pretty cool). She think I'm still in that phase because she doesn't usually see my drawings unless my dad forces me. And today I refused making her a drawing because:

1.I'm not wasting time for something I don't want to make.

2.She is obviously not gonna pay me.

3.I'm in art block. (I basically have really little inspiration)

And I also told her that It takes me a lot of time to make a drawing (Usually 5-6 hours depending on how difficult the piece is) and she laughed and basically said ""You are lying!!!!!!!! It's impossible for you to take so long you're not even that good"" and after that my dad and my grandma proceeded to laugh at how I look and saying that my generation is so dumb and shit even tho theirs is even worse.

90,"I have so much anxiety about the way I smell. About 3 years ago, a friend of mine had a talk with me and she basically said a few people have been saying I smell bad. I’m thankful that my friend said this to me, but ever since I’ve been so self conscious. I thought my hygiene was adequate when my friend brought it up, but maybe it wasn’t? After that, I began to shower sometimes 2 or 3 times per day, I brushed my teeth after every meal, made sure to reapply deodorant, and wore a lot of perfume. 

However, about 2 years ago there was ANOTHER incident where a girl in my class kept saying “something smells bad” and I left to put on perfume because I had anxiety that it was me (even though I did everything I was supposed to regarding hygiene that day). When I came back, I noticed the girl was pointing to me and whispering, “I think it’s her.”

She could’ve thought it was me because I left, but I doubt it. I truly think I smelled. I’m just confused. 

Also, a lot of my friends have worse hygiene routines than me. Once, my friend and I had a sleepover, but we went to breakfast the next day. I said, “I feel gross because I haven’t showered today” and my friend said, “same, can you smell me?” So I smelled her and I didn’t smell anything. However, when I asked her to return the favor and smell me, she said she “kinda smells me.” Like what? I’m pretty sure we had gone the same amount of time since our last shower :(

I just need advice on what to do. I have no clue. I feel like I’m just a smelly person despite my hygiene routine, which is extremely anxiety provoking for me. I feel like I don’t have control over how I smell. I am currently in college (it’s summer for me now), and during the school year I would have to rush home to take showers in between my classes. My friends would be so confused as to why I was showering so much, but the truth is that I was having a panic attack and was convinced that I smell bad. 

I think this has caused me to develop social anxiety. I barely have friends except for like 2 people. However, I still feel insecure about my scent in front of these two people. I literally can’t make friends because I feel like they think I smell. I’ve also convinced myself that people don’t talk to me because they can smell my body odor. Please help :(",14May2020,1

94,"So super weird question, seeking advice.  My father and I have a normal relationship. But just recently he accidentally (or so I'm assuming) messaged me via messenger a pornlink.  At first I thought it was one of the funny videos he normally sends to me but this one wouldnt open.  I asked him what the video was because it wouldnt open and he said he had no idea, which I thought was weird.  So upon looking at the link closer (it had a screenshot) it is easy to see it is a sex act.  I know he likely sent this to me by accident and was embarrassed which is why he said that.  But I just feel gross, sick to my stomach, and not sure how to handle this.  He told me later he was hacked but I'm assuming he just said that as he was so embarrassed.  Help please.",14May2020,1
95,"Okay so I'm a 18 year old male and a few weeks ago I started talking this this girl (19y). She was in my stat class this past semester but we never talked in class due to where I was seated with some of my friends. Anyways fast forward to this past week or two we started talking and I got that feeling that we were getting along together really well, so I simply shot my shot and asked her if she wanted to go out and do something. She said yes and seemed very happy and excited with the idea of doing that. We got ice cream because that was the only place that was open at the time and we just kinda vibed together really well. Well the next two nights after that, we went on two more dates (to be clear we both knew and understood that they were dates) and they were simply some of the best dates I have ever been on with anybody. At the end of the third date things were going really well and we ended that date on great terms. On the car ride home after I dropped her off at her house I was thinking to myself like ""wow I finally did it"" ""nothing can possibly go wrong"" ""this can really turn into something special"" you know stuff like that. Everything that happened seemed to be leading in the right direction and we were gonna be in to what I hoped was a relationship after going on a few more dates with her in the coming weeks. However when I asked her what she wanted to do for our fourth date she said she ""has a question"" before making any plans. So she asked and said ""what was I looking for?"" I responded accordingly and she said that she isn't ready for anything right now and she just wants to be friends due to her recently getting out of a relationship which is valid and I understand completely, but at that point I was crushed because everything was going so well and I was looking forward to what adventure we were gonna go off into. As of writing this we haven't talked in a couple of days since she wanted to just be friends she did say she wanted to still hangout with me but I ultimately chose to just give her space. I decided that I didn't want to wait around and hope for something to change because it would destroy my mental health due to my anxiety. However, I'm still struggling to accept what happened. I do want to reach out again in a few weeks or so to see if things have changed because I really did enjoy the short but sweet time we shared and I just can't help but think what it could of been with her. I've questioned myself thinking that they may just be something wrong with me. I think about her all the time and it brings me down at points during the day where I'm alone or not busy. I just don't know why one day is was good and the next everything changed.

I just simply do not know what to do moving forward and I would appreciate any feedback or advice that can be given.

Thank You.",14May2020,1

I’m noticing a bizarre correlation. The fire alarm in my building goes off fairly often, sometimes just for a few seconds (can personally confirm this is just from cooking), and sometimes for minutes at a time. It occurred to me lately that most of the time when it goes off for a longer period I’m in the middle of a shower. It’s not every shower, only every week or two. I’m not working ATM so I also don’t shower at the same time every day.

I never leaving cooking or candles on when I’m showering so I don’t think I’m triggering it with heat. Because this is so frequent in our building, I don’t evacuate when it starts and the alarm usually stops before I finish showering. Yes, correlation is not causation, but once I noticed the link it really started to get to me. Why in the world would that happen so often at the same time?

103,"For backstory, we stopped being friends because she was 13 dating my 19 year old sexually abusive ex. I told her I was uncomfortable with it and she said she didn't want to be my friend anymore because of it. 

I had given her chances continually from August until February when I moved schools and stuff to get away from her and her bullying. 

She completely wrecked me and my life. I barely attended school this year, I'm failing every class, have to take classes I don't like because I moved school, I feel into a very bad depression where I was hospitalised fir a few weeks so I wouldn't hurt myself. The list goes on. 

For 10 months I've been thinking about this moment, what I'd say and do. I came to the plan that I was going to tell her I didn't wish to speak to her. But now that the moments actually come, I don't know. My heart broke. It broke thinking about how she has no one to trust or turn to. 

But I'm very suspicious. She's still Friends with my ex and this other girl (this girl has a different story, but long story short she made her parents hate me by telling them lies). If she doesn't talk to people she blocks them or at least removes them from her social media. It's also the time of my exams. It seems a little fishy. 

I'm so stuck. On one hand I hate her and never want to see her again, on the other, I love her and all I wanna do is hold her again while we sleep and hear her laugh while we stay up until ungodly hours playing games. 

Please help me, I'm so overwhelmed with emotions.

I realized I hadn’t been breathing all that much because it gets so hot under a fabric face mask and dogs up my glasses. I drink some water, sit down for a bit but people needed my help so I put one back on. 

The second one I put on was this thin mask that I thought would be bette, but it’s so tight against my face. And for some reason putting that mask on pushed me into a full panic attack. I started hyperventilating and felt like I was going to vomit. 

I sent myself home and it took two hours to calm myself from this panic attack. I used to get panic attacks a lot but it’s been almost two years since my last one. 

Idk what the fuck to do. I have to wear a mask, but I physically can’t. I feel like I could go into a full panic attack just thinking about putting a mask on. It hurts my throat from the hot air inside, it hurts my ears, I can’t breath, I get no oxygen, It’s horrible.

112,"Hi everyone I'm a junior soon to be senior in highschool, and I think i have a stalker. The first time this person texted me was when i was out in the park at 8:00 PM. I was on a swing set, when the person texts me hello. I say hello back. Then they text me saying do you have my money? I think I either said no or maybe. They then text back saying who is this? I say, your worst nightmare, jokingly think nothing would happen. At this point is when I started to walk home. When I was walking after texting them that they said that they see me walking, and that they are coming for me. When I saw this I balted to my house scared out of my mind. Luckily I made it home. When i got home they said why did you run. And i said its because i didn't know who they were, and i thought they were going to harm me. What was strange is that after i said that they then said, sorry wrong number, but then they texted back again saying why did I run. And I told them again. They said cool, then why did you run. After telling them for the 3rd time, they said what's my name. I gave it to them, and after that they stopped. After that there was another instance where I was at Walmart with my mom, and they texted me again saying, you text my kid? I said no, and they stopped that day. Another instance is where is was at the park again. But when I was walking home they texted me, who are you? This time I didn't respond to them at all. And that was that for that day. In this instance I was in the car waiting for my mom to come out of the store. When I got these 2 scary images on my phone through text, they they said I'm outside. But then they deleted those pictures right away.After that I ran into the store where my mom was. When I did they texted me where are you going? But I didn't respond. After we were at the store we went to Mc Donald's. They started to text me again saying that I see you in the car, I'm following you. Then they said that I see you in the park We are coming 4 U. This is when i got confused. Because mc Donald's was bitterly right across the street from the store we were just at. And i wasn't at the park. But after all that i got a new phone, which meant I had a new number. And I didn't get a text from them for sometime. But they eventually found my new phone number. They then texted me saying that they hacked all my social media, and that they were going to expose the gay porn I was looking at to my family. If you didn't know about my orientation now, now you know. But after that they seemed to stop texting me, but this person hasn't stopped stalking me. Everytime I got to the park I see all these different cars parked in similar places everytime I'm there. And when i leave, they leave to. Ever since I've been limiting the time i go outside. So that they won't see me. I've tried talking to police at my school, but they said they can't do anything because they haven't sent me death threats. But if they did they suggested to me that tell them to stop. Which really pissed me off. And probably won't work. I also told my mom about this, BUT INSTEAD OF CALLING THE POLICE, SHE CALLED SOME DETECTIVE? needless to say, he sure hasn't been doing shit about this. My mom such a infuriating peice of crap to deal with. I feel like telling my dad won't work either because I feel like he will do the same thing. This people have been texting me through all sorts of different phone numbers, so its pretty hard to block.

got an IT internship for the summer and because of covid19 it is now a work from home situation and i am taking 3 online summer classes (in order, at most 2 running at the same time, no meeting times just my own pace with guided due dates) 

the whole family plus a few s/o are all now living under one roof full time in an open floor plan situation. everyone is constantly making noise and talking loud for no good reason. they have very little considerations for others and it is getting really exhausting dealing with them/asking them to stop. their noise level was so disruptive that i flunked one of my finals and my professors had questioned me about the noise from my end (i dont have my own room and my desk area is within the living room/open space) 

i do not have a quiet, non-disruptive, private space in order to work. there isn't really a lot i could do to get a space set up to work privately during this whole covid19 situation, but the only thing that i could do is to use the living room when no one is awake and then run back into my room when my brother isnt sleeping; essentially i have to move every half hour or so to avoid all noise made while trying to not disturbing my brother's sleep 

the company contacted us earlier April about switching over to wfh for this summer/fall and they were okay if we wanted to drop the internship. its a situation where they could push back the work (like cancel the internship session) or they could continue it with or without interns. a couple of us were totally fine with the work from home situation and was okay if they shut down for the summer or pushed it back 

i need the internship because i dont have a lot of experience in IT and this one can really provide a lot of practical knowledge/experience in website management and some HR based analytics 

im fine with juggling the workload/course load while pushing out quality work, but im not confident in being able to do this while dealing with my family's antics. im thinking about just dropping this internship to save myself the mental stress but i also dont want to. i dont know what to do, please help 

TLDR: i have to deal with my inconsiderately loud and disruptive family members until covid19 is no longer an issue and i have a wfh internship starting June 15 with no private space for it. should i drop the internship (and how should i do it) or should i just deal with this trash living/working situation because i need the experience?",14May2020,1

117,"My now fiancé and I have been together for almost 8 years. He is a great partner but there is one thing that continues to bother me, and that is his temper. He can go from 0 to 100 in about 15 seconds, over things I consider to not be a big deal. I’ve learned what to say and what not to say during a fight in order to keep things from exploding. One reoccurring issue is his road rage. The horn is his best friend. He is also known to chase down the person who “wronged” him so that he can scream at them for what they did wrong. One time, he got out of his car and chased down a bicyclist for blocks because the bicyclist cut him off, leaving me in the car with the engine running waiting for him to come back. However, the main problem (in my opinion) is that he has been known to punch walls/ doors while we are fighting because he is so angry. Most recently he’s thrown his boots at the wall (we now have a scuff on our ceiling I can’t reach to wash off) and tonight he threw a dish at the wall, which shattered into pieces. I feel like I’m naturally a calm and logical person, so fighting isn’t something that comes naturally to me. He has never hit me, but sometimes he gets so angry (literally probably sees red) that I don’t know what will happen next. I do understand that people express themselves in different ways, especially when they feel mad or hurt, but sometimes I feel like the way he acts isn’t normal or healthy.

118,"I've been severely depressed for years. I'm just 23 and my whole world has fallen apart. I no longer have a personality or a sense of self. I am completely blank, and sometimes I have to take cold showers just to remind myself that I'm actually alive. I cannot describe in words the pain that I feel every day. Every single day feels like groundhog day. It's the same bullcrap over and over again. Therapy didn't help me at all and I hate it how everyone just keeps insisting that 'I haven't found the right therapist yet'. I have tried therapy with many therapists over the course of 5 years and it didn't help me at all. If anything, I just kept getting worse. I've been on meds too including a bunch of SSRIs, SNRIs and sedatives but it seems like nothing is helping.

I am going down the rabbit hole. I have been engaging in really reckless activities because I just don't care anymore. I drink myself to sleep and hate myself in the morning because of the hangovers. I started self harming again. During daytime, all I do is play video games or literally just stay in bed, contemplating suicide. During the night, I usually don't get any sleep because of my anxiety. Other times, I just masturbate compulsively during the entire night. My physical health isn't too good either and I am having really bad days when I throw up everything I eat and I just feel like I've been hit by a meteor. I have scoliosis and my back hurts most of the time. My stomach also hurts to the point where I sometimes curl in a ball and just cry for hours. I've undergone many medical tests to see what's wrong with me but all my results came back fine. At this point I believe my physical illness is psychosomatic, and it's a result of my terrible mental health.

I have started self harming again. I don't sleep. I don't eat, and when I do, I throw up after every meal. I don't drink water. I can barely get out of bed. I lost my job due to covid-19 and I'm stuck at home with my mother who I hate ardently. Even when I used to work, I would gamble away all my money. I just can't stop making stupid, harmful decisions and it's tearing me up. I no longer have a drug dealer/drug connection since graduating from college and moving away and I was craving drugs like crazy. So a few days ago I stupidly decided to order drugs off the deep web and now I feel terrible about it since there's a chance that I might end up in prison because of it. I just can't stop doing stupid things and then feeling like a fucking retard.

I feel like there is no hope for me. I have no motivation to get better and all of my actions consist of me intentionally trying to fuck myself up. At this point, I lost hope and I don't even expect to ever be happy again, all I think about is death and a good part of my time is spent thinking of how I should painlessly kill myself. I don't know what to do. I have no goals, no motivation and no desires. I feel like continuing to live would just be a waste of time and resources.

Now to the story. My friend, A, works at a pub in town. A week ago, she slipped on some water on the floor and took a tumble. This incident is on camera. She ended up injuring her hand but at the time figured that the pain would go away on its own. Yes, her employers knew of the injury and saw the video of her falling and followed her suit of thinking nothing of it. Well now a week later A’s hand is still tender and from what she has described to me, numb in places.

I recently dropped [my vibrator](https://www.spencersonline.com/product/multi-speed-waterproof-vibrator-7-inch-galaxy-sexology/45685.uts?relationType=recentlyViewed) and it died permanently, and now I can’t find a suitable replacement.  
  
This vibe lasted for like 3+ years. I’ve had it for so long that it’s now been discontinued and I can’t rebuy it.  
  
The reason I liked it so much was:  
- It had a dial to just the intensity  
- The size and shape was perfect  
- It was *powerful as hell*  
  
I have tried 6 other types of vibes (everything from a [3in bullet vibe](https://www.spencersonline.com/product/naughty/vibrators/view-all-vibrators/rainbow-delight-10-function-bullet-vibrator-3-5-inch-sexology/pc/2352/c/2355/sc/2356/211617.uts?currentIndex=24) to a [magic wand](https://www.spencersonline.com/product/hitachi-magic-wand-massager-12-5-inch/135555.uts?Extid=sf_froogle)) and nothing has even come close. Most recently I tried [a copycat](https://www.adameve.com/adult-sex-toys/vibrators/classic-vibrators/sp-precious-metal-gems-vibrator-large-14971.aspx) of my vibe but it is **substantially weaker.** All the vibes I’ve gotten recently feel like they are made much more cheaply (I mean, a piece of paper to hold the batteries in place, seriously?)
  
Can anyone help me find something like my original vibe? I would appreciate it so much.

131,"This will probably be a long post, so I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it.

I have two friends, we'll call them friend A and friend B. Friend A, Friend B, and I used to be really good friends when we were younger all the way through high school. I used to go hang out with friend B a lot when I was younger and whenever I would mention it to friend A, they would get upset (this is like, elementary/middle school). I learned not to mention it much to friend A when I would hang out with friend B because I didn't want to upset them and hurt their feelings. I always dreaded telling friend A when I was going on a trip with friend B's family because I knew it would upset them, but I never wanted to seem like I was ignoring them for a week when I was gone (again, middle school primarily). Basically, I knew friend A would get jealous when I would hang out with friend B as friend B was closer with me then they were with friend A.

We all stayed friends together until senior year of high school. Friend B was dating a controlling boyfriend that neither I nor friend A liked. This boyfriend also used to be friends with friend A but once they started dating friend B, they weren't really as close as before. Friend A and I tried to get friend B to break up with their boyfriend as it was affecting our friendship and was not healthy for friend B (friend B would say they wanted to break up with their boyfriend, but then never do it). I can't remember exactly how it all went down (this all happened 7 years ago) but essentially us friends got in an argument about friend B not breaking up with their boyfriend and friend A and friend B stopped being friends. It was a pretty heated argument, and during that time friend A was going through family issues that they felt friend B was ignoring and were not paying attention to how they were feeling about their issues because they (friend B) were stuck in the controlling relationship and was pretty much consumed with that. Even though I was upset with friend B, I was pretty much over the argument in a few days. I am someone who can tolerate people's BS and do not like conflict, I'm a big ""peace and happiness"" person. However, it was clear that friend A and friend B weren't going to be friends anymore, and I felt like I was stuck in the middle of choosing sides. After the argument, neither friend talked to me, I guess cause they felt like I was either mad at them or choosing the other's side. Friend A was pretty cold to me and it took a whole month for friend A to talk to me again, and that was really thanks to another friend who got us together one day. I ended up having a class with friend B later on in the year and everything between us was pretty much fine. You could tell the friendship had been pretty broken, but we still talked and were friendly and even took a picture on graduation day.

Basically, after graduation I stayed close friends with friend A, but friend B and I drifted apart. I knew friend A did not like friend B (they honestly always butted heads of some sort, even when we were little, their personalities would clash) so I didn't stay friends with friend B as not to upset friend A. Fast forward to 7 years later and I'm thinking about reaching out to friend B to just say hi and see how they're doing. However, I don't want to upset friend A if I do reach out to friend B. Friend A has apologized to me about feeling like they made me choose between the both of them during the argument and they told me if I wanted to be friends with friend B that I could (they apologized 4+ years later, even though I appreciated the apology, the damage was pretty much done at that point) , but I feel like if I were to become friends with friend B again that it would upset friend A deep down and backfire on me. We are all adults now and I feel like I'm thinking too much about this, but I don't want to upset anyone. If anyone has any advice they would like to give, I am open to anything. Thank you for taking the time to read this post.",14May2020,1

I've noticed a very recent change in my next-door neighbors' dog's demeanor and behavior. I've only really ever owned cats so I don't know if this is something to be concerned about. 

He's an Old English Sheepdog (I think) and my neighbors got him as a puppy. I think he's maybe about 2 years old now. He was always super friendly and energetic and always came over for pets and scritches when I went out in the backyard. Never had any problems or issues with him. I think he's a great pup. And he seems to have been trained well and is always well groomed and appears taken care of. 

Recently, in the last few weeks, he won't come over to me for pets or attention anymore and he looks a little scared when I try to approach. I know dogs can be trained at various levels depending on their breed and intelligence and I'm wondering if the neighbors are trying to train him to not approach other people during social distancing? Is this a possibility? Or I'm wondering if I should be concerned he isn't being treated well by the owners? I'm not really close with the neighbors who own him, usually just say cordial ""hellos"" so I would feel somewhat awkward directly asking them. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!",14May2020,1

139,"I am so angry with my family

My family does not have an ideal dynamic, to say the least.  My dad suddenly turned on my mom when I was a baby, and had acted like she is a stupid, toxic (not even figuratively toxic, like, he won’t touch things that she touches and gets weird if she touches his food, like he thinks she’s poisonous or has cooties), good-for-nothing woman despite taking care of my sibling and I, and doing everything for us while he’s always at work.  My sibling is a narcissistic brat, who gets whatever they want because my dad never allowed my mom to discipline them, or make them do anything for themselves, and now he’s allowing them to keep a job that they can’t even support themselves on because it’s their “dream job” and my dad is making up the difference by paying for literally everything for them, despite being too old for that shit.  I have always come in second place, and I never get as much as my sibling because I don’t throw hissy fits when I don’t get what I want like they do.

I really need help launching my life after years of illness, but my dad is acting like it’s not possible and that it’s too much money.  So I can’t help but feel that if my sibling would just grow up finally and pay for some things (I’m not even saying everything, but SOMETHING) like their very frequent and expensive vacations, that my father helping me get out of a bad situation would not be as undoable.  I feel like I’m getting short handed and I am both hurt and angry.  I have always been the responsible one, and the one that tried to save money by reusing my siblings clothes, getting things on sale, and not buying things that I don’t need.  While my sibling does whatever they want, buys whatever they want whenever no matter how expensive, and refuses to get anything on sale because they somehow feel something must be wrong with it if it’s on sale.

I feel horribly disrespected and I don’t know how to cope with it.  I’m ok some days, and then other days I just feel like crying and punching something because I’m so upset.  I feel like pulling the, “you give THEM everything, why I can’t I have stuff!!???”, thing wouldn’t help, and I feel like it makes me look like a brat, but he’s not being fair.  He shouldn’t be paying for their vacations at the very least.  That’s a “fun” expense, at least make them pay for that.

So I guess what I’m asking for is advice on how to cope with this.  It’s really bothering me, and I’m getting really depressed because I feel like my father is making me go from disabled-by-illness to completely-self-sufficient (just because I, personally, don’t want to live with my parents anymore, he’s not kicking me out or anything) while he’s just shoving money up my siblings butt and he’s ok with that",14May2020,1
140,"I'm 19 (as the title says) and I feel like my life is spiraling downward. I've always felt powerless yet I always blame other things and/or people for my problems, but I'm too stubborn to fix my problems. I'm a pathological liar and my parents don't trust me (understandably so). My first semester of college was awful. I barely passed my classes and dropped out of one to avoid a failing grade. My parents didn't know until about a month into summer and now my second semester is even worse than my first due to classes moving online. I have ADD and with the combination of my bad habits, I'm really pushing my limits as to how little I can do and get away with it. Sadly I've been doing this my entire life and I tell myself that I want to change, but I don't know if I will.

I've hated school since the first day. I literally cried every day up until the fourth grade and bitched about it every morning until I graduated. My parents made me go to college straight out of high school without letting me take a breather, and I'm not sure if they should have done that or if it's just me being a little shit. Either way I don't have the self discipline to brush my teeth some mornings and I feel like a god damn toddler, but it feels like I don't give a shit to fix it no matter how much I suffer from it!

I don't clean up after myself, I just sit around and jerk off or play video games all fucking day and I'm wasting away at my fast food job that I just LOVE so much. I never keep my room clean until my mom basically explodes. And now that I'm facing this situation, inall honesty I'm just a scrawny, lazy, little shit.

My semester ends tomorrow and it will be a fucking miracle if I pass any of my classes, yet my parents think I've got Cs and above. Should I see a psychologist or something? Please help me stop this self destructive, childish behavior that has become my lifestyle.

TL;DR: I'm an idiot 19 year old guy who keeps fucking up his life through childish and self destructive behavior. I've been this way for so long that it is essentially a lifestyle. There are outside factors to it, but nothing that I can't work through, and I'm worried about my future. How do I change my lifestyle into something healthier?",14May2020,1
142,"Hello Reddit , first of all I’ll preface this by saying that having a job in general is a blessing in this economic climate (USA) but I have been working in the refineries since September 2019, and it’s come pretty easy to me .I quickly became one of the better workers in my group at “company A” But since my first day , my supervisor, has been nothing short of terrible to me. To make a long story short , I got hired the same day as her friends son , who is only 18 and his first job was in this line of work. A guy who I actually think pretty high of and tell him often that if he sticks with this , he will be everyone’s boss before he knows it.  But, being “green” he doesn’t know how to use hand tools or basic safety concepts and so on and so forth . Never once have I held that against him, and often times I pick up his slack and another coworker who is just generally lazy. But no matter what I do, this supervisor will find something wrong with what I’m doing , and throw fits and yell and treat me like shite. I’ve tried being quiet , tried being friendly and making small talk as well as somewhat submissive to her rants . But after 5 months of no solution I got an opportunity to work with a friend in the same field for a bigger company, let’s say “company B”. Then came the pandemic , and they weren’t having trainees work as they were “non-essential”  so I had to delay the hiring process to still have an income. Enduring her and the rest of the management at “company A” that makes life more difficult in an already difficult field of work. Now Fast forward to today’s date , dealing with the same stuff on repeat , I got fed up and called “company B’s”hiring manager that interviewed me. he confirmed I’m still top of the hiring class , and wants to get the ball rolling, as well as informing me that my position is now deemed “essential” so I won’t be waiting much longer to start work which is why I delayed the whole process in the first place. Now I don’t like to quit , or give up on commitments like jobs and such. As generally most people don’t. But If I go with the two weeks process leaving company A, I won’t have any time to get the things done I need to do for the new job, as well as getting heavily scrutinized by management as that is the theme of how they handle employees leaving ( watched quite a few leave in my first months and didn’t understand why at the time LOL) and ultimately be unhappy for two more weeks ,or just turn in my stuff tomorrow and leave on my own terms . I have enough savings to pay bills for a few months so I’m not too worried about that at the moment ( but we all know how fast that can change ) SO basically Reddit I need help deciding , any and all advice or points of view would be appreciated",14May2020,1
143,"He started a year or so ago with weed, and has moved to harder drugs like lsd, crystal meth, mushrooms, and wants to do cocaine if he gets the opportunity. He has struggled with things like depression and attempted suicide in the past, and has overall had a difficult life.

He knows that I want him to quit drugs with the help of a professional, and really try to make a therapist work. His parents know about his behavior, and confiscate his drugs, take his phone and social media away  (it's how he contacts his drug dealer), and have tried to make him see a therapist (which hasn't worked since he doesn't try to make it work).

Things changed for me when he emailed me yesterday stating that he doesn't think we should be friends anymore since he's not going to change, and thinks I'll be disappointed in him if he doesn't. 
This felt like a slap in the face. I have told him and truly feel that what is important is his health and happiness. 

The line is definitely drawn at doing hard drugs, which are illegal and could seriously hurt him, or get him sent to jail, especially since he's so young, and I know he hasn't taken any sort of precautions when it comes down to it.

Since he wants to end our friendship anyway it doesn't matter whether I alienate him, so should I tell his parents? Go to the police? Do something else entirely? 

Any advice would be appreciated. I really only want the best for him.",14May2020,1
144,"So for context, me and the snake are as good friends as it gets, I’ve spent more time with him than I have my own family, I know him better than I know anyone else (or so I thought) and I know him better than anyone knows him. There is no one in his life as supportive of everything he does quite like me and I can say that confidenly. I have never in my life done anything wrong to the snake not even ever really had an attitude with them, and I have definitely been worse to some of my other friends.

During the recent lock down our days consist of doing our work for education and whoever finishes first invites the other and we play games.

Recently I’ve reconnected with a girl who I had sort of a thing with a few years back which didn’t work out as we were too immature but we’ve grown and I caught feelings hard for this girl pretty quickly, and as close friends do, I told them straight away, snake and my other friends, in no uncertain terms just how much I liked her.

But as of recently the odd few times, I’ll think “Hm it’s later than usual is snake on yet” and guess what Ill check and he’s partied up with the girl. So this girl doesn’t know I like her, she doesn’t really catch feelings quick so I don’t think she likes him, so I’m like whatever they were friends when me and her had a thing, makes sense they’re friends now, so I’m like cool and I ask for an invite, snake ignores that message for hours which piqued my suspicion. 

After this I employed my real best friend to go and ask the snake as I knew if I did he’d lie as he does that frequently, so my best friend goes and says to the snake he’d noticed he was in a party with girl on their own, anything going on? 

Snake says there is and that I’ve lost and he’s “already won” 

Not that I believe him at all but he thinks he’s snaked me even if he hasn’t and he’s trying to if it’s working or not. 

There is no chance on earth I’m ever letting something like that go, what do I do in terms of trying to get the girl and if possible the most severe ‘revenge’ on snake",14May2020,1
145,"I'm 23 and have done absolutely nothing for six years. I got my associate's and working on my bachelor's in accounting, but I just couldn't care less about any of the classes I'm taking. All of them are giant snoozefests, and I'll probably kill myself eventually if I actually have to go into a field where I'm actually supposed to care about how well a company is spending its money or everything else an accountant is supposed to do. Absolutely soul sucking. The problem is that I'm alright at accounting and not good at anything else, really. I chose accounting because I don't like anything else and an accounting degree will make money. The only other subject that interests me is astronomy. However, astronomy is unfortunately not just looking at space through a telescope, but intense math, science,  and programming. Guess what I hate? You guessed it, math and programming. I've been stuck for six years and I think it's time I do something drastic.


I've made the decision to join the Air Force next year. I've done a lot of research and read many of the anecdotal stories and advice. Many of those, including from family, have told me to absolutely not join the military because it is absolute hell. The others have said it was the best decision and time of their life because of the exact reasons that I want to join. I need the structure that the military brings, I need to take myself out of my comfort zone, I need life experience, I need to figure out what I'm doing, and I want to be a part of something bigger. I'm going to take the time until next year to work and get into physical shape.


I lost 100lb over three years ago by only counting calories and reached 155lb. I gained weight back up to 190lb over that time. I was a recluse and didn't actually work out except for a short stint, and I am so far out of shape that they need to invent a new one. Yesterday, I decided to get serious and just started with 75 pushups (throughout the day), 20 squats (2 x 10), and I walked a half-mile. This isn't extraordinary and I'm definitely going to do more, but I woke up today and I felt like I was hit by a truck. I couldn't get down and do a pushup or a plank, and my thighs ached. I did go for a mile-long hike and was proud even though I felt like I was dying by the end (and during). Now, I'm resting and going to walk another mile in a couple of hours.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the advice I'm looking for is this: Will it get easier? Right now, I'd be in deep shit in BC because I couldn't do pushups two days in a row. I'm not afraid that I don't have the discipline or the willpower, but I'm afraid that my body just won't cooperate. What if I'm trying my hardest and giving it everything, but my body is just too overloaded and refuses to push anymore? I played sports, but I never did any actual training except for running and the drills I was instructed to do, so this is my first real attempt to get into shape. How long will I feel like dying before this gets easier?

I would also appreciate any advice or stories of your time in the military if you'd like to share. Thanks!",14May2020,1
146,"So me and my roommate are old friends, we currently have lived together for a few years and have grown apart a lot since we moved in (she's very aggressive, dramatic, and at times verbally abusive towards the people around her). I'm not innocent but she's not either.

Some back story: my roommate was on and off with this guy for 8 years, every time this guy has treated her like shit. He's used her, made he look like an idiot. He's cheated on her, cheated on girls with her, and been an all around POS. They broke up last December because he yet again was doing this shit. 

In January my best friend had told me that this guy has been replying to her instagram stories. She showed me the messages and she didn't respond, he was just being a creep. 

March comes around and my roommate says she's yet again talking to this guy, and I was just sick of it. I told her he hasn't changed and that he was being creepy to my best friend - my roommate turned around and blamed my best friend. Apparently my best friend had told my roommate that ""she was lucky to fuck him cause he's hot"" when my friend was drunk on my birthday.

148,"I’m currently a rising junior college student studying theater in North Carolina. 
( and not at any of the “good” colleges) 
Currently at a crossroads and I’m having a really hard time making a decision about my future don’t really have anyone else to talk to you about it so here I am on Reddit.

Here’s my problem - I’m currently getting a “BA in Drama. “ I want to pursue acting (ik ik but it’s the only thing I like sooo) And I to Believe that the degree I was going to receive would further my acting skills but it turns out that’s not the case there’s only like two levels of acting and I did the equivalent to them when I was at my previous university. The degree really is it’s just a random collection of beginner level drama related courses that won’t really ultimately make me a very skilled in any subject. Not only that but I don’t really like college as a whole I’ve never been good at school and I don’t have very many friends. Particularly in the theater department.I know it’s not much of an excuse but this whole current situation Drove me into pretty big mental health breakdown causing me to fail two courses.  I also have yet to declare a minor which is required for my degree. Basically I have a lot of credits left and I don’t feel motivated to finish them.Later this summer (if it’s safe) I will be attending an acting workshop in NYC . It’s worth six college credits.Since the two classes I failed with Gen Eds it won’t cover those credits but it will fill in the credits I need to be considered a junior. I know a few people there and I can work to probably have about 2000+ dollars before I go. It’s possible that I could find a way to move out there get a job and take acting classes outside of school.
 So here’s what I’ve kind of figured out my options are- 

1. Stay in school and live in my sorority hall. This is basically the equivalent to a freshman dorm room which is a downgrade from what I had last year. Not only that, but my roommate would be a girl who I don’t really get along with. We don’t hate each other we just don’t vibe very well. On the plus side I could get to know some of the other girls in my sorority. Note that Greek life at my school is far more diverse and accepting than other schools. 

2. Stay in school and live with some girls I don’t really know at an off-campus house. One of these girls is the same age/ major as me and could possibly lead me into having more friends with in the theater department. However it doesn’t appear she has many friends in the theater department and could end up of a repeat of last year where at me roommate was also Ba Drama majors but only really hung out with each other and weren’t able to break in to the crowd. I should add that we are both “BA drama” majors. Others at the school are “BFA acting” majors which is kind of this Unintentional cast system within the theater department. they get cast in more shows , take more classes together etc. one of my main problems with doing theatre at that school. 

3. Like I mentioned before try to make it in NYC.  I’m aware of how difficult it is. I could transfer from a job that I have here to another location in New York while taking acting classes outside of school. I could just get a job through somebody else. Again I know people there and could probably have up to 2000+ dollars before I arrive.My thought process is that I’m going to have to move to New York eventually why not do it when I have less student loans to pay back. 

If you read this far thanks and please be don’t be mean lol. I’m aware I may sound naive. I am looking into getting therapy and medication to make me a more productive person.💕",14May2020,1

One of the recent ones (from 2017 since she disconnected it then) was with her old boss &amp; the last text sent/received in the preview thing was “😘”. My mom uses emojis a lot and I think she uses that one to be friendly but she mainly just uses the smiley one I haven’t seen her use that one with her friends really at least that I can remember but I may have forgot. I didn’t go into the conversation because I didn’t want to snoop &amp; felt like I’d already seen too much. I feel like I might be overthinking or overreacting and she was just being friendly but given my parent’s relationship I’m a little skeptical. I don’t think my mom would be the type of person to cheat, but if someone goes without intimacy and someone caring for them for so long (20 something years) it’s debatable what they may turn to. I feel like she may have just wanted some affection in her life and that was her way of getting it if she did cheat. And I am absolutely not excusing cheating at all and there is no excuse for it. If she did I obviously do not accept that. But I just am not sure if I’m overreacting. I do not plan on asking her as I know that if she did she won’t tell me and if she didn’t she’ll get really offended and hurt that I’d even think of her doing that. I would talk to a friend about it in person but you know the situation with corona makes that impossible. Also I can’t go read the rest of the messages because I already reset the watch when she came to do it for me. I mean it was just one emoji am I overthinking it or do I have a reason to be worried?",14May2020,1
151,"My father has worsening dementia and a love of TV. However our cable TV has 999 channels and only about 200 authorized and scattered about. He becomes frustrated whenever he goes through the TV guide only to find out the program isn’t authorized. 

He’s incapable of using nextflix or any program that requires him to type or know what he’s looking for. So our cable TV is the only electronic entertainment he can operate himself.

155,"Hello Reddit people!
First of all, excuse my writing and formatting, since am not very familiar with Reddit nor is English my first language. :)

So I (F20) moved out of an abusive house hold when I was 18. The situation at home improved ever since, due to me threatening to take my siblings away or calling the police.
Now, my siblings (M16) and (M13) are still back at home. While they aren't getting hit, they do get verbally abused sometimes. 
To describe my parents, they are rather... Special? My father is a narcissist, who thinks he's above the law and my mom is a manipulative, selfish and attention seeking person. Am sure my mom loves us but due to her insecurities, her language is very manipulative. 
My father recently tried to hit my mom but my 16 year old brother held him back and since then, I have been working with the social resources, to get them out of my father's home. It's taking a lot of time and there is so much paperwork to do. 
Now while am absolutely overwhelmed with it, due to my own mental illnesses, I am horribly worried about my youngest brother. :(
The case is, that I don't have the capacity to take him into my tiny studio apartment and I have a hard time to be there for him emotionally. He told me how bad he feels and how scared he is of moving out and it absolutely breaks my heart... Am trying to get a hold of a therapist for him but due to Corona, they can't make any appointments at the moment.
I just want to know if there is anything I can do, whatever it may be, that I can do to support my family? Should I start looking for bigger apartments, so I can take in my youngest sibling? What would you do?
Also am sorry if it's low key ranting but am just so overwhelmed and don't know where to go or get help :(
Thank you for reading!!! c:",14May2020,1

Anyway, I’ve also been a very picky eater my whole life due to this sensory issue I have so dieting is super hard and working out is even harder due to 55+ hour work weeks. For the past year I had such a boost of confidence but ever since my boyfriend and I started dating about a month and a half ago I’ve lost that confidence and he’s constantly doing everything to make me feel good about myself. He says he likes how I am but I’m so self-conscious in public (probably because he’s 40 pounds lighter than I am, my little spaghetti noodle)

I didn't really have any side affects about my abuse other than me feeling dirty, and getting emotional when talking ab my story to others.

We work internal clients for a big corporation (communications and public relations), which is tricky because results can be manipulated, so it's all about perception. We usually do large management meetings to share and celebrate client results (other units of the business). She became my boss and I was not promoted yet and I have been trying to get the promotion for a while. Anne said to me she regretted the promotion because it was way more work to do. During meetings, she is clearly not doing well at her level. I was always better at providing results and our boss /VP is asking me to give her credit on something I did, so present together something like she was part which she was not even involved. I think that it's clear she is not pulling her weight and this guy is trying to protect his decision. It's totally unfair that I am fighting for a promotion, while I am told by superiors to allow someone else to steal my results. What I mean about stealing is to share the presentation with her during this management meeting, while she doesn't even know or ever talked to this client. The initiative was totally mine from strategy to execution. Is this even legal? any ideas on how to deal with this? I was going to apply for a new job but the job market is weird now.",14May2020,1
160,"I'm a 26-year-old DFAB agender person. I recently have moved out and away from my Dad, who had sexually abused me for years. Any time I tried to bring it up, in a way asking if it was normal people often said that 'it was my fault' and how 'if I didn't like it I should have left' but the thing was at the time I couldn't.

I suffer from DID and a whole bunch of mental health issues that made it nearly impossible for me to readily move out on my own. I have since moved in with my fiance. But thanks to my dad we've had to move TWICE.

Now I don't want to go into detail but he used to crawl into my bed at night and sleep naked next to me and I just thought it was normal, something happened that I cannot remember that caused my Mom to leave him and left me alone with him for years.

He recently added me on Facebook and I guess I accepted or something. But like... He's really creeping me out and keeps asking me about where I live and how he wants me to come home. Now I know I'm an adult and stuff, but I feel like if I blocked him, he might message my fiance or something because he's always hated him.

They have video tours, but I still just feel like there are things you as the renter need to see before hand.

171,"So I’m 15 years old and in 10th grade. I live in Ottawa, Ontario. I’ve been taking reach ahead courses, which means I take courses during the summer. (Ex. I took Careers and Civics the summer before 10th grade and I’m planning on taking University English this coming summer) 

I get decent grades. This semester my average is an 86%. I’m definitely not smart enough to stand out or anything, but I get by in my classes. I have diagnosed anxiety disorder and I usually plan things. I’ve been looking at universities and programs since I was in grade 8. 

I want to be a doctor, probably a neonatologist or paediatrician. My top pick for universities was UofT. I told my mom and she told me it wasn’t doable. I understand the costs of living in Toronto are pretty high, so I said maybe University of Waterloo or Queens. She shot down both. She wants me to go to University of Ottawa, which is a good university and all, but not the one I want to go to. 

For context, I go to a fairly wealthy high school(I’m not in the district but I transferred from my original one because of bullying). I’m not saying that we’re poor because we’re not, and I’m not ungrateful. We’re middle class, I don’t know our annual income because my parents won’t tell me(they say it’s none of my business, which is fair) But unlike many of my friends, my parents never set me up a college fund. 

They’re under the impression that wherever I go, they have to follow. (So if I went to UofT, they’d have to move there as well so I could live with them) and whenever I tell them they don’t have to, they get very offended and say that I’m trying to get rid of them or something. 

Whenever I try to tell them I don’t want to go to UofO, they get angry and tell me that’s my only option. My mom especially try to scare me away from other universities by saying things like, “you’ll never live a good life if you take out student loans because you’ll be in debt” and “you shouldn’t work a job during university, you’ll burn out.” She has also told me that if I went to UofT, I’d get injured/hurt. (I’m adopted from China) She said earlier at dinner “If you go to UofT, you might be faced with hate crimes and racism, and showed me an article of an old man who was beat up for being Chinese(a corona virus thing).” I feel like she’s playing on my anxieties. 

How can I convince my mom to let me explore other opportunities? Or am I being ungrateful and should just go to UofO?",14May2020,1
172,"So about 2 months ago I have moved from Ohio all the way to Washington. I became roommates with my bes friend and his sister and her friend.

174,"Ever since I was 13 years old, I have been cutting. At first, I did it as a “fad” or whatever because people seemed to get a lot of attention doing it. Through time as I got older, I began doing it in moments of great distress or sadness. When I was 18, my high school girlfriend that I had been dating for almost a year moved back to her hometown, which is three or four states away. We maintained contact, but slowly started to drift apart which ended with her cheating on me in October of 2017. In December that same year, I tried to kill myself over it by overdosing on some antidepressants and blood pressure medicine I had mixed with alcohol. I cut a lot after I got back home from that, and still struggle with it today. In 2018, I moved in with my grandmother from living with my mother because my grandmother has central air and heat with Internet in an actual house. My mother lives in a trailer in the country with nothing but window units and it became unbearably hot. My grandmother is emotionally abusive towards me, and my mother says she was the same way towards her. We have tried talking to her about it many times, but she is extremely narcissistic and does not ever see that the issue is her. I also feel as though I have abandoned my mother. My mother and I are beyond close and I often cry thinking about life without her. Today, I am 21 with no job, not in school, and I do not have any skills. Due to my severe depression, anxiety and autism, I am unable to hold a job. Because I am autistic, I was constantly bullied in middle school to the point where I had two concussions and a broken nose. I tried a semester of online college and despite doing well, I dropped out because of the demanding workload. I feel as though I have been embodied by depression and I will never get out of it, almost as if I’ve accepted that this will be the way I am forever. The last few weeks, I cut my arm to pieces a few times and was bleeding profusely. I have something in me that keeps telling me to inflict self harm, like I’m addicted to it, something that drives me. I don’t know if it’s because of everything I feel inside or because I feel like I have no purpose and will never be anything.

181,"My 3.5 has always gone right to sleep and slept through the night starting at a very young age. She currently shares a room with her 2 older sisters (7 and 9) because we live in a very small apartment. They have a triple bunk bed. 



Recently she has stayed up late a few times playing talking calling mommy and daddy. We got a pretty bright night light for her but that didn't help. They are allowed to have the TV on in their room on the weekends. The light and TV are on a timer and shut off after a set amount of time, usually about 1 hour. One night she would not stop calling us. We checked on her about 10 times before we decided to just ignore her. She started screaming crying hitting herself you name it. We spoke to her about it but did not stop. We told her that we're sorry she is sad and mad but she can't keep everyone else awake they need to sleep and everyone loves her and it makes us sad when she hurts herself. We let the 2 older girls come sleep in our bed so they could get some sleep. She screamed and cried until midnight until finally we told her that her sisters could come back in the room if she could lay down and be quiet for 5 minutes. 

(Just for background) She NEVER acts like this. This behavior is very unusual for her and she is extremely well behaved 99% of the time. She listens well goes to bed stays asleep is a great listener is very sweet and polite and cares a lot about others. Anyone who knows her would be SHOCKED to see her behaving like this. 

As a consequence of acting that way she now goes to bed 45 minutes to 1 hr before her sisters so that (hopefully) she falls asleep before they go to bed. She is not allowed  technology during the day. There is no TV or light on when she goes to bed (its still light outside). She does fine. Lays right down is quiet *pretends* to fall asleep. Until her sisters go to bed.. Her father asked the 2 older girls to call him if she is talking or playing or anything. Now they watch her like a hawk and tell on her for everything even something as simple as putting her hand up in the air. 

Since that night when she was screaming she has not done anything to keep anyone up. She might make a small noise or play with her hands (not that she should be doing that at bed time) but certainly not anything that would prevent her sisters from sleeping. She might occasionally call her father or myself to tell us she needs to use the bathroom, or that shes hot or wants to take her socks off or something random. And if she does do those things its not every night.

I told my partner he's not solving the problem. That he's placing a responsibility on the older 2 that isn't their job. It's not their responsibility to make sure she goes to sleep or isn't playing- its ours. He wants to move her mattress into another room permanently for something as simple as having her hand in the air. I said the older 2 wouldn't even know she was doing that if they were going to sleep. So now all of them are just staying up late...

I told him I think that we should set up a camera in the room or just check every 10 minutes or so to take the responsibility off the older 2. And I think we should try some other routes before moving her mattress. (If she was keeping her sisters up I would not be opposed to it) I just think its a little dramatic to jump to that when she isn't being loud or disturbing anyone. They only know she's doing it because they're watching her. I think right now everyone should just ignore this behavior because I think the attention she's getting from it is making her do it more. 

My partner thinks I'm playing favorites and that I'm just trying to flip it on the older 2 instead of being mad at the 3 year old. 

I just want to cut her some slack because we are going through a pandemic a lot is changing and she doesnt know how to process all of it. She's always been in the same room as her sisters and I think another big change would just make matters worse. She is very smart and understands a lot of what is happening but she's only 3 years old and doesn't have the coping skills that we would have. As a grown adult I am feeling quite stressed with all of this and I have a lot of tools and a better understanding. 

I'm usually very strict and I by no means just want to let her off Scott free- there will still be consequences but I just don't think moving her bed when she isn't keeping anyone up is the solution. 

My partner is annoyed with me because he thinks I am babying her too much. I'm frustrated because I think he's being too harsh. I just want to get on the same page without an argument.

They act as if I'm a child who hasn't seen this stuff before. It's like their ultimate goal is to keep me as innocent as possible. How do I get them to stop? I have a boyfriend who they know well. I don't act immature. I think I'm old enough to see kissing, it's just so annoying and it's driving me insane. Do they think other parents do this?",14May2020,1
183,"I'm 14 and I believe I have this. I would be happy and joyful at school and I would feel miserable and sad at night, so much that I cry myself to sleep.

I sometimes love my dad, but any little thing he does make me angry, resenting him. My mom and sisters do their normal things, but I hate them for no reason, and can't make myself appreciate them. My mom recently told my sister she wished she had given me away when I was born.

Even though the people I know would support me, I still feel abandoned. I think they are just faking it and deep down hate me, even when there's rarely any proof. 

I have unstable morals. One day I believe in hope, the next I say that hope is merely just an imagination of the weak. I don't know who I am, what I want to be, what I want to do, I just don't have purpose. 

I get impulsive over small things. Me struggling with online school work? I throw tantrums and punch myself. Losing in a video game? I start screaming until my head and mouth hurts.

I have friends and family (who probably don't love me), yet I feel abandoned. They are not the type of people who would be there for me, but when they are, I accuse them of being fake. I can't help it, that's just how my brain works.

I told my mom and dad about this and said I think I have bpd. They just said ""mental illness isn't real, just stop feeling the way you are and fix yourself."" That's all I get.

I've been feeling like this since I was 11, with suicidal thoughts almost every single night. And no one would want to help me.

The point is, I would feel happy, joyful, then angry, sad, and abandoned in a span of an hour. These negative thoughts just stay in my head and they just won't go when I want them to.",14May2020,1

186,"As the title suggests, I got scammed yesterday via a phone call of what had the same caller ID as my bank and same number. It was the most elaborate scam I’ve ever seen. They were incredible and studied what and how my bank reps spoke. They began by asking for me by name and told me of fraud of a place I recently visited, so it was very believable.

I gave them my bank info and pin, security questions, social, DOB, address and I believe that was it. Only my debit was compromised.

I figured it out when my real bank called me, and as a response I filed a police report, froze my credit at the three major credit institutions, locked my credit card. Got a new debit account, bank id, password and security questions. Put a notice on my credit, and let the SSA know.

What else should I be doing? I’m scared shitless and have no idea what to expect, though it’s good I caught them and my bank caught it about 30 minutes into it. Am I in the clear? Is it likely they’ll move on? Any advice is welcome.",14May2020,1

192,"Hi guys. This is a follow-up post of this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gi2hpt/am\_i\_a\_dick\_to\_move\_out\_of\_the\_apartment\_during/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gi2hpt/am_i_a_dick_to_move_out_of_the_apartment_during/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

So I found a place that might be a good match for my living. I already checked out the place and met with some of the people living there. However, there are parts that I am a bit worried about.

&amp;#x200B;

First, monthly expenses. The new place will be around $150 more expensive to live in. My workplace announced recently that they will be reopening for take-outs, but did not guarantee I will be hired back there since they will be rehiring fewer people. And I don't know how many hours I will be working there either. Maybe less than 10 hours, which the earning will still be lesser than my current rent. I also need to pay a security deposit.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, cleanliness. Since one of the roommates in the house love to clean (still brought in guests during the order, I don't understand how her brain works tbh), my current apartment is pretty clean. However, the new place was not as clean as my current place. I am not that anal about cleanliness, but it was a level that I was a bit bothered. They also had a smell of Indian spice-ish. I may be able to get used to it by living there, but I don't want to be the only person cleaning around the house all the time. They did have a board to check down who has been cleaning, but it isn't like they have a chore cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

Third, the current roommates. So, after some mediation, I was told that the roommate who was bringing in guests will no longer bring any. I did not hear this directly from her, but from the person I asked to mediate the situation. It was also interesting since the mediator told me after confirming that I was looking for other places to live. However, the roommate herself has not told me directly that she will not bring any more guests into the apartment and has not given me an apology for her disrespectful behavior.

&amp;#x200B;

I am pretty much stuck here. I am fearing heavily about my financial situation, but also have no trust towards the other roommates whether they would follow the order. Adding to that, the current housing situation I am in is quite sketchy (lease wise). I am not on the lease, but that doesn't make it better.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I still move into the new place, with the financial burden and other burdens, or should I just swallow my pride and stay at my current place?",14May2020,1
193,"So my significant other told me that they are a diagnosed psychopath and used to torture and murder animals as a young child. They said they have since changed and “made” themselves learn how to act like a somewhat normal person. They’re pretty narcissistic about their appearance and they have a very hard time admitting when they do something wrong. It takes me blaming myself for them doing what they did for them to see that they did something wrong, and at that point, there’s zero chance of me not blaming myself and I have issues with self harm, and me blaming myself for these things often lead to me self harming. They also never cry, even when really bad things happen and are very controlling, which due to my messed up childhood I actually kind of like. Anyways, do you guys think I’m dating a psychopath? And if so, how should I deal with this, other than leaving them.",14May2020,1
194,"This isn’t a “Im 18 why am I not a billionaire yet?” or “why can’t I learn the guitar after 10 seconds of practice” post. I spent my entire life trying to find my niche, I tried sports, art, labour etc. and never once I managed to actually feel satisified with what I do. When I tried to get into drawing I spent months redrawing things other people made to understand art but I was still drawing like a 6 year old at the end. I asked what to do and people said “take it easy and start from the beginning”. So I spent weeks trying to draw straight lines on paper, I filled out multiple notebooks with nothing but lines, circles and squares. I gave that up after seeing one of my friends who has never once drawn more than a doodle his whole life effortlessly draw a random line much better than me on concrete. Similar stories exist where I; break my violin for the 4’th time, get kicked out of the swimming team, get kicked out of the debate club, get laughed in the face when I say I know how to code a little... 
“Dont compare yourself to others” you might say. Well than what do I do? I never recived an award better than a medal for a chess competition when I was 13(I suck at chess now btw). How am I meant to keep going when there are 0 results from my actions? 
Worse, I have 0 excuses to be this way. I am not that dumb, I am not poor or come from a discrimnated background, my hands shake but I can still write, I am the shortest male  among my “friends” but Im not a midget. Speaking of friends, I have none. I thought maybe if Im too much of a failure to be of any use to this planet maybe I could make people happy. No, no one laughs at my jokes, when I criticse people they take it the wrong way, there was only one person in my whole life that I truly helped. I pulled him out of deprssion, found him friends, thought him how to make use out of his talents and he left the moment I fell into one of my depression waves. My family are the only people who love me, and I hate that. They love me, but dont like me. We share nothing, I am of no use to them. I wıuld have nothing and no one if they were to leave me. Once when I was 8 or 9 I got angry with my parents, in respose my father stripped me to my underware and kicked me out of the house to show how much I had without them. I cant form relations people now unless it’s perfectly balanced in terms of power or there is some sort of gain for both sides. Dont blame my parents though, they rarely hit me and neverraped me, or came home drunk... I really cant blame anything on them.

I go and ask the internet: “why”. Here is the one of two things they say: “Oh everyone fails once in a while, here is the story of someone who made it.”. Well, I am not suffering any setbacks right now, because I never made anything or became anyone. 
Or they say” well you dont have to be succesful to be  hppy” well I certinly cant. I cant live iwthout knowing I have added nothing to this planet. I dont want fame, money or pwer oüI just want to do something I want to look ibadk and say I did this with my own two hands and şt looks great 
I just cant get rid of the sinking feeling that I am somhaw takşng up sapce, so much money and time was wasted by others to make me a succeesful person and in return J gice nothing. This is like to sunk cost fallicy, aı am not suicidal right now but I cant stop hating myself for not killing myseçf when I first treid sucide when I was around 13.

195,"Hey guys, I wanted to get your opinions on this situation.  I am currently a student in college with barely 1 year in. I am a 19 year old female and I acquainted myself well with a (old male proff. from India, maybe mid 50s ?) professor midway of the spring semester. So, I wanted to mention a few things here about the interactions I have had with this proff, let me know what you guys think and its a bit odd ?

So, I got on this professors good side because I joked around with him and then he started joking around with me. He always says that women have never joked around with him. I believe he was married or something, because he has two older kids that are girls (barely mentions), but at the moment I think he lives alone. So, this dude very lonely and works a lot to distract himself.

Anyways, there are a few things he has done/said along the way that have alarmed me a bit, but not everything listed was alarming. So, some fairly normal things will be listed in order for you guys to get a better understanding. Also, I guess I am not used to it either since I am fairly new in college so here we go:

1. Would call me out in class to answer things, mostly just me. Also this a Biology class. Would joke around and say my homework was bad in front of the class as he went along the checking other students hw, but then say it was super good or whatever. I did not mind this, I played along.
2. One time, I was waiting in class and when he came in, I asked if I could go to his office to check my test. My friend was was sitting next to me and she was attentive to the conversation too. I don't remember what he said, but he did put a hand on my shoulder. Which was not the most comfortable, felt kind of awkward.
3. Then would ask me to go to his office for coffee, and he would try to convince me to join his research laboratory. Eventually over time I agreed to work this summer, to get trained for the actual class in the fall. \*Note: I did see him call out one of his students and say something like ""hey you come to my office I miss you!"", and would say how he knew some of he graduates students families (grandma, parents, etc.). So, a fairly friendly person and liked for me to go to his office because he could relax.
4. In the office, he would give me coffee and always would give me water, coke, food, or whatever he had. He gave coffee to all his students that came in and would ask students to come to his office, etc. Still pretty normal. The semester ended and I saw this professor like perhaps once or twice during the second semester.
5. Second semester ended and I came to his office cause there was some matters he wanted to discuss with me. Like the name of the class I needed to sign up for, etc. Also, he did try to give me front hug, but I gave him a side hug because I am not comfortable giving male professors front hugs (The hug was a bit odd though, I don't really like hugs). The other form of physical contact he did was pat my head, but I had a cap on. So, at this time he says ""oh I noticed you were in the top five of my class and I was thinking oh what can I get you, since you did so good (or whatever). I was thinking maybe we could go get ice cream /food because this is usually my lunch time."" He had basically already been planning to take me out to whatever because I was top 5. No big deal to me though, but I told him my parents were waiting so I could not. Then he looked a bit sad, but said it was okay he understood.
6. Then covid-19 hits and all that mumbo jumbo. Few weeks ago, I texted him (all his lab students have his #) what would happen with the research class. So, he called and the calls always last about a hour or two. \*\*\*\*\*Oh, I forgot to say the meetings in his room began to get longer, it started from 30 min, 1 hour, 1: 30 min, then 2 hours, last time it was 4 hours (I'll explain below the last 4 hours). Of course it was a mix of casual talk and some college discussion talks. I would mention some family troubles and in order for him to get a better understanding so that he could help with my college career.\*\*\*\*\*
7. In connection to #6 he mentioned in the call that he missed me. I was like ok me too sir, but I always say sir to kind of remind him like hey your my mentor not friend. Anyways, he tells me about the research thing and that if I could drop by this week. I agreed and scheduled on Monday at 9 am.  He did mention about coming to visit me where I live so we can hangout, I took that lightly, thinking like someone told me that he was probably joking.
8. I arrive and the college it is basically empty, there is still social distancing, because of covid-19. I arrive and he initiates a front hug again. This time,he squeezed me a bit, but I felt the chest-to-chest hug which was highly uncomfortable. Then like he tried to lift me, but I kind of stepped back so he kinda stopped (remember I am a female with BOOBS). Now that set me off the whole time, so I felt very uncomfortable for the rest of the time. So, I tried to get it off my mind. He told me he thought that I came with my parents, so he said that ""oh I was gonna tell you to tell you parents that they can go, we can have lunch and then I can drive you back home (about a hour)"". I said no sorry I came with my sister and I am expected to return back with her, but thank you. He gave me a food and drinks, said to take some to my sister which I did. So, again a mix of casual talk and college stuff when I came back. This meeting lasted form 9am- around 1:45 pm.
9. As to not make #8 too long, I will continue here. So, he was doing some lab work and I was there in the laboratory with him talking. One of his students comes, we greet her, then later on she leaves. Whilst the conversation, there was a time he suddenly stood up and started counting the steps to make sure we where 6 feet apart. I though he was gonna stop, but he walked all the way to where I was. Which I found a bit odd because he could have stopped at step 6. Another thing he did, was give me germ X, but as I held out my hands he lightly touched both my hands which was unnecessary and I did see him hesitate before he touched my hands. Again, I did not like that and I think he hesitated a bit because I did pull back a bit instinctively, but he proceeded anyways. I thought that was weird because he was inconsistent with his social distancing, like sometimes he was real strict and careful, but then he would give me hug or something.
10. In reference to what he mentioned on the call and meeting is he said if he could go visit me. Where I live its a touristic place, so a lot of people come here to relax. He said he wanted to relax or whatever. Me not knowing how to say no, just kind of played along. He said oh we can go walk, hangout, etc. For me this is a little to much, I am not comfortable with a professor knowing too much about me yet  and where I live. I would understand if I had been working with him maybe a couple years already, but at the moment it was uncomfortable for me. Moving on...
11. Since I did mention my main priority was making money, he offered to pay for the gas in my car and all. Again, I said I appreciated and thank you (but I don't want him paying stuff for me). He did also offer me a job to work in his lab if I want, but it would only be him and me in the lab because no one else is suppose to be there due to social distancing. I mentioned this to a few ppl and they all said that was a bit weird.
12. During that time, he asked my hobbies so I showed him and he was amazed by it so he gave me another side hug that lasted a few seconds. I think he hugged me like 3 times during that meeting, 1 front hug and 2 side hugs. I noticed majority of his lab students are male, maybe like 4 or 5 females. Anyways, reminder the college is completely empty. Then towards the ending of the meeting, he said asked if I was hungry. I was not that hungry and he said its either yes or no. So, then he said you are aren't you, how about we go for some  drive through food. He then said, your sister can stay here and we go and I will bring you back. I though he was gonna invite my sister, so I said no on because (1) my sister can not be left alone (2) my parents are asking for me (3) I felt it was unfair to do that to my sister ( I didn't say this one out loud). So he said oh okay I understand, then mentioned when I would come back and if we could maybe go to lunch. So, I don't know it depends so, then as I left another one of his students came, we greeted then I left back home. So, about a total of 4 hours I spent there.

So, what do you guys think ? Perhaps, I am overreacting because I felt uncomfortable. I feel like personally it is moving way to fast in us getting acquainted for barely 2 semesters. He was my proff for one semester, but we got better acquainted towards midish-semester. At the moment, some of these encounters, mainly the last parts (especially the front hug) made me super uncomfortable. I am inexperienced, but I understand now that I am going to have to set boundaries for myself. Thank you for reading and your advice, I am relieved to get this off my chest.",14May2020,1

198,"I’m 19 almost 20
I’m insanely grateful for everything my mom does for me she does a tonnn a ton.
I’m very sensitive I’m aware but I feel like something is off these are just a few issues we’ve been having that have been bugging me I understand my moms not perfect if you have any advice or anything on how I could approach the situation or talk to her or something that’d be great or just general advice 



If I don’t have money and I depend on her it’s an issue 

If I have my own money and I do the things I like then she’s jealous I guess (I spent over 200 dollars on her the past two birthdays and I buy her things randomly )

Me being sad always seems to make her angry (she’ll stomp around and slam doors and ask me if I’m ok a million times just to hear me say yeah then she’ll leave me alone) like I’m sad give me a minute 

She ease drops if I’m on the phone with anyone 

She asks very personal questions and makes odd comments like regarding my sex life granted we’ve never talked about sex or boys or anything it’s always been don’t worry about it so I’m confused as to why it matters now 

She’s always comparing us it seems like you have nicer things better clothes better shoes and I’m grateful for everything I have and that she does for me but she’ll randomly come in to get something and get an attitude like I wish I had your closet and like direct that energy towards me like anger and then I feel bad and guilty and stuff 

I’m really sensitive feeling like someone’s mad at me or anything bugs me soooooo much and I just feel like it’s the environment I came up In there’s always arguing and yelling and doors slamming it’s hard to like deal with all the time my anxiety is through the roof all the time 

I’ve always dealt with being bullied my self esteem all that and everyone just says you have to toughen up don’t let words bother you don’t care about what people say etc etc and I understand but it’s like a complete disregard for how I feel like I’m telling you I’m sad I hate myself I don’t know what to do and all I hear is get over it move on 

When It first surfaced I was sexually active I tried to be as safe as possible I asked her to make me an appointment for birth control and I don’t believe she ever called because after that day it was never mentioned I don’t have or know where any of my insurance info is or anything and I figured most parents would be like hell yeah let’s take every precaution available ya know 

I was in my  relationship and my gut told me he was cheating something was wrong it being my first relationship and not having any friends I vented to my mom  and I was told with my attitude I’m gonna end up alone no matter what I do or say I’m always wrong I’m always over reacting  I’m always at fault and turns out he was cheating 🤷🏾‍♀️

I don’t really have a good relationship with my family and I don’t have any friends so I meet a lot of people online and everyone calls me stupid for it I’ve only met up with 3 guys I was friends with  from the internet and I ended dating two it’s like it’s not understood why the online world is so important like if I didn’t have online I wouldn’t have any one to talk to I wouldn’t be able to make friends I would  be alone like actually my family doesn’t talk or communicate unless it’s holidays for family dinner and it’s not even genuine or positive or  it’s yelling 

I ask to play games with my mom I ask to craft I try to just spend time with her and it’s like it’s always an inconvenience to ask and  when she wants to it’s always when I’m doing homework or on the phone it never fails i just don’t understand she also just wants to be around me when I’m on the phone to listen in she’ll come in and start asking me the most randomest things and ask if I’m on the phone like she didn’t already know “did you get your period “ “did you feed the dogs” “do you have trash bags ?” I literally never keep trash bags in my room did you do you classwork she’s literally never cared about my school work or something I didn’t know how to do until a boy was involved oh you’re going on a date maybe you should spend more time working on your Spanish than you do with these boys oh you’re dyslexia is causing problems again maybe you call your tutor instead of talking to these little boys (and then she’ll never show an ounce of interest in my school career again )


I’m sure these comments are about to be reckless but not everyone has a healthy family life and just be your family is perfect doesn’t mean everyone functions like that I’m not bashing my mom I’m looking for advice to navigate these circumstances by giving examples of what’s bothering me punctuation isn’t my strong suit so sue me",14May2020,1

201,"My roommate (19F) is depressed and I (21F) don’t know how to help her without crossing boundaries.

My roommate and I moved in together a year ago. She’s one of my best friends and I love living with her. However, she’s struggled with depression and agoraphobia for a long time, and it’s only gotten worse. She doesn’t leave the house, doesn’t clean the apartment, never cooks, never eats unless I make something or she’s on the verge of passing out, and she never follows through on things she says she’ll do / is known for flaking a lot. All she talks about is how she doesn’t take care of herself and how she’s sad, and all of her comments are phrased as self-deprecating jokes that make everyone around us uncomfortable. She also is definitely dependent on weed, like to a really unhealthy extent. 

I know all of this is harsh, but it’s all true. I also am recovering from depression, and moved in with her to get out of an emotionally abusive relationship that’s given me a lot of PTSD to sort through. Despite all of this, I’m in a pretty good place, but my roommate’s situation makes it hard sometimes. I know it shouldn’t be my problem, and it wouldn’t be if it wasn’t all I heard about every single day. 

I love her a ton, and I really want to help. I’m just afraid of addressing this because I’m afraid I’ll seem harsh and insensitive, and I also don’t want to say anything it isn’t my place to say. She’s such a smart girl and she knows in her head what she needs to do to get herself on track, but she just doesn’t have any motivation or discipline. She does see a therapist but I’ve learned she lies to her therapist about her situation (including her smoking habits), making it seem better than it is. 

Do I say something to her? How do I address any of this without being an absolute prick or hurting her feelings? We both struggle with talking about her emotions, so this has been a struggle. I appreciate any advice anyone has to offer. Thank you all so much.",14May2020,1

I have moderately bad anxiety and I blame all my problems on that, but obviously I need to help myself. Quarantine has me hidden from any type of authority and I don’t have to have physical interaction but even the tone of an email will set me off. My counselor sent me an email today saying that the meeting I requested wasn’t required and was for younger students, but I couldn’t help but feel that she was mad at me. I didn’t shed any tears, but my eyes started to burn and when I saw she even sent an email in the first place my heart sunk. Anxiety obviously. I’m used to that, I have social anxiety and get nervous when anyone texts me but that’s something I can get over on my own. What I have no idea on how to fix is my confidence because I don’t want to be like this forever. Sometimes I feel like crying when I’m mad too. I can’t help but feel embarrassed over it

It’s random, sometimes I don’t care about anything and I’m desensitized to stuff but other times it’s a struggle. I want to blame it on being a teenager and my wild hormones but I’ve always been like this and I see older people who never really got out of it either (not trying to bring anyone down). I see a lot of people say that working out really boosts your confidence and lowers your anxiety so I will definitely be trying that out, but if there’s any other sort of tips you have I’d greatly appreciate them

And again sorry if this seems pathetic because trust me I know, I’m just looking for some advice from anyone",14May2020,1

I need help finding a way to recover my mothers deleted messages. I come from an immigrant family who started from nothing and now live a comfortable life. My father has always been at the fore front of our households working low-paying jobs just so we could afford rent. Without him we wouldn't even have food on the table let alone a house. He had always helped my mother out with her education and still continues to provide for us endlessly. My mothers affair began when she started her job and it has been going on for years. At first we all found out and she denied everything, since then we have moved to our new home and moved on with life, we had always thought that she would never continue because of what happened when we confronted her. It was not til recently that I found out her affair continued. I keep trying to memorize the messages sent by her and am trying to get pictures of the conversations but she keeps deleting them. I'm 17 now and my relationship with my mother has deteriorated completely and it deeply hurts me to see this happen to my father again and again. I am seeking to find a way to access her deleted messages however, the traditional ways of going on iTunes and using the backed up data are out of the question as she is really strict on her phone security. I am looking for suggestions and possible alternative ways of recovering those deleted messages. I am at this point willing to go to any extent to prove her guilty.

205,"I [17] have finally caught feelings for someone and they [18] have caught feelings for me (referred to as *flower*)



The thing is, flower is leaving in June to help their parents settle into their new house and move and all that and then flower will be moving back down to where we are currently in August as college classes are starting.



However, my family has said that they don't want me to get hurt and I'm setting myself up to get hurt because ldr's are difficult and we'll be entering two different worlds -- flower college freshman and me hs senior year. My mom thinks that it's a bad idea and I'll end up getting hurt because flower might find someone better at college. 

A couple factors are here: 

1) we might be moving in August out of state so it really will be long distance until I graduate and come back to our current area for college as I had planned all along. (my mom thinks I'm planning and revolving my life around flower's which isn't the case at all -- I made my 5 year plan for our current location) 



2) none of my family have met flower and have only heard a few things about flower. Idk if this will play a factor but flower is ***very*** antisocial. Flower might switch the college classes to online college classes so flower doesn't have to deal with people as much. The only reason flower goes out is when I pull flower out of the house. 





3) my mom doesn't think it's a good idea to 'start something when we know it's going to end quickly' Im not sure how to feel about this because ldr's *can* work, it's just a matter of how we make it work. 




4) my mom thinks that I shouldn't trust him especially when flower's going to be with college kids but I've known flower for 2 years and flower has done nothing during this time to set off any red flags (which have been instilled into me to look for) and I have complete trust in flower. We've been the best of friends throughout this entire time. 





I'm at a crossroads here because my heart is telling me that I should go for it but my mind is telling me to listen to my family (my brother is telling me the same as my mom). I've always been one to make decisions based on logic and I'm not really a risk taker but I *really* want this to work out. I want to follow my heart this one time and take that risk but I don't want to upset my family by not talking their advice. 


Any suggestions on how I could go about this? Thank you in advance~",14May2020,1
207,"So a few minutes ago (around 20 when writing) my dad was yelling things such as ""Throw the dogs outside, NOW"" in a very aggrivated tone and getting what I thought and felt was too close to my younger sister (8 years old), saying what hes done in the past.

I ran into the living room and she was already in tears from the constant yelling, fear of him, and overall not liking or trusting adults from a few minor things (like her speech impediment that caused bullying)

I yelled ""Get away from her!"" as I ran in. He looked at me and my sister looked me in the eyes giving me *the look* that you never want to see from someone. She ran upstairs (the stairs was next to the doorway of the living room) to get our mom who normally backed him down from stuff like this, but as soon as she made it up around 8 he backed me into the corner and yelled ""Dont talk to me like that!"" I put my arms up thinking he would hit me, because he had balled up his fists and raised them. He grabebd my wrists and shoved me into the corner and started leaning in slowly, yet threatening. My sister who was watching because she didn't make it up the stairs all the way yelled ""get off her!"" and he dropped my wrists.

I know this sounds like it's fake and stuff but our family on my moms side is known for being rapped by older men like him and I'm pretty sure I know what would've happened if she didn't come but saying she saw that makes me wonder if I might have made her scared because she's been more talkative and jittery like when this stuff happens. My mom also broke down after telling him off since she had been kidnapped and raped, so I'm scared I also re opened some wounds from the past. Should I have let it escalate?

Side note: My dad has ptsd and a few anger issues that have been diagnosed but when this happened he just (I mean let than 10 minutes ago) took his medication for it.",14May2020,1

Although no federal or state law requires a two week notice, I am forced by the state agency (current employer) to provide a minimum two week notice to be in good standing to be elegible for benefits such as withdraw my resignation within one year (but I am still in probation, so this does not apply).

210,"I am a college student back home with my parents because of covid and I am struggling. I feel like I am definitely not handling this as well as my friends or my sister (also a college student) and I don't know how to be better right now.

I love my family and I am close with my parents, but they are also getting on my last nerve and I on theirs. My mom is chill for the most part but she makes my sister and I tense up because she has a slight temper when it comes to technology (specifically her laptop) or the news (which she reads a lot of). When she gets in a mood we all hear it (our house isn't that big) and it just makes us tense. My dad is passive aggressive, though when I point this out he says he's ""aggressive aggressive""; he gives me advice multiple times a day and I feel like if I don't respond my agreeing with him and immediately following his advice he gets passive aggressive (""don't come crying to me when \_\_\_ doesn't work out"" or ""I just don't want you in \[insert worse case scenario here\]"" or ""I'm sorry so sorry for bothering you"") and I want to pull my hair out. He doesn't give bad advice but I want to do my own research and make my own choices, but he doesn't always take that well and gets annoyed. I don't help the situation because I get defensive, we argue, and I lose my temper and storm off to my room to sulk. Depending on the day this cycle might repeat again. 

I feel bad for my sister who hides from this and embarrassed because I try to get my parents to understand I am an adult but I behave like a brat. However, I don't really know how to control it without it leading to an argument. I try to prevent these arguments from happening by staying in my room and agreeing with my dad, but my parents don't want me hold up in my room and I don't want to be constantly in my room, and when i agree with my dad he will follow up about it and if I don't do it he gets annoyed and the argument begins. Plus my mental health isn't great right now (I lowkey think I have some sort of situational depression and my anxiety is really bad especially since I have chronic kidney disease and am a high risk) and I just really miss being an independent adult. I can't move out because my college apartment lease is almost up and I don't have another place to live yet (graduating in December, trying to set up sublease but no motivation to since I doubt we will be back in the fall).

How do I keep my cool and not lose my temper when dealing with my parents? I really don't want to be this bratty child but I'm not sure how. Thank you!!",14May2020,1
211,"Long so TLDR at the bottom
   
    I M(16) live in a neighborhood with quite a few kids so I'm used to babysitting or playing nerf with them. So I can understand that some of them might think of me more as a friend than someone who is in charge. They also don't like it when I leave and they think it's funny when they ring the doorbell a lot. But they crossed the line recently when of my neighbor M(7) just walking into my house through the back door (into our wood shop with tools) and walked through the basement with my other neighbor M(4) then once they opened the basement door to the upstairs they saw me and they laughed and ran out. This is a problem not only because they shouldn't be able to come and go whenever they want but there are tools all over, like we have an axe right by the back door for splitting wood and knowing him he'd probably pick it up and play with it. That's not good obviously. 

He also hasn't been a good influence on the 4 year old because he is very easy to persuade, you can probably get him to do whatever for the right amount of chicken nuggies. But for whatever reason the 4 year (let's call him Sam) really likes the 7 year old (let's call him Tim) and follows him around and basically does whatever he says. Tim figured that out and makes him clean up after him or have him try out a dangerous stunt on his trike before he does it.
Also I might add that sam has anger issues and goes to therapy to help with it. So usually if he starts to get excited we would have him sit down for a while and cool off and try to keep him away from violence as best we can. 
But tim doesnt get this and gets him riled up all the time and one time got him to stand on the curb with him and try to get their nerf swords into bikers wheels as they rode by. 
Another time they were playing in the sprinklers and with water guns and tim sprayed the hose right into the window of his dad's new car and all over the dash and the seats. 

I told his dad about the doorbell but the walking inside is very recent so I'm still yet to say anything to him about it and I guess he gave him a talk and because he kept his distance for a while but he is still being annoying like when I try to close the garage door he'll sit there and put his foot under the door so it won't close or spam the doorbell or go on my back porch and knock on the door and leave. He just doesnt seem to get that he is being very over the top annoying.

I was a couple of drinks deep and started chatting up some girl, politics came up in the conversation ( i know you should never talk politics at a party) and things got heated quickly. I will admit i was extremely rude to her and even cursed her out. I walked away and 10 minutes later i find out she started telling people i held her up to the wall and started grabbing her private parts. I obviously told people i didn’t lay a finger on her but most people just believed her word over mine. 

The party was packed over 100 people and no one claimed to have seen anything happen.

I am a 21 year old fresh grad who got a job in audit. I've been in my job for almost 5 months now. I was initially excited when I started work, but I slowly disliked it. I got in during busy season, so I hardly got training. I worked way more than 10 hours everyday, just went straight to sleep when I get home, never get to meet friends, get yelled at by stressed clients and supervisors, and hardly make friends at work because everyone is so busy. I thought, well, many people hate their jobs, I'm acting like a baby, and went on, but everything changed when lockdown orders happened. 

I bunked down with my parents, and all my siblings are working from home as well. They work strictly 8-5 (only exceeding sometimes), then they get to destress and play games and such. Meanwhile, WFH only made it difficult for me to contact clients and colleagues. There was still pressure to be productive and fill in my timesheet with chargeable hours even though it's difficult to find tasks to do since clients can't also access their paper files. I know its hella selfish, but I snapped. I feel so demotivated with the pandemic going on already, and I started to feel like everything is pointless.

Great place, and I come back every summer even though I could probably make more somewhere else (I’m in college so I’m home for the summers).

But at the cash register as I was ringing up an order he was bagging and kept touching my waist, my knee, my shoulder, and once my thigh to get past me to a bag or something. It’s a cramped spot for two people, sure, but i regularly manage to avoid touching my coworkers in the same space out of respect.

I told him he was a little handsy and I was uncomfortable and he said it was my fault that I was in his way, treating it like a joke. Now I’m not sure what to do. He’s an actual child, which makes me even more uncomfortable. I work with him and you’re often alone with people because the store is so small you only need 2-5 people there at a time.

234,I was exploring these paths in Wisconsin with my sister. We went down the path everything seemed normal and it was actually really pretty! But then we found this opening in the woods and we found 3 ripped up men’s shirts a ripped up dress and a ripped us pair of underwear. Grocery bags (maybe like 3) full of cans of beer. Me and my sister were a little freaked out because these shirts look like they were forcefully ripped. Then we decided to leave but I wanted to look over a little hill near by before we left and what I found shocked me. I found a knife. At that point I was so freaked out. The knife was out in the open to.. then we ran. That was the fastest I have ever ran in my entire life. I called my mother and she said to ignore it and pretend I didn’t see anything. This happened over a month ago now and I can never stop thinking about it and I don’t know what to do. I’m not sure what you guys would be able to say but anything would help.

240,"She was a huge bitch to me for 23 years, classic narcissist, wicked evil stepmother shit. No one in the family likes her.

She did, however, help me a lot when I went through rehab, doing all the red tape with my insurance and everything. She's cooked me plenty of nice meals, but overall she's just made me miserable.

Dad kicked it last week (cancer is a bitch) and now me and the other kids (we're all adults and from marriages #1 and #2, there's no kids from #3) are wondering if or how we should go about cutting her off.

I mean, marriage is until death do us part. They've parted. She's not blood. We all hated her. 

Should we feel bad abandoning her?

Is there such a thing as a step-widow? 

There also the matter of his estate, which he left all to her. So if I want any hope of getting my share I'm forced to play nice with her until she dies, and even then, she might leave it all to this charity they like.

The other siblings are married and have kids, and are okay financially. I'm 32, single, and broke as fuck. I know it's awful but I loved my dad, I'm just trying to be practical.

Because the inheritance doesn't matter much to my siblings, they disapprove of me doing anything positive for my stepmother, and I don't want them to resent me.

I asked my parents, who I still live with, and they said that was disrespectful to them and if I did they would cut ties with me. I tried to have a mature conversation with them but they just won’t listen to my perspective. I come home whenever they want me to, 11pm is my curfew, I never go to parties, never have some drugs, have all As, i don’t understand why they can’t agree to this one request. Bad part is, I told my boyfriend I probably could sleep over the other day because at the time, they said they would think about it and they seemed on board. I should of known I guess. He’s been asking me to sleep over for 8 months now, I feel awful. His parents are completely fine with it even. Should I just say screw it and spend the night? I just want one night.

243,"Wondering if there is some helpful, supportive insight into my concerns. Both my GF and myself are recovered from extremely unhealthy lifestyles. For me, amphetamines, various narcotics, cigarettes, booze, ect. Her it was booze, cigarettes and food (she was obese). We both ate like shit. 

A few years later, we are done with booze and cigarettes. We eat clean 5/7 days. She is a fitness instructor and is down to about 180 lbs. She's Beautiful. But she's still overweight. I don't stress about her weight now so much (she could loose 20 lbs). I more worry about the future. Been together 5 years and while I've seen her slim down, this is the biggest I've seen her.

I have tried to ""be the change"" I wish to see. I started doing 16/8 IF, running about 25 miles a week. We went veggie together. I throw in some yoga. I am in good shape but I must spin my wheels to avoid crashing into unsustainable habits. 

She does yoga for her w/o and had recently joined me for short runs (which I'm SUPER stoked on. Although I prefer to run alone, it's worth it). 

The thing is, she does her part. However, the diet is deceitful because she eats organic, IFs, works out 45 minutes 5 days a week. But will eat a pizza or a organic pop tart or organic tortilla with maple syrup, for example. 

I'm just afraid it's unsustainable. I turn 37 this year, she's still not 30. I am happy where I'm at yet and yet know I need to be disciplined to continue quality of life and health. Her appearance doesn't effect my Love for her. It worries me for the future. And effects my attraction to her. 

I think she, understandably, doesn't have to energy and mindset to lose 20 pounds and keep it off. My concern is this won't be conducive as far as similar goals, similar physically abilities in our future and possible sexual issues, all as our relationship progresses.

244,"Hi everyone! I just finished my dream masters at the top program in the US for my field and at a great university, which was definitely not easy. I have always been confident about my professional abilities (never over confident, but I’m a true believer that if you work hard you will see the results), but this school year CRUSHED my self-esteem, no matter how hard I study I didn’t see the results reflected in my grades and I ended up the program feeling like I’m not good enough or intelligent enough. Even though I finished it and I should feel proud of the accomplishment that this means, I can’t help but feel sad/defeated. I’m afraid of taking the bar because I feel that it will not matter how hard I study, I will not see the results to my efforts (just like my masters), I’m also kinda scared of starting a project I was so exited about because I doubt my own ability to do it.

247,"So a little background about me. I’m a 22-years old female. My family( mom, dad and brother) and I moved to the US when I was 12 and we currently live in New York,we don’t have much family here other than my aunt(dad’s sister). 

I am currently in college for Pharmacy but for a while now I have been feeling like I want to take a break from school because I’m not sure this is what I really want to do in life and I don’t want to keep wasting money on school for nothing. I have taken a semester off from school before to help me figure this out before but it was not very well received by my family and just caused more bad than good which wasn’t helpful. In the past I have almost moved across the country to Washington state but that failed due to me being young and stupid and not doing proper research and ending up in a shit hole in the middle of nowhere. After I came back home, I went back to school like I was expected to and have been in school since then.  When I was across the country, I met someone and have been talking to them ever since and have visited them and got to know the state better and I actually love it there now. So I’ve been applying to jobs for a couple of weeks there and I might potentially get hired for a job there very soon but I’m not sure how to bring up this subject to my parents. They are kind of old school and I know they won’t take it well but here with them I always feel very pressured and stressed and I know I would be much happier moving there and being on my own and potentially starting a relationship with the person I’ve been talking to for a while now. I know with this whole Covid-19 thing happening it isn’t the best time for this but being stuck with my family during this quarantine had just made me want to move even more than before due to a lot of fights and issues that have happened in the family during quarantine.  I know that as parents they’re worried for me and don’t want to end up in a bad place but I do have a person there that I trust and I know would be there for me if anything was to happen. I also have money saved up and have been looking at places to live and done my research so I’m not just going into this blindly. So I’m just not sure how to tell them that I’m moving across the country possibly in a few days if I do get the job that I’m waiting on right now. 

TL:DR: how do I tell my kind of old school parents that I got a job across the country and will be moving in a few days?",14May2020,1
248,"hey, i have a bit of an odd situation. i'm a 19 year old girl and i've been dating my boyfriend (21) for 11 months now. we're long distance, met online and it's been amazing. i visited him in person and he's all i've ever dreamed of and more. literally my best friend!

i'm not sure why but tonight he was talking about how he wants to make a career out of photography (something he is VERY passionate about, literally would work as hard as possible to be successful with it). i've known that he wants this badly since the day i met him. he's the type of guy that would be very successful with the grind and effort he puts into any project he has. he was talking about how he can't wait to travel and have a job he loves. i couldn't help but feel overwhelmed with jealousy and annoyance. i don't have any particular passions and nothing that truly makes me happy. i'm in college for communications but i just kinda picked it because journalism is tolerable for me. he was telling me that i need to explore and find a passion that i can turn into a career so that i can really enjoy life. it's so frustrating seeing how easily photography came to him and how happy it makes him. he's always been a person with many passions and i've always felt so boring in comparison. 

he started talking about doing portraits of people in cafes or at the beach or wherever. i couldn't help but feel annoyed at the idea of him photographing girls or being close friends with them, or making friends via taking pictures of them. it makes me feel really jealous. i don't want him going out and having fun photography sessions with girls. i probably need some sort of therapy so i don't sabotage our relationship. i think i'm slowly dragging my boyfriend down. he told me i'm just not open to any ideas and i don't see things the way he does. i told him it makes me a little sad to see how happy photography makes him, and he was like ""alright i'll stop talking about it then."" that's now what i meant.. i don't know why i feel jealous and upset. i should want my own boyfriend to be happy and successful, so why am i feeling this way about it? i feel like such a terrible person. i love him and want him to be happy, but i can't stop feeling so insecure and annoyed.

251,"I originally was studying environmental science at university. However I had undiagnosised mental health issues (major dissociation and cptsd) and would take time off schooling work for a bit, then go back to school and withdraw from all my classes due to said mental health issues. In total I have completed two years worth of the degree, and withdrawn from 3 years worth of classes. The only work I’ve been able to find is min wage fast food. 

I went back last fall and got all these diagnoses. I decided to not go back for the next term (get therapy in place, lower stress ext). 

Now I'm wondering if after all this time it's worth it going back to school at all. There are no jobs in my area for people with just a high school diploma (over 2000 aplicatations for a job was normal here before covid). So I’d have to move to another providence to find work. 

I'm not sure I’ll ”know” therapy is helping enough to go back. I’ve been in therapy on and off for 10 years and it's not really done much. And having more accurate diagnosis's doesn't seem to give any direction. I’ve tried 5 different meds and stopped taking them (the first 4 did nothing and the last one made me suicidal now I'm just meh). I'm not sure what other supports I can put in place.

253,"My dad is turning 55 this year. When he was 9 years old he was run over by a drunk driver while crossing the street with his friends. He died twice on the way to the hospital in the ambulance. He was in the hospital for six months. He now drags his right leg. It is non-functional, he is partially paralyzed. He did not see a doctor for many years after this until he was involved in some altercation and was struck in the face with a gun. Several more years passed. He has not seen a doctor in 10 years. Ten years ago he felt chest pains and went to the emergency room. I know he was diagnosed with bradycardia and he takes aspirin to reduce the risk of heart attack.That's all I know about his health.

He's lived a rough life due to his personality. He grew up in an abusive environment physically and verbally which did not help his mental state or physical condition. He received no help or resources in school. He got in trouble a few times with the law doing stupid teenager stuff. He never attended college. He was a car mechanic for several decades but they recently fired him because new management took over and they did not accommodate his condition any longer. 

His biological father was never in his life so we don't know anything about medical history and predispositions beyond what I described. 

He does not have stable housing which is something I want to help him with as well. He has state medicaid. If anyone knows how to get housing for a disabled independent adult that would be helpful. 

The main thing I need help with is choosing the right doctor for my dad. I myself have several health conditions and I am a medical student so I am very familiar with the healthcare world. However, my dad, he's...difficult. I believe he has bipolar disorder as I have witnessed manic episodes. He is the type who thinks asking for help is admitting weakness but in the same breath he'll complain about being in pain and not wanting to live anymore. I would not describe him as tolerant of diversity, he grew up during ""that time"" and also I don't think his brain recovered entirely from the accident and later injuries, which is not an excuse for his behavior, but an explanation. He will not change either, I've tried for years. How do I explain this situation to a doctor? I think it's relevant information because his mood controls his behavior. If the doctor accidentally sets him off he will become argumentative and insulting and potentially (only when provoked) combative. I need someone with patience. He needs an incredible amount of work up so we can apply for disability and maybe ease his pain. Please help.",14May2020,1

255,"In a routine email exchange with a family member, they included a screenshot of something from their computer. In the screenshot, I can clearly see a bookmark (in the bookmarks toolbar) for a company that makes spyware GPS devices. They market GPS trackers for things like “keeping track of a vulnerable loved one” or of valuable possessions. But the marketing also specifically mentions spying on people, discovering infidelity, etc. Seems kind of shady.

My question is: should I ask them about this? What should I do? 

As I mentioned this spyware company was in the bookmarks toolbar, which suggests they are tracking someone and checking on it regularly. There could be an innocent explanation. Or, there could be something going on that I should check on. Maybe it's none of my business.

258,"Hello r/Advice, burner account here. This will be a little long, but I'd really appreciate help here, as I really don't know if it's wrong that I feel this way or not.

Context: So about a month ago my best friend and his girlfriend of 2 years broke up. Luckily it was mostly mutual, just a real bummer. Understandably, he felt pretty sad and lonely afterwards. I talked with him for an hour or two that day, and for many hours over the next few weeks. The talks were pretty one-sided, with me asking the questions (""How are you feeling today"", etc.) and him venting, and that's still perfectly understandable to me. About a week after the breakup he thanked me for helping him out and listening to him vent, and I really appreciated it. About a week after that, he asked out a girl and was rejected. Again, understandably, he came to me to vent. When another personal issue came up a few days ago, I was happy to help as well. My perceived problem here is that he hasn't really done similar to me, like asking ""So how are you doing?"" or saying ""Thanks for talking"". This was 110% understandable following the breakup and other personal issues, but I haven't heard either from him in a while.

I've also felt that our friendship prior to quarantine was a little one-sided, slightly favoring him, but so little that it didn't bother me much. I just feel that since March or so (even a little while before the events above) it's been a lot about him. Could that be because of prior difficulties in his relationship? Maybe. Loneliness from quarantine (which I feel too)? Possibly.

I'd like to clarify that I love helping my friends out, and being there for them. However, in this situation, I don't really feel that appreciated as of late. I don't hate him, or want to distance from him, I'd just love to hear ""So how are you doing?"" or ""Thanks for the help"". Is this just my mind grasping for straws to make me feel like I'm a victim?

Or, another angle, is that a wrong thing to expect from him after he went through a breakup from a serious relationship? Should I just continue with this, let him ride it out, and see what happens of it?

Also, he's a little socially awkward, so maybe he doesn't realize how I'm feeling?

And how should I bring this up to him? I don't want to sound egotistical or anything.

Again, I want to clarify that I'm not sure what the answer is. I'm not mad at him (he's my best damn friend) and don't feel that I've been used, part of me just wants appreciation.

Thanks for the help y'all.",14May2020,1
259,"Hey! I'm not really sure where to post this, I just would like some advice.


I have a fear of planes, but not of flying. I could fly in an airplane all day, but when one flies overhead I get massive anxiety. I feel almost certain its going to crash on top of me, and I usually stop whatever I'm doing, especially if the plane is a bit louder than normal. It gets hard to breathe, like a mini panic attack, especially if I'm alone.


I'm not really sure what caused this, and it seems to have started a few years ago for no apparent reason. Its very inconvenient as planes fly over my house anywhere from once to five times in a day. Helicopters are even worse, and once or twice I've thrown myself to the ground (I was alone). 


I would like to know what are some good coping mechanisms, and just generally how I could improve my situation. I've tried googling it, but all searches only bring up fears of flying on planes, not of planes overhead.

260,"This is a really long story so here we go.  Im 16 years old my parents divorced about 11 years ago they are great friends now and we get to all hang out together all the time.  I have a 8 year old brother with autism and a 10 year old sister.  I met my stepdad when I was about 5 he was originally a good guy.  As the years went on he became horrible he would go crazy and scream at the stupidest things.  He is a narcissistic sociopath.  He would scream at me for something as stupid as dropping water on the floor or he would freak out if you made too much noise he got worse as my brother and sister were born.  They were his fast forward a few more years he would spent more time at a bar restaurant.  It was so nice when he would be out and it was just my mom and my siblings.  Oh and my mom has an autoimmune disease so she can't work anymore.  My stepdad loves to pick fights over the smallest things like the dishes, our dog barking, the trash cans being crooked, too much noise, spilling food on the floor, losing the remote, etc.  He bought us a dog about 4 years ago but when we only had her for a few months until she started barking too much so he gave her away we all had a big fight because we loved her but this was what he liked to do he liked to control.  We all screamed at him about how much we hate him because of this and still get mad at him to this day about it.  My mom would have left him years ago if she would have been able to work.  Over the years he liked to scream at my mom and tell her that she is turning his kids against him and I would tell him that he is doing that himself.  We have moved about 5 times and he used to work really hard until we moved to our current house. This is by far the one house where the fights got the worst.  About 2 summers ago he started keeping us under even more control he would restrict my moms credit cards and other stuff.  We all have told him how much we hate him but in his eyes my mom is the bad guy.  We now have 2 wonderful dogs which we love but he uses them as control and leverage as well.  He will rarely let them inside and he freaks out if they walk on the carpet.  He disciplined me when I was little but he stopped at my sister.  And didn't even try to dicipline my brother.  I always tell him to make my sister do some chores but of course she's ""daddys little girl"".  I could write 10 pages and it still wouldn't tell the whole story.  The other day he got into a fight with my mom because he couldn't find his remote and he got in her face.  She said to get away because his breath smells like pickles and he breathes onto her face.  I screamed at him because of that.  He loves to say how goldy of a person he is.  We have tried therapy but he is a narcissistic sociopath, no matter what we try he is going to remain the same until the day he dies, his family is the same level of craziness.

262,"I am so sorry this is long

Back story: I am the oldest of 3 girls (34,32,&amp;27). Of the the 3 of us I had the most strained relationship with our mother, and when I moved out at 18 I didn't talk to her for 6 years. When I was pregnant with my son she contacted me and apologized for a lot of the stuff from my childhood, told me she had started seeing a doctor, and was on meds to help her mental state. Over the past 9 years we have rebuilt our relationship. Honestly, it is the type of mother-daughter relationship I always wanted, and I even worked for her company for 4 years after college.
In 2016 my husband got a job 3 states away, and we moved, though I still called my mom regularly, about 3 times a week. I was so incredibly happy to have a stable, healthy relationship with my mom. It even brought me closer to my sisters, who never were treated the same as I was, so they never understood why I cut her off in the first place.
The situation:
The thing I feel guilty about is that I have cut way back on my phone calls to my mom recently. Not because I am busy. God knows in lockdown I have time to chat. But because I don't think 'checking in with me' is a huge priority right now. 
When working for my mom I was able to get a real understanding of what kind of income she needs to make. This woman works her ass off to support her household and help out family. And because her business is in real estate that income is based on how much she works. No vacation. No sick time. Just billable hours.
About 6 months ago my grandma was diagnosed with throat cancer. At first it seemed to be a promising. Use a treatment to shrink the tumor, then have surgery. Easy peasy. 
Well not so much, Grandma had a 1% reaction to the treatment, and ended up with burns on 85% of her body. Her skin was literally falling off. it was stressfull and got to the point where I came in to town to see her because I thought it was the end. Fortunately, after a couple trips to the burn ward, she was able to heal enough to be discharged to my mom's house for Hospice.
My mom is still working (even going in strangers' houses for work wearing a full hazmat suit) while caring for her own mother. She is also trying to get extra reports out so she can pay for Grandma's in home medical care. 
I have called a number of times to check on her, and my grandma. But every time I call, my mom sounds stressed and busy. I feel like when I call her I am inconveniencing her. So I just stopped. I texted on Mother's Day and mailed a present, but I haven't called her in weeks, and she hasn't called me either.
Both my sisters live in town, and they can help run errands or take care of things. But I feel helpless. I am 8 hours away. I can't drive there because I can't risk infecting my grandma. But when I call I think I am taking time away from something my mom needs to take care of.
I don't want to ruin the relationship I have been able to rebuild with my mother, but I also don't want to take away what time she has with her mother. 
So do I call more, back off? Am I doing the right thing by letting them be?",14May2020,1

265,"I'll start this off by saying that I'm not 100% sure if this is the space for this, so please point me in the right direction if it's not. And if it matters at all, I live around Long Beach, CA.

So my situation is this. I was furloughed from my part-time, barely-above-minimum-wage job recently due to the COVID pandemic. This is kind of okay for me, it gives me more time to do homework and the government is giving me WAY MORE money than I was originally making so I'm actually going to be saving money 5 times as fast as when I was working. Problem is, I'm at the point where I think it would be financially irresponsible for me to get a temporary full time job over the summer (which was my original plan before all this happened).

My second issue is that my rental history is not great. I'm still on a lease in San Francisco with my old roommates who refused to change the lease when I had to leave in July of last year. We never, ever had an issue with paying rent or bills on time while I lived there. But since moving out, they have paid the rent late multiple times AND no one currently has put the gas and electric bill in their name since I took mine off, so PG&amp;E has been sending the bill to collections since August, marring everyone's credit. There is nothing I can really do at this point, none of them will listen to me and the management company in charge of the old house will not let me out of the month to month lease unless everyone in the house either moves out or signs a new year-long lease, which my old roommates will not do. (Never move in with strangers you met on Craigslist, kids.)

My final issue is that I have no credit history other than the collections. I wasn't dumb enough to get a credit card as a teenager and it just never came up again until now. This was dumb and all my bad. I do, however, have over $10k saved up in the bank and will have over $12k at the end of the month.

However, the two friends that I am planning on moving in with do have good credit. One of them is over 600 and the other one is over 700. One with no rental history and just moving out of his parent's place and one has good rental history.

My main question is how do we go about this when I've fucked up so badly? Are we going to have to have a cosigner, and does that always mean we'll have to pay higher rent? A higher security deposit is fine, I have the money, but am I even eligible to sign a lease? I know I'll be okay financially once we get a place, I'm very good with my money, but I don't know how to convince a potential landlord or management company of that.

Any and all help is appreciated, thank you so much if you've read this wall of text.",14May2020,1

2) he’s verbally abusive. He says so many messed up things when we argue and has threatened to hit/punch me numerous times.

While I was in school I met this girl who became the closest friend I have had in a long time. Her commute was 3 hours each way in the opposite direction. We laughed together to the point that I would cry laughing, and wouldn’t be able to stop for at least 10 minutes. I haven’t had a friendship like that in a really, really long time and I didn’t realize how much I missed it until I met her. (No- i don’t have feelings for her. She was just a really great, funny person and we meshed incredibly well)

I graduated 3 months ago and we kind of don’t talk much. We both went to school and immediately started our careers after, so we both don’t have much time to meet up. We made it a plan for a month after graduation, but with the pandemic, it didn’t happen.

When reading this keep in mind this is the same exact day as my previous post. My mom came into my room around 8:30 - 9:00 and proceeded to tell me how I can’t leave my room and how I’ll never be able to live on my own because she provides everything I had in my room, then I told her that I could and she takes my Wii ( really -_- ) she takes my firestick and then asks for my phone, I stay silent when she asks for it and end up hiding that and my switch. She starts yelling at me again, ( this has to be the 4th-5th time today ) during me standing there without saying a word because I know it will only worsen the situation she yells at me and asks for my phone again ( I didn’t give it to her because I vent through my friends and if I didn’t have it I would have to bottle everything up ) so I say nothing, while she’s yelling at me I tell her “listen I know I’m in the wrong wether it be school work sometimes, getting up late sometimes etc, but I think we are both in the wrong” I try and bring up her being verbally or emotionally abusive as I continue on by telling her “some of the things you have said to all of us, wether it be calling me retarded or making my sisters feel bad about themselves eventually takes a toll on us, and it already has for me” and that’s when she throws the coke in her hand at the wall and starts crying and screaming about how “maybe I should just leave it would be better off” or “I’m going to send you to a teen group home” trying to threaten me, I continue to tell her I didn’t want her to freak out because I wanted to talk about it calmly and make sure she understands and she constantly cancels out anything I’m saying with “nope doesn’t matter” and then she leaves my room. I go downstairs and my sisters yell at me and make me feel bad and then my mom comes down crying and makes me feel extremely bad, I don’t know if she is doing it on purpose or if I should really feel bad but some of the shit she said made me scream and cry inside while keeping a straight face on the outside, I really want to go up to her and tell her “why haven’t you just got rid of me” because she has made me feel like I am the wrong person in the entire house and that I’ve singlehandedly ruined everyone.

281,"
I’ll just lay it all out right here. First, I am grateful for everything good or bad that I have been given and experienced. I know that might seem weird as you keep reading but I think that they have really helped me become who I am today and also helped me realize my situation even better. Also, I’m very sorry if the story of my life is a bit confusing. I’m still trying to piece things together. And with that I’ll begin. 

Hello! My name is Madison and I’m 16 years old. When I was born my parents were already split and from what I’ve heard, it was a pretty nasty custody battle. In the end my mom was the one who got full custody of me and my dad saw me every other weekend. I think this is when things started going down hill. 

The earliest feeling I had about my dad wasn’t good. I never felt comfortable around him and for some reason he always scared me. He had this really authoritative voice that scared the life out of me. He wasn’t a good parent either. His version of me spending time with him was to go to his house and sit there in a room that me and my brothers shared. He never really talked to me or brought me anywhere. The only time he acted like a real dad was when he was in front of other people. Later, her got married to a woman from another country without sitting me down and talking to me about it. I just remember coming home and she was there. No talking to, nothing. So that was that. I also remember a time he gave me a whooping because I spilled Kool-aid on the carpet (I was around 5 or 6). Me and dads relationship never got any better. He ended up moving and I finally found a friend that would come over to my house or vise versa almost every weekend. She was the only person that was worth seeing at my dad’s house besides my brothers (on my dads side) but they were older and in college already. Me and my dad didn’t talk to one another. Most of the time I would avoid even walking past him because he made me so uneasy. When I was a kid I cut off my eyelashes because I thought they would grow back longer  (I know now that that wasn’t the best decision but I was a kid). I remember my dad yelling at me about it and then making fun of me in front of his friends. Another time, I worked up the courage to tell my mom that I was scared of him. My mom ended up telling my dad (and I don’t know why) and he made fun of me for that. So I stopped talking to a lot of people about my feelings for fear that my dad would find out. I remember being really scared that if I wasn’t outside the minute he got to my house to pick me up I would be in big trouble just because one time he yelled at me for not being outside without a couple minutes of him arriving at my house. I was only a couple minutes late too. So every time it was time to go to his house, I would look out the window every 10-15 minutes all day long just to make sure I was late. Later on he adopted my baby cousin without even telling me. I just came over and bam there was “my baby sister”. When she got a bit older he would sometimes put me in charge of watching her while him and my step mom went to work. I wouldn’t have minded it much if I wasn’t only 12 and if they didn’t go to work for almost 10-12 hours a day. He would also sometimes make me be the one to discipline her. That really scarred me because his version of discipline was spanking (I live in the south and it’s pretty normal but not for that age. She was young).  Sometimes she got put in timeout or a spanking just for crying. It was really sad. Over time they began to alienate me out of the family. He put up pictures of them everywhere but rarely there were any of me. Maybe on or two and he had tons of space to put pictures. I remember a Christmas when he “bought me a Christmas present” and I was really happy about it. I thought maybe that meant our relationship is completely in the dump. Turns out he gave my aunt some money to buy my presents. My step mom was the one who actually got me some gifts straight from her. That really broke my heart. (By the way my step mom is an amazing woman and I love her to death. I don’t know why she married someone like my dad). Over time I began to go to my dad’s house less. He would lecture me about not going to his house and make me feel guilty saying “what if I died? You would feel guilty for not coming to see me” or one time on my birthday he said “I shouldn’t even give you some money because you don’t see me enough but here”. I remember sometimes I would complain to him about my mom (who I will get to) because that was my one attempt to try to at least talk to him. It was the only thing we ever talked about. At his new house, I didn’t have my own room and my dad got a new job as a sherif which he would leave me home alone for at least 12 hours most days. I would sleep on the floor somewhere or I would sleep in my step mom’s mom’s room.  It always irritated me that she got a room yet she wasn’t there for months at a time. Anyways, he would say something along the lines of “if you come live with me instead of your mom then I will build you a room”. Him saying all of this only made me come less until one night he texted me and said “if you don’t want to see me and be a part of this family then just tell me. “ that was the last time I had contact with him other than one Christmas gift card he sent me but I sent it right back. I haven’t had any contact with my dad for about 3 years now. I’ve never been better but I still feel guilty. All the family, friends, and even my poor little sister that I left behind. I still don’t know what to think. 

Now onto my mom. I have mixed feelings. On one hand I love her with all my heart of course. She’s my mother and there will never be anyone who has taught me more than she has. On the other hand, my mom is one of the worst  people I’ve ever known. My mom has been drinking and smoking since before me and my sister( on my moms side) were even thought of. When I was younger, everything seemed fine. We didn’t have a lot of money but we still went out to the beach which wasn’t far from my house or went driving or walking around the neighborhood. I cherish those times now. As I got older and we moved away things got worse. My mom used to work as a lunch lady at my school. When I was in fourth grade I was bullied by the girl who I really trusted. She was my best friend. I told my mom but she didn’t help me much.  She told the school and all they did was send me to a counselor who didn’t do anything either. I got over it later but it just hurt my heart so bad that my mom didn’t comfort me at all. Later on, my mom met a woman and they began having a relationship. My mom was still married. To be honest I think that was the happiest I had ever seen her. I didn’t know what was happening back then because I was too young. But I know now what was going on. The woman ended up moving away because of her family so my mom tells me when I ask about her. I think she found out my mom was married but that’s not my business I guess. My mom ended up getting a nee job as a custodian at my middle school and things only got worse. My moms new job became more demanding and to deal with the stress she began to smoke and drink a lot more heavily. When she was drunk she got super angry with anyone and everyone. She would call me and my sister names or stay up super late and yell and scream. She would slam doors and cabinets. I remember one time she threw a remote at my sister. Thank god it missed her. Sometimes being at my dads house alone felt like a sanctuary even though I hated being there too. Very often I would try to talk to my mom about her drinking and smoking but she would just change the subject. A couple of times I just broke down crying and pleading with her to stop killing herself but she just told me to go to my room. When I complain about something at school that clearly wasn’t my fault she finds a way to make it my fault or say something bad about my generation. Just recently I bought a really cute outfit. It was revealing but it did hug my body very well which I could hide anyway. I showed my mom and she told me I was going to be a tramp. She’s even had fits of anger when in front of my ex, family, even in restaurants. Nowadays and the rest of my family do everything thing we can to keep her from yelling. I try not to tolerate it but it’s hard when the rest of the family just enables her behaviors and there isn’t much that I can do. My mom is also super over protective. She won’t let me go to the mall with friends or even stay the night. She doesn’t even let me go out with a lot of my family who are very trustworthy and wouldn’t do anything to put me in harms way like most. My friends are very far from bad kids as well. We are all in the same honors programs and classes at school and we don’t do drugs or smoke or anything like that. My family and I don’t travel. We don’t do much of anything. There’s so many things that I’ve missed out on as a teenager. I don’t really want to go into every detail about my mom. I don’t want start crying or have a panic attack. I just want to know how am I supposed to deal with this? I want out of this situation so bad. I’m so depressed constantly and my house is so toxic. At one point things got so bad that I thought about suicide for some time. I can’t go stay with family because my parents don’t realize their wrong doings. They think I’m just saying things like this for attention. I’ve been to my school counselors, teachers, people I trust and they just tell me to talk to her or things will get better. I can’t afford therapy. The only way to get better is to get out. I thought about running away but I know that’s not a smart idea. Staying with my dad is out of the question. I thought about revolting so bad that they feel the need to kick me out? I don’t know. I feel so stuck and trapped here. Every day is the same thing.  I just want a bit of peace. I want out of this house. What should I do?",14May2020,1
282,"So I walked in from being on sick leave for a week and some things were changed around a bit. since this corona shit has been around we have a different complicated way of ringing people up and before I left it was a easy, smooth way to ring people up (we all would ring up under our managers name in the front and there would only be one register behind the counter) and now since I left there are  3 registers in the front and my register doesn’t even have a computer for it so I was ringing up orders under other registers and all of a sudden I got sent home by a PIC because “I wasn’t paying attention to what I was doing” and “This wasn’t my first time doing this” And NO ONE even gave me clear instruction on how to ring up anyone now that we have so many registers up front. I was already used to ringing up under the managers register in the front. Even then, after she said she was sending me home, she never even told me why, I had to fucking ask.

288,"Some background— 

I moved in with my current roommate about 8 months ago. We met online, but we definitely got lucky with each other. We’re pretty close (movie nights, face mask / wine nights, classic roommate stuff). 

About 2 months in to living together, she shared that she used to suffer from bulimia. She shared that her last phase was 2 years ago, and required inpatient care in order to fix it. She said it was in the past, and that now she’d be all about body positivity, healthy eating, yoga etc. 

Fast forward to a month ago, I walked passed her bathroom and heard her throwing up. I know for a fact she was vomiting. I thought maybe she just wasn’t feeling good, so I didn’t mention it to her. But this has become a regular thing. We’re quarantining together and this is a small apartment, so there really isn’t a lot of room to hide things. 

I started suggesting we make and eat dinner together more often so I could monitor her, and like clockwork, she’ll drink an ENORMOUS amount of water, excuse herself from the table, and come back a few minutes later with messed up hair / watery eyes. 

I am worried. I’d say I’m pretty certain that she’s relapsing, but she hasn’t mentioned anything to me. 

Would it be inappropriate to just flat out ask her what’s going on? I need her to be okay.",14May2020,1
289,"My brother asked me months ago if I can lend his brother-in-law my laptop since he really needed one for college. Back then I was only looking for a job and didn't use the laptop for more productive purposes. He told me I could use his computer for job hunting. I said yes.

Fast forward some months and I got offered a job but the lockdown caused delays in the contract signing. I feel that there's a chance they might pull out. If I do get the job though, I'll need myself a laptop (the one that offered me advised me to study up on the tools used). I also can't use my brother's computer anymore since he took it with him when he moved to his apartment

I'm tight on budget and can only buy secondhand laptop, and there's this one I saw at an online shop with decent specs

A friend asked why I'd waste money when I DO have a laptop and I could just get it back. But the one I lended it to would really need it now for the 'new normal' that's going to happen for their school year. So I feel like it's a dick move asking for it back when he really needs it and I agreed to let him borrow it.

So my options would be:
A. Buy a secondhand laptop
B. Get my old laptop back

But it all depends on if I actually DO get the job
So in case of that, should I just go for:

C. Just don't do anything until I'm sure of the offer?

One day her mom picked her up from school and i never got to say good bye to her ever. I vividly remember her mom picking up . I never heard from her . I never shed a tear that time  but I always wondered, where she was . All these years. It’s been 9-10 yrs now and I finally got in contact with her. She is that same goofy self that she used to be . Three years back i called her somehow but things were awkward. Didn’t pursue the talk any further.Now it’s kinda different. I fucking miss her. She has no idea how I felt. I miss her. That anticipation killed me and now i am kind of relieved that atleast i got in contact with her. Funny enough how we are in the same city just a km or two away. I want to get to know her more . I want everything to be the same but I don’t want to make it awkward. I can’t stop crying, i want to meet her but I don’t know how to pursue the convo and tell her all about this .what should i do ?",14May2020,1

294,"Hey, I am a 16yo teen who lives in a non dangerous neighbour hood who has a curfew of ""before dark"" which is for half the year around 5-6pm. I am trying to explain to my mother that this curfew is too early and that it is hard to keep good relationships with friends who have jobs and cant hang out during weekend days mostly. When I ask her why I cant have it extended to atleast 8pm she says ""because its dangerous"" or ""Because thats when I said you have to be home don't argue."" I am not doing bad at school and have decent grades aswell as not into any drugs or even drinking which is commonplace in my country at my age. I would like some advice that I can send to my mum to convince her that a curfew that early isnt healthy for me.  


Exceptions to current curfew for more information:

\- I am allowed to stay past dark if she picks me up which barely can happen because I have 2 little sisters who she takes care of at around 8pm and most likely doesnt like picking me up at that time.

\- If I am staying the night at a friends house curfew doesnt apply

\- If there is something like a movie that finishes after dark she lets me watch the movie to the end but she most likely will pick me up.

just a simple description: i’m a high school student interested in digital art, not so much graphic design or designing logos but more into like the movie industry, specifically character design (i’m not so good at animation bc i don’t know how to use much programs but i’m trying to learn more). i’ve been doing digital art since around 2017 and started to consider something in character design or concept art to create movies and animated films and such, but i don’t have any art friends and many art teachers to talk to. 

are there any experienced artists out there able to share some advice on being an artist? i’m literally open to anything—any colleges to consider, majors to think of, anything to try or practice, etc. i’m not really set on character design as i don’t really know if it pays much but my dream career is basically just to make anything that can contribute to a big thing, like a movie. any advice or experience you’ve had will help and bring me perspective, i hope everyone stays safe and healthy :)",14May2020,1

298,"So this got removed from r/AmITheAsshole but I didn’t really get enough time to respond to some of the points brought up 


I just finished my freshman year of college. I am trying to work in the field of investment banking. When it comes to banking recruiting, there is this concept called “target schools.” This just means that there are certain schools (Ivy+ and public Ivies) that banks hold on campus recruiting on and take most of their kids from. 

My school is not one of those aforementioned Ivy League or Elite public schools, thus, networking into the role is a lot more important. 

There is a specific business frat at my school that has a solid number of alumni at these firms, and joining would help my chances with landing an internship or full time role. 

I have a few friends in this frat, and I was talking with them and they told me that I should pledge in the fall. They told me they polled their frat group chat and they told me I’d have a great chance of making it in the fall. 

I was having a zoom kick back with some of the people from my dorm floor. I briefly mentioned in passing that I was likely going to join this frat next year, and some of the girls in the videochat lost their shit and mentioned this frat had a horrible reputation. 

This was the first I’d heard of this coming from this frat, so I decided to ask around. Most people said they didn’t know, but some said they agreed with what the girls said. I checked on Greekrank and there was some mention of - a kind of vibe there. I asked my friends in the frat (the ones who said I should join) and they all said that the bad reputation talk was extremely overblown. 

I was having another Videochat with my floormates some time later, and I told those girls that, while I though that the rumors, if true, are bad, that I really needed the connections that the frat could provide due to the alumni. Those specific girls then told me that they wouldn’t hang out with me next year if I joined. The call kind of spiraled from there, and told them I can’t beliebt they’d make me choose between them and my career. 

I also get along great with my friends in the frat, and they are super fun. It really pissed me off that those girls acted like I am some sort of criminal for wanting to join.   

Look, I’ve already decided that I will join; this post isn’t about that. I’m here asking if I am the asshole for **wanting** to join despite the bad reputation?

302,"I had a really great interview today for a possible part time job at a company that's relevant to my major. Although it has not been a guarentee that the position is mine, I would say I have a pretty good shot based on what my interviewer was saying. However, two weeks ago, I also accepted a part time job as a barista because I was under the impression that this company was most likely not going to interview me. In addition, I am also taking a few summer classes online. 

My dilemma is that my family is being slightly unsupportive in my decision to do both part time jobs and my online summer classes at the same time (if I get the part time at the company of course). I am not sure what to do. I just got hired as a barista and I really like the environment there, but I know that a part time job at the company would benefit me the most in the long run. I know what I'm capable of and what I can handle, but knowing how my family is, some of them will probably yell at me for taking on too much. Also, the part time job at the company would require me to drive the freeway, which my mother does not allow me to do because of a previous car accident I had a couple years ago. What should I do?

305,"&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to be as honest as possible. This girl and I met during my sophomore year of college. I sat by her during the first day of classes, and we started talking. The first night, we hung out on campus and talked for hours. I tried to kiss her and she was a bit freaked. I felt embarrassed and said, ""Oh, that was stupid,"" She says, ""Noo, it just feels a bit fast."" A couple of days later, we hung out again and we actually began kissing. I was kinda surprised because she's Christian, and at one point she let me move my hand up her shirt to touch her boobs. From then on, we would hang out and make out. We both enjoyed it, but sometimes she got a little annoyed.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes we'd walk on the sidewalk, and I'd try to kiss her and move my hand to her chest. She'd move my hand away and ask, ""Do we have to kiss every 5 seconds? Can we just take a walk?"" There was another time when we were at a football game. Sometimes I'd try to kiss and move my hand to touch her chest. She'd be like, ""No! Not here!"" Then she'd quickly move my hand away.

&amp;#x200B;

It was confusing because sometimes she liked making out, but other times she didn't. There were a few times when she mentioned that maybe we should make it official that we're in a relationship because we click very well. I was hesitant and said ""not yet"" (because I didn't want people asking questions). There was another time we hung out privately and I touched her chest. She was like, ""Maybe we shouldn't be doing this,"" I asked ""Never?"" And she said, ""No, just not all the time."" I was sad and asked ""Please"". she said, ""Fine, ok.""

&amp;#x200B;

One night, in particular, I felt kinda bad because I was a bit drunk. We hung out and went to my apartment for a little bit. We started making out, and I asked if I could see her boobs. She was hesitant and said, ""No, I don't think we should do that."" I asked, ""Please?"" a couple of times. She eventually said, ""Ok"" and showed me them. We kissed and stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, I messaged her and said we needed to talk. We met somewhere and I felt bad but said I don't think we should be in an official relationship because I was hoping to feel butterflies over the past several weeks but never did. I told her that she was really good to me and that another guy would appreciate that. She was upset and said she feels like I used her for her boobs.

&amp;#x200B;

AITA? I went to a catholic all-boys high school, and I don't have experience with girls.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a couple of conversations we had much later.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: How've you been?

&amp;#x200B;

Her: Ok been kinda stressed

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Actually same. But I brought it on myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Her: How

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I mean I could tell you, but I don't think you'd really want to hear it

&amp;#x200B;

Her: Is it about me?

&amp;#x200B;

Me: No

&amp;#x200B;

Her: why would I not want to hear it

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Other girls

&amp;#x200B;

Her: \*sends a huge ""like"" button\*

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Yeah. Knew you wouldn't want to hear

&amp;#x200B;

Her: Girls? lol

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Just one

&amp;#x200B;

Her: Ok

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Yeah sorry to mention it I'm sorry if that made things awkward Are you mad?

&amp;#x200B;

Her: Who even knows at this point

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I'm sorry

&amp;#x200B;

Her: I mean, I'm pissed. but it's whatever at this point

&amp;#x200B;

Me: What?

&amp;#x200B;

Her: omg

&amp;#x200B;

Me: You don't know what did or didn't happen

&amp;#x200B;

Her: Well why were you stressed then

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I think it'd be tacky to say. I mean I could say but I don't think it'd be very polite to you

&amp;#x200B;

Her: Lol well whoever she is, I hope you feel butterflies for her!

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I'm gonna say this without any sarcasm. I think it's good that you're pissed and you're being like this

&amp;#x200B;

Her: And why is that?

&amp;#x200B;

Me: It shows you're starting to stand up for yourself and being assertive

&amp;#x200B;

Her: Explain more in detail

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I think that a lot of people that are timid or too nice for they're own good need to get pissed to start asserting themselves and find they're own voice. Like I think you are one of those people (I used to be like this) that everything is they're fault and they're always in the wrong. And tbh sometimes those type of ppl need an antagonist... someone that they think is 100% wrong and they're 100% right.... To get pissed at before they really find their voice

&amp;#x200B;

So I know you feel wronged and kinda think that I'm a dirt bag. And do I think that's justified...no. But if that's what it takes for you to stop letting people and life push you around...then I don't think it's the worst thing ever

&amp;#x200B;

\*much Later conversation\*

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Hey!""

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""Hey""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""What's up?""

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""Nothing you""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Not much I just wanted to kind of apologize for being an ass last year

&amp;#x200B;

Her: I accept your apology thank you

&amp;#x200B;

Me: No problem I just don't want you to hate me anymore

&amp;#x200B;

Her: I never hated you I was just frustrated because I felt like you didn't see where I was coming from you know?""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""sort of? I'd be down to talk it out tho If that's something you'd be ok with doing""

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""Basically I was mad because I felt like you didn't see what you did wrong""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Like what?""

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ?""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""like ending things the way I did?""

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""Yeah wait why are you apologizing?""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Just for that and being cold-hearted""

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""Oh ok""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Yeah I just feel bad and I kind of miss you

&amp;#x200B;

Her: Why do you miss me?

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Cause you were always so nice and sweet to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Her: Thanks haha

&amp;#x200B;

Me: And there's a big part of me that sort of misses being affectionate

&amp;#x200B;

Her: In what way

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Wym?

&amp;#x200B;

Her: Affectionate in what way?

&amp;#x200B;

306,"First off, it’s not the actual college that I hate or the thought of being alone or away from home or anything. What I really dislike is schoolwork and studying. I have ADHD and a horrible attention span that has affected me since I was a kid. I got pretty good grades in high school because it was so much easier to get by just on knowledge alone instead of studying for hours. What should I do? Should I figure out how to get through college and suffer, or should I just try to go down a different route?",14May2020,1
307,"
So I’m currently a second semester freshman at CUNY Brooklyn college. 

I applied on kind of a whim to transfer to NYU. I do have interest in NYU, but I didn’t really expect to get in on the first try. I was kind of viewing it as a practice application for a larger round of transfer applications I would do next year as a sophomore. 

(Some of the other schools I’m interested in require that a student transfers with 60 credits so it was too early for me to apply to them). 

Anyway, I was offered admission into NYU school of arts and sciences. 

I know NYU has a much better reputation than my current school, and I’m tempted to just accept the offer, but here are my concerns:

1. NYU is wayyyyyyy more expensive. So far, I’ve been able to pay all of my Brooklyn college tuition with aid and my own money from working. I don’t have family support to pay my schooling, loan me money, or co-sign with me on private loans. Plus that level of debt is kind of frightening to me. 

2. I’m not positive what I want to do yet. I’m leaning towards double majoring in psychology and film. Maybe I’ll end up just picking one or the other but I’m not sure. I haven’t taken enough classes in either to be certain. If I go to NYU, double majoring or changing majors won’t really be an option. Based on what I’ve heard it will be too expensive and rigorous to do two majors. Also, if I want to do film, I have to apply to NYU Tisch which is specialized and that’s no guarantee. 

3. The commute is a lot longer. I live within 15 minutes walking distance of Brooklyn college and it would be like 45 mins on the train for NYU. 

4. There’s the whole pandemic thing. I’m not even sure if classes will be in person in the fall, and if so that’s even less reason to sign on to a humongous tuition right now. Also, the lesser cost of Brooklyn college means some of my financial aid is supplementing my living expenses next year, so I have a cushion to still be able to survive for awhile until COVID ends and I can work again. With NYU, there would be nothing left over and I would be screwed if the pandemic lasted past August.

5. NYU has a much more rigorous reputation. I don’t normally mind that, but unlike highschool, I’m not just doing school and nothing else. I have to work full time, and I’ve been realizing that I want to try living a more balanced life that includes socializing, health, and creative projects. Brooklyn College has made that a lot easier to manage, but I fear the workload of NYU might throw me into a really unhealthy imbalance of being super overworked all the time. (Even in highschool I became so grade obsessed I barley slept and was anxious all the time). 

6. My best friend lives here with me and also just started going to Brooklyn colleges. He’s had his own journey with school and he’s fairly sure he’s going to stay here for undergrad but our lease is year to year and he could up and decide to go to school in  another random state anytime, and then I wouldn’t be able to afford to stay here. (I pay rent but he offers a more generous split than anyone else would because of our history). So if that happened I would just need to transfer again. 

7. I don’t know what kind of aid other good schools that I’m interested in might offer me, because I haven’t applied there yet. So maybe transferring next year could be a better financial option for me. 


Why I’m considering it:

1. It has a way better reputation and student body. 

2. I’m worried that if I reject it and then do my round of applications next year, I might not get any offers and I’ll have ended up squandering my one opportunity to transfer to a better school which I really would like to do. 
3. Kind of the same as the last two, but I’ll feel like kind of an idiot for rejecting such a good school. My family is really excited for me and on paper it seems like a good opportunity. 


(Sorry I know this was long)

I kow it's a morbid title but it's the truth. She is my baby. My love. And she's getting up there in years. The apartment i live in currently doesnt allow pets so she lives with my mother. I typically visit twice a week. I've wanted to leave and live in other places but Ive always put it off over and over.

I have family in arizona, california who have offered to allow me to stay with them while I find work and an apartment. I feel like her eventually death will be the catalyst that will push me. I


'm in my mid 20 I have over 5 grand that I've slowly starting saving since I noticed her health deteriorating. Would it  really tell my family of my plan until I've already bought a ticket. I know they'd try and probably convince me to stay. Am I being selfish? Im not hoping or anticipating her death.

311,"Backstory: Out of nowhere, she just started ghosting me in early December. She would not reply to anything I said to her. She didn't come back for Christmas, New Year's, my birthday, and when all of _this_ happened (if you know what I mean -- I know some subs remove posts if they mention it.) It made me upset because I thought we were close, and I thought she would have at least told me what was up. It wasn't even the sole fact that she ghosted: it was the fact that she just refused to let me know she needed it.

Anyway, a few days, I looked at her without feelings or bias, and I realized that maybe she didn't care about me all that much. From her actions, she just didn't line with her words. With her being social awkward and weird as she out it herself, I tried to take her word for it, but I don't know. I was always the one initiating anything, I was the one asking how her day was and if she was okay, whenever I talked about myself -- part of me felt like maybe she didn't care (over text is more noticeable than in person -- maybe she actually did listen.) I always had to remind her that it was my birthday but I was always there to say happy birthday for hers.

I thought I should just end it. Make it official rather than just let it fade. I sent her a very long text of how I was feeling due to her lack of communication with me. And I said I was done. And then blocked her.

Then I unblocked her a day later.

I felt like I made the right decision but why do I feel so bad?

Today, I've been sad. I don't know why. Even though certain signs are apparent, she was nice to me. She was kind to me. She helped me through my depression three years ago. Our museum hangouts were awesome. The days where it was just us were fun-filled and we did fun stuff. Whenever I see people have fun, I cringe because I don't have that anymore with the one person I cared about. 

I have a friend who is a relative to her and my only contact to her, and he plans to talk to her and tell me what she thinks of me or what she feels of my decision, so I have closure. But he's busy and I honestly don't know if it'll be soon. I don't want to text him again because I've already texted him a few times this week around. I reminded him and he knows that I want to know what she thinks.

Maybe I'm second-guessing myself. Overthinking. Thinking what if she did get back in that time. Because I blocked her for about 18 hours, and right as I deleted her off of my social medias, her same relative that I was talking was looking at one of my social media that he is never on, as I deleted her as a friend.

So on April 22, 2020, I ordered a backpack online (my last one was ripping on the bottom and needed a new one immediately bc I need it for work). I bought from a seller who ships from China. Okay, they ship the item and it gets to the U.S pretty fast, but the third party deliverer, which is called Newgistics has been holding it and it hasn't moved for 21 days. 

Now, I never disputed a charge in my life. I also am a human being and understand we are in a middle of a pandemic, so I want to be understanding, but at the same time I don't want to be scammed. I saw online where some people said Newgistics never gave them their packaged.

I don't want to be scammed, but also don't want to forget the part, we are in a pandemic. The shipping company is in California and I know COVID19 is bad there. So, when is it appropriate to submit a dispute?

325,"I want to keep this brief and just get some of your thoughts on this. I am a middle aged man and I work nights at a manufacturing facility that has separate restrooms for men and women. Note that on my shift it is all men. 

So I'll get straight to the point of what happened to me tonight and get some of your opinions on how big of a deal it really is. I regularly see a man cleaning our facility at night, its normally one or two men cleaning together. 

I was busy at work and had to use the restroom bad. I rush to the restroom and quickly approach the urinal. As I'm undoing my pants I realize it is a lady cleaning up, a little awkward but when she realizes I'm about to use the restroom she leaves. I proceed to use the restroom and get back to work. 

A co-worker approaches me and asks if I just used the restroom while a lady was in there. I explain what happened and he goes on to say that her husband (and co worker) mentioned it to him and was not happy. I immedietly stop what I'm doing, track them both down, and apologize profusely while I explain that I didn't mean to offend and that I should have asked her to leave or waited for her to leave. 

Thing is, all my co workers are acting like I did the worst thing ever. They're saying that if HR hears about it that they'll fire me. I admit that it was awkward and under normal circumstances I would not have used the restroom with her in there but this all happened so fast. By the time I realized it was a lady cleaning the restroom she was already leaving. 

So, reddit, is using the restroom while a cleaning lady is cleaning really THAT big of a deal? If for some reason this did get brought up to my company do I have any leg to stand on? I really don't feel like what I did was THAT bad but maybe I'm wrong.",14May2020,1

333,"So when I was younger my uncle beat me mercilessly, like broken bones, hit with bats, choked, and alot more. Put of fear, I never told anyone, and around eight, I started MMA  and also did not scouts and such. Now the MMA helped with letting put the anger, but never letting it go. As a kid from 9 to 18 I was care free, imaginative, wrote stories, played video games, and I was just very creative, and in the last three years of high school I had met a girl and she brought me to God. And it helped for a little, but I always had anger issues, and had a problem with letting things go, and I had no fear complex of anyone, or anything, not even doing something that might kill me, and granted I'm still that way, I'm just smart about it lol. Graduated, proposed to her and she said yes, but four months later there was a car accident,  and she didn't survive. And that just drove me away from everyone, and built up so much anger. I went on to study psychology for  three years before I realised I'm too empathetic, and I took on the weight of others problems. So I changed schools and majors, and studied graphic design and got a degree, and I love what I do, and I am very creative, but I'm running into a problem. About one year ago, I met a girl, she had a boyfriend at the time but we still talked, and eventually dated during the holidays. But at the same time, I had learned my sister had been shot and killed, and it just destroyed me. I went to God for strength, and prayed and prayed and for a tiny bit I had it, I was facing all my problems and moving forward. Soon after my uncle stepped back into the picture. Hatred is a poison, and it is very potent, and the amount I had toward him was unbearable. But my girl talked me down, and talked to me on how to forgive and let go, so I started to work on that, and it was working. I love this girl, with all my heart, but two three months ago, she just cut me off, no warning, no anything. Blocked me, my friends, everything, cut all ties, and it's killed me. One month ago, I learned that my uncle actually killed himself, and left a note about me and how he was sorry. Then, a week ago, I learned that she actually left me, to be with another guy. Now because of how my life has played out, I tend to move on from most people, but for some reason I'm stuck on her and can't let it go. And now I feel responsible for my uncle, that now I'll never get a chance to forgive, that's it's going to stay in my heart with that bitter taste. For the past month, my emotions have been overloaded, and that poisoning is just so strong. And now it's towards her, and other around me. I can't focus on my work, even though I get it done, it's like my mind is clouded, and I'm not who I was. I want to reconnect to who I truely am, stop worrying about things, to just live, to live without this poison in me. I don't like it at all, and anytime I hear her name or anything, it's just this wave of anger and explosive outburst. I don't want to live like that.",14May2020,1

I am considering going to film school and trying to make a career out of it, however given the current scenario there will be no to minimal jobs in the industry and I don't really have any sort of experience making films, it's pure interest atm which might leave me poor / unemployed or with a low wage job for the rest of my life if I don't make it in life. Even the industry isn't so clean, especially for women. But I have some inspirations on how to not let that be a barrier.

Characters
Me:me/I
Problematic friend: Z
Old friend: C

So as I’ve said, I’ve had this friend for a few years. Z. We met in school, and instantly became friends over our shared appreciation for discussing politics and religion, and our shared love for overwatch. For the first 6 months our friendship was fantastic. He quickly became one of my closest friends. Because of how well we got along, I introduced him to my old friend who I knew before I moved where I am now. I’ve know. C for nearly 5 years and he has problems getting close to others, due to borderline abusive parents and all around difficulty making friends. Us three played apex and overwatch together and constantly talked, and then Z broke up with his abusive girlfriend who kept cheating on him. Constantly. 

For over a month, he was miserable, a wreck and I helped him though it, and then they got back together. I said some very bad things about her, and he ended our friendship cold turkey. A month later, he texted me back, in shambles because their relationship ended again, and he was wrong to cut me out of his life. I took him to six flags, and soon our friendship was back to the way it was. During this time, and months afterwords Z and C became super close friends through independent talking.

Cut to a few months ago, and Z and I get into a big debate over politics, which quickly devolves into an argument, and then becomes a roast session for him. He goes off on me, not breaking down my argument, but insulting both me and my argument. He stopped trying to prove his point and instead made it about devaluing me, and therefore my argument, using all kinds of logical fallacies. So after this fight we stop talking for a while, and then we got back to it. And I slowly started to realize how careful I had to be around him. After a few more fights over the past few months, it’s started to feel like I have to walk on eggshells every time I talk in the group chat with Z&amp;C,  and I don’t necessarily want to leave him out, since I currently am playing games for C due to his parents extreme restrictions on his screen time. 

I don’t want to loose more friends, but this situation is getting rough, and I especially don’t want to put C in the middle of it. This could lead to him no longer being friends with Z, and then all of his hurt would be 100% my fault, and I can’t hurt C like that. Honestly I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I’m just over reacting, or not reacting enough.

I had also tried to pull back from him, to give him time but he then left a shared discord between Me, C and him, and then sent us a text to our GC about how someone would tell if their friends don’t care about them anymore, and then when asked strait up said he doesn’t think we care about him anymore.

343,"So I(23m) have been with this girl(20) for a year and 8 months. During this time I noticed her entertaining a female she tried to be with prior to me. Since it was early in our relationship I let it go. They got a matching tattoo and she got mad once the girl got a boyfriend long story short. I continued to date her since this happened so early on in our relationship I wasn’t taking it serious. Then when moved in together in November. We started dating in September before her 19th birthday. After we moved in together she met a friend at work cloe and her and the girl became abnormally close. 

Like she asked me could she go pick her up from work because her car was broken she got off at 11:00pm I said yes and she came back rather quickly so I thought nothing of it. She then asked me later could they have sex with each other because cloes boyfriend was okay w it. I said no and later about in April 2019. I found out they were in a relationship and she had sex with her in my bed while I was at work. I was angry and left her and went back to my moms house. But sexually and mentally I’d never had anybody do what she was able to and it made me fall in love with her. We didn’t talk for a week and I ended up going back to stay w her. 

I also found out she was talking to her ex the whole time and she was liking all his pictures from the jump before we ever had an argument. He changed my name on our Netflix account and it hurt me. All of these things she promised she’d never do again. So we broke the lease to her apartment which costed me 1442$ and I paid her 241$ car note. She did not have a decent job and neither did I I work my internship and Walmart which is about 1600$ a month roughly. So I supported her and she bounced from friend to friends house I made sure and fed her and gassed her car I always gave her my last. The relationship turned toxic though I threw a lot of things I did for her in her face and she said I made her hate herself. She just really hurt me to my core. So fast forward she ends up staying here with me at my family’s house and never paid a single bill. Gave me attitude and talked to her ex while me, my mom, and sister financially supported her. I wasn’t perfect but I tried my best to love her I was in love. She went to the military in February(national guard) and wrote me through basic basically saying we were gonna start our life together and etc. I ended up not writing her often it wasn’t intentional but she would call so I figured it was okay. I sent her items she asked for in letters and wrote her when I felt like it I guess. The reason I didn’t write her often is because I was aiming to have 10k saved so I could buy a ring and move away with her when she got back. 

I wanted to right my wrongs I loved this one. She got mad about me not writing her saying I didn’t support her and I wasn’t there when she needed me. I apologized and told her it wasn’t with I’ll intentions I was working 100+ hrs for 8 weeks and it slipped my mind. So we barely talk she doesn’t call me but we were texting everyday. She mad her twitter private and today I asked her let me follower her we had been doing good so I wanted to show her silly shit. I look at her tweets and see a tweet that she retweeted with a quote “been about you since I met you” and her response was “&amp; always gone be 💚” instantly I thought about her ex because she used green hearts for him and blue for me. I then found out after she told me it was about a girl. I asked her to let me see and she sent me a video of her screen recording them brushing their teeth together. She had moved on basically and led me on until today. She rubbed it in my face posting happy things on Snapchat and sending me that. How do I pick up the pieces? I really need some help. I loved her even with all of this shit. I feel so used and belittled.

February was the first time I experienced this. I contemplated seeking help again, assuming my mental state was worsening again. But then two weeks later I felt better and thought it had been a one time thing. And since then I've started to notice the pattern, that I always feel this way around three days before my period starts.

I think I can deal with it now I know this. It's just that my period isn't that regular, so I'm not always sure if that's what it is. And this makes me feel like I can't trust my feelings at all. Because it feels so genuine, you know, true gut sadness. And I'll then cross a line through it in my mind thinking 'This is because of your period, it doesn't matter'.

I don't want to disappoint my mom, and all she wants is to see me leave with at least a C average. I don't foresee it happening, unfortunately.

In just about every class, I never really understand anything at all. My two worst subjects are history and math. Both teachers have insisted that I'm smart, but I'm damn sure that they only say that because they're teachers. I'm not smart, I'll say it myself. I use large, complicated words to sound smart, and I've taught myself how to write better along with that. Of course, writing well isn't going to get me that far. I've failed just about every test, and it isn't a ""not paying attention"" issue, so much as it is a ""I don't get any of this"" issue.

Everything sounds confusing. I've noticed how whenever I ask someone for help, they try to break it down, and I keep asking more and more questions, and they grow so frustrated that they just give up. At this point I've quit asking for help, because I know that the same thing will keep happening. I can hardly complete assignments without leaving half of the questions blank because I'm not sure what to say. I'm starting to lose every ounce of encouragement I have left at this point.

I am a very open person. I see no reason to not tell people what I’m feeling. Since meeting this friend half a year ago (through mutual friends) I’ve been going through a divorce, so obviously I’ve been quite emotional.

He brings up me being overemotional and sensitive a lot. I’d love some advice on how to counter this. If I get offended then I just prove his point. So I’ve been rolling over and letting him say it, which is very stupid and against my nature.

I’m under an extreme amount of pressure to find a job and move out which let’s be honest anyone who has had to move back with their parents after 4 years hates.

351,"Hey guys! So as I stated above, I'm 25 and still living at home. I'm still in school and I have a job, although I plan on getting a new one soon. Ever since I got my first job when I was 21, I've been trying tirelessly to put money in my savings to move out. For years I couldn't keep a stable savings account no matter how much I budget because my former car always had something wrong with it. Without going into too much detail, my dad is abusive and my mom is extremely overprotective. They both wanted me to go to school in the medical field, but I decided to follow my dreams and go to school for Elementary Education. I know it's less money, but it's something I want to do. Also they want to try and be picky about who I date. My dad is racist and my mom wants me to find a rich guy that will support me. With the support system, I honestly don't want to feel like he's the only one holding the house up, that should be my job too. Not to mention I'm not after money, I never looked at a man for his money. I was single for a few months after breaking up with my abusive fiancé, who they adored and I don't think they believe me when I told them he's abusive. With all of this being said, my mom gave me her old car which is a really good car. I have money to move out finally. This guy I'm talking to and have really good feelings about (we're taking it slow) is Hispanic. I can't move out because of this pandemic (low immune system), my parents are constantly trying to tell me I should date a guy THEY like, they think I'm moving out after marriage (when I literally can't handle what I'm going through now with them), and they're literally TELLING me I can't move out.
So what should I do? What's the correct approach to tell them about the guy I'm talking to (because I will tell them, I just don't know what to say because I've never been in this situation before)? Also when I move out, how should I tell them about that? With the guy I'm talking to I have a feeling we're going to start dating, and I don't want to hide our relationship because of his race. As for moving out, they can kick and scream all they want, but my decision still stands. How do I approach the situation with both questions? Thanks!",14May2020,1

Hello, I am a teenager who has an overweight issue, it's painful and sad to admit but it is the truth, anyways, thanks to many advice from doctors, teachers, friends and family, as well as thanks to having extra time thanks to quarantine, I decided to start working out to help me loose weight.

This has thankfully helped me reduce some weight, however here is where the issue begins, I love eating, which is the may reason of my weight, but the problem is, not only do I eat a lot when eating with family, I also eat a lot when I should not be eating.

Sometimes when I am watching TV or playing videogames or something, I would go to the kitchen for water or something, and get the urge to grab something to eat, doesn't matter the time, what or when I ate, even when I am full, I would still pick something to eat. I hate myself for doing this, but I can't stop, sometimes I would open the fridge to stop and say, I am not hungry, if I keep doing this, the exercise I am doing is worthless, but I will still go ahead and get food, even if I don't want.

I need advice in how I can stop myself from doing something that affects my self-esteem as well as my health, or do you guys believe I require professional help? Thanks in advance",14May2020,1

Later at 7am my dad woke up and he came in the room to apologise too because apparently they were talking about it all evening yesterday. I just hugged them both and my mum cried a little again.

I really don't want to be this way. I realy don't. I need validation of others way too much.

Some background: I am 17, male and I only have a couple of good friends. I come from a family with 2 parents that both love me so much, but both have huge flaws( not that I don't have any though). My dad is addicted to alcohol and he won't admit it and can become quite toxic at times, while my mom gets extremely upset over the smallest things and has huge outbursts of anger.

Now into the actual problem: I need validation and being accepted too much. It just fulfils me more than any other thing. Whenever someone praises my work, my looks, my personality or anything about me, when I get likes/upvotes on socials, you name it. Anything that involves social acceptance/ acceptance from another person. Whenever I get offended/not accepted it just takes a toll on me and I am in a really dark place. Latest example: I got downvoted here on reddit the other day, and I ended up thinking about it for 2 days straight.

Why am I like this? I want to feel that I am worth without others praise.

360,"TLDR at bottom

My roommate and I used to be super good friends in college, and moved to a new place together after graduating. However this past year, we've just grown more distant, and I guess I'm starting to get annoyed because we are both teleworking, and she will play video games for 16 hours a day, and always, always be talking to her online friends, like she can't live without them. When she talks to me, it's only when it's convenient for her, like when she gets up to grab a snack, she'll start a conversation, but then as I'm talking to her she'll go back to our couch and instead of finishing our conversation, put her headphones back in and interrupt me to tell me her friends are talking to her, and to ""have fun,"" basically telling me to stop bothering her it seems, or if she doesn't do that and waits for me to finish talking, when I'm talking to her she won't really listen, and when I finish instead of commenting say ""yeah, you done?"" She says it in a nice way in terms of her tone, but it's still rude, and I just don't feel that valued as a friend anymore.

 I moved with her because I didn't want to live alone and living together had mostly gone well, although we had some of they typical roommate problems, we are similar in what we do as roommates and are both pretty tame. For the most part, we haven't had major issues. But now it seems like it's not paying off to live with another person if they are going to act like I'm bothering or inconveniencing them every time I try to talk to them. It's frustrating, and I listen to her when she talks. I get that she doesn't want to be bothered when playing video games or talking to her friends, and I would just wait to address things with her except that she is ALWAYS playing games and talking to friends. 

Maybe she takes me for granted a bit since it's been so long now, and we've spend almost every day together for a few years now. I don't know. Maybe she's bored with me, but she acts like she likes me and still wants to be friends when she's not playing her game. I also know that she is dealing with some things right now, so I think that playing her game is her way of escaping reality, but I don't think it's healthy and I feel like not facing some of the issues in her life and trying to distract herself from them instead is starting to take a toll on her. I have tried to help her take care of herself physically and mentally in the past, but to no avail. She is aware that she's distracting herself instead of facing things in her life, but she doesn't care, she'd rather just have the distraction. I know it's not really my business, but I do care about her, and I feel like she'd enjoy life more if she did something for her mental health instead of playing video games 16 hours a day. Not to mention, listening to someone talk to their friends out loud for 16 hours a day can get to you, especially since she has a loud voice.

So, here's what I'm thinking about doing. We have our lease renewal and neither of us are in a good position to move this year, and aside from the friendship issues, as a roommate she is pretty tame, so I'm going to renew our lease with her for the next year as our renewal is coming up. However I'm thinking in about a year when our lease is up, I might move. My job has locations all over my state, and I've always wanted to live near the ocean, so I was thinking of moving to a beach town. Within the next year I should be in a pretty good position to move and get a decent apartment for myself. The thing is, without the friendship aspect, it seems like having a roommate isn't worth it anymore. I know I said my roommate is a good roommate, but no matter how good your roommate is you still have to compromise and work together all the time, with everything that affects the apartment. I think it would be nice to have my own place and have complete control over the place I live in. 

My main concern is living alone. I'm not great at making friends and I don't go out a lot, but I could put in the effort. Still, living alone can get lonely. If I got a pet I'd probably need a pet sitter, unless maybe it was a cat? I feel like I could potentially get super lonely and even depressed if I lived alone in a place I wasn't familiar with, especially since I'm not close to my family at all so I don't have much of a support system. At this point, I'm not sure what to do, but it's kind of getting to me that I live with someone who I used to have a meaningful friendship with and now don't. It's sad. Advice on this?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Roommate and I used to be friends, friendship had deteriorated but roommate is still a good roommate, however there's still normal compromises that come with having a roommate and I don't know if it's worth it anymore without the friendship aspect. I'm afraid I'll fall apart living alone though, so I need advice on what to do. If I move by myself it would be in about a year, maybe two.",14May2020,1

362,"Tldr is in the title.

So this happened just over two hours ago. I'm on mobile, so sorry for the formatting.

I don't usually answer restricted numbers, so I let it ring, figuring they'd leave a message if it was so important.  They rang again, and then again. I figured it must be really important for them to call me three times with barely any time in between tries, so I answered this time. The first thing they said, ""is this u/stanlins_anus?"" I freaked out when they said my real name, trying to figure out who it could be when I don't even recognize their voice.

So I asked who this was, and I'll call her Pam. She sounds pretty close to my age, 16-20ish I'd guess, and she tells me she remembers that I was really fun to be around and that she loved every moment with me. I asked how we know each other, still reaching for distant memories, and she said to ""stop being weird, u/stanlins_anus, c'mon you know me"" and I apologized because I genuinely don't remember her. So she tells me we met at a summer camp in Redmond, Washington. I've been to Redmond before, but I've never stayed at a summer camp, regardless of where. I don't even live close to Redmond.

At this point, I'm more confused than anything else, but I tell her to go on with what she was going to say. She says she remembers I was a lot of fun to be around and that she would really like to get closer. I said I'm cool with being friends (her voice and reactions could easily convince me this is legit and I'm the one not remembering something right), but that I'm taken. She promises she's taken too and doesn't want anything like that with me. So I said I'm okay with being friends, and she starts hyperventilating and saying things like ""oh my gosh I can't believe I'm finally talking to you again."" I told her to take her time to breathe for a second, so she composed herself and said that was the only reason she called, was to say I'm a cool and fun person. So I said for her to have a good night and she wished me the best and asked me to call her back.

How should I move forward? I can't call her back because her number is restricted. I'm genuinely confused and I tend to not trust things like this, but she somehow knew my name and that it matches with my phone number. I think we have a mutual friend, but no one comes to mind that knows anyone in or near Redmond. If there's any more questions, I'll answer them in the comments. Thanks so much!",14May2020,1

i lived in a good family. i’ve been told so by my parents for my whole life. i ended up taking a mental health plummet in the fifth grade and ended up dealing with self-injury. i think my mother meant well, but when i went on a school trip to a museum, she made me look at my wounds under a microscope. along with other incidents relating to my self-injury, that one stuck with me. and a bit later, people along with my own parents told me how others had been through worse, later going on a tangent about their own issues.

i entered a relationship, and got told off later for it and that i didn’t know what love was. then they say something like “you know we’ll always love you, right?” i brought up the incidents from fifth maybe 1-2 weeks after being diagnosed with depression and anxiety, only now feeling a bit more comfortable, but it escalated and things got bad. my mother says stuff when she gets angry, but when it’s bad enough she yelled at me asking if i wanted her to leave and/or kill herself. this was the second time this happened.

So I have been talking to this guy (NG) and we have been FaceTiming a lot, he tried logging into his Apple ID on his macbook that his ex had used frequently when they were together and found his ex's old messages.

This would put anyone in a piss poor mood but what gets even worse is he then finds messages from SE to at different people about cheating on NG. We are going through and screenshotting all of the messages we can because neither of us knew about this while their 2 year relationship was happening.

NG just took a video of the messages and sent it to SE and quoted specific messages about it:

""I'll go get d\*ck somewhere else""

""I don't cheat on him often""

etc., etc.

Don't know whether to expose him or not, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

382,"About me: i'm 15 almost 16 (despite the year in my username), i'm graduating HS some time this year, and i'm deeply into personal finance. I don't plan on pursuing any post-secondary education at the moment.   


I want to move to Canada, mostly for practical reasons (healthcare, less violence, etc etc), but I can't help but feel concerned it might impair me career wise. At this point in my life my main goal is to propel myself into a comfy future through frugality/hard work/investing (mostly in real estate) and i'm worried Canada might not be the ideal place for that. It could just be my idealized version of the U.S and it could very well be the same but i'm not sure.   


What do you guys think? How level are the 2 places? Let me know if I need to elaborate on anything, i'd be more than happy to.",14May2020,1
383,"I'm not professionally diagnosed, but I do seriously think I might be depressed. There's been so much going on in my life obviously, and I'm just sad &amp; have no energy all the time. Sometimes I get in these moods where I think about suicide or hurting myself, but I don't wish to do it. The thought scares me &amp; also the fact that i even thought about it in the first place. I still want to have a future so badly, my biggest goal is to just be successful and help out my family since I'm the oldest sibling. I have to pretend to be ok because I don't want anyone to worry about me. Everyone has their own problems, and I feel like I'll be a another problem if I tell them about what I'm struggling with. Does that make me pathetic? I want to be there for my family &amp; friends, but I feel like I'll just bother them. Do I tell them or deal with it on my own?",14May2020,1
384,"A throw away but to shorten the story I was fucked over by someone who I used to love and cared for a lot but over some time i now see how manipulative and how awful she truly was as a person and whenever I think of her and the things she did it's pure rage and I just want to see her get fucked over. I have dirt on her I know would do it but I dont know if it's the right call to anonymously tell her mom or someone. Example she did c*ke in class under a table being one of the smaller things. I know I have the means to fuck her over and possibly get that satisfaction but I'd like to just forget it all and not give a shit or be indifferent but I dont know how to get there. It genuinely takes a lot for me to hate a person but shes up there with all of the shit she did to me but I've never had the problem where it keeps popping in my head.

388,"I will provide further details if necessary. 

We had feelings for each other and a relationship was impossible, we slept together, he moved abroad, we stayed friends, he kind of distanced himself a few months ago but continued to make dirty remarks. 

Recently, he suggested Skyping, but right before the call he told me he had been having a serious girlfriend for months, asking me if it would be awkward. I say no, and he ghosts me. It surprises me, since he’s always been honest and (too) direct, no matter how harsh the truth was. I wasn’t sad because of his gf, but because he cut me off and I felt like I lost a very good friend who took care of me during some very tough times and chronic illness.

I sent him kind of a closure text (I can say exactly what if anyone is curious) and ignored my phone for a whole day due to crazy work hours. When I check it, it wasn’t working anymore, at all. I needed to change my phone, but lost all the data in the last day since the backup had been done earlier. I never knew if he replied. 

I wrote on Facebook that I missed all the texts and that I’m only available on Facebook, but I’ll reach out once I sort out the problem. The ex-FWB “liked” my status. He always “liked” my posts, but stopped doing that since he ghosted me. 

What does he want and what should I do? Regardless of what he might have replied, I wouldn’t have answered. Unless it was something like “let’s talk/Skype”...",14May2020,1
389,Uh so I know this will sound weird but I am a huge anime lover and after binging Seven deadly sins I couldn't bring myself to do anything.  My emotions are twisted and weird.  I got so emotionally invested and (spoiler) &gt;!Escanor dies and Meliodas has a child with Elizabeth!&lt; and because of this it just felt so devastating that the series was ending after it made its start back in 2014.  I dont want to sound like a baby but I cried a lot while watching it and got to hooked into it that when it suddenly ended I just had no clue how to feel.  I literally stay up all night just thinking of it.  If anybody has advice it would be very much appreciated.  Please and thank you.

391,"Alright...this is a doozy and obviously I know the obvious ""its karma"" and ""you get what you give"" answers so please, just advice. 

I was recently married when i created with this woman. Do I love my wife? I don't know tbh. Im not sure i ever did and I know I shouldn't have married her. I know that. Anyway, I start an affair with this woman but I say I can't do it and break things off. She starts dating another person straight away (who she had dated before me) which hurts after 3 days my mistress calls me and begs for me so I say yes and we officially become a couple. I left my wife. 

So me and my mistress are together and she is saying she wants to talk to the now two time ex. I say okay but let's do it right, do it with me ect, she changes her mind and what's nothing to do with the ex. Great. Then the day comes where I receive the wrong text. The text that was meant for the ex about planning to lie to me and meet up. I ask her about it and she said it was just to get closure and she wanted to work the drama out first without involving me then involve me once It was sorted. 

Everything blows up. I hated that I was lied to. I know, hypercritical but I hated it and found i now couldn't trust her. The one thing I said was if she cut the ex off completely and we can go forward. She can't do it and we break up again and again she is publicly with the ex again within a week.

A week later again she calls me and tells me she misses me, this time I blow up go off my Nana at her and she freaks out. After hours of talking we decide we can't be out of each other's lives (toxic i know) and now we start the next affair. This time with her in the relationship. 

Here we are the two of us sneaking around again. But here is where the doozy starts. I've loaned her about $300 this week, we've had sex, we've been so lovey dovey....then about an hour ago I find out for a month before we broke up she had been sleeping with the ex that she is now dating. 

I want to blow her world up. She's played me from the start, she's been playing the ex, she has lied and manipulated everyone in her life and I just want to see her world burn. 

Should I walk away and cut my losses or should I stay and blow everything up? We have pictures, conversations, i know everything about her, i even have a recording of her saying she loves me more than the ex and that I am the best sex she's ever had. My love is gone. I'm not sad, I'm not even angry. I feel tense and anxious.

392,"Hi, I'm male, 20 years old, and my best friend is female, 20 years old.

We haven't been talking a lot since quarantine started and I'm having problems with the distance but it doesn't bother her. 

Today, I was trying to talk to her all day but making sure I wasnt spamming her. She didnt respond until much later in the night saying she had fallen asleep after work and apologized. I was still a bit mad but I could understand that. She went back to bed a few minutes later and I reached out to another friend to play some games online. 

In doing so, I saw that she had been playing the same game during the time she said she was sleeping. I've been really hurt by friends who've done this to me in the past and she knows this. I feel really betrayed because she knows that I honor honesty above anything else.

393,"This is might be long so I'm sorry. But my family is nuts. I have my parents who's relationship I can't explain besides too poor to leave reach other but doesn't fight Infront of the kids but ones an alcoholic and the other is addicted to pills. None are violent just my dad can get verbally aggressive. My siblings are a 21 year old half sister. I'm the second oldest and my younger siblings are my 2 younger sisters and my even younger 2 younger brothers. I'm 19 and one my sister just below me lives with me and my fiance. But we always grew up very poor and had some VERY VERY rought times. Such rough times that phones ringing or especially doors knocking send me into a panic attack cause I think it's either the cops or child protective services. We never had a clean home and only my dad worked. I grew up with epilepsy and aneurysms so I couldn't act and play like a normal kid and when my older sister ran off to her friends she was never around to help out or when she was she would hide in her room. So I grew up very quickly and due to medical reasons had to drop some of my biggest dreams and ended up dropping out of highschool before graduation to help raise my siblings. But now that am on my own with my fiance (tho I'm taking care of my sister) my parents have taken advantage of my fiance and my kindness. And has stolen over 5 thousand dollars from my fiance's credit card and iv decided over everything that has happened I shouldn't have a relationship with them as of right now but I don't know how to tell them without the worry they might commit suicide or get violent (both realistic reactions I expect as iv lived with them almost all my life.) But I won't know how to tell them I need distance or to say HEY YOU FUCKED UP and let them know it. My fiance has been very forgiving though they don't deserve it. And I just don't know how to approach this. I'm so scared of their reactions. We're even eloping because my parents send me into a panic attack (that can turn into a seizure) I just don't know how to approach this. Im really sorry and anything is helpful. 
P.S I don't want to ghost them because they won't stop talking asking to hang out with my fiance and I like they didn't steal from us. Thank you I'm really sorry.",14May2020,1
394,"I (M17) dated this girl (18), my first girlfriend, and her first boyfriend, for about 10 months before my mental health started declining pretty quickly. She was amazing, we never argued once, she loved me for who I was and I loved her, but at the time, I didn't know what to do, panicked and broke up with her. This was after some back and forth where I tried to leave but she wouldn't let me, and I wouldn't leave because I didn't want to but felt like I needed to. Eventually after breaking up finally, while in the car talking she kissed me on lips before she left. I eventually got on meds for depression and anxiety about 2 weeks later, which she knew about, and asked her to give me another chance. She said yes, but said shed need to think about it but we continued to talk pretty frequently throughout that. A couple of days in some things happened and I realized that I really just couldn't be in a relationship and told her this. She responded well, told me that she'd been trying to tell me that I need to work on myself and that we could be friends with no communication. I really appreciate having her in my life in any way although I never wanted for any of this to happen and am still in love with her. This was about 2 months ago and while I know that I shouldn't have a texted her telling her I loved her and more, asked if I could get one more chance. She said that she was happy with the time we had together but thought it'd be best if we were friends, and that we both should focus on ourselves.

What makes matters worse, I cannot remember what she was saying to me, nothing about the topic or even what I was responding with.

398,"Hi! I am a very sensitive person and refrain from speaking unless I have to for an assignment or must voice my needs. I am moderately shy when it comes to people I do not know and have minor anxiety in public situations which is only human I think. Some context: when I was in 9th grade in high school I applied to be on my school's student council and I encouraged myself to step outside of my comfort zone and I wrote and delivered a serious speech about my experience relating to being selected. Being a freshman I had no idea about who/what would help someone win a position but I was serious which is how I tend to be at school, being anxious and nervous. I am not sure how many votes I received but I did not win and of course, I was disappointed and wondering what I could have done differently. The student who did win was one of my peers who was very outgoing, opposite of how I come off at school. They performed a funny performance rather than a formal speech like mine. When I am in a comfortable environment, like with my family, I am the same. 

I was the type of kid who aspired to do well academically because I saw it as a way to be independent and I wanted to escape some of my personal and family life issues. I am very emotional and have been recently falling behind in my studies from being a very good student for the majority of high school up until this year, trying my best even when I failed. I try very hard and if I dedicate myself to trying to become the valedictorian of my graduating class it would be disappointing if I did not get it because it would be a confirmation that I never did belong and no one ever liked me, I feel this way because I have a couple of friends who I consider to be acquaintances because I do not let them in and only communicate to them in school, even now we have very limited conversations because I just can't bring myself to let them in after I have been hurt many times by others. A part of me does not want to even go to my graduation because I do not want to see my peers.

I am heavily involved in my school community, have completed many volunteer hours and have good grades. But when it comes to school, I feel as though I might come across as standoffish and possibly arrogant because of my anxiety and because I don't really talk about anything other than school because I don't feel comfortable mentioning my interests and opening myself up for hate. I would dare say that I might even come off as a 'Paris Geller' intense type. However, I try my best to be open and to the people who do know me at school and I am kind and funny. I always dreamed of being the valedictorian of my graduating class as a kid and giving a speech and taking calculus (which I am, but it gets hard haha). Now that I am here, I am wondering whether I should go ahead and take the risk and self-nominate and get 2 teacher references (this is the process at my school if you want to be the valedictorian). I have lately been not submitting my assignments because I have been getting in my own head and worrying about other things (basically an existential crisis). Do you think I should do it, or even have a chance of winning? Do you have any ideas how can I win if that is even possible? My brother is very supportive and tells me to go ahead with it because there is nothing I really have to lose because of quarantine but I would be sad lol. Thank you for any help and I am sorry that this got so long! I feel like the girl in Mean Girls who wanted to bake a cake of rainbows haha.",14May2020,1

401,"Hello Everyone, Sorry if this is not the right subreddit but:

Long story short I had a online friend who had a bunch of mental health issues, inc anxiety and depression, I my self live with both disorders so I understand what it takes to live with this day to day.  


I tried to advice this guy as much as i could, give him someone to talk do and just in general tried to get him back on track again, But it seemed he never followed my advice of if he did it wouldn't be 100% effort and was kind of one sided(Never really took interest in how i was doing or what i was doing or if he did he would just repeat my opinion ) I mean overall he was a nice enough guy we got along well and had a good laugh, but its just when he got down he would put all his negative energy &amp; problems on me. I just tried to advice him in what to do and how to go about problems. Which is more or less what  i did since we started our friendship little over a year ago. But weather or not he followed my advice I don't know but I have a feeling he did not, I'm the type of person to give people really good advice when it comes to mental health etc, but i really feel this guy made minimal effort. Ik his problems are not mine but i cant but feel bad if something was to happen to him. But i'm sorta of just sick of hearing his problems and issues if he puts no effort in to sort them, so i decided to end our friendship earlier today.  Like earlier in the convo he said he tries to follow my advice but ""I'm not good enough"" I replied: ""Thats the attitude i'm getting fed up of"" His reply:""You make me feel that way tho"" So i was kinda like ... after all the advice i gave.  
I'm pretty sure if you was me you'd be like ... too  


I did say a few times before we ended our friendship that he needs to get a professional and he can only help him self as much as the advice i give, But I have never met this person  before in fact he doesnt even live in my country XD I have no problem deleting people of my friendslist (I've spent years socializing with people online and had no issue never talking to them ever again) but I would feel terrible if something was to happen to him.Ik while his relationship may not be good but he lives with his parents so at least he doesn't live alone(We are both around the same age) :) He kind of looks up to me and i feel like i have done something terrible. that could have a impact on his life, Like what if i was the only chance this guy had of talking to someone and sorting his head out But i hope someone can understand why I ended our friendship.

403,"About two months ago, I had finally gained up the courage to break up with my ex. We’ll call him Aidan. 

We dated for about 4 months, and throughout those four months, I noticed how much he’d put me down when it came to my emotions. I’ve been dealing with anxiety for as long as I can remember, and it got worse while being with him. Each time I would express my concerns and open up about how I was feeling, it would turn into him invalidating me, ultimately causing me to shut him out when it came to my feelings. 

I knew it shouldn’t have been that way, but I always hoped things would get better. It wasn’t until I noticed how manipulative he would get and even talk down on me. 

A month before we broke up, it was around my birthday. An ex of mine (we’ll call him David) messaged me with birthday wishes. We hadn’t ended on bad terms and we were still prettt friendy, though I hadn’t spoken to him the entirety of that current relationship as there was no need to. Aidan saw the message (not like I was hiding it as I was just responding with a quick and polite thank you), and reasonably questioned it. I quickly reassured him that it was just a simple happy birthday, a quick how are you, and end of story. Later that night, he messaged me in such a degrading tone, saying “Shame on you” “How dare you betray my trust” and it got overwhelming and I just had nothing left to say. I felt so stuck between letting out all these pent up emotions I have from him shutting me out, but I felt so helpless. He blocked me that night (which is something he would constantly do during our relationship when I did something he didnt agree with, like going to a party or posting a video/picture he didnt like), and I thought it was the end of that. 

A few days later, he messaged me saying he still thinks about his ex and messaged her apologizing for the way things worked out between them and wanted to rebuild a friendship, and he was asking for my advice. It immediately felt like I was punched in the gut. I was so hurt yet felt so numb, as this was another one of his tricks as to him getting back at me for something that wasn’t/ shouldn’t have been an issue, but it hit ten times worse. 

His ex has always been an underlying issue in our relationship. He would want me to get piercings like she did, dress the way she did, and compared / confused me to her a lot. It made me feel as though he still wasnt over her. Especially since they had broken up a week before him and I had met. 

Of course, there’s no problem with still having feelings for an ex, but I felt as though it wasn’t fair to me that it started to hurt and effect me as well. For example, he once cried on my shoulder about her, retelling events and stories of their relationship and her family. He brought me to places he took her, showed me a youtube video she was in. It was almost like he was using me as a means to get over her, seeking for advice from the wrong person in a sense. 

This began making me question my feelings for him and of course brought up memories of my ex. Like I mentioned before, I hadn’t spoken David pretty much since we broke up about 7 months before my relationship ended with Aidan. Though the more Aidan brought up his ex, I thought about David as well to the point where I found myself crying about a memory that popped into my head on Aidan’s couch. When he asked what was wrong, I told him I just had a thought about someone from my past, and he immediately guessed David, and asked me to leave. I was so hurt and confused as I had comforted him when he had done the same, except didnt spare me the details. 

David and I had gotten back into touch after I broke up with Aidan, and we rekindled our friendship, had a lot of talks about our past, and eventually ended up getting back together. Our relationship had ended due to it being long distance, and we both weren’t in the financial position to keep travelling, though now that we’re both able to provide for ourselves, its made it easier. 

On the surface, it looks as though I left Aidan for David, and I don’t know how to express its not at all what happened. I left Aidan for his manipulative behavior. I told him that and how I didn’t want to deal with it anymore because I, and nobody else, deserves it. 

He’s blocked me on everything, though my friends still present to me ways he posts about making me look like the bad guy in the sense that I dumped him for no reason, and they reassure me that its him seeking validation and approval to compensate for his own insecurities (nothing new), but its really taken a toll on me. 

I’m much happier now in my new relationship, I’ve reconnected with people Aidan has forced me to cut ties from, and I felt my mental health improve. Though I can’t help but feel frustrated knowing he’s gotten so many people to view me as someone who didn’t care for him when I gave him so much of myself to the point where I lost respect for myself. Its been troubling me the past few days because I just feel as though it’s unfair. 

I’m not too sure how to get my mind off of it. I’m glad he’s out of my life, but it seems as though he finds indirect ways to plant himself in it by twisting stories to my friends who know exactly what happened. 

Sorry if this is childish or stupid but its just really been bugging me .-.",14May2020,1
404,"I've posted this once before, if you wanna read it here's the link https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice so as a 13 year old I'm scared. But I will clarify things. My grandma is NOT very old, she's in her early 60's and retired last year. Do NOT simply joke around about her cat problem. I will go off on a huge rant if i see ONE COMMENT talking only about her cats and how she needs to get them under control. If you don't want to read the other post I'll give a brief summary.

My grandma basically told me she wants to die and soon but made it sound really 'innocent'. She told me this when we were alone at her house. No one but me and reddit knows. I am scared because i don't know if she understands what she said. I'm hurt because if she did she said it in the most cheerful way, almost like a I'm going on vacation to here some day, hope its soon!' Tone. I don't want to tell my mom, and she's almost never home anyways. I don't want to tell my step dad (her son) because a: his dad died last year and b: we aren't close so i don't think either of us are comfortable with a deep conversation. Yes. My grandma is stressed because she keeps taking in strays and one had 5 kittens so she currently has 12 cats. 

Like i said, NO CAT JOKES. I'm so sick of them even simply because they were over half my comments on the last post. I'm genuinely disgusted that when I write an entire post about my grandma possibly confessing her being suicidal, and i make ONE comment about her being stressed and having 12 cats and people immediately think thats the bigger issue.

Anyways, during the date, at several times, he said ""I like you"" while I was talking. Like when he'd realise that we have things in common and then he'd say ""I really like you"" while patting/touching/holding my shoulder.

Would a guy lie about this just to get laid? Cuz tbh I really liked him too, I felt a connection and there was chemistry but it's a shame he is leaving soon and I dont wanna just hook up. He also texted me later that day that ""not gonna lie I kinda felt like kissing you at one point😂"" which we just had a laugh about, like i made a joke out of it etc. Then we started talking about meeting again for drinks cuz we both like drinking hahah.

So what kinda guy does he sound like? A player? Just wanna hook up? Or a nice guy who might still want smthg serious even if only until July...?",14May2020,1

409,"I just found out I’m pregnant, I am 19 and my boyfriend of one year is 20. I’m on birth control and take it pretty responsibly so I never saw this coming. My boyfriend and I are both in school, while I am taking it slow and not on any certain career track, he is about to move for his Bachelors and then will be going to law school. I do not feel ready to have a baby (and while I am pro-choice) I don’t want to have an abortion because it feels wrong. And as far as adoption goes, I genuinely think if I go through with the pregnancy I would not be able to give up the baby. I am stuck between making two choices I don’t want to make. I want children in the future and if it were the right time in my life I would be crying happy tears for this pregnancy but right now I don’t know if I could do it and do a good job. I am not only concerned for my own future if I were to have a child, but also concerned for the life I would be bringing that child into. I’m a server and have practically no savings, and my boyfriend works for $10 an hour and will be moving and going to school. I’ll be moving with him when my lease is up in 8 months.

If that makes sense. But then I said “What wrong idea? Tlak to me man” we are friends and I have a crush on him. 
I’m getting over him but I just have so many questions and it would be nice if you guys could help me out. So then he said “Like I didn’t want people to know that I liked you and all/ which I did of course, but I just lost the feeling. That’s what I thought.”  He basically told me? But I just don’t understand why he didn’t want people to know he had a damn crush. Like it’s normal :/ he never acted on his crush wirh me so it left us nowhere but just he loosing feels and me having them. We argue a lot now....don’t know what to do.

I was reading a old argument we had and he said a lot of things, my feelings were actually hurt and I started crying. we had a argument (this arguing is really childish and dumb. I know. We need to grow up. And start being nicer to eachother)  the other day and he apologized. I didn’t forgive him, I’m still upset and disappointed that it got to this level of toxicity. It does seem like he still wants to b in my life, he cause he keeps saying he wants to be my friend, he’s like let’s be friends pls, i want to be your friend, I just wanna be friends... 

Butttt my friends say he’s only having me hang for me to be the backburner. But I’m not sure for what. Since he doenst interact with me at all unless I text first. Like what does he want with me?? I even asked him why does he want to be my friend? And he did t answer. I told him to give me 5 reasons why He wants to be friends with me and he says it’s too much work

418,"I’m 18, but I have a 4 toddler aged half siblings from my dad. From oldest to youngest, I will refer to them as G, E, C, and T. They are 4, 3, 1.5, and 1 years old respectively. Recently G has been acting out a ton, throwing fits and not listening to her mom. However, my dad never really punishes her. He simply threatens to take away a toy or something but never goes through with it. The bigger issue though is that he will let her get away with things and then immediately after will get mad at the other kids for doing the same thing. The other night at dinner, G was stacking her watermelon cubes into a tower and my dad said nothing, but then E began to do it too and he yelled at her for playing with her food while allowing G to do it right in front of him. This is just one example of how he favors G but it is not the only one. This happens constantly. He gives zero positive attention to anyone but G unless he’s playing with them by throwing them in the air and catching them. Their mom, myself, and my other sister who is 13 have all tried to tell him this is wrong, but he gets furious and begins telling us he’s trying to teach them the world isn’t fair. I worry that because their brains are physically not developed enough to understand this concept, it will permanently damage them mentally. E has started acting out by hitting in order to get attention from him. I do not know what to do. When I tried telling him that because they all are so close in age, they should be treated almost the same by him, but he literally used the reason that because he obviously doesn’t treat me and T the same (a 17 year age difference) he shouldn’t treat G and E the same (less than a one year difference). I don’t know how to make him understand what he’s doing to them. Nobody can convince him. I am moving away for college this summer, and I’m scared of what my dads behavior will do to them as they age. I can tell their mom is already considering leaving that house, and she’s the only person who is there all the time to give them positive attention and treat them equally.

okay i'll label off the paragraphs so you can skip them if you'd like but basically i'm just gonna tell you about us so you can kinda get a feel about why i'm so conflicted so strap in for this odd story if you decide to read all the way-&gt;

The Background Story--&gt;                                             

so it starts 2 yrs ago.. yes .. two years ago (why am i holding on you may ask? i wish i knew.) but anyways there was this guy let's call him nate. so nate and i met through friends and it took a bit of a escalation.. he is 2 yrs older so at the time i was a freshman and he was a junior. we started to talk for a little and right off the bat i felt this chemistry and the time to meet finally came. we made plans to get together and that day he picks me up with a friend actually his best friend who actually plays a big roll into the very conflicted times in our time together but i won't get into that (or maybe i will well see where my minds takes the rant) but anyways we hang out and when i tell you there was just something about him that felt so right. i mean that feeling i got is intense i mean it feels like i'm having a full on anxiety attack anytime he's around or talks to me and in that moment that very first day i met him it felt unreal it felt like i known him my whole life not one awkward moment. which led us to the moment i regret to this day.. we ended up well i'm sure you know what i'm gonna say and honestly my little virgin self was now only little self if you know what i mean.. i'm not gonna say i totally regret it because it was both our firsts and honestly the feeling i get just typing this i know i coudlnt see it being anyone else i mean i'm the super awkward don't know how to ""hookup culture"" but  i felt so comfortable and that brings me to this part where that seemed to be all we did. i mean we'd go atleast 2-3 rounds everyyy time we hung out and i was always there late at night like we never really hung out during the day but sometimes we would.. seems horrible i know and seems like he was using me as well but it was deeper than that i know that for a fact i mean it was exclusive and we had some great moments and i knew he liked me but it never got labeled. 
but as time went on like fast forward 3-4 months things started to drop. i mean he would straight up ghost me for weeks it went from him apologizing for obombing or caring why i would to being GHOSTED. honestly the most hurtful things someone could do . but he would come back get what he wanted then do it again but it was also easy to catch his attention and make him jealous which is what it started to be like. not healthy i know. but that's what is was and it would work i knew i had him wrapped around my finger but he also knew i was wrapped around his even more. 

Some What Getting To The Point--&gt;.

                           so anyways it basically turned into this whole thing where he'd beg for me then end up leaving me to coming back and blah blah leaving me traumatized and heartbroken for 1/1n a half years basically(still kinda to this day) but finally end of the school year that changed i mean some shit went down and we kinda just grew apart i mean i ended up finding someone else for a bit and he did his own thing. but the thing is that was all 2yrs ago and to this day were still apart of eachothers life and we still have that weird connection and although he's still temporary i still get a bit sick to my stomach when i think about him. and we grew up a since then and we talked it through and things are good and casual between us. which leds us to now-&gt; 

The Point To The Point (juciy part kinda)--&gt;                  

so the second last time we saw eachother he straight lied to me about talking to someone and once we finally got back to my house saying our goodbyes he hits me with a KISS!okay.. a kiss!goodbye! and a ""next time"" talk .. like pardon me and on the car ride to the spot we were going he said some fishy things that added up to me and by that point i was just ready to leave but i had to go through with our plans and so i hit him with ""next time? there's no next time bc your talking to _____"" may i say i felt so bad ass as i'm about to slam his car door i normally avoid conflict but i wasn't having it. but as i do he of course begs for me to come back in the car and i did .. but only because i wanted the information. and i got it .. turns out his story was he was banging this chick for two weeks and that it meant nothing also may i mention she was in a relationship while it took place.. so i was hoping it meant nothing and he went on about how he doesn't like her even called her a ""bit of a hoe"" it was a convincing speech i must say.. till it got out and he was texting me freaking out saying ""he didn't want it to end yet"" i was like SIR? what do you mean ""you don't want it to end"" I DIDNT EVEN KNOW IT STARTED!!! and then proceeded to give me a plan just as i thought i was possibly getting a apology for being LIED TO it was just a plan for if ____ blank girl texts me asking what happened .. ""i picked u up but then 10 mins later dropped you back off because i realized it was wrong and we didn't do anything"" i obombed of course and then blocked him too but ended up unblocking when he threatened to throw out the bra he had of mine at school the next day(he was actually hurt by the fact i did that and oops i kinda enjoyed that). we hooked up on more time and again he claimed they were nothing at all when i asked.. they've been dating now for like 5-6 months ish not to sure 


SOOO close to The Point--&gt;                                           

so fast forward to like little
more than 2 weeks ago i decided to snap him. we haven't talked in a hot minute so i was curious to see what he was up to these days. We started snapping talking a bit but then that day he said he needed some one to talk to and if he can talk to me and of course i said yes and he goes on to tell me how he wants to break up with his girlfriend and that he just doesn't feel the same way about her anymore . Now normally (because he came to me about a girl before) i would say to not give up and go for it but it kinda felt wrong to say that when it's clearly not a good situation although it also felt wrong telling him to break up with her but i mean he's gonna hurt himself and especially her in the long run so we had a nice conversation about that and gave him some food advice. now fast forward a day or 2 and he tells me HE MISSED ME. i just don't know how to feel about that you know.. because i obviously miss him too but like what does he mean?!? like he misses me in a friendly way or a romantic way!? like that threw me right off.  also fast forward few days after we happen to get a bit freaky and i feel terrible and i even told him i apologize because he's in a relationship but he went on to say that he basically has a soft spot for me and that he can't resist me. and we've been snapping ever since which is kinda weird because he would normally obomb by now. but also as of lately he's been leaving me on delivered for like hourss (which i also do to him but that would be from night time to afternoon bc i sleep all day due to quarantine) but it seeems like it's when _____ is there he won't snap me as much ... and when she's not i get more snaps than i normally do. He's been with her like every day for some days now and i don't get it because he told me he didn't want to be with her .. and i'm not mad or upset i'm just confused and i also don't mind this few snap thing bc it helps me distant and not depend on him for feeling something.. because i really don't feel much anymore and he's the only one who can make me feel. 

YAY The Point! --&gt; 

so i know it's been a lot but i basically just want some advice because i have so many questions for him and the main one is knowing if he feels that feeling too or if it's just me. i also just want to catch up i mean i barely even know him anymore. but should i risk like trying to have the conversation and how would i even HAVE that conversation. i mean how do i express how i feel plus being scared i could scare him away bc i feel like it's so easy for that to happen. im scared to be rejected by him and then not get the proper closure. like i want to move on from this and understand things and grow a better friendlier relationship. is that normal and something i should do? and how can i do it? what should i say or how can i start that off? i know i should back off romantically with him being taken and all and i already feel terrible but i know my overall intentions and it's not to date him plus i don't think he ever would date me. i just need some advice..",14May2020,1

430,"Firstly I totally understand no one knows what it going on with the COVID situation, I am just hoping people over in the US might be able to offer their own advice. 

I am from the UK and have been going over to Florida once a year to watch the Bucs play (Go Bucs), but obviously this year is looking unlikely. I can now book flights and a hotel with British Airways to go for 8 nights on November 22nd. This only requires a £350 deposit for two of us, the rest payable 2 weeks before departure. 

I guess my question is, how likely does everyone think UK nationals will be allowed in the US by November? I understand there will most likely not be a vaccine available by this point, and would that be a dealbreaker, do we all think Trump will let people in without a vaccine? The second point is do we think NFL games will actually have crowds? This isnt too big of a deal as I can just book the tickets later to ensure no problems with that. 

So basically I can book the trip only paying £350 deposit, If we are not allowed in by Trump then I will be refunded the £350 into travel vouchers, which is fine. Am I being too optimistic? Is it a good idea with how cheap prices are?? 

Any advice appreciated :)",14May2020,1
431,"I live in a flat in a European city, the building is very old and I've been here for a year.  
I'm a 30 year old adult. I've never had issues with roommates/neighbours, ever. In fact, I've only had positive experiences, everyone has loved living with me.  
When I moved in, the person in the top flat asked that everything be quiet. I like a quiet place too, I thought that was ok.

     
I am generally an extremely quiet person -I always watch things with headphones or extremely low volume and subtitles, I never play music out loud.   
I don't sing, I don't dance, I never have parties, I've had two friends over for dinner once.   
I tread lightly, wear socks, etc. I don't do anything unreasonable. No fights, no screaming, no regular sex sounds (I go to my partner's place).   


Since the coronavirus pandemic hit, I've taken it quite seriously and stayed inside (in contrast to most people in this country), conducting as much work online as I can. That has involved daytime conferences about twice a week or less, usually between 11am and 5/6pm, for maximum three hours at a time but usually shorter.  
I live abroad from my home country, so my only contact with family and friends is online, and my closest friends from here live in other cities, so it's all online.      
I usually call them in the evening, around 7pm, or during the day sometimes. Once in a while, I have a drink with one or two friends online around 9-11pm. Only speaking, in low voices, nothing crazy. It's happened less than once a fortnight since quarantine, so maybe 3/4 times in total.    


It turns out the neighbour wants **total** silence, particularly after 9pm. There was aggressive banging on my floor the most recent time I was talking to two friends at 10:30pm. I hadn't spoken to both of them in over two weeks, but I kept it down, and spoke in an almost whisper with the volume low.    
But the complaints from the neighbour have extended to all sorts of noise -it seems they would rather be living in the countryside with no animals or other humans around.    
They've also complained about my cooking smells -including the smell of baking bread and cookies, despite my use of the extractor fan, and keeping the window open and the kitchen door closed while doing any cooking (and it honestly is just normal cooking, no burning or anything too offensive). That made me uncomfortable as normal cooking smells are not a civil disturbance, and I have a right to live my life normally.  


I'm not sure how to deal with this. We've spoken before (when I had the two friends over) and they acknowledged that I was mostly completely quiet.   
I made a point that if I have a conversation in the evening once in a blue moon (which again has never extended past 11:30pm/12am) it should be ok.    
I've even baked cookies once (when nothing was wrong) in an attempt to foster good relations.  
I feel like I'm walking on eggshells and still not doing the right thing.    
I'm making an effort and meeting them more than halfway, but there doesn't seem to be any understanding on their part that this isn't an constant noise issue, and that we're living in strange times so a little lenience every now and then wouldn't go astray.  
This person doesn't own the building, so I know that technically there isn't much that could go wrong, but I would still prefer not to receive angry texts or knocking on my ceiling/door.    
As far as I know, they have been a tenant here for quite a while, so I'm sure they have an established relationship with the landlord. I have only had positive interactions with the landlord too, but I would rather not have them involved for such a petty issue.  
Moving right now is not an option, and anyway, I like living here otherwise.   
This isn't an issue for most of the time, but when it is, they really make it a problem.    
Sorry this is a bit of a rant, but any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.",14May2020,1

434,"I live with my roommate 6+ months (military barracks) and he’s overall a really good roommate but sometimes he makes clutter and I either clean up after him or yell at him like a child. A while ago I noticed him making a “scratching” noice here or there in the night or morning and thought nothing of it because obviously I’m sleeping literally 5 feet away from him even though my back is to him &amp; once I asked him what the sound was and he said he’s scratching his stomach. He’s a bit hairy so I though nothing of it. I occasionally catch him being a boy in his simplest form scratching his nuts in his underwear with his legs wide open &amp; make fun of him for having crabs or some other std/sti. I’m openly bisexual and he’s straight (talking about gay men or sex in general makes him uncomfortable so I don’t discuss those things with him) &amp; he makes that clear so I respect his boundaries as someone he lives with. I think it’s important because it’s not fair to live with someone who makes you uncomfortable you know. recently, When we first wake up in the mornings I catch him masterbating in his bed under the covers, it’s kink of quiet but noticeable given there’s only two of us and no other noise in the early mornings. My assumption is he thinks I’m still sleep &amp; his eyes are closed as he’s going at it vigorously sometimes biting his lip, kind of like he’s still sleeping or in a trans like state. Once I’ve rolled over, looking in disbelief and mild humor and says “you having fun there bud” &amp; he stopped. I’m a very straightforward person but we haven’t discussed it because I think he’s too embarrassed and he’s not very confrontational. I’m not attracted to him at all but It also kind of turns me on to watch him pleasure himself as a way to start my morning, even if he’s half sleep oblivious to me being a light sleeper.

Its a built in one thats placed on the ceiling and roof. What happens is that it drips water onto the floor and at some point it stops shooting cool air.. It was a night mare last year. Idk why we waited it out instead of fixiing the situation then. Actually I think mostly it was because we had no clue what to do.

Whats the least expensive solution to this problem? We’d like to do something about it before the super hot days come.",14May2020,1
436,"This covid crisis is flipping my life upside down.  -- living in denver as a currently WFH software developer -- My lease ended april 15th, and I've managed to get some extensions.   


But it has me feeling like I want to move. Is it reckless to relocate when you live alone to a town 20 minutes away during covid? It's definitely scary......  


I almost purchased a house a few weeks back until I realized that was incredibly risky and I definitely shouldn't do that right now with so many future unknowns for jobs and stuff.

I found myself looking at apartments in Golden, an AWESOME nearby town in the foothills.  I've always daydreamed about living here. Something about living in the foothills, with close access to everything, and outdoorsy people like myself all around me....  I also have friends around there! All within 10 minute driving distance!

And suddenly I found myself putting a deposit down on one! WFH, no commute, this seems like the perfect chance to try! I tried to imagine myself where I want to be when this virus dissopates, and golden felt like a really cool place to try out. 

But it's scary, and when will this virus dissopate.... should I wait another month or 2 or 6? I am scared I'll feel alone -- mostly and especially due to covid right now. 

While only 20 minutes away from where I live now, the impulsive last minute porch/park hangs with my current friends will seem to be a bit more effort suddenly.  Not to mention moving during covid may be ethically questionable (altho move in date will be may 25th, who know what could change?)  

How do I process this to be sure I will be ok? I can still bail on my lease and get my deposit if notified within 72 hours. (friday)",14May2020,1
438,"I'm 17f

a breakdown of all of my friendships would look something like this

1. person likes my ""personality""
2. we become friends 
3. we hang out outside of school 
4. I say or do something ( I never realise at the time that said thing was wrong)
5. they leave

in the past year I'd say I've been through this cycle 10 times. it breaks my heart everytime. I've never been good at keeping friends. they like my charisma at first but once the true layers of my personality show they hate me. word gets around of course making it harder to make friends. 


I'm generally disliked. people's parents keep them away from me because of ""bad vibes"" whatever that means. I've read countless articles on how to be a good person and how to keep friends. I never set out to hurt anyone but nothing is working. at this point I've stopped trying to make friends. and allow them to come to me. keep my distance. and keep my mouth shut.

441,"I apologise if the title is a bit misleading.

18 months ago my wife and I separated. Have two wonderful children. A mutual decision and amicable initially.

I moved in with my parents and spent 50% of the week at the house with my children (I’d be with them during the day, put them to bed and get there early the next morning. I wouldn’t sleep at the house.) The long term plan was always to sell the house and split equity 60/40 which would give us both more than enough to get a home each. Whilst being at my parents wasn’t ideal, it was going okay and I treasured every moment with my boys.

This March our house went on the market and attracted a lot of interest. Then covid hit. Understandably, the house market has frozen. 

I have moved out of my parents as I don’t want to put them at risk but I can’t  stay at the house we jointly own as my ex had informed universal credit and the council we’ve separated. She gets some benefits and cheaper bills etc It isn’t feasibly to move back in either as unfortunately the mutual break up has become toxic.

I don’t know where to go or what to do- my friends have all got their own families so I can’t stay there and I have no other family myself. I’ve looked at house shares but it isn’t financially viable and would put me and my children at risk as I’d come into contact with so many other people.

444,"I was the type of kid who aspired to do well academically because I saw it as a way to be independent and I wanted to escape some of my personal and family life issues. I am very emotional and have been recently falling behind in my studies from being a very good student for the majority of high school up until this year, trying my best even when I failed. I try very hard and if I dedicate myself to trying to become the valedictorian of my graduating class it would be disappointing if I did not get it because it would be a confirmation that I never did belong and no one ever liked me, I feel this way because I have a couple of friends who I consider to be acquaintances because I do not let them in and only communicate to them in school, even now we have very limited conversations because I just can't bring myself to let them in after I have been hurt many times by others. A part of me does not want to even go to my graduation because I do not want to see my peers.

I am heavily involved in my school community, have completed many volunteer hours and have good grades. But when it comes to school, I feel as though I might come across as standoffish and possibly arrogant because of my anxiety and because I don't really talk about anything other than school because I don't feel comfortable mentioning my interests and opening myself up for hate. I would dare say that I might even come off as a 'Paris Geller' intense type. However, I try my best to be open and to the people who do know me at school, I am kind and funny. I always dreamed of being the valedictorian of my graduating class as a kid and giving a speech and taking calculus (which I am, but it gets hard haha).

Do you think I should do it, or even have a chance of winning? Do you have any ideas how can I win if that is even possible?

445,"First off I am really new to reddit and this is my first post so apologizes if I mess up.
For the sake of simplicity let use the names Kate(19) and Julia(19) for the people I am going to talk about.
Also sorry if this gets stretched out.
I am 20y/o Male with severe ADHD and only found out about it recently. I dont have much of a connection with my family or many friends IRL. Since I was young I always moved from place to place due to my father's job which led me develop an introverted personality. Despite a lot of childhood trauma I used to be a cheerful child and loved making people (that I was comfortable with) laugh with my dumb antics. I even dated a girl when I was 16 but both her(18) and my best friend at the time(17) were killed in an accident around my 17th birthday. It was following that my life started going down hill. I started using substances and hooking up with random woman to take the pain away until a cousin of mine who was very close to me found out and took me to rehab after around a year since the accident. Both my parents are till this time are unaware of anything that happened due to them never really being at home or even in the same country as me.
Years since I slowly got over the accident but I kept a habit of still hooking up with woman because I still had a slight sense of emptiness that I tried to fill but never could. I also became a very private person  and used a different persona whenever I wasnt alone. 
I was a huge gamer and still am. I met someone in an online game who was  ,say, Kate. I added her after playing with her and she was an amazing person and also lived in the same city as me. After months of pressuring me into meeting her I caved and met her. Ngl I has fun. She was super fun to hang out with and chill with and i felt we hit it off quite well. But as with all others I never truly felt completely myself with her. I eventually met her friend Julia and we began talking. After a very long time I felt I could be myself around her and felt as if she and I both had the same type of mindset as well. I felt a connection. But it was very short lived. I was playing with julia and had to go afk to take an important call and as a result we lost the game but by the time I got back she had left the vc and refused to pick any calls nor reply to any of my messages saying sorry. She had done something similar before to someone else and I figured she needed time as she always does but even with time when she came back and started talking I felt her behavior was really different and really distant. She and I eventually stopped talking to the point I felt she only talked to me when she needed to. Being distant from her made me realize I felt something for her but I dont have intentions to ask her out even if she was still talking to me because I feel I am too broken to keep her happy but what I really wanted was for her to keep being my friend but whenever I tried talking to her she pretends everything is normal while I can tell it's not. This is killing me on the inside because I would rather have her say I dont like you than keep me in the dark. This along with other things have gotten to me to the point where I have gotten so mentally tired that I am tempted to end it all. I cant see a way out and I tried professional help but nothing is wrong.

451,"When I was 15 or so I started painting houses with a friend of my step dads who owns his own little business. Did that for a few years. 
I’m 24 now and had been living in another state since this March. Moved back to be with family and I told the owner of that business (let’s call him Richard) I needed work and he started blowing up my phone trying to get me to come out to help him on jobs. However the weather has been very obstructive so I only actually started with him the first week of May. 
He has three of his kids working with him, who he pays about 12-15$/hr. The weather has still only allowed us to paint about a house or two a week, and I’ve accumulated a total of 20 hours. This is the issue: He will not pay me. He says he doesn’t have a lot of money right now and that he wants me to keep track of my hours until he can start payroll. So I get fed up and tell him I really need money after a few days, and that I’m not willing to rack my hours waiting for payroll, and then he goes back on what he said before and tells me he IS on payroll and is getting checks every two weeks, and that his kids are too and he “doesn’t even pay his own kids cash.” 
So at work yesterday when he was off on another side of the house, I asked his two kids if they’re on payroll and they both told me he pays them cash. I then talked to my step dad who still works with Richard sometimes, and step dad says “I talked to him a few days ago. He says he’s collecting unemployment and saving all the checks from the jobs he does until he starts payroll.” This was after he told me he needs to put me on payroll to get paid. 
So dude lied to me. I’m being taken advantage of. He gave me 100$ after I insisted he pay me for my hours. He goes “can’t you wait? Do you really need the $ right now?” But that doesn’t even fully compensate me for the hours I have and I REALLY need the money. 
He expects me to go to work with him today but I can’t do it. I know he’s going to get mad and give me a rash and I’m worried he won’t give me the money he owes me. But I can’t work for free.

453,"I've found myself in a weird transitional phase in life where I'm suddenly on a different path than all of my friends and its freaking me out lol.

To break it down I have two main friends groups (A and B)
Group B was my first real friend group back in highschool and we're still pretty close but I stopped hanging out with them as much a few years back when I met group A. 
As time has gone on, I've found myself not really getting along with Group A as much either. I think it's because our common interests aren't what they used to be. I'm very artistic and interested in that sort of thing, and nobody in group A or B is very artistically inclined. Group B supports me and does care when I want to show my art or talk about it, but they don't know about anything other than what I show them. Group A basically doesn't give two flying fucks and generally all think I should pursue more ""realistic"" indevors.
Obviously I want to surround myself with people who share my hobbies/likes/interests but I live in a small town and basically know everyone worth knowing and haven't found more than a few kinderd spirits.

I have love for my friends but I don't see myself being super close with them for the rest of my life because we really are becoming more and more different every day. Granted I know this is a staple of ""growing up"" (I'm 20, so I thought I'd gotten through all the growing up already lol) but it's bugging me. On the one hand I have tons of history with these people and us not being close makes me sad, but on the other hand I need to make new friends and do my own thing so badly its all I think about these days. 

I'm planing to move to the city in a few months and hopefully I'll meet people there that I jive with (I've never had any trouble making friends) but we'll have to see. Anyways if anyone has any advice for me on getting through this weird transitional time in life, I'd love to hear it.",14May2020,1
454,"Ok so, mobile, first time posting. This will be long. I don’t know how to start but here we go....

Background: my father is a collegiate coach who’s placed, and has been ranked third in the country (u.s) in his sport. He has over 10 national champion rings. Suffice to say, he’s a highly accomplished person. But not just in athletics. We joke and call him Dr, Mayor, Pastor, Coach, Dad to get his attention when he’s busy. My mother is the same way, except in a bit of a different aspect. She’s the head athletic trainer at the same college my dad works at, everyone knows of and LOVES this woman, she’s kicked cancers ass, and is highly motivated. Like this woman can do no wrong. Also, side note, they both went D1 in athletics and that’s how they met. Sports are a huge part of our lives. (Also know that my brother is training for the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, and my younger sister, if she keeps playing basketball, she is looking at a D1 scholarship)

Moving Forward: So at the point where I had to go to college, I basically got talked into trying out athletics. I wasn’t sure but bc I’ve grown up around sports being such a massive influence, I decided (with lots of persuasion) that I should continue on. I signed, got a massive scholarship (to a small school). But it went south quickly. To summarize my season; Girls are mean, petty, and very cliquey when they don’t like you. I still feel like I haven’t mentally recovered my confidence. 

Now the Cause: Because of COVID 19, I’ve been forced to move back home. I’ve been uprooted from the life I was building for myself outside of the shadow of my parents and my siblings. I’ve been forced to examine myself, my choices, my future I want. And I’ve realized that I don’t have plans. I don’t have any life goals. I don’t know who I want to be, who I am now, what I want to study, or what is in my 5 year plan at all. 

There’s nothing wrong with that for some people, but for me I’ve always had a plan. Always. And I’ve come to the conclusion through a lot of late night cry sessions, that sports has been my only identifying personality trait for the last 12 years. If someone asks about me, they mention my sports accomplishments, or my families sports accomplishments. 

I haven’t been able to grow, learn, or experience life outside of a gym. And I don’t want to only be known by one part of my life. 

I want to be more worldly. I don’t want to be stuck in my hometown 5 years from now doing what my parents expect me to do. I want to find a passion in the world outside of what’s been my whole life for the last 12 years. 

And with spring training coming up I’ve been lazy, not doing the max, basically unconsciously self sabotaging by making excuses for myself. I don’t look forward to practice, to our team chats, to training, to my next season, to meeting incoming freshmen, to team dinners. I’m not excited for any of it. At all. 

The Problem: my parents have forced me, without me realizing it until recently, into serious codependency. They pay for my school, my car, my phone, they helped me get my first job, they paid for all of my clothing and items and have never forced me to have a job. Until now I thought that as a blessing. But my dad holds his financial ownership over me, and uses it to force me into compliance. I.e ‘I own that car I can take it away’ ‘I bought that dog I can put it down’ ‘that’s my money paying for your college don’t make me waste it’ (my mom has no spine and refuses to stand up to him) 

I don’t drink alcohol. I don’t do drugs. I get average grades. 

My Question: 
1. Should I continue with my sports to make them happy and help with money, even though money isn’t an issue? my fear with this option is that I’m basically going to run myself into the ground with how much I hate it and need to go to therapy(again)
2. Do I incur the wrath of my father, quit sports, and focus on school and myself only? My fear with this option is I’m basically becoming the black sheep of the family, isolating myself and losing all support from my father. And that it’s a too selfish of an option. And that I’m going to disappoint everyone if I quit. Would this be worth it in the long run? 

Any advice would be appreciated! I feel like I’m going through a mid life crisis and I’m only 19. 

Just in case note; nobody is abusive at all, we are of average income but my dad has put a lot of money aside for my education, i love my dad it’s just a complicated relationship, I’ve had to go to therapy bc of the loss of a family member in the past but got lots better and don’t go anymore(in case anyone needs to know why I went to therapy in the first place)",14May2020,1
455,"I \[16F\] was pretty good at school until 6th grade, when i somehow lost my ability to focus on any textbook for more than half an hour. don't get me wrong, i'm not failing or anything, i'm just.. doing badly. have been for a while.

i was supposed to be doing my IGCSEs this year- but they got cancelled, and we'll be given something called ""predicted grades"" instead, which is exactly what it sounds like. in this curriculum, how you do in class doesn't matter at all- all that matters is the external exam. so while my grades were rubbish this year, i didn't particularly care (neither did my mom), because i was just gonna get my act together for the real thing, right? well, tough luck, there IS no exam, and now these my predicteds are gonna be based off the rubbish ones from school.

our teachers are sympathetic to our position- so they've started conducting online exams, to give us a chance to study and have some sort of evidence to justify giving us good predicted grades.

so i've been cheating.

i have *never* done this before in my life, but i couldn't risk this. my mum is sort of nuts about these grades, she genuinely believes the GCSEs are the most important exams of your life. we fought at least once a week this past year, her saying that i was killing her, driving her insane, not studying just to spite her, getting bad grades just to spite her (as if i'm insane), getting mad and not talking to me for days at a time.. suffice to say, i've disappointed her plenty this year. the truth is that i try, really, and there's nothing i wanted more than to be able to study properly like my peers and do well just to show her that i really DO want to make her happy, but time after time after time i kept failing.

so i've been cheating on these exams. it's incredibly easy to do so- laughably easy. so i've been doing it. and doing well at those exams as a result. until two days ago.. i had a biology test on tuesday, and didn't tell her. i didn't study, either, because, well.. i didn't need to. i shut the door and locked like i always did with lessons, and as i was solving, she knocked the door. she tried to open it and i reflexively (like a moron) yelled out ""exam!"".

afterwards, she came up and told me she didn't know i had an exam (i usually tell her) and that she hadn't seen me studying. i told her the first lie that came to mind- i didn't know. 

bad, bad move. she hasn't spoken to me in two days know. she thinks i've just blown my last chance at a good predicted grade. and to be fair, she's right. what kind of idiot doesn't know about an exam they have? not me. i knew. i just knew and didn't study because i was going to cheat off the internet anyway- which is worse, i guess. 

but i really don't want her to think i'm that careless, that i *didn't know i had an exam.* that's exactly who she thinks i am, and i don't want to reinforce that idea. but at the same time, coming forward with the truth will break her- she thinks of me as someone who would't compromise honesty for anything, despite all my other shortcomings. but i do want her to rest assured i didn't fuck up that exam. 

i know what i did was wrong. but there really wasn't another way. i *can't* study. i don't know how to. nothing sticks. i try to, for hours, then get the same shitty grades.",14May2020,1

Broke up amicably and then became best friends. Gays am I right? So we’re besties and then a year ago he had a spot open up in his house with two other roommates and I moved in because hell ya!

The next day we were back to our normal selves and nothing was said and nothing was weird. It’s like it never happened. But all I can think about is how I want to be affectionate and cuddle every night and am also very open to being sexual since this quarantine has made everyone very sexually frustrated.

464,"This is a girl I haven’t seen in a full decade.  Last seen her when we were in High school.  She wasn’t even my girlfriend although we both liked each other.  We were both too shy so the relationship never happened.

I explained to her I personally don’t want to work anymore because I am too depressed from being scammed by my landlord and roommates.  Long story short with that I was conned out of thousands of dollars, majority of my property was stolen and I was jailed for 10 weeks on false charges

She also has two kids and claimed I wouldn’t even have to watch them while she was at work because she could get her family to do it.  This made no sense to me and I insisted on watching the kids if she was doing all the work and she eventually said I could do it if that’s what I wanted to do

She is currently in a different state and says she wants to move together sometime in June so I still have another month or maybe two to think about this.  We have only communicated on Facebook on and off the past 4-5 years but aside from a few days ago never even spoke on the phone and heard each other’s voices

Throwaway because my wife knows my main reddit user. 
My wife and I have been together for 2.5 years and married for 6 months. We didn’t live together until we married as she comes from a traditional family. We are adjusting well to married life. 

However there’s one slight issue, she has always been an emotional person on her period, which I understand as ive grown up around 2 sisters. 
However the issue is a little awkward for me. She grew up in a very conservative family, not necessarily religious but very conservative and traditional that made her believe in no sex before marriage. A year or so before she met me she fell off with an ex she says her first time was very strange and that consent was somewhat questionable. I know that she then slept with a colleague a few times. I don’t necessarily like that she wasn’t in a relationship with him but I wouldn’t express that to her, I’ve always made clear we don’t need to discuss our pasts as we both have one and we should focus on the now. 


But since we’ve been married each time she’s on her period she gets super teary and cries that she ‘ didn’t wait for me ‘ and that the other two dudes weren’t nearly as special as me. I told her not to be silly that it’s happened and it’s fine. it literally puts her in a funk and makes the whole atmosphere awkward especially as were quarantining. I’ve told her that she should see a therapist but she seems reluctant. I don’t know if it’s because money is super tight right now. 

Is there anything more I can do? 

I don’t really know what to do as it’s not a topic I want to necessarily discuss as it’s all in the past.

Ive always been insecure and he's always been a dream making me feel better and reassuring me I was all he wanted. But I dont have that vagina, that body, those particular fetishes. It is clear what he enjoys looking at when im not around, so how could he possibly like what he gets from me? Everything else about our marriage is superb. I love him to pieces.

Like I brush everyday, don’t drink any soda and don’t have a sweet tooth anymore, but it’s not working. I’m incredibly scared and anxious cause that’s my teeth now and one front tooth has a tiny tiny black dot on the front now. I know it’s all my fault, but I genuinely can’t afford a dentist at the moment and don’t want anything to get worse.

479,"I feel a little bad posting this here considering the usual tone of the posts here. But my mums 60th is coming up next week and I don't know what to get her. She has no hobbies or interests which is linked to her depression and its making it quite difficult to get something for her that will bring a little light into her life. She recently got into going out at night and watching the ISS fly over and i discussed the idea of a telescope so we can go star gazing. She liked the idea but a few days later she did a 180 on the idea. She struggles with her memory, I have a feeling that its the early stages of dementia and has never been interested in anything outside her own home life so she just dismissed the idea saying ""my brain just can't comprehend whats out there so I don't want one anymore"". I figure seeing whats out there may give her negative thoughts. I tried to convince her that the learning exercise would be good for her and give her something to be interested in, and it could be great bonding but to no avail. She also has mentioned a little pop-up greenhouse and books, but I get the feeling that she will change her mind on that soon too.

480,"I really don't care if he sees this. 

So I'll go indepth. My brother is 4 years older than me, I just turned 23(F) this year. I come from an east asian background, where males are more valuable than females. My brother has always been my mom's favorite, she always babied him, always picked up his mess, and gave him little to no consequences, only empty threats. My brother growing up was physically abused by my father, in my culture beating your child was the only way of discipline. Growing up I was also beaten by my father(although not as often as my brother) and had to listen to him beating my brother. My parents divorced, they never had chemistry or love for one another. My mom told me they only married due to societal pressure and time closing around them. From there on my mom picked up the ""disciplinarian"" role. She beat both my brother and I, but she only considered it ""discipline"" and said the ""real"" abuser here is my father. My brother, being much older than I, started college before me. It took him 6 years to graduate with a bachelor's because growing up he didn't learn time management skills or what it takes to do hard work.... remember, my mom made shit easy for him. During this time it was just my mom and I at home. She and I would fight often, as I grew sick and tired of her antics. At one point she told me ""I like your brother more because he goes to college"", which confirmed my suspicions about him being her favorite. But I also rebutted with, ""Even though he has like 1.5 GPA and he's using you? you're paying for his tuition and he's not improving."" Which she said ""yeah i like him better"". But I digress. My mom gives him a brand new car and a credit card, which she will pay for both... despite him lazing around doing nothing. She hoped that these new shiny things will help him find a job somewhere during breaks, because it'll make it easier. My brother doesn't want to find a job during summer breaks, because ""retail sucks and people suck"". I have agoraphobia yet I still managed to do retail. Anyways... 

I'll just jump into it, there's a lot of shitty things I left out. I can write a fucking book about my life. 

Around 2016, I was picking out a new laptop for me to use. I wanted to pick out this specific MSI laptop for gamerzz shit, and so that I can carry it around. My mom for some reason calls my brother in to ""look at it"", because I guess she doesn't trust my intuition or research I did to pick out this specific laptop. My brother comes in and tells me to pick a shittier laptop, and we argue back and forth, I don't want this shittier laptop. At one point I reached my breaking point and I tell him how it is. The shit thats been bottled inside me and shit my mom has vented to me about regarding him. I said, ""let me have this for fucks sake. Mom gets you everything nice and even pays for your tuition as you sit around failing classes and being ungrateful"" He stands up and as he's about to leave my room he grabs a bottle of fish food and throws it at my face. I looked away when it hit my face, and when I looked back up, he was there. 

He lunged at me, punching my face closed fists in the corner of my bedroom.  I'm blocked in. My mom tries to get between us and just screams at him to stop. At this point my brother starts kicking me since he can't reach me with his fists. He shoves her to the side and lunges me again, this time putting me in a headlock and punching my face and head over and over. My mom tears his shirt trying to pull him off, but after that just stands there screaming. He then throws me onto the floor as he continues to beat my face in. He then gets up and leaves my room. 

Im hysterical. I scream at my mom to call the cops like 50x. My mom quickly tells me to ""shut my mouth"" and that ""it was just siblings fighting"". I don't  think a sibling who is 5'11, male, 190 lbs would beat down their sister, 5'4 130lbs. My brother walks in to tell me that he ""wouldve broken her nose"" if I wasnt his sister. He pulls out a cube and sits on the floor with my mom and I and tells us ""whoever has the cube can talk and thats it"" (fucked up isnt it? He tries to immediately take control of the situation). He says, ""i had to take out the anger out on someone for what dad did to me"" he starts weeping. My mom embraces him, and tells him ""you were truly truly abused"" he then starts weeping more to say ""this family needs to be a team, we're just like roommates, theres no sense of family here"" . I watched them, with my bruised arms and hands with defense marks, black eye forming on my right eye, and a bruise forming on my leg and side from being thrown down. You know in movies where the focal point starts to zoom out into a tunnel and time just slows down? Yeah, that was me. At that point I was in such a shock, i got up quietly, left the house to call the only one I have left. My boyfriend of 8 years. 

My mom tells me to come back in, and gives me an ice pack before going to work. Im sitting in my room with this icepack now wondering what the fuck? My brother walks into my room to look at the damage he has done. Kind of laughs about it. Gets reeeeal close to my face to look and says, ""Wooooow I did that? Haha. My knuckles are bruised too because of your hard head haha *shows knuckles* Sorry though!"" Wtf? 

My boyfriend gets increasingly upset after I told him everything and calls the police on him. The police come knocking, they see the marks on my face and take me to the station. He's charged a felony, we get a restraining order or something. That night he stayed in a friend's house. The next day my mom is furious and yelling at me, screaming, hysterical. She screams at me how I have a big mouth, and says ""How dare your boyfriend call police on ME. He is not part of the family. Who does he think he is? How dare HE"". I knew this would've happened and didn't want police called either. Im forced to stay in my dingy dorm on campus, and my brother got to stay in the comfort of mom's home. 

My mom pays approx ~$3,000 dollars for a lawyer. I don't press charges because im fucking terrified of being disowned by mom. 

2020

I regret not pressing charges. In 2020, he told me it was ""fine"" and ""ok"" for him to assault me back then because i was apparently being a ""cunt"". Who knew being telling the truth is cunt-y behavior? And he said he has ""no problems"" and no ""issues"" regarding his mental health and anger. I told my mom about this and she just laughed. 

I hate my brother. He is not a man, nor a boy. He has no sense of duty, no discipline, no structure. A soyboy, betamale, cuck, incel, whatever the definition is, i despise him to my very core. 

In a way I also feel anger at my mother for just marrying a man she had no love to. If my brother and I had a positive male role model growing up, a positive father figure, I doubt we wouldve ended up this way. 


I know it is too late for me to go back and press charges. I know it's the past and there's nothing that I can do. How do I move on? My life has been filled with unresolved issues and abuse. My family dynamic is we have a fight, and act like nothing happened and move on


EXTRAS:
In a weird sense I feel like the anchor of this trio. My mom and my brother do and say fucked up shit onto me, they both move on as if nothing happened. Im still traumatized by it, and keep quiet about it. I know when I pipe up about something, their delusions of ""everything is fine. Out of sight out of mind"" is broken and they lash out on me. 

My mom complains i have a big mouth because i vent too much on the internet or to my friends. Well, if I had someone to talk to in the family then I wouldn't be doing this.

 I was previously diagnosed with C-PTSD and agoraphobia due to abuse growing up.

My brother still lives in the house,  and of course he doesn't help around the house living under mommy's roof because he now has 40hr/wk job. As if having a job prevents you from doing anything around the house. He expects me to be a little maid to do everything around the house, cause.... apparently being a ""team"" is to have one person do everything. And having a job means you can't do your own laundry and wash dishes LOL. Imagine living under mommys house and not being able to help around. She works 12 hr shifts. My thesis, classes, studying, takes longer than 8 hours per day and yet I still manage to do chores without being asked. He's just lazy. 

I am currently looking into moving out to an apartment. Even though im a fresh graduate, class 2020, Ill work two or three jobs of retail if I have to. I will have to learn everything about the ""real life"" though. Kind of embarrassing, im 23 and know nothing of how banks even work. My mom has sheltered both my brother and I regarding how the world works... because removing every obstacle for your kids is the best way of having them learn and grow right?",14May2020,1

482,"Hey guys, 

I’ve kinda hit a low point in the midst of this unusual time. Since quarantine has started I’ve been more alone with my thoughts and feelings. I’ve also been thinking about death more. I want some advice about the current situation I am. Buckle up because it’s going to be kinda long. Thanks in advance for the advice Reddit!

Here’s some background information. My mom remarried in 2014. The man she married molested me for a while growing up. At first I didn’t know what he was doing was wrong I was a 10 year old. He would touch me in my private areas. It makes me sick to my stomach thinking about it again. He fingered me one time while i was sleeping I was too scared to do anything. As I’m typing this I’m stressed, crying, anxious, disgusted. I eventually told my mom about the sexual abuse when I was 14. My mom did not confront him or anything. Her response to me was were in this together I’ll make sure he doesn’t go near you again. Her plan was to ‘protect’ me until I’m old enough to move out and never come back. I lived in the same household as him, we wouldn’t interact at all, up until I moved out for college at 18. The abuse stopped after I told my mother. 

Some more information. This guy has wealth, is a white man, and has power. I would also like to point out that I hate him with all my guts. Living in the same household with my abuser for 4 years significantly impacted me and my mental well-being. Not to mention the abuse and trauma has profoundly impacted me as well. It wasn’t until I went to college and felt the effects. 

When I was younger I was scared I didn’t quite understand what my mother was saying to me and did not question whether it was good advice or not. As I got older I realized, the man committed a crime he should go to jail; as I got older I pressed this idea more and more on my mother. That is/was my position on this issue no questions asked. My mother agreed, or so I thought. When I told her what happened to me, in retrospect, she would give so many excuses why she or I shouldn’t call the cops yet. She said that she just needed more time to figure everything out. She gave excuses why not to call the authorities and put him in jail. She would pity herself and say if you do that we will be poor and live on the streets. She would say if you call the cops I will go to jail too because I knew about the abuse. She would say I need to be married to him for at least five years to get half of his earnings when I divorce him, assuming she’d leave him. She would say I’ll help you get justice just give me some more time. As a vulnerable 14 year old and as I grew older, I believed in my mother and I believed that she would help me get justice for what he did in the future. Although as I grew older, a part of me knew that that was all bullshit, she wouldn’t help me get justice. During my highschool years, 
it’s almost as though she created a system with me to shush me up. She gave me anything I wanted in exchange for me to not say anything. Although it was never explicitly stated between us, the sort of system was evident growing up. Nonetheless, my goal is to put his ass in jail summer of 2019 after healing from past trauma. 

Sept 2018 I moved out and attended college. Things were good. I was financially stable. I was happy. June 2019 I moved back home for a week after the school year was done. I was between leases so I needed a place to crash for a week. My mom owns two houses so I stayed at the second house. 

During that week, I expressed to my mother I wanted justice and intend to get in this summer. I yearned for justice and I told her times up. I conveyed this to my mother and she lashed out. She exposed a side of herself I never would have guessed she had. She started blaming me for what he did to me. She started saying I ruin everything. She told me to leave and never come back. She said that all I bring is trouble to her and to leave her ‘family’ alone. I was shocked, depressed, angry. I always thought that it’d be her and I together reporting to the authorities what that repulsive man did to me. To think that all those years she false promised me justice. Although a part of me always knew they were fake promises, I was scared to accept the truth. I didn’t want to go through the process alone. I didn’t want to ruin her family. I was crushed after hearing these things. Never had I’ve been more broken after hearing these things from a women I trusted for so long. From a women I loved for so long. I had hoped she’d follow through with her word. But she proved to be a selfish woman. 

Following the fight. I packed my bags and now live in my college town permanently. I’ve cut off all ties from her, financially, mentally, communicatively, etc. I am now estranged from her and have been since June 2019. 

Today I’ve missed her for the first time since I cut off ties with her. I hate thinking if this a decision I’m going to regret later in life. In quarantine my mind has been less distracted so I’ve been spending more time thinking about life. Am I really going to die not speaking with her again? Or even more scary, am I never going to speak to her again before she dies? This thought frightens me. On one hand I know I shouldn’t reestablish a relationship with her. She has hurt me too much. On the other hand I don’t know if I will regret it or not. I also can’t help but think why is it that IM hurting when I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING WRONG. Why is it that I’m in a SHITTY situation without a mother while the molester is MARRIED to my mom and living life to its fullest. These thoughts anger me and I have all the right to be angry but at the end of the day I feel hopeless because I have the short end of the stick. My mother chose her current life over her daughter. It angers me because it shouldn’t even be a choice. There is no ‘sides’ in this situation. Her husband committed a crime! I didn’t do anything!!! out of respect for myself I know I shouldn’t go back to her but also out of respect to myself I don’t know if I will regret this decision given that I don’t see why I’m suffering instead of that asshole that caused the rift between my mother and I. A part of me also thinks that my mom is scared. That she’s with him because she knows how it is to grow up poor and since he has money she’s stable in that regard. But regardless, my virtues don’t align with her train of thought. I cannot tolerate that one bit. That’s why I cut ALL my ties with her and her family. I don’t know what I should do. I’m in the process of healing right now from the trauma. It’s a slow process. Reddit, what would you do In my situation? Any advice would be appreciated. 

btw sorry if some things are unclear. I was filled with emotions when I’m wrote this.",14May2020,1
483,"Hi, 
I made this account to post because I don’t want my family to see it. I’m 23 and at uni in my hometown so living at home. I’ve got ADHD really badly and with that I find it really hard to control my temper. I don’t have an in between, I’m either over the top happy and chatty and noisy, then suddenly I can lose my temper like a switch. I only ever lose my temper at home. (I think it’s important to say here, when I lose my temper, it’s that i feel like I can’t get anyone to listen, and I think it’s like I panic? Because I shout and say anything to get people to listen. Sometimes after an argument I’ll hate myself so much for ruining things yet again that I’ll hit myself because I think I deserve to be hurt, but I’ve never, ever felt even close to the impulse of hurting someone when I lose my temper) 

I love my family more than anything, but I feel like I ruin everything.

I lose my temper so easily and ruin everything. Family meals, activities, everything. I know my family loves me, cause unconditional love and all that, but I can’t emphasis enough. I’m literally sat in my car with no where to go but I can’t go home right now because I lost my temper again after me and dad had an argument. Everyone else just walks away when he argues but I can’t so I lose my temper. I could go home, and I will later, because it’s not like they’d ever kick me out and they’ll forgive me, but I can’t face them right now knowing that, yet again, I ruined something, and I know they’re really relieved that I’ve gone away for a bit. 

I’ve been told I ruin things by them, so it’s not just that I think I am. It’s not as nasty as it sounds, it’ll be like if I’m arguing with dad my sister might say “for goodness sake, why do you always have to ruin everything?” Kind it thing. Not like your existence ruins things! 

Even when I don’t lose my temper I don’t think they love having me around because I talk to much, I’m loud, I fidget, I’m annoying and weird. 


I think they’d be a lot better off without me. Not like if I killed myself. I sometimes think it would be easier if I hadn’t been born, but never seriously. I’m not suicidal and I don’t think I’m depressed. I just can’t control my adhd so I lose my temper a lot, and I know that I make everything at home so hard for everyone else. 

I don’t want to keep ruining everything, I want to move out and go far away so I can talk to them on the phone  and tell them I love them and they’ll be happy and I’ll be happy and they won’t have to deal with me any more, but I’m at uni in my hometown for a few more years and I can’t afford to move out. But I can’t face more time at home where I can’t control myself. 

I’m a completely different person at home. I’ve moved out before, lived alone, with other people. In every other aspect of my life, I’m super calm and super chilled out. I’m the last person to lose my temper, and I’m actually way too much of a pushover. But at home I’m the completely opposite. 

What can I do? I don’t know how I can move out but I ruin everything at home. I’ve tried anger management tips and everything and it doesn’t help.",14May2020,1
484,"I've reluctantly returned to work after my Furlough ended and I've only been here for nearly three hours now and nobody is social distancing at all! Earlier, someone came into the office and leaned over me asking about what work I'm doing. Is it so hard to keep a two meter distance though? 

We both went to the CEO with a print out of of Section 44 of the Employment Rights Act of 1996. He just didn't care. We want masks and gloves because me and my co-worker are in a confined space (small office). He tried to justify not wearing masks. I'm furious.

On top of that, my password to the system has been changed and he can't even remember what he changed it too. I've been sat here doodling and making notes the whole morning. What do I do? 

This is a massive health risk. Am I overreacting? The boss man even said himself that he has had corona at one point and no one cares. Who do I report this too? How can I handle this?

485,I am a vulnerable person. I share a lot of personal stuff with my friends and sometimes with people whom I barely know.

486,"So me (17M) and my friend (18F) have known each other for three years. We're best friends and always tell each other every detail of each others lives, and we text a lot (around 50,000 messages, and most of the time in the last 2 years we were in a place with no internet connection). Anyways I made a joke about posting some embarassing thing she said online as a joke, and she got it was a joke. But a while later yesterday, she asked me to delete all the messages we have sent each other. I didnt think much of it as she claimed it was because she was paranoid, for many reasons including having a parent in IT. Now we do text a lot of weird stuff, but i definitely know that that parent would not check her phone because they are in law enforcement. After a lot of intense nagging, I deleted it a few minutes ago.
 
But the thing is, she wants to keep the messages. She said she'll read all of them and delete tomorrow. This is definitely not possible and it makes me think that that isnt a legitimate reason. Now i am beginning to think she has some sort of ulterior motive, but im not sure if its cause im being paranoid or whether she is.  She eventually gave an explanation which boiled down to me inferring that she didnt trust me. Im really hurt by this and also a little confused as my gut tells me something is wrong. I have kept screenshots of her asking me to delete all my messages just in case. She has never seemed like the person to have this conspiracy theory type mentality and her attitude is a bit out of character. I dont know why i am so bothered by this because i honestly would trust her with my life.",14May2020,1
487,"Hello guys. So I recently started taking driving lessons in my city. I was so happy and everything. Well I discovered that it's hard as fuck and so stressful and I am so bad at it. The thing is I like to do things a little bit slower, you know I don't want to rush things when slowing or speeding up and stuff like that. But my instructor wants to me to do everything really quick and I am really stressed by it.

The thing is I drive good when he doesn't always picking me up for even the smallest mistakes. He was on the phone for about 20 minutes one day and just giving me directions and that was the best drive I've ever had. I did like one mistake but that was it.

He tells me how bad driver I am like all the time, and that I'll be taking tests like 10 times before I'll pass. And I am always trying to hold up my tears, like after every ride I cry and I feel so exhausted. But I don't want to blame just my instructor, I do mistakes.

So anyway I really don't know what to do anymore. I have driving tests on monday and I am really scared. I remember how happy I was when I started taking lessons but now I am stressed out everyday, and I mean REALLY STRESSED OUT. I didn't sleep well for like a week. So my question is, should I just quit and leave it for some other time? Or should I quit forever? Can I really be such a bad driver?",14May2020,1

490,"So to cut things short, I've been refusing to talk to my dad for five months. 

I feel like he betrayed me and manipulated me for so long and I just can't talk to him anymore. I want advice on how to talk to him when he comes to see us in person.

Warning: Some language, sorry, I don't swear often, I'm just so angry. This is mostly vent but it's some much-needed context that you'll need to know before answering my post. Sorry it's super long.

For context, my whole life I've never stayed in one place. When I was eight I was forced to move to China for two years (I know that's really lucky of me but hear me out) then when those years were up I moved to WA, Perth. I was there for 6 months when my dad said he'd gotten accepted as deputy principal for a school in another town four hours away. I had only just settled in at that point when I was forced to move to that other town. I was there for another six months and had only just started making amazing friends (Actually I still talk to two of them over text quite frequently so yay) when my dad lost his job and refused to look for other work in that town, so he forces us to move all the way to fricking NSW, somewhere four hours north of Sydney. I was there for two years. I made the best friends I could have ever made. I was the happiest I'd ever been in my whole life, every day was like a dream.

Then the motherfucker forced me to move to New Zealand, Auckland. It was only last year actually, and it was the most depressed I'd been in my entire life, which is saying a lot because I've been depressed quite a lot thanks to moving. I wasn't able to make friends in my new school and I'd have therapy sessions where I'd just break down crying hysterically for hours on end. Some days were so bad I could barely get myself out of bed to go get something to eat. All I could do was cry most of the time and the smallest thing made my sensitive self cry like a baby. Everything looked so dark to me.  Fuck those ten months of my life.

Oh, and we're not even up to the tea yet.  

My parents started getting into fights, starting infrequently but slowly becoming more frequent with time. My dad started talking to me about my mum, telling me things about her that were mostly lies and told me bad stuff about her. He was my favourite parent at the time, so of course, I believed him and turned against her.

 I'd been asking for months and even saving up a little to go see my friends and my mum finally said okay, since she knew how depressed I was without them. (Friends mean the world to me since I've been forced to lose them so many times) So a few days before we left he kept showing me emails mum sent him which was highly inappropriate to show a 13-year old and told me he had a feeling she would force us to stay in NSW and we wouldn't be able to see him. 

I believed him of course and he made me take photos of my and my sister's passports and send them to him. (I'm sorry but I started crying while writing this)  Then my mum and my sister and I went back to NSW and it was the best time of my life. Fast forward a few weeks and it's the day we're supposed to go back to Sydney Airport and I confront my mom about why she hasn't taken us. My sister and I get really mad at her and then she comes out and tells us he was cheating. 

The motherfucker told me to my face that my mum was the bad one while he was cheating behind her back. He was lying to my face. He was manipulating a clueless 13-year-old girl. He was right about us staying in NSW but nvm I'm cool with that now. By the way, to show how bad he was, he went and visited his girlfriend instead of being with us on Christmas. Fucking Christmas. Oh, and his best friend who has been our family friend for years met her too and then just came back acting like nothing had happened. So yeah, I feel betrayed.

Then he and his brother fucking said something to my little sister that was so unforgivable on the phone that I flat out stopped talking to him. My brain blocked out most of the fight because it was a pretty shitty night but he basically said 'If you don't come back here, your grandma will die of old age and you won't be here.' (she's pretty healthy and she's in her seventies)

So yeah. 

That's my daddy issues. I just want advice on what to say next time I see him in person. I'm really sorry for the rant I just needed to get this off my chest. I feel like nobody asks me how I am anymore, just my sister as well but maybe that's just my acting skills. Btw my sister still talks to him over the phone. 

Okay thanks for coming to my Ted Talk see ya later folks.",14May2020,1

492,"Sorry for the long post, this happened around ten minutes ago and I'm still shaking. I used to have this friend, let's call her Emma. We didn't see each other in person a lot but we were texting a lot every day. Our friendship started around a year ago, I think. She was depressed and almost committed suicide one day and I helped her cope (I hope, I was putting a lot of energy into our friendship.) 

Then, in November, she said I was too tiring and 'broke up' with me. I cried a lot, since she was my best friend. (I did not have a lot of friends and still don't.) She said I could still text her if something major happy or sad happens, but I didn't do that yet. Well, in times where I was feeling really sad or wanted to make myself feel sad, I sometimes (I did this max. 3 times) looked at her Instagram story. She still followed me on my other account so I used that one. Last time I did that I unfollowed her as well because I didn't want her to check who had seen her Story and finding out I'd seen it. (Which is, come on, not that bad.)

Then, a friend of Emma (FoE) suddenly texted me:

Dude, why the fuck are you stalking Emma

I almost got a panic attack.

Me: What?

Me: I'm not stalking her

Me: What does stalking mean to you, wtf

FoE: I believe Emma, bye

Me: I don't get it

Me: I watched her story a few times that's all

FoE: Uhu

Me: Can you please tell me what you think I was doing

Me: What she's accusing me of

Me: I want to know

Me: If I know what I'm ""doing"" I can stop it

FoE: HAHAHAHHA

Me: I don't know what you mean

FoE: HAHA

FoE: you do know HAHA

Me: seriously, I don't

FoE: oh yes HAHAHAHAHAH

at this point I started crying because she wasn't taking me seriously and I was trying to think of something I did wrong

Me: I'm crying rn fuck off

Me: Do you think this is funny or something

FoE: OOF XD

FoE: You're fucking weak if you're seriously crying HAHAHAHHAH 

at this point I became very angry and sad at the same time because I had no control over the situation at all

Me: Why are you even messaging me this

Me: Is she too much of a coward herself or something

Me: I don't even follow her

(she didn't respond for a while now.)

Me: If I'm too tiring for her she doesn't have to become paranoid, I don't stalk her and I follow Cameron because she's my friend. (This is also a friend of Hannah or so I thought.) Nothing else happened. If Hannah is friends with Cameron that's fine but she shouldn't accuse me of stalking.

FoE: HAHAHA YOU DO STALK HER WHAT ARE YOU THINKING WHO DO YOU THINK I'M BELIEVING

FoE: AND WHO THE FUCK IS CAMERON LMAO

FoE: Even through Emma's friends you try to reach her wtf HAHHAHAHAH

Me, somewhat calmer: Cameron is someone who Emma also knows haha. I thought that could be the stalking you were talking about, but no.

She didn't reply after this.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I got falsely accused of stalking my ex-best friend who found I was too tiring half a year ago and 'broke up' with me. A friend of my ex-best friend sent me that.

So I am going to get right to the point here, my brother is a complete slob. He is 24 and still living at home, and he is a complete mess. It takes him maybe a week to completely destroy the bathroom, he leaves his clothes in the floor, chews tobacco in there leaving shreds all over the floor, he always leaves thing open stinking up the room, not to mention he NEVER can flush and blames it on ME! My parents are treating him like a baby and I have had enough, he takes 1/2 of the kitchen upstairs in a family of 4 and leaves it in his room for a month before my parents have to go into his room which is 10 times worse than the bathroom! My parents are saying they have tried but they have made absolutely no progress with him and he only seems to be getting worse each month. I am so repulsed with how this is that I would rather move out and struggle as I have not yet finished high school but I will in 2 weeks thankfully. I really don't know what to do at this point with my family and brother, and need some advice because sure this cannot be acceptable because I have nearly been hurt multiple times by my brother's mess. My parents justify babying him by saying that ""he is just tired from work"" and acting like that making his behavior acceptable. Anyone have any ideas to help me?

Anyway ever since this covid-19 thing started my anxiety has been getting really bad. 

The thing is tho, whenever I have a panic attack, breathing gets harder sometimes even impossible, my head gets heavy, I feel dizzy and nausea and I feel really warm and as if I have a fever. 

Most of these things are symptoms for the virus so this only causes me to freak out even more. It's so hard to calm myself down and tell myself that I'm just freaking myself out bc of that even though ever since the lockdown I haven't been outside due to my paranoia. I can't stand going outside and even when a family member goes in and out I freak out. 

My family tells me I'm being hysterical and I get that but them not taking my fears seriously and just dismiss them is making me feel worse

But we don't have the money to go to a therapist/get online therapy and even if we did I don't think my family would willingly allow me to go bc they don't take mental health seriously.

Basically the above title, I’m 29 years old and I feel emotionally stunted/stagnant in life currently.

I work full time at a job that’s okay but don’t care for it. I still live with my parents and pay rent, but I’m responsible with my funds and have a decent nest egg.

I pretty much feel unfulfilled in life and I can tell by the way others treat me. I have no career ambitions in life even when I studied through college (it wasn’t the greatest experience) and I believe it’s why other people treat me like a teenager.

Right now my biggest goal is to move out of my parents’ house and out of NYC to a more affordable city that I can afford on my own.

I want to do this because I believe that living with them has stunted my growth as a person. They’re against it and want me to live somewhere close to them (but living in NYC is extremely expensive and I don’t like it here).

In terms of hobbies I don’t have any, I love writing and animals. I really want to move out to challenge and put myself in an environment I can grow in.",14May2020,1
498,"Throwaway cause all my friends know my main...

Have a friend who we will call ""P"", known the guy since pre-K and basically know everything about eachother, one thing that always preplexed me since the beginning was he never invited me over even though he came over almost everyday and slept over all the time, I litterraly just found out his address like a month a ago. Background on him, he is in his mid teens comes from an immigrant family (will not name the country but he does come from the same background as me), he is a single child and lives in an apartment with both parents. He never talked about his family and never mentioned anything in his home. He would sometimes take ""breaks"" from school due to ""sicknesses"", I always thought the guy just had a bad luck with being sick. One time he left for like 4 months and had the school send the exams to him with a supervisor look after him while he did the exams. During this time he would still talk to me and play games online but when I asked him about the ""sicknesses"" he would always be vague. 


Now this is where I found out the truth. A burner cell contacted me via text and told me everything, P was abused everyday by his dad and what I mean I he was beaten and his mom aswell, the beatings were so sevear he wouldn't come to school so the teachers and faculty won't find out. Now you might ask, why would you or P or His mom not report this to the authorities? His dad is the sole bread winner in the house and the only reason they are in the country because he is the one with the visa if anyone reported him and the evidence was shown it would have been an open and shut case but P and his mom would be sent to our home country which P has never lived in and doesn't even speak the language their and due to this it would ruin his life.

I love this guy he is my dearest friend and want the best for him but if I do this his future would be ruined, right now  he has the highest GPA in the school but he will probably not be a valedictorian due to his grades and I would bet he will get a scholarship to an ivy league school.

499,"So this is mostly in prevention for a situation that occurred nearly in all my past relationships. 
Basically, all the boyfriends i had in the past were moderately fit and exercised/went to the gym regularly before and in the beginning of their relationship with me. But after a few months, they all seem to stop going, which led to them gaining weight and losing muscles.
I know this sounds superficial, but i exercise regularly and am pretty fit myself. It annoys me to see someone whom i care for neglecting their health like that.

It’s not really my place to intervene and ask them to go, as it’s their decision and their body... also, i don’t want them to assume that i find them unattractive and want them to change.
I have tried proposing to do sports together, but ya know...doing squash once a week is not enough to maintain a body healthy and fit. I also have encouraged my past boyfriends whenever they exercised.

These are people that I like and that I will enjoy spending time together, and that to me nothing will change, whatever time passes since we last saw each other. I have a really hard time managing so many different people while also managing my life - for the past year, studying in a Masters program. It always feels overwhelming to go on Whatsapp or other platforms and see a bunch of messages from different people - that I haven't replied to in days or weeks. The more I accumulate, the worse it gets. I can only keep a closer contact with 3 of my family members, because I know otherwise they would get really worried about me.

In the past, I've tried regulating my access to these platforms so that I wouldn't feel so overwhelmed with the amount of information, e.g. I've deleted my Facebook and Instagram accounts.

At the moment, I'm struggling a lot, because I can't meet with people in person.

I was living by myself, abroad, in a very tiny studio flat. When the current events were starting to hit, I decided to move back with my parents, because I was feeling very lonely and knew that only staying in touch online would be very difficult. I'm not feeling as lonely, but i'm also not getting in touch with any of my friends.

I came here to ask for some understanding, as I feel like I can't talk about this without sounding crazy, and some help about how I should approach this.

What should I do to try to understand where this behavior comes from?

What should I do to try to fix it?

What other ways could I try to stay in touch? 

I have a bit the desire to go back to writing letters and think that if it was still like that, everything would be easier.

Should I share this in some other place that is more appropriate?

My mom has told me multiple times that she wants to move in with me wherever I go for college (my dad isn’t in our life btw). I live with my mom and sister (she’s currently a sophomore in high school). However I really do not want her to live with me. I’m not sure how I’m going to tell her and I need advice on what to do. 

My mother is very childish and overprotective. If anything, she’s more of my friend than a mother; or so she tries to be. She is in her 50s but dresses and acts as if she’s in her 30s. She doesn’t know how to save and budget money, and will drop tons of money on items like expensive makeup or skincare. She currently works at a job that pays enough to where we live paycheck to paycheck with a little extra to spend. We also live in a very poor area in the Central Valley in California. She hates when i go out with friends and is super overprotective. She is always telling me that everyone in the world only wants the worst for me and tries to convince me to cut off my friends so that i dont hangout or talk to anyone. I cant even tell her about what’s going on in my life and my feelings because she’ll just find a reason to blame to make me feel horrible about myself. She tries to make me feel guilty for how her life is. She has extreme trust issues and has me send pictures of myself as proof of where im going when i go out. She also forces me to share my location on Life360. She doesn’t want me to get a job because she wants me to be dependent on her for money. Another thing, she’s not fond of me getting my license. However, i have a car that my brother gave to me. 

She’s always nurtured me so much as a child. I believe this is why I’m so sick of her now. She always babies me and treats me as if I’m 13. I’m tired of seeing her every day, so I stay in my room all day, every day since I’m in online school. I am a very independent and mature 17 year old. I have a savings/checking account and debit card to my name. I’ve already started budgeting my money and preparing for college. I plan to get a job over the summer even if she doesn’t want me to. I know how to apply for a credit card for when I decide to start building my credit score. I’m very responsible with money, unlike her. I know how bills/mortgage works, etc. I’m perfectly fine with being alone and I’m very responsible. (Sidenote: I have older siblings in their late 20s that support me and are willing to help me out financially; they cut off my mother because she was toxic in their lives).

So, even if she wants to live with me for college, we’ll pretty be in the same financial position. She doesn’t even have a savings account. I’d much rather live on campus and deal with loans/debt or in an apartment with roommates, than live with her in an apartment. She is very toxic and makes me miserable. How do i tell her and what would you do if you were in my position? I know that if i even mention living by myself, she’ll try to guilt trip me out of it. Also, i plan on moving across the country to attend a college in Texas, Georgia, or Florida.",14May2020,1

515,"I am a 20 year old transgender man who is currently attending college for reference. I had tried to upload a similar post a few days ago but there was an issue so I had to take it down. Here is try #2.

My entire life I have known that I was different. I didn't figure it out until I was around 8 that I was actually a boy, not a girl. However I did not come out and start transitioning until I was 18 and had finished high school because I was afraid of what people might say. At 19, I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria.

My friends were all extremely supportive of me and so was my father and siblings. My father is happy to see me happy, and he likes my preferred name. I have been living full time as a guy for a few years now and at college I go by my preferred name.

Where I am having an issue is my mother's side of the family (my parents are divorced for reference). My mother was very upset when I came out to her and told me that she didn't understand why I couldn't accept being a woman. I tried explaining it to her the best I could but she did not understand. She told me she would not feel comfortable using my preferred name or pronouns. Eventually though, she got used to me dressing as a man and even got me some men's clothes for Christmas. She seems much for comfortable with it now but it took a few years. 

However, we still have not told her extended family because they are extremely religious. They have excluded my immediate family from a few family get togethers before because we don't go to church (I am an Atheist and my family is Catholic) regularly. So for holidays I have to use my dead name despite being uncomfortable with it and I am treated like a woman. My grandmother did not like my new haircut and insulted it when she first saw me with it.

One of my cousin came out as a lesbian a few years back and my aunt and uncle sent her to therapy to ""fix her"" (didn't work cause duh). My mother has not told them about me yet and neither have I.

They are huge hypocrites too. Another one of my cousins (two years older than me) has been caught stealing, neglecting her pet cat, and lying. Yet they have always forgiven her for everything she has done and continue to allow this behavior because she ""normal"". She is allowed to come to all family gatherings for holidays.

I am now seeing an endocrinologist and will be starting HRT in the coming months. I will soon be unable to hide the fact that I am transgender to the rest of my family during the next get together (most likely thanksgiving) because the hormones will have changed my body and voice. I know my extended family will not accept me for who I am and will most likely not want anything to do with me. I am also concerned that they may not want to speak to my immediate family any more because they are okay with me being transgender. I do not want my mother and siblings to be alienated from the rest of the family because of my ""sin"".

I live in my own apartment, I have my own health insurance, I have my own job, and I go to college on my own. I am in no way a financial burden to them and I am an adult so I can make my own decisions. I love my family very much but I am not sure what to do in this situation. Any advice would be helpful, thank you.",14May2020,1

I'm doing CompSci in September and although one part of me is excited and rearing to go and study this course, the other is very disappointed -- disappointed that I didn't get into a top / much better school (university) for my course.

I know -- I know, the school isn't important as long as you make an effort on your course to learn, to socialise, to network you'll be fine. But I can't help thinking getting into a better school would've given me that headstart.

- I'm surprised I even got into this course. I'm self studying math (re-covering everything) so I'm all caught up and prepared.
- I'm learning Java at home, the programming language they'll use when I'm there.

I really enjoy this subject. I particularly am excited to go into the fields of AI and Robotics. That's my ""dream"". My natural curiosity has led me to love these fields, they're so unpredictable and full of challenges.

I'm not going to sugarcoat anything.

I am a little ""dumb"", I procrastinated a lot, I never tried in school and when I did nothing would go in, but I'm still here aren't I? And I'm not going to stop trying. But then sometimes I'm like what's the point, I'm dumb and I'll always remain dumb.

Lots of people tend to be tied to these addresses.

At first we were nice about it, told them it was the previous tenant since we recognized the name from his mail. We even told them where we think we moved, as we heard it from a neighbor. Dude supposedly lives just a little farther up the road now. Debt collectors said cool, thanks, and we thought we were done.

Fast forward to today and they call me. I don't pick up, because I don't answer unknown numbers. Then, instantly, my mother's phone rings. She picks up, it's the same freaking debt collectors.

Apparently, they don't believe what we said about him being a previous tenant.

525,"Hi, I’m a 16yo, european, and i’ve been in a relation for almost an year. This is the first one for both.

A little backstory:
Some time ago i showed Reddit to her, and I convinced to install the app (yeah i know i know, stupid move but I didn’t thought a lot about at the time). After a while i noticed that some question where a little strange and biased about my... “sexual situation”. 

We both are totally virgin, but we had a little fun together, but after installing reddit she became a little more reluctant to have fun together. No problem, I don’t really care. 

Fast forward a week and while peeking her reddit phone i saw some nsfw female... particular subreddit about dating (sorry not gonna name it). I didn’t cared to much.

Fast forward to 3 days ago and she asked me if i beated my... beef, and how much. I was genuinely shocked because I didn’t expected by her such a sensible question, but still i said that a do it, in particular during the quarantine. After this she got REALLY angry about, saying that it’s basically cheating, that i can’t wait for her and sincerely other bs.

I’m gonna be honest, I know that we wouldn’t had in any case a long relationship, but i really like her and I don’t want to end it like this.
It would be really simple just leave her but i would fell guilty, because then she will hardly find anther boyfriend with such “requirement”; moreover I basically made her discover reddit, so it’s partially my fault.

I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this. I recently got into a fight with my boyfriend [20F]. I don’t know if I want to go into details about how the fight started yet.

But this is why I’m upset. I was molested by my music teacher when I was probably around 6 years old. Coping wise, I’m relatively mentally stable, I don’t have any diagnosable mental disorders. No one in my family knows.

I’ve told my bf about this. He agrees it’s fucked up. But he doesn’t seem to understand the concept of triggers. I think his friends are assholes and they’re scummy and immature. I get uncomfortable that he jokes/laughs about it, and when I try to explain why, he immediately gets annoyed/angry and says it’s not the same thing.

We had another fight about this just a few hours ago. He got angry at me being angry and called me things like “dramatic bitch,” “stupid,” “SJW,” “nosy,” etc. He always says I make a big deal and that it’s not the same thing so I’m being dramatic.

I feel really lost. We’re almost getting to our 2 years of dating and my birthday is real soon. Feels like a really shitty way to break up. I recently heard a quote that someone can love you, but that doesn’t mean they respect you and that’s how I feel right now. My bf has shown that he loves me, but he also disrespects me a lot. I also feel like he’s way too immature to understand the gravity of the situation. He just thinks I’m a “social justice warrior.”

I want to know if I’m overthinking things. Do I or do I not have the right to be triggered by certain things that are unrelated?

531,"My(23F) boyfriend(23M) and I have been living together since spring break. I finally was able to go to my hometown and pick up clothes so I decided to clean out his winter wardrobe so some of my clothes could fit. 

I found a shirt. It was clearly a sorority Tshirt, far too small for him. He played it off as a gift and I asked from who, “my ex.” 

The ex he bad mouthed our entire relationship. I told him I would not be putting that away that was up to him, he took it and said, he’d use it to wipe the gym equipment down in the garage. 

Later that night, I came across it in the guest room. Memory came back from when we first started dating, countless two year old pictures of him and his ex across Facebook. He told her the same phrases he’d tell me. 

I did say much, until he asked about a pic on my Instagram from a trip I took to California on an adventure date with a guy. Said guy flew me over after meeting briefly on vacation and we had a Grease-style summer love. I removed the picture. 

He kept all 50+ images of his ex on his Facebook. After a couple of days, I asked if he still had feelings for her. Voiced how I felt. He deleted the pictures. 

Forward some time later, he asked why I had said guy from California on Instagram. Given that I had over 2K followers, he didn’t stand out much. We hadn’t spoken in a very long time even before meeting boyfriend. 

Then I look, he had his ex. 

I didn’t say anything until a heated discussion sparked boyfriend to say that I had liked California’s post. He still had ex on Facebook. She kept up pictures of him from 2018, still tagged too. 

So tonight, while he slept I grabbed his phone and searched his Facebook to realize he had searched her on her birthday. He unfriended her that day. He hadn’t spoken to her in years. He didn’t even read messages random girls sent him since we met. Not on Facebook, Instagram , or twitter. 

Now I’m confused as to how did I become so insecure over something so small. Should I come clean? How can I communicate to him that his behavior felt like his attention was on her. Is the T shirt that important to focus on? 

TLDR while cleaning boyfriends closet I found his ex’s shirt. Grabbed his phone and snooped all over and didn’t find anything. Now I feel guilty.",14May2020,1
532,"I’m not sure if there is any advice on what to do, but it’s worth a try. Just to give some background, I (20f) live in an area where every kinda knows each other, as a lot of us went to the same school, or schools nearby and it’s common to bump into each other while out and about, or at clubs etc. 

Anyway, there is two guys from my school that I used to be moderately close with, one I was seeing for a while when I was like 15, and one was just a friend. (These guys are pathetic, and are known to drive around drunk for no reason, blaring music).

So moving on, they are both compulsive liars and will lie often to make themselves look better, (e.g, one of them lied about their workplace etc). So I bump into them sometimes, keeping it short and sweet, I’ll be nice and whatever but I don’t really care to converse with them for ages because tbh they’re just annoying.  

The problem is, for a while now people would come up to me and ask me if I slept with one of them, but I brushed it off thinking, who really cares but it just got worse... more and more people would bring it up and it made me feel like shit, because I would feel like I have to really deny it as it’s just annoying because it’s not true. A while later I confronted him and he denied ever saying anything. I left it. It continued. Then my friend said she overheard him saying that were fuck buddies or something, so it was clear he was spreading those rumours for sure and my boyfriend got involved (maybe a bit too aggressively) as people would start telling my boyfriend tht I’m sleeping with him and cheating on him, which is not true and my boyfriend believes me. Things calmed down.


Fast forward to now, my boyfriend, who can get pretty jealous, messages me saying tht he was told the other guy has been saying that we’ve now slept together and I’m literally at my breaking point. 

It might sound like I’m being dramatic, or I should just ignore it but it has caused me relationship problems, and gives me so much anxiety. Whenever I get a message about a rumour, my heart sinks and I feel like I’m going to throw up. Why won’t they leave me alone? I literally mind my own business, I can be a bit too nice but Idk. I’m just tired of it. My boyfriend is hotheaded and close to doing something about it, which gives me even more anxiety - I don’t want any trouble.

Sorry to ramble on, but I’m just interested to hear advice, if there is any.  Thank you guys.",14May2020,1

So  I (F25) am babysitting for my SIL so she can work (nurse). I am  babysitting my nieces (Twin 5 year old girls) and my nephew (6). I have  no children experience other than them. I have baby sat them before but  not this often and not for this long and not always alone (if my fiance  is home he helps).

Since they are  not in school I had printed some worksheets off to do with them, as I  was trying to do fun but educational things with them.  However, that is  all now lost as I have lost all patience for the one twin. I am at my  wits end and exhausted/annoyed/pissed and have no idea how to handle  her.

So the one twin lets call her  A was sitting on the couch watching tv with me. The other twin, lets  call her B sat down beside her and started kicking her and annoying her.  I asked B to move as A was annoyed and telling her sister to stop  kicking her. She refused to move because she was there first (she wasn't  A was there first). When i asked her to move again she started  screaming and throwing a fit. So i told her she was going to the corner  for a time out.

She started  screaming even more so I picked her up and put her in the corner. The  minute she was down B kicked me . So i told her that her time out was  now doubled. She kicked me again so I told her it was tripled. She tried  to hit me so I told her that she lost her tablet all day and that if  she keeps that up she will lose all privileges for the day (tv, toys,  outside, everything) and that she would be doing school work all day  while her siblings got to play, She went to hit me again so I told her  she lost everything and that she could choose to sit at the table and  calm down or she could stand in the corner until she calmed down. She  then looked at me and said ""you are a bitch"" so i grabbed her and put  her on the couch, turned the tv off and gave her siblings their tablets  and told her she gets to sit there all day and do nothing.

She  started screaming ""I want my tablet"" for about 10 minutes straight. She  tried to go over and take her sisters tablet and I took it back telling  her she didn't get it for the day. I asked her if she acted like this  at school and she said yes. So i asked her if she wanted to show  everyone that she was a brat and she said that she wasn't a brat. A then  piped up that she was acting like a brat right now and to stop.  She  tried to take her sisters tablet away again and I told her that if she  tries that one more time that she will be going to her room with nothing  but the dresser and bed and staying there until she can listen/calm  down. She then kicked me twice so off to her room she went, where she is  now until she can listen.

I am at  my wits ends with her. I have tried reasoning, punishing everything and  nothing is working. I wanted kids before this but after babysitting for  a month I am seriously doubting my abilities to be a mother. I am like  so angry right now that I am shaking, I have no idea what to do with her  because I know I can't leave her in her room all day (she will destroy  it, shes done it before) and I have no more fight in me to argue with  her and keep dealing with her freaking out.

Hello guys,

i’m crying as i’m writing this. 

when i was a kid and adolescent (until i was like 15) i had a high libido and used to make out with a few guys and everything was fine. then i had a boyfriend who was 30 when i was 15. yes. looking at it now, i feel so disgusted to even think about his face or that he ever even touched me...it makes me really sick and its really hard for me talk about it. he never assaulted me though and when i told him i didn’t want any sexual contact anymore, he respected that. we never had intercourse btw. luckily. a year ago i started to date someone new (my age) and had a very high libido for a few days but then it just went away. i think i have attachment issues too but this is another problem i’m not talking about now. my problem is that for a year now i barely wanted any physical/sexual contact with men but over the months it got worse and it actually makes me cry to think about a man having sex with me. i feel so disgusted by men although i know most men aren’t like that but still. the fact that they’re horny already makes me vomit, idk why. i’ve seen a video on youtube today where several women talked about men harassing them online and sending them d pics and nasty messages etc. i started crying watching it and idk what to do anymore. the thought of a man touching or hugging me, even shaking his hand (especially when he’s old) makes me so uncomfortable. i think over the years i just realized how disgusting some men can be and this has definitely contributed to my rejection. i even wish i was a lesbian because sexual contact with men scares me so much.

so i’m writing all of this because i want to know has anybody the same experience?? 

do you think i should see therapist? thanks in advance. have a nice day.

My Mom and I were very close in my younger years but grew slightly distant (not in a negative way, just sort of life got busy type way) and my family member informed me that she had left a message for me. 

So emotionally this all feels very weird and kind of wrong. Especially because I typically don't generally believe in psychic or medium readings because I know how intricate their scamming system can be... But I'm also the type of individual that doesn't want to be entitely dismissive of things I don't understand. I do believe in some form of afterlife, but I just don't see how a human could form a connection to the spiritual world.

I'm torn about listening to the message or the session because I don't want to have an emotional response to something that is fraudulent and disingenuous. But on the flip side my curiosity is strong. And maybe just microscopically maybe, there's something real about this? I don't know.

This guy is a major Trump supporter, reposts insane shit from people like Alex Jones and Glenn Beck, and seems to be a Covid-19 truther. Basically, by all indications, just a nightmare of a person. I am concerned about having a neighbor like this, mostly because people like this tend to be loud and obnoxious about their political beliefs, and enjoy provoking people for no reason. I am very liberal, but I’m mostly a “mind your business” and “live and let live” type. I also discovered this guy works on motorcycles for a living. I was very excited to be moving away from noisy apartment neighbors, but fear I’ve jumped into the fire with this decision. The deal isn’t finalized and I can still back out, but I can’t decide whether this is too petty of a reason. Maybe I could just build a wall between us (and make him or Mexico pay for it)?

537,"I really need help. I feel so paranoid. There is this teen friend app I use to meet new people, and You can only talk to people around your age. (Example: if you’re 18+, you can only talk to people that are 18+ as well.) so I started using the app, and met a girl on it who’s age showed as 19. We started flirting around and talking about sexual stuff, mmmm she was going with it and engaged back, and then she told me she was actually 16. I felt so weirded out and blocked her. I thought nothing of it, and moved on. For some reason I’ve been super anxious, and paranoid lately about it. I’m not sure why. I made the right choice and blocked her right after she told me her real age, and delete that app off my phone so nothing like that happened again. I am in NO WAY into that stuff, but I am not sure how many other people I’ve talked to who have lied about their age. I’ve since removed all the girls I’ve met from that app off my social media accounts. I’m so nervous and could use help.",14May2020,1
538,"Hello everyone. I feel very glad to have discovered Reddit Community. This is the first time where I am sharing everything that's bottled up for a long time.

I am 27 years old (M) and will turn 28 in September. I am from a South Asian Country. I was born into a lower-middle-class family and had an alcoholic father. The environment in the family was toxic. He is an artist and he started drinking when he had started his own company and it didn't work out. The school didn't care much about our monthly fees because I and my brother performed well in our studies. I was always torn between loving and not liking my dad. We had a tough time managing the finances at home. Mom has always been a fighter. Meanwhile, I discovered 'stories' and 'films' when I was in school which later on happened to be my outlets to the monotony. I applied to one of the prestigious high schools of our country which I got into. My family was very proud. My dad seemed to get better and was fighting against the addiction. But it wasn't getting better which I got to know later on. I couldn't match the pace with what was happening. I failed the first unit test. And the dean called my previous school's principal and shared about it. My family was so disappointed. I couldn't study. I even hid an answer sheet after the examination is over and managed to get away with it. I lied to everyone and said I didn't know how my paper got missed. Teachers made me take the test again and I thought I would pass it the next time but I failed at that time as well. I feel bad for this. I feel bad that did something like that. I was so lonely. I could see my friends studying hard and also having fun. I couldn't do that. I wanted to be in a relationship but couldn't approach anyone. I started taking tutoring classes when I was in high school. I scored 70% in high school on average. I had degraded 10% as compared to class 10. High school got over and I started to teach in this institution to support students of class 10. A girl fell for me for the first time and I felt like it was morally wrong to date your student. She was two-three years junior to me. I used to message her these long messages in Facebook and we would talk a lot. There is this thing with me regarding intimacy. I have always to connect. Well, she felt I was getting overly attached or was afraid that things wouldn't work out, she asked if we should stop talking. We didn't even meet while we were dating. We just chatted for a week and she felt overdose because of me. I got so fucked up. As there used to be fights at home all the time, I always fantasized of running away. I wanted to run away and thought that I would be part of this dreamy world that I believed that it existed. I almost didn't appear for Chemistry's finals because a day before the finals, I got into a physical brawl with my dad and I was so disturbed. I wanted to have a girlfriend but couldn't share with anyone and I was one of those utterly shy types. I read about a few filmmakers and thought to get into the world of storytelling. I lied to my family saying that I was going to study in my neighbouring country (we don't require a visa to go there) and left to the city where they made films. As my parents aren't that educated, they didn't ask for documents and such. I bought a ticket and headed to a place where I had never been to. I was so fucking naïve and stupid. I slept on the streets, did all the odd jobs, got abused, and happened to destroy my inner self. I wandered around in a new country where I didn't know anyone and did jobs here and there. I still can't go out in the sun because it reminds me of those times. I even went to a brothel and slept with prostitutes. I feel so bad. I feel like I have hidden this from everyone and I am a bad person. I couldn't fit into the practical world. At all. I used to miss my family a lot. Although I dislike dad for what he did, I always wanted to create a better environment for him, younger brother, and mom. I used to call them sometimes and feel that one day I am going to make something of me and create this world for them; you know where I can see everyone happy. There was a calamity in my hometown and I had to return back to my country. Everyone was happy that I returned back home. I thought of developing a few ideas into scripts or writing books. I love writing but haven't had the discipline to create something. I planned to teach for a while but happened to teach for four-five years. Last year, I said to myself that I should take a step towards my dream and stopped teaching. I applied for a few workshops and got selected into one which led to work as an intern in a feature movie. Well, after it was over, I couldn't land another job. I think I try my best while doing a job; however, it has never been good enough. I had to go back to teaching again. I am already old and have this sensitivity issues. A song can make me get into the deep part of the blues and not be able to do ANYTHING for hours. I crave for connection and intimacy. Almost all my friends have married and everyone has progressed. Here I am; a pathetic person, who always made excuses and didn't do anything good for him and the family. I am a selfish prick. I think of killing myself sometimes. My brother has started this small company and was about to get profitable before this Corona thing. Parents are getting old. Dad hasn't stopped drinking. I have zero saving and zero degree. It has been 10 years since I passed high school and I haven't accomplished anything. I go to brothels and sleep with prostitutes because I crave for connection. I don't think anyone would want to be friends with me if they know about this habit of mine. I am addicted to masturbation and porn. Almost like dopamine addict. I sometimes fantasize of applying to somewhere abroad for studies. I imagine myself in relation and studying something that I am passionate about. But I don't think any university would accept me with this gap after high school. A friend of mine was saying that if one scores well in IELTS, one would be accepted even with the gap. I don't think I would score well in that test and I don't believe I would be accepted even if I did. I see young kids in high school and I see the future in front of them. I have let down many people in my life. I feel like a burden in the family. I can't do interns sorta stuff as I need to support my family. I am depressed and suicidal at times. I would have done it if it weren't for my parents and brother. I think of making it look like an accident, you know. By the way, there was this teacher in high school who came to my home and gifted me a few books because I couldn't buy them. You know what I did? I contacted one of his friends if he would accept me in his university. The guy then asked him and he hasn't contacted me since that episode. I let him down as well. I can't fit in. I don't fit in. Why did the hell god create me? I want to talk to someone and be there for them and start anew. Do you think I can do this in this time of my age? Is there anyone who would like to have a conversation?",14May2020,1
539,"My boyfriend is “studying” over zoom every day with a his classmate (F29). He never met her in real life as their class started during isolation. She found him over Snapchat and they started snapping each other every day.

We been together for 4.5 years and we live together. I am (F21) usually study in the same room as him. However, as soon as that girl messages him to go the zoom meeting cuz she has a question he asks me to leave. I asked him why can’t I stay and he said that he doesn’t want her to know that he has a girlfriend. He said that if that girl likes him it might affect their studying and he doesn’t want to ruin it. 

The girl also has a kid 8 years old but she is single. Also, I found naked pictures of her over the internet. She also messages him at 1 in the morning, sending jokes and telling him about her life.

for the past few months i’ve been messaging a guy who was a mutual on instagram. things seemed to be going well on there, so we started texting and facetiming and really hit it off virtually, but refrained from hanging out due to the state of the world lol. 

he’s really REALLY sweet and affectionate and we get along quite well. rarely do i feel this sort of attraction towards just anyone, so it’s been really nice getting to know him. 

we decided since we’ve both been self quarantined for a few months -without any symptoms of the virus- that we’d take a chance and hang out since things seem to be dying down in our areas anyway. (not the smartest decision, i know, but we’re being careful and it’s just us so) and we had a really great time!! we hung out all day and laughed and kissed and we both really clicked. 

however, i slept over and that’s when things got kinda eh. his dick is really small. like, real small. sex wasn’t bad but definitely not very good. and even though i think literally everything else about him is perfect, the sex being bad is, kind of a dealbreaker right? 

should i just tolerate the bad sex and hope it’s gets better with time? should i dump him? how do i dump someone for having a small dick): that’s just so mean!! i don’t know): i really don’t know what to do",14May2020,1
554,"Hello, I am 17 and get overwhelmed and upset quite easily. I don't like crying as I feel it takes away from any point I was trying to make. 

One example of this happened just this week. My mom and dad sat me down and started lecturing me about the usual, doing stuff around the house and the like. I agreed until it moved on to talking about me getting a job and basically just berating me about not having one yet (I should mention it was mainly my mom and my dad was just there, chiming in every now and then). They've been wanting me to get a job since 16 but I was sitting pretty important exams that year (ones that would determine me getting into uni) and so I wanted to put it off until I was done with them (also I was scared of getting a job). I was going to start applying for jobs during this summer but due to covid these plans fell through. 

I explained to them my plan and how it didn't work out but, as usual, my mom started laughing and saying it was bullshit even though I have told them this plan before. I tried to insist that this was my plan and that I really wanted a job but my mom and dad kept laughing and shrugging me off, telling me that it was a lie. 

This is when I started to get upset because they never take anything I say seriously, I am basically just a lier with their head in the clouds to them. They think I'm useless and lazy and that I don't care about myself and others. I started to get angry and overwhelmed and I could feel the tears try and push their way out. I tried to cover it up but my mom obviously saw me and started laughing at me more, calling me a baby. She wouldn't let me leave when I tried to get away from the situation and calm down so I was stuck there crying like an idiot which ruined all chances I had of getting my point across. 

I felt that in that situation I could've handled it much better if I didn't start crying and just kept a level head, that way they may have believed me and would take me seriously but I messed it up. 

How do you stop yourself from crying in stressful situations? I feel like this would be a good skill to have and would greatly appreciate anyone that could offer some advice. Thank you so much in advance and sorry if this isn't the type of thing to post here, I can take it down if so. Thanks again and have a good day!",14May2020,1

557,"I live with my mum , step dad and two half siblings. Over the last 5 years my mum and occasionally my stepdad has done emotional and physical abuse to me including shoving me into a way and hitting my head with a TV remote. My mum would also tell me off by saying that i'm an 'idiot , retard' e.t.c

&amp;#x200B;

In februrary I could not stand it any more, and told my school about this. I told them everything that happened and they sent a social worker who told my mum that physical violence was not ok. I thought that would be the end of it

As the coronavirus lockdown started, our relationships have gotten worse. We both wanted an apology from each other and things went badly. She continued calling me names and I locked myself in rooms sometimes to ensure some temporary safety. She would get angry at me when the door would eventually be forceably opened and tell me not to do it again.

Ive realised now that they are probably panic attacks, and I cant really stop them. She still thinks Im only pretending to be angry.

&amp;#x200B;

Last weekend my mum and my stepdad had an argument . me and my siblings were out in the garden at the time and when I came in my stepdad went up to me and shouted about how this is all my fault because i keep locking doors and never act on my mistakes. Personally i dont think they're mistakes and even if they are my parents are over-reacting (i haven't seen anyone get that mad about a 13y/o not going up to bed at 9.30). So anyways they made me stand in front of the table and asked me if i want to stay here or go live with my dad. I geniunely did not know and said that. I kep repeating i dont know and stepdad smashed a mug out of anger i suppose. Also scared my other siblings by doing this. Eventually i couldn't hold it in any mroe and started crying . I went to the corner of the room and said that im scared of them. i then just kept repeating this and i thought they got the message as they just went up and left me alone

&amp;#x200B;

now today my mum just told me that i need to act on my mistakes and I just bursted in anger. i had another 'panic attack' where i cut some potatoes and threw them on the floor. dont know why but yeah. I guess my mum was scared of me with a knife as she thought i would suicide. Ive actually thought of this for a while now and as she said it i just thought 'actually why not' and held up the knnife to my arm as if i was going to cut my arm. she grabbed the knife from me and put all the knifes in the kitchen away

i've calmed down now but i know for a fact that this will keep happening despite how many times social workers come and tell her not to do this. Maybe it is because i have some mental health issues and i'll be fine once i start taking antidepressants or something. but before then i am genuinely scared of what i or her or my stepdad will do and i dont know what to do at the moment. sorry for the grammar and spelling errors my hands are still shaking as i type this

558,"I need some help. 

I'm currently studying full time at a university and submitted a Centrelink Youth Allowance claim around March, only to be rejected because of my mum's single income being too high for me to receive payments. I only moved to Australia 8 years ago, and for the first 5 years I lived with my cousins, but moved in with my mum once she got a stable job and have been living with her since 2017 until now. Since then, my mum would fail to provide my sibling and I with adequate meals, and has rarely financially supported us. To add to that, my mum has been the main cause of my mental health problems, from her constant emotional abuse for years. Over time, I had seeked mental help from my school counsellor, mental health clinics, and local GP who have referred me to psychologists in private, but when my mum found out, she prohibited me from seeking mental help, and would then deem my mental health as irrelevant and make me feel as if I was delusional. My family circumstances have been bad for years since my father is completely out of the picture, and my mental health had only deteriorated to extreme circumstances, and I cannot even get treated. Since COVID-19 started this year, my family circumstances had worsened. I had to quit my job before COVID due to unfair treatment, so I cannot even qualify for jobseeker/jobkeeper. So ever since I started university this year, my mum had forced me to pay for rent since ""I'm 18 now"". My main source of income is through tutoring a high school student online, which is around 40/week, and 100% of this income would go to her for what I assume is ""rent money"". Despite working from home now due to the virus, my mum would still not supply my sister and I with any meals, even with her having a lot of free time, and had us resort to buying our own groceries and preparing our own meals with our very limited money. I have had to borrow money from friends just to supply myself with food and have enough to pay for rent. 

Because of the overwhelming emotional abuse I experience at home from my mother, as well as 100% of my income going to her, I decided to move out of the house and rent a room and live by myself. I called Centrelink to inform them of my new address and to ask if my Youth Allowance claim's outcome could change from dependent to independent, even with the 'Unreasonable to Live at Home' forms filled. It would be difficult for me to convince my mother to fill out this form, as she has chosen to completely break all forms of contact with me ever since I moved out. I also cannot get a licensed psychologist/counsellor to be my third party, since my mother had literally prohibited me from going to one. The only person I could consider would be a close friend who is aware of all these cirumstances. Right now I'm living off of barely no income, and in debt to friends from having to give my mother money, and Centrelink staff member basically tells me on the phone (very rudely)  that I probably wouldn't be eligible to be independent and would not get payments, from her assumptions that my family circumstances were just ""my mother wasn't giving me pocket money"" and ""that I'm 18 and I'm old enough to look after myself."" Since my mother was never PHYSICALLY abusing me it seems like to Centrelink, this would not be enough to be considered ""Extreme family breakdown"", despite the constant mental abuse, and the inadequate support, etcetera. I'm at a loss on what to do, and do not even know what to put in the forms, because it seems like to Centrelink, they have very subjective ways of deeming what is considered 'UTLAH' in these forms. 

TLDR; I moved out of my family home due to extreme mental abuse from my mother, and due to COVID, I am living off 40/week from online tutoring and loans from friends. My Centrelink Youth Allowance claim got rejected since my mother earns too much. Centrelink call employee tells me I most likely won't be considered 'independent' if I filled out 'Unreasonable To Live At Home' forms, despite explaining my circumstances. To add to that, I have no licensed counsellor to fill out the third party form as my mother prohibited me from getting psychological help.",14May2020,1

I’m a 15 year old boy, and a pretty decent guy who has a decent set of friends.

564,"Hi Reddit, Let me get straight to the point, I was a pretty aimless kid, all i ever wanted to be when growing up was a Soccer Player, but that didn't work out, so i didn't really have something i wanted to do, i knew i didn't want to be stuck on minimum wage all my life, and i should go to college, get a degree and go from there, i laid out all my options, and decided on those that i didn't ""Mind"" doing.

The problem is, College needs a lot of dedication and patience to get through, and you can't power through on the power of ""not minding"", you need to WANT it, so you can get through those all nighters fighting for the future you want, i dropped out 3 times, convinced myself i was useless because i kept spending my family's money and my own time, that i should just go to work on a Minimum Wage job for the rest of my life.

But i had an epiphany, I'm from Portugal, 1 week ago, a little 9 year old girl was murdered by her father, beaten to death, mercilessly, there was an history of abuse, but no one ever did anything, and it culminated on this innocent girl being beaten so badly that she was in agony for 13 hours, until she had a seizure and succumbed to her injuries, this sweet 9 year old girl, died a terribly painful death, at the hands of her own father.

I started looking into more cases like this, and stumbled upon Gabriel Fernandez's case, Very similar, the child was tortured for 8 months, Injuries were well documented and social workers knew this was happening during these 8 months, no one ever did anything, and his stepfather ended up brutally beating him to death, he wasn't fed, he had cat litter in his stomach when they autopsied him.

I read into other cases in my country, and i made a decision, i was aimless after losing my only focus in life, i didn't want to be anything else and i didn't have the strength to finish what i got myself into because deep down it wasn't what i really wanted.

My Parents got divorced when i was 5, from 5 to 10 years old my Mother had a boyfriend who beat me in ways  you only see in bar fights, smashed my head against tables, kicked me around, punched me, the whole nine yards, they broke up, and then for the next 10 years, until i was 20, she was married to a man who physically assaulted me over 20 times in several occasions, many of those after i turned 18, and almost all of them while he was drunk, however, Emotional abuse and neglect were a daily occurence, she knew, about both, but she always sided with the boyfriends and husbands and whatnot, she wasn't a good mom, no matter how much food she put on my plate, she was not a good mom, so i looked back on my own story, how i never got the help i wanted, how these kids got it even worse, they never got the help they needed, and they died for it.

That's what led me to this epiphany, i want to become a Lawyer,one that specializes in these types of cases, in child abuse, that's my  vocation, that's what i'm meant to be, to put monsters like these in jail, to protect other kids in these conditions, to save them from these monsters, to make sure, less children go through what i went through, and even less go through what those poor souls went through, i want to make a difference, i want to make the world a better place, i want to put as many of these monsters in jail, i feel like i finally found a purpose, a goal for my life,i know i dropped out many times, because i was doing it just so i didn't have to work a minimum wage job, it was the crappiest reason i could be doing it for, it didn't give me motivation, but this, this could be my legacy, this is what i want to leave behind, someone who fought to protect children who went through the same he went through and even worse, is it too late for me?

571,"For the past months I’ve been trying to be more socials, or rather, closer to people. And since it’s something I’ve never really done before, it super scary. I’m 30, and even tho I’ve had people around me all my life, I’ve been avoiding close relationships, (except romantic ones)
I have this unbiased fear that people will hurt me, for example use the information they learnt about me to hurt me deeper. 
So I make shit up. All for myself. I get myself to think people don’t like me, because its easier to take pain of you’re prepared, right? It’s easier to make up a reason yourself so I don’t need to hear what others think about you. 

Even if the truth is exact opposite of my delusional-thoughts, I keep going back to those thoughts.

I have so much safety, love and wonderful things around me, why do I doubt people’s intent?
I even have people who explain that to me, every god damn day, that I’m ok, nothings is wrong. Why is my head so thick that I can’t take that in?

572,"So some background my little brothers (b1 has severe autism and type 1 diabetes and B2 has ADHD and kidney problems) (I myself have a form of epilepsy which is being tested because we aren't 100% sure what's wrong with me and this is something to keep in mind). My parents have improved from what they were and show even more progress of changing (whole other story) but they fail to take some responsibility on helping my brother's learn and because of the virus they (my bros) have had no education since the start which didn't sir well with me.

Now I'm in college which is stressful enough and I've been getting secret therapy (they don't know I have a therapist) so I constantly have to juggle multiple things at once which is very difficult and they don't do all that much. My parents have tried to keep me calm but it's more of a don't bish about life instead actively trying to be apart of the solution. 

I've basically had to start neglecting my own work so that I can teach them or get things they need because they aren't prioritizing things well at all. Now because of their mental health conditions I've had to juggle different methods at the same time which is draining and honestly dangerous for myself because one of triggers (the epilepsy and hung I have) is stress and the process of teaching them both is rewarding but honestly tiring and heart breaking (I say that because they start to get a bit weary around me because they're scared I'm going to end up hurting myself because of my condition). 

My father recently although he pays attention with everything else he's been more fussed about his video games and my mum flat out refuses because she ""can't""; now my mother has also been shown to possibly being on the autism spectrum as well (some reason no one's thought to check) and flat out refuses to do alot of things and will often rely on me as the parent figure which is unfair but at the same time I don't know what to do to help her so I try my best.

The advice I'm asking is what can I do to tell my parents they need to be involved more with my siblings when it comes to their education (something that should be said is that I'm often told it's not my problem since I'm not the parent by both my parents as well as others). Also some on if I'm over reacting to this and if I need to step back and let them do whatever they think is right.",14May2020,3
573,"Hey. I didn't really know where else to post this,  but any advice at all would be welcome so i thought this might be the place for it. 

I'm 19 and started a new job at a small icecream place that also works as a drop off place for packages about 2 and a half weeks ago. The first week (only did maybe 10-15h) were unpaid bc my boss was shoving me the basics of how to do stuff. 

It seems like I'm the only employee for now bc i haven't seen anyone else around ever. 
After the first week my boss gave me the keys and chip to deactivate the alarm system so i can open the place, do my shift (we only stay open 6h due to corona) and close the place up at night. 
He has 2 other jobs so he's never around,  I'm always by myself and responsible for everything, from taking the icecream delivery to paying the people from the post who come pick the packages up at night to selling and cleaning and everything else that comes with the job. 
Which i don't mind, i like it,  but I'm by myself so if i have any questions i have to figure it out by myself and in those past 2 weeks I've made mistakes ):
The list goes as follows:

• switched up the barcode and the receipt for a few packages the first day i was on my own so we had to phone the people who had dropped them off and ask them to give us the barcode back 

• i set off the alarm 3 times when opening the shop and had to call my boss so he'd explain how to turn it off 

• last night i forgot to turn the light off over the counter and 3 people called him between 1am and 2am to let him know. 2 days before that he had reminded me not to leave it on and when i left i thought it was off bc it's so dim but apparently not 

•and most importantly during my first week we were closing the shop together (so imo this wasn't my fault but he said it was and he told his wife and friends) we both forgot to make sure the front door was locked so in the morning someone tried coming in thinking it was open, set the alarm off, police arrived and called my boss thinking someone had stolen stuff. He was understandably shook. 

I feel so dumb and like it must seem like I'm a horrible employee, like. Is it normal to make so many mistakes? Am i just really dumb? 
There's many things i do well, but my boss isn't around to see it. Idk.  For all my other jobs i was never alone so this was never a problem:/

584,"Several months ago, I was holding a giveaway for three different products and the winners were randomly selected via random name selector generator. One of the winners lived in the same country, the other two did not. Two of the winners received their prizes (one in the same country and one not), and the third one did not.

The package was in carrier hell for several months, I assumed they got the package until my mailman came up to my door with the package last month saying that the package was not accepted at the address. I’ve got a few witnesses that heard him say it albeit they’re family. When I looked up the tracking information to go through the history of it, it doesn’t show when it was sent to the country, but it shows when it was sent back to mine from the country.

He messaged this last week asking where his package was and that he’s been waiting for several months for it and I think he may be trying to get something else out of me. I have not responded back to his message yet. 

I paid shipping for all these packages too, I’m not in a position where I can do this again right now. I probably am under no obligation to try and “fix this” for this person where they didn’t accept the package, but I would like further reassurance on this or to be told otherwise and why. I would love advice on how best I can resolve this or at least cover my butt as much as I can. I’ve done giveaways and prizes before in the past and have sent stuff within and outside my country and have never had an issue until now.

585,"Me (21M) and my little step brother (8M) we're playing with a football on the trampoline together earlier today and he had the idea of a playful situation where I act as the daddy and him as the son, where he wanted me to hold him in my arms whilst we bounce on the trampoline so that he could go higher. I had no issue with the game itself but it was just that he referred to us as father-son, although I realize he is just a kid and playing in fantasy it still freaked me out quite a bit and I rejected the game.

In the past he has referred to me as his father, and the first time he did I told him that I was not his father and that I was his big brother and that I always will be his big brother, that he has a dad but that he isn't currently here. Our mother has never explained anything to him, nor did she ever with me about my own father who I have never had any form of contact with. But there is no doubt that as the only male in the house, especially with the age difference, he naturally considers me as a father figure and I don't quite know if or how I can mitigate that?

I have always cared for him in the way that I would expect from a strong brother-brother relationship, such that I cook him food when our mother is out and he often plays video games in my room where the play station is. This essentially stemmed from when he was growing up when I used to babysit him a lot because our mother was out often. I would cook his food, watch a movie with him / play video games then put him to bed and this would be quite a frequent thing. I did agreed to babysit him because it seemed right at the time but I do not like the idea or pressure of being considered as a father figure at my age and it really freaks me out when any form of the idea gets brought up in any way.

I'm still trying to put my own life together and figure everything out and I just can't take the pressure of my brother relying on me for that kind of support. I say no to him a lot to set boundaries and it makes him quite upset, but he is very obnoxiously persistent and nags me to go on the play station with him all the time, to watch a movie with him, etc. which I understand could be normal kid stuff but I can't help but think that his behavior in particular is exacerbated by daddy issues. In turn this makes me feel guilty and like I'm a bad person for rejecting him, he just seems confused and I'm afraid his dad's absence will result in a stumped development such as mine, but then I also realize that his problems aren't my fault, that he is not my responsibility but that doesn't make it much better and I care for him deeply as my brother and friend.

What do I do to stop him thinking of us as a father-son relationship but rather a brother-brother relationship? Is this possible with such a big age gap in a fatherless home? Could I be at fault here or are his parents absence to blame?",14May2020,1

First we had to write a guide on a certain topic, mine was Laser cutting. I can speak German at a level which is enough for my social life but sometimes falls short on complicated texts like these. So I copy pasted some of my guide from the internet. I know it is wrong but I wasn't understanding much anyways so I couldn't find a different way out. (Turkish information about this topic lacks because Wikipedia was shut down for several years and all other websites were just laser cutting companies promoting their procedures.) So later on my teacher said that it was copy pasted but she didn't say anything else. So I asked her if I should do it again. And her answer was ''Sure you could do it, but only if you understand what you are writing.'' So this kinda got on my nerves but I didn't say anything. Later on we started doing online classes. It was all good for a few weeks but then my teacher created new accounts specifically for her class for us but no one mentioned that to me. And so I wasn't getting any new notifications about classes or homework etc. I later found out from a friend of mine that there was class that day. So I told my teacher that I wasn't getting any new notifications and asked if she could help me about it.  She ignored my question and later on during that day a guy from my class asked the same thing and she answered.

And she asked us if any of us belonged to the risk group. But of course she asked that in German and I didn't understand what it was. I translated it to Turkish but it wasn't making any sense. I had never heard of the translation. I went ahead and asked her what it meant and she ignored me again. After 5 days I got really pissed and confronted her (sort of.)

600,"In order to progress at my company I have to take let's call it a ninja exam. It requires nine months of grinding, crying and suffering. I failed it last time honestly and bluntly because I did not study enough (why? I am already a corporate lawyer and just can't take another exam. I am just worn out. And I am not interested in said ninja exam). As it is expected in my company I signed up to retake the exam this November. But I don't want to take it. I can't make myself study for it. No, my bosses don't know that and they expect me to pass. 

I was told last week that I sadly can't get promoted this year without said ninja exam. I am furious. Overall I like my job and I really really like my team. I've been with the company for four years and it was my first real job (studying law takes a lot longer where I live than in the US). What should I do next? 

Another twist the story: we are currently trying for a baby (I am 33f). So leaving the company now and then getting pregnant at a new job during probation wouldn't be great, especially as I'd get a year of paid maternal leave here with my company (Europe). Waiting with childbearing until next year is also not great (biology ... age ... wanting to have two children in the future). 

I am afraid that I'm stuck in my career and can't unstuck myself because of our wish for a family. When I fail this exam again I will be not only a failure, but a pregnant, unpromotable failure with in a year or two.

All that stress gone and you won’t have to take those scary exams”. No, you would think that but no, I don’t want grades that I didn’t gain myself. My teachers will give me grades that they think I deserve, and they may be the grades I want but who knows the chances of that. This virus stole that from me

Also, it took the last months of school from me. The last year of high school/secondary school was cut short. I will never be able to have a proper goodbye to all the people who I grew up with. The Government said we will have no exams and no school one day and it wasn’t even with a warning or a sign so no one could prepare. 

Next to that, this loneliness is killing me. For the past 2 months, I have only been able to talk face to face with 3 people, my parents and little brother. I love them but I see them everyday no matter what. I miss talking to people my age at school and hanging out together. I miss being able to relate to people. I mean my heart goes out to those who are having to isolate alone without family, I couldn’t last a week but still, I miss my friends just as bad

Next is this pressure on the media and everyone on social media I know being pressured to tell everyone and promote to everyone that they should be doing something. Learning a new skill like learn a language, learn an instrument, build something etc. I have been isolated from outdoors for 2 months and I haven’t done shit and I feel terrible for it. I don’t know why and its stupid but it just feels that I have wasted all this time for nothing. 

Next is my fucking government is in absolute shambles. Failure to communicate to my people and country. It just makes me stressed. If we don’t beat this virus soon, I am scared for how long we will be here. My dad says 2 years. I can’t take that. People keep going outside to be defiant and stupid and I just get this feeling that the virus will never end. I have to keep up with the news though, I need to be updated but I can’t say it doesn’t make me scared for the future

And finally, I miss my fucking friends and family. Especially my family and relatives. Like I said earlier with my dad who thinks we will be in this mess for years. I can’t imagine not seeing them for that long. I’m worried for them to. I am fortunate to have a very big family. I actually have over 40 cousins I see and talk to regularly and obviously with that a loud of aunts and uncles. But I don’t know when I will see them again. I’m worried for my grandparents the most. On my mothers side, my grandparents love going outside, my grandfather never spends a day indoors. I’m worried how this is affecting them. On the other hand, my dads side, my grandparents are just very frail, they are both in their late 80s and they live in London, a very crowded place. I am so scared they will be infected. 

And this is minor in the eyes of some but this is very personal for me. Every year since I was born, for 17 years, my entire extended family on my mums side, they live in Ireland, travel to this beautiful place in Ireland called Castle Gregory. We have been going every year and it is so special for me as it is the time I get to spend and live with my family and the people I care about the most. Plus, its just a blast anyway. If you ever get the chance, you should go. This virus will most certainly stop me from going as I live in England. I am not allowed to travel and even if I was, I would have to isolate for 2 weeks and I can’t stay with family or my family can’t afford to stay in a hotel for 2 weeks. This will be the first year where we can’t go and when I found that out, I wanted to cry. It felt silly but I did

I just don’t know how to process this pandemic anymore. I am tired of all the negative news and I am tired on my own fucking house. Tell me, I need advice on how I should cope with all this information and how can I accept what is happening for the next possible 2 years of our lives in this pandemic.",14May2020,1

Let's say he is thrusting but because it's been such a while before he's last had sex, he reaches climax earlier than normal.

606,"So it was my birthday and I couldn’t get over the fact that no one said happy birthday to me. My dad said a lousy happy birthday over text which meant nothing to me since I know he doesn’t actually care. 

I asked my mom at like 10pm why she didn’t even wish me a simple happy birthday and she said that apparently I told her not to. Well this was a few days before this happened and she ignored my birthday.

She basically said we should go to the store and buy a cake or something and I just said that I didn’t want to make a big deal of my birthday because I sometimes find my birthday depressing, especially with the lockdown that was happening.

So we had to go 3/4 across the day for me to remind her that she didn’t even say happy birthday to me. She seemed like she regretted not telling me happy birthday when I told her she didn’t say it. I mean I had told her not to make a big deal out of it, but not make me seem like nothing and that it was just a worthless day.

609,"Work in a family construction business and will be the only successor (unless it is sold). Have enjoyed the industry but find myself tied up with safety to keep employees safe and building regulations to make sure our projects meet and exceed code (have a perfectionist mentality). Sometimes I think it would be nice not to worry about the potential for someone to fall off the building, have a trench collapse, or someone getting seriously injured in day-to-day activities - the very nature of construction is dangerous and there is a lot of risk/liability for construction companies.

I wear a lot of hats and find myself getting burned out, questioning whether I want the responsibility down the road to run the company. It probably sounds like I am being ungrateful considering it is a rare opportunity but I also question if I will be happy with even more responsibility. I have considered furthering my education (and am in a position that would allow for that) for construction law, real estate finance, and even IT for construction (another hat I wear) but also wonder if the best opportunity for my life has already presented itself.

Well, we'll call the person I'm talking about George. It's not George, it's me. The situation started with an argument, and that's when I tried telling George we should keep our distance/not be friends anymore. (Which I believe I handled incorrectly) George didn't handle it well; they cried and got really upset. I felt incredibly guilty so I just said it was my fault and I wasn't thinking right at the time. My other friend, who will we call Jennifer, was going through obstacles, and noticed George's behavior, she told me her problems and was worried about George, so I checked up on him.

611,"Throwaway account, because they all follow me on my main account.

I (21) 'm a college student and my brother (19) was still in school before the crisis.

My brother has had a (first) girlfriend since last year. They had been sleeping together, either at our house (we both still live with our parents) or hers. My brother and father had several discussions on how he can't bring her over all the time, and he can't be away constantly. Back then we of course had school and such.

But as it turned out, the family had some problems themselves. A manipulative mother and a father that didn't dare to go in against her. Father moved out of the house at the start of the pandemic. And because of the new rules, my brother convinced his gf to come and live with us and convinced our overcaring mom. 

She's here now all the time and they don't leave the house often. She's apperently also not that talkative. At the start I would ask her questions and either she'd respond very brief, or my brother would answer for us. We talked about it with him, but said she just needs time. It hasn't changed yet and it gets really awkward sometimes. She hardly dares to be arounf us without him and I've stopped to instigate conversation.

I wanted to do it again tomorrow because it's a significant day, but in this last days I washed everything I own including a mini clutch that I emptied without realising that the earrings were in there, and they were lost in the laundry machine (this one it's an infamous item for this kind of accidents).

615,"When I (21M) was 12-13, I was sexually assaulted by a black girl multiple times. This same girl and her sister also broke into my home while my family and I were away and attempted to bribe me with snacks.

As a result, I don't particularly trust black people, especially not sexually, and it's to a point where I'm on edge whenever a black person is nearby.

Now, I'm not shouting the n-word at them or supporting the KKK or anything remotely heinous like that, but I find that whenever I hear about people like Mike Brown or Ahmaud, I can't help but focus on the fact that they're black and my distrust, but still recognize that what happened to them is bad.

I find this comes up whenever race issues come into play,  I have to remind myself about empathy and how I would never want such a thing happening to me. In fact, the effect on my politics is probably the least concerning thing to me.

Rather, I would like to break the fact that I don't trust black people. The last thing I want is for me to do something I regret because that person happens to be black, especially since I hold myself to a high standard in that regard.

TLDR; due to my sexual assault, I don't trust black people, but I keep it to myself and don't support racists or racist politics",14May2020,4

617,"I've been severely depressed for years. I'm just 23 and my whole world has fallen apart. I no longer have a personality or a sense of self. I am completely blank, and sometimes I have to take cold showers just to remind myself that I'm actually alive. I cannot describe in words the pain that I feel every day. Every single day feels like groundhog day. It's the same bullcrap over and over again. Therapy didn't help me at all and I hate it how everyone just keeps insisting that 'I haven't found the right therapist yet'. I have tried therapy with many therapists over the course of 5 years and it didn't help me at all. If anything, I just kept getting worse. I've been on meds too including a bunch of SSRIs, SNRIs and sedatives but it seems like nothing is helping.

&amp;nbsp;


I am going down the rabbit hole. I have been engaging in really reckless activities because I just don't care anymore. I drink myself to sleep and hate myself in the morning because of the hangovers. I started self harming again. During daytime, all I do is play video games or literally just stay in bed, contemplating suicide. During the night, I usually don't get any sleep because of my anxiety. Other times, I just masturbate compulsively during the entire night. My physical health isn't too good either and I am having really bad days when I throw up everything I eat and I just feel like I've been hit by a meteor. I have scoliosis and my back hurts most of the time. My stomach also hurts to the point where I sometimes curl in a ball and just cry for hours. I've undergone many medical tests to see what's wrong with me but all my results came back fine. At this point I believe my physical illness is psychosomatic, and it's a result of my terrible mental health.


I have started self harming again. I don't sleep. I don't eat, and when I do, I throw up after every meal. I don't drink water. I can barely get out of bed. I lost my job due to covid-19 and I'm stuck at home with my mother who I hate ardently. Even when I used to work, I would gamble away all my money. I just can't stop making stupid, harmful decisions and it's tearing me up. I no longer have a drug dealer/drug connection since graduating from college and moving away and I was craving drugs like crazy. So a few days ago I stupidly decided to order drugs off the deep web and now I feel terrible about it since there's a chance that I might end up in prison because of it, in case the pack gets seized. I just can't stop doing stupid things and then feeling like a complete idiot. 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like there is no hope for me. I have no motivation to get better and all of my actions consist of me intentionally trying to fuck myself up. At this point, I lost hope and I don't even expect to ever be happy again, all I think about is death and a good part of my time is spent thinking of how I should painlessly kill myself. I don't know what to do. I have no goals, no motivation and no desires. I feel like continuing to live would just be a waste of time and resources.

620,"Ok, first, when I say *Goddaughter* I mean that in a nonreligious way, but I will get legal custody of both girls if anything happens to the parents. I love these kids like my own.

Anyway, she told me she likes girls and is starting to have crushes at school. She was isolating herself. 

**Side note**: *I know it's a trend right now because  sexual orientation is so saturated in everything currently, causing children to be introduced at a very young age, MUCH younger than we were, to sexuality and all that entails. I'm also aware that, while I, as a grown adult, realizes effortlessly my personal orientation, kids are much more influential. I also believe some people are born that way and some have chosen preferences.*

Anyway, talking to this sweet girl, watching her cry was heartbreaking. I GENTLY asked a few questions- what makes her believe that, etc.... and come to the conclusion this is the real deal. I told her to talk to her mom; her dad's a complete asshole. She was afraid to tell anyone and I told her there's absolutely nothing to be ashamed or afraid of. Her mom had been my soul sister for 20+ years and know for a fact she would be accepting. She talked to her and we thought all was good. 

So that took place a few months ago.... So here's the problem....

We just found out this beautiful little girl, who is only 9, is cutting herself up and down her arms and has been hiding it with long sleeves. When asked why, she began sobbing. Apparently people at school were being mean to her because they thought she was weird- she isolated herself. She also said her sister was extremely mean to her. She feels alone and really sad. 

While Corona helped take care of the bullying, her older sister is very mean so she stays in her room, alone.  She doesn't have any friends and doesn't talk to anyone except my kids and her sister. My kids are the same ages as both girls and completely accept her. My oldest told her she's her friend no matter what but we can't get the kids together that often because *life*.

I just cuddled up with her on the couch and held the precious girl until she cried herself to sleep. I don't know what to do and neither does her mom.

The older sister is consistently disciplined and reprimanded but they're still sisters who share a room  (12 &amp; 9). Sibling rivalry is going to happen.

I was a cutter so I do understand the appeal. My story was so much different though so while I can empathize, I don't know what to do to help this baby girl.

I was also bullied (Grade 8) at that time (which was my fault) for screaming at a teen in Grade 10 for hitting up on my friend, which was a girl. They bullied me, it was only one guy but all of his friends were there. That made me insecure in my junior highschool days. 

I had a girlfriend in Grade 10. We lasted 2 years and a half. She cheated on me after our first year. She had sex with another guy. She told me that just after our second anniversary. She kept it for a year. I was loyal to her but she put me through hell. She was manipulative and always tried to threaten by leaving all the time we fought. I became toxic that time too. It was a very hard time for me.

There is never a normal day for me and usually I sleep through the days to avoid any conflict but there have been many many many many many moments of calling me a whore and slut and a disappointment and a useless daughter,bitch,twat,cunt etc etc. multiple physical fights and bruises and many sleepless nights where I feel afraid to come out and unlock my door for fear that they will come back and try to do something to me. I have called the cops and was told that I was gonna be arrested but didn’t because my parents said not to (even though they have told me they wanted me gone and locked up) and I have called cps which didn’t help either because my parents soon turned it against me and used cps as a threat (still do) to send me away.

But my Mom(65) ,who I live with, takes Covid-19 extremely serious, like washing her hands with Clorox and panicking whenever she goes to the store. I just got my first job ever yesterday at a fast food place but my mom wants me to quit because she’s scared I’m going to give her corona. I feel guilty because she is in the minority due to her age and can easily get hurt from the virus if that happens.  She knew I was looking for a job. I asked her why she didn’t stop me when I went to the interview and she told me she didn’t think I was going to get the job :( she’s going to force me to quit no matter what because I’m underage but what should I say when I quit ? I also don’t want to burn a bridge and have the rest of the town blacklist me. I need to go in today but my mom doesn’t want me to go but I thought I had to give them 2 weeks notice? She wants me to tell them I feel sick and can’t come in. Her franticness doesn’t help.

Also, does anybody have any suggestions on how to make money over the summer at home or where I have less interactions with people?",14May2020,2
631,"I (28 M) am really curious about the work of actors do on the job. Although participated in a script writing in elementary school and I was a leading role in a skit back in high school and we won the first place, I don't consider myself good at it by any means and I am not trying to explore my acting career at all. I don't know if there are groups nearby (USA) that are looking for amateur actors just to help them out with their small film project. Simply thinking about myself reading and preparing for a script can be a little exciting. I feel like this can be a rare need because they can probably direct and act all by themselves.

632,"Today I was at this posh chain vegan store with my mother. After cruising the store for a bit I went to look for some oyster sauce in the soy aisle which was adjacent to the cash registers but didn’t not end up finding it. Once my mom was done we headed towards the cash register, we paid and as I was bagging the stuff we bought the cashier kept on giving me dirty looks. After a bit she spoke up and claimed she could see a bottle of (unpaid) soy sauce in my bag, I was taken back by the accusation so I simply stared at her blankly and didn’t say anything, my mom spoke up and opened her bag assuming she had been talking to her, I then also opened my bag and showed her what was inside. The cashier refused to look, but she kept up this annoyed accusatory tone and kept reporting something about trusting us, but looked really skeptical. As soon as we walked out I lost my shit (I do not have the best temper) it’s been an hour and I am still thinking about the events. I think the reason why I am so upset is because I have always been really proud of my “moral code” and I pride myself in being a person who sticks to her principles at all times. In the midst of my anger fit I proceeded to call the rest of my family and tell them the story, draft up an angry letter addressed to the store that I’ll never email and work on an elaborate plan involving me buying 10 bottles of soy sauce and throwing them in her face. I 100% get that I am being super irrational, and completely overlooking the privilege I have had for this to be the first time I experience this shit, but I guess what I am trying to say is, am I taking this too personal?

I texted my friends telling them about what happened. They also think I'm being ridiculous about this and even said they are going to the dentist next week.

We have done quite a lot of theory as our practicals only start the beginning of next year (due to the coronavirus pandemic). To get into the practical course, the university selects a handful out of 140 students by looking at their portfolios. Submissions are only next year so I have sometime to add more things.

So far my portfolio includes :
- 48 hr film competition 2019 (in charge of lighting)
- Short film made for the National Blood Donation 
- A university project short film
- Quite a number of home videos I had done in highschool
- An old YouTube Channel of mine where I edited clips from 2014 - 2019. The channel current sits at 12k subscribers
- Some scripts I've come up with 

I feel as if I should be doing a lot more in pursuing a career (hopefully) in the film industry.

636,"Using throwaway.


My (20M) girlfriend's (20F) mom has stage 4/5 breast cancer spread to the liver and bones and she was initially given a prognosis of 15-20 years on some medicine (doctors estimated 6 months without it). Her mom had been feeling super ill recently so she was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with lactic acidosis, which is a really serious condition and the mortality rate is 75% and the prognosis says that most people aren't able to survive for more than 28 hours.

Losing a mom at this age is something that should happen to nobody and while my own mother had breast cancer and beat it I was far too young to fully comprehend what was going on. In this situation I want to help my gf as much as I possibly can, and make sure she helps herself, but I'm quarantined 350 miles away from her. It's a really stressful time in her life with because of this, her summer internship being cancelled because of corona, and just general anxiety because of the pandemic and college going virtual. I can't even imagine what she's going through and I understand she'll need a lot of time before she even thinks about helping herself but I just wanted to see if anyone had any advice for me to help her deal with this, but more importantly for her to help herself. She's very good at compartmentalizing and deflecting to focus on the tasks at hand but deep down the her mom's condition has always been eating her away inside and she tries to bottle it all up and rarely releasing it. We don't know for sure what's going to happen but the facts say that it is likely that her mom might pass away anytime withing the next day, week or months. I'm afraid if she bottles everything up again she might lose herself and it will be (even though it already is) too much to deal with. She is also really angry and frustrated that her mom kept avoiding going to the doctor throughout the years which means her conditions could have been prevented from getting this severe / she could have beat her cancer. Along with her father, she also has a little brother (13) who she will have to emotionally support and I can't even imagine what her brother will go through because having something like this happen at that age is absolutely brutal and can shatter his focus on school and could completely alter his life. My gf is also currently working a part time job remotely and is taking 3 classes at college.

I am committed to my relationship with my girlfriend and we both hope to marry each other one day. I plan on fully respecting her space if she decides she needs it. I just wish I knew how to help her more because when she texts/calls me to tell me about this stuff there is not much I can offer other than patiently listening, letting her talk through her emotions and me giving generic empathy advice. While I understand I may not be able to completely put myself in her shoes and give her profound advice that really changes her headspace, I would appreciate any advice to help this situation.",14May2020,2

Coming home for the summer, I carried this same sleep routine with me, getting up around 10am. I went downstairs and my parents immediately had this pissed off attitude towards me. They had a talk with me saying how waking up at 10am is unacceptable and lazy and not fit for a young man like me (They are always up at 7-8). I replied that 10 is not even late at all, in addition my summer classes are all in the afternoon, so I’m not gonna skip any lectures. 

This set my parents off over the edge leading them to say I have no “ambition”, ”self control” and “your gf will dump you once she finds out what a lazy pig you are.”

My dog is 11 years old in human years and I think she is close to dying. She has squeezed herself into a corner where nobody can reach her (it’s an area in the garage where there’s lots of piled stuff), she’s barely moving, not eating, not drinking water, not anything. I placed her water bowl beside her and some chicken strips but she didn’t touch them.

I was expecting to grow out of this by now and am starting to believe it will never go away. 

I have always felt this deep rooted hatred for everything about myself. It’s not even emotional, but a feeling of objective dislike. I just can’t stand being around myself. I hate how I look, I hate my personality, I hate everything about me. I would not kill my self, but every single day I wish I didn’t exist. I genuinely believe I am the scum of the earth and do not matter. My family all tells me how great I am and I couldn’t care less.

645,"So a little background about me. I’m a 22-years old female. My family( mom, dad and brother) and I moved to the US when I was 12 and we currently live in New York,we don’t have much family here other than my aunt(dad’s sister). 

I am currently in college for Pharmacy but for a while now I have been feeling like I want to take a break from school because I’m not sure this is what I really want to do in life and I don’t want to keep wasting money on school for nothing. I have taken a semester off from school before to help me figure this out before but it was not very well received by my family and just caused more bad than good which wasn’t helpful. In the past I have almost moved across the country to Washington state but that failed due to me being young and stupid and not doing proper research and ending up in a shit hole in the middle of nowhere. 

After I came back home, I went back to school like I was expected to and have been in school since then.  When I was across the country, I met someone and have been talking to them ever since and have visited them and got to know the state better and I actually love it there now. So I’ve been applying to jobs for a couple of weeks there and I might potentially get hired for a job there very soon but I’m not sure how to bring up this subject to my parents. They are kind of old school and I know they won’t take it well but here with them I always feel very pressured and stressed and I know I would be much happier moving there and being on my own and potentially starting a relationship with the person I’ve been talking to for a while now. 

I know with this whole Covid-19 thing happening it isn’t the best time for this but being stuck with my family during this quarantine had just made me want to move even more than before due to a lot of fights and issues that have happened in the family during quarantine.  I know that as parents they’re worried for me and don’t want to end up in a bad place but I do have a person there that I trust and I know would be there for me if anything was to happen. I also have money saved up and have been looking at places to live and done my research so I’m not just going into this blindly. So I’m just not sure how to tell them that I’m moving across the country possibly in a few days if I do get the job that I’m waiting on right now. 

TL:DR: how do I tell my kind of old school parents that I got a job across the country and will be moving in a few days?",14May2020,2

650,"Hello everyone. I need some advice regarding health and fitness. I recently starting working out and eating a cleaner diet. It is something I have done in the past but never stuck with. I would like to lose 20lbs (I’m a 29yr old female, 4’9” and I think around 130-135) but I feel like that is so so unattainable so I would be happy with 10lbs to start. Anyway, my boyfriend went back to work two weeks ago and since he has been out of the house, I find myself slipping back in to old habits. Ordering take out, then feeling too sluggish to work out and then feeling so guilty and disappointed in myself to the point that I cry and become depressed. It’s like I need someone with me 24/7 watching what I eat and what I do. When my boyfriend was home he would keep me disciplined and focused. He really helped me. I just don’t know why this always happens to me. My biggest issue is food. I actually enjoy being active, I was always an active person even in my work life, it makes me feel good. But what is the point in working out if I can’t get my diet right? My question is, if working out and eating right makes me feel good, why am I so quick to fall back in to old habits? How do I stay motivated when there is no one around to help me? How can I stop relying on food for enjoyment and pleasure? I mean, I am obsessed with avocado toast but instead of making that today, I ordered a heavy breakfast from ihop because it looked good. WTF?!

652,"I [23F] finally graduate college next semester after lots of ups and downs in my college career. I went to a private school on a full tuition right after high school in a pretty competitive program and did extremely poorly my first two semesters causing me to lose the scholarship and transfer to a state school after taking a semester off. After 5 years (5.5 if you count the semester off cause I took some classes during that period at a community college to mentally cope). I should’ve realized that STEM wasn’t for me after my first two semesters but my dumb self enrolled in Biology at the state school I transferred to anyway. 

Fast forward to present day and I have no idea what I am going to do with my life after graduation. I don’t know what jobs I’d even start applying to and my gpa is so low that my original plan or becoming a PA has long since been thrown in the trash. Even nursing school is pretty out of reach. I do have an interest in the medical field and even got my emt certification junior year to get those much needed patient care hours required for PA school but I haven’t utilized the certification at all. I hate lab and research based things and never enjoyed my labs in school so going into academics or research is a no (basically I hate 9-5s and staying in one constant environment) 

I currently have about 20k in savings from waitressing all through college and have thought about opening a restaurant (obviously not enough cash to yet) with my S/O. My parents are not well off but have said that they are willing to invest 100k in a business (they used to own and operate a take out restaurant). They are currently out of state but plan to return in a few years to settle down in my state. The passion for the business is there on my part but I can’t stop the feeling of stress every time I think about the huge chance of this first business failing and me losing my parents hard earned money (1st gen immigrants). 

My dad has also always been extremely adamant about me working in the medical field since I was a kid and although he doesn’t actively pressure me, every time I talk to him on the phone he says that he’s willing to do whatever it takes (money wise) to support me through my schooling, no matter how long it takes. My mom on the other hand, I feel has picked up on signals that I’ve lost interest/passion for the medical field (or at least the schooling for it) and has told me to just basically do whatever makes me happy/whatever it takes to support myself. 

Conflicted on where to go at this point. My options are to either 1. Go back and take a bunch of classes to raise my gpa enough to maybe go to nursing school and then become an NP in the future. 2. Take the chance and save to invest in a restaurant 3. Find a low paying job I’m qualified for with my degree 4. ????

Back in 2016, I fell in love with my guy best friend. I confessed in 2017. He rejected me. My heart shattered. 
2018, he started to feel for me too. We got together. Everything was perfect. 
We spent 24/7 with each other. 
But school work and exams came up, we were always hanging out and talking so our school grades were going down. 
Few motnhs before exam he broke up with me all of a sudden one day. His reason ""I lied to you, I never loved you""
That's the second time I got heartbroken. I had enough. I had rebounds, did everything to forget him. 
Later he told me, the break up thing was a lie. Just for us to focus on school again. 
We got back together but I lost feelings for him, I didn't tell him. He still loved me. He did everything for me. 
But I was wreck less, I ruined it all. Id never listen to him when he was sad, didn't give him time at all. He kept forgiving me. 
2020 February he stopped talking to me.  
He had enough. 
He doesn't love me anymore. 

But I regret it. I still love him. I do. 
He has changed. He is very salty now. 
I begged, he is very rude about it. 
He says he'll never love me ever again. 
But I'm in pain. I really want him back. 

He makes a joke out of it when I beg and cry. He says I hurt him on purpose. I didn't. He had fully changed.

665,"I'm 31(M) living with my parents, no health insurance working a physically demanding job and I just injured my right forearm.  The pain is severe and limiting my mobility and a hindrance on my work.  I cannot afford taking off of work to heal nor see a doctor for treatment.

I can't keep going like this, I've been doing bullwork for the past 15 years.  It's what I've always been good at, the heavy lifting rough labor jobs.  However, I'm seeing now more than ever this is unsustainable.

I have a BFA in animation but the job market in that field is miserable and played a big part in my decision to enter my current field of employment.  Other than outsourcing most positions to other countries for cheap labor, nepotism, and workers' inability to unionize, I also didn't want to ever hump the passion out of the only thing I care about just to make a paycheck.  The freelance market is also nothing I want to be part of.  Regardless, while I do have an education beyond HS, it doesn't do me any good and left me in student debt that I'm still struggling to pay off.

I have no idea what to do with my life but I need to change it fast.  I wish I could leave everything I've known behind and start over somewhere else, but that's a pipedream.  I don't speak any language other than English, but I'm willing to learn and integrate myself into another society if I can find a way to make a living elsewhere.  I'm getting to the point where my last resort of eating a load of 12 ga. birdshot in my bathtub is looking more and more appealing.

Does anyone have any advice on what to do?  Any leads for jobs and cheap housing near you that someone with my skillset can look to?  Any foreign friends live somewhere where their government isn't trying to lowkey kill them/keep them in poverty?  Please help, life is a drag and I hate feeling doomed.  I'm in crippling debt and have no means of escape",14May2020,1

668,"I am currently staying with my partner that has a 3 year old cat, Korra, that we both love and adore.
Here's the issue. I'm a light sleeper and he can sleep through anything. Every night about 2-3am Korra uses the side of the mattress as a scratching post and fully wakes me up. I am now wide awake. It takes me awhile to try and fall back to sleep. She does this again around 5-7 as well. I end up with very little sleep. 
I've started having to close her out of the bedroom at night to get some sleep. Turns out, my partner hates that I do that and wants her to be able to sleep with us. 

Do you see any other options or compromises here?
 I've tried spraying the bed with deterant and each time I see Korra scratching the bed during the day I gently tell her no and push her away. I've actually done this enough she doesn't scratch my side of the bed anymore, just my partners. She also has a scratching post in the living room.",14May2020,1
669,"Soooo. Recently I was prescribed a non-opioid based painkiller for some irritating RSI-related pains.

The medicine itself is pretty well protected. It's a scheduled drug. Because of that I pick it up once a week.

This week it came in two foil strips. In the past it's come in all forms. But importantly this one was TWO strips with 7 capsules. I picked them up on monday. I take one twice a day. I come to take todays second one and, oh shit I can't find it. I dig through my medicine area. Nothing. I DO remember binning a load when I picked these up on Monday... and the binmen come on Tuesday. The last half of my weekly medicine has been binned. Along with others. I just have an OCD thing where if medication arrives with spacers or blank spots in I remove them.

I've no idea who to contact over it. In normal times I'd be able to contact A&amp;E where they would replace the binned ones. (I did this before but with a less serious medication).

671,"Hey all.

So right now I am at 18, which is a huge crossroads obviously. So far in my life I have been a good student; my parents (and myself I guess) pushed me to do medicine, so now (I just finished my freshman year) I'm in a 7 year MD program with my commuter, low-reputation state school satellite in Illinois.

Life seems awful any way I turn. I have been miserable this past year (probably mostly due to my gay feelings + having no friends), so I applied out for transfer admissions at better schools. At this point, I have two choices.

1. transfer, and either pursue a career in comp. sci., econ, or maybe even engineering - I don't like any of these fields, but I don't like anything anyway
2. stay, and complete my medical degree here and have residency done by 30

If I choose the first option, I will probably have an easier time exploring my sexuality, since my current school is a commuter school and is pretty conservative (and I hate it here). At 22, I'll have an okay job (maybe) but it definitely won't be something I'm psyched about.

If I choose the second option, I will have a harder time dealing with my homosexuality, and will have a slightly more relaxed if restricted career. I'm not excited about medicine. At 30, I'll still be lost in terms of my sexuality, and everyone will be getting married and me? Let's try our luck buddy.

All of this sounds absolutely awful. Especially awful is that I won't have a normal life. Wife and kids? Nope, not if I act on my gay feelings. What am I going to do as a 50 year old? Get fat while I sit at home wishing I had a wife and kids and someone to spend my time with? I'm so awfully sad and I don't know which way to turn, what to do anymore.

Thanks, would REALLY appreciate someone's help right now.",14May2020,1

674,Hello reddit. About 20 minutes ago I went up to my room to get my iPhone charger. It was not there so I went back down and asked my family where it was. My mom said that she took it because the charger that stays in the kitchen was gone. She asked my brother and I were it was and we both said that we didn’t know. She of a sudden got really really angry and started yelling and calling us liars. I told her that my charger has my name on it and that I never took it. My brother said the same. After yelling a bunch she went up to her room and found another charger with my name on it (I have no clue where that one came from) and called me a liar because I placed it there without her knowing. I was outside with my sister all morning and I swear to the lord that I didn’t do that. My parents are calling me a liar and are getting mad. I told them to get a lie detector. I have no clue what to do. I don’t know why she got so angry from a Danm phone charger. My mom has some serious anger issues.,14May2020,2

One if my friends has a teenage sister (16) who likes to confide in me(25F). She really is into social medias. She wants to be an influencer and wants to do music videos. She also talks a lot with men which are hitting on her but she says it makes her laugh. She met a guy online (18) and she became friend with him. She saids he really understands her and gives good advices. Far from now he didn't seem to say inapropriate things to her. He accepted to become her ""manager"" cause he knows a lot about music. He said he would find her a cameraman and when the covid situation ""ends"", they will do shopping together, they will make videos (in public spaces) and that she won't have to pay anything. I don't know what to think about this guy. She doesn't talk about it to her parents because they are against this music thing and I am not confortable with her meeting internet boys.

basically, (im already so fed up cause i've written the same  text so many times lol) i have this habit of recording myself. just to see how i look, cause i guess thats one of the most accurate things you can do, to get how you're perceived by others

anyways, lemme get this short. it always changes. like, rn, obviously i feel shit, cause i wouldn't even come on here and write this. i feel shit. i feel so fucking ugly, its indescribable. i dont know if its how it really is. or if its only in my head. or is it the angles?

basically, hour ago approximately, i felt godlike. but now, i feel so fucking shit. i dont know how to avoid thiss.

and yes, this mood changes happen everytime i see a recording of myself. i really dont get how it works tbh. but in some videos i look so good, and in some so bad. should i just stop this habit and go with the flow? at this point i think im a bit obsessed even.

yall have no idea how tiring it is. happens everyday, numerous of times.

i really want to somehow avoid it.

like its almost unbelievable how it changes. rn i feel like a humanoid, with no chin, and jaw. nose sticking out too much. how would anyone love me?

but like an hour ago i felt like a male model.

honestly, is it just the bad angles? should i just ignore them? but its hard tho

i dont know how to stop this. because, again, its so tiring. imagine going thru that everyday, numerous of times.

and, yea. i know that both of those feelings aren't real (Well, i hope that the highest i feel is the real one lol), i try to rationalize it. but it affects my mood heavily, and also the way i treat others. i get aggressive.

basically, what should i do? i need some sort of advice, besides ""go to a therapy"" one",14May2020,2

I didn't give anything much thought from there until one day we were talking and I realized he was using old things with other women before me which ended up making me feel super uncomfortable and like I was not good enough.

In Primary I was always the 'gifted kid' and for a while my mum considered sending me to a private school to not 'waste my gifts', but really I was just extremely average. I pretty much went along year 7 quite happily and it was all relatively okay stuff, but in year 8 some things happened and I ended up in counseling and at that same time I found myself at a total block and my grades seriously suffered with it.

It's been about a year and a half since I ended counseling, and for a while I was a lot better. But as time passed, it's started getting worse again and I feel just as bad as I did before. I can't focus for shit in class(especially in tests), I'm making myself throw up just to skip school, I'm not doing most of my work in quarantine, my grades are seriously awful and my mum is pushing and pressing me to be the top of the class when I really can't do it.

683,"Currently in NYC and quarantine has spurred our need to move

My husband and I (both 33) were planning to leave NYC in the next year as we’ve both been here 10 years now and don’t want to buy a house here since it’s so expensive and not the lifestyle we want. We originally wanted to use this year to travel the country to see what we liked, but given COVID that’s not an option for the foreseeable future. Ideally we move in the next year and rent for 1 year to get the lay of the land before settling and buying a house. Below is what we are thinking so far for our wish list...based on this any recommendations? 

Nice to haves:
-Culture and diversity (we are an interracial couple and want to live somewhere we won’t be stared at) 
-Liberal/progressive 
-Dog friendly 
-A city with activities and suburbs close by for when we’re ready to buy 
-Good restaurants, we love to go out and enjoy ourselves 
-Hiking, nature close by (terrain doesn’t matter, desert, mountains, water all good)
-Somewhere where the transition from NYC won’t be too big of a shock 
-MCOL would be nice (currently we pay $6k a month in rent, don’t think we could keep this up forever). Ideally would want somewhere to rent $2k-$3k for us and our dogs 

Negotiable/don’t really care:
-For work, we can both keep our current jobs and work remote (need to stay in the US though as we’ll be flying back to NY as needed for conferences). 
-we don’t mind the cold or snow (at least how cold it is in NY, don’t think we could live in Alaska or somewhere it’s cold year round)
-we are flexible between having a car vs using public transportation 


Already lived in and not interesting in moving back due to close proximity to crazy family members:
-Washington (both Seattle and Vancouver)
-Oregon (Portland, didn’t like the homelessness and lack of diversity) 
-California (didn’t like the people in SoCal and SF is too expensive for us) 
-New Hampshire/Maine/Vermont - too much extended family here. Also lacked diversity, at least where we were 
-NYC - the city just feels very small and dirty
-Upstate New York - lived here four years for college and there just seemed like there was nothing to do now as an adult 

I know our list is a bit broad, we just haven’t really traveled the US much and have no idea where to start thinking for our move. Thanks in advance!",14May2020,1

686,"Hi there, thanks for taking a look at my issue. 

So about 5 months ago my car was stolen, and I was in a really difficult position financially (needed a car, but couldn't afford it, and the insurance I had didn't cover theft). I decided to take out an auto loan to buy a used car. I ended up buying a 2002 volvo v70 wagon. The car was \~$3000 with an $1800 extended warranty, and the interest rate is 19%. Soon after buying it I realized that there were some noises it would make (in the body of the car, not the engine), so I took it to get checked out. I was floored: $2800 in repairs - all three motor mounts, all four struts, and driver side ball join/tie rod need to be replace, and I'm told that it's dangerous to drive in the current state it's in. ALSO, I checked carfax, and there were 28 reported items on it from before I bought it! So it definitely went through a lot before I bought it, and the dealer didn't tell me about any of it.

Obviously that's a lot of money for me, and the interest rate is really high, and having to pay essentially the value of the car just to repair it is crazy... plus the warranty doesn't cover things like motor mounts or suspension parts, only the drive-train. Here are some things I've considered:

* cancelling the warranty, bringing down the total loan amount. 
* surrendering the vehicle to the bank, and taking a very difficult hit to my already not-so-great credit
* trading it in for another car with an even bigger loan... -\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_-

Has anyone here ever been in this position? What did you do? Did it work out ok? I'm wondering if the bank would be willing to help me at all in this situation... I have another car that I can drive, but I would need to insure it alongside the one that I shouldn't be driving, which is more money, on top of the monthly payment I'm making. Any advice would really be appreciated! Thank you. 

&amp;#x200B;

2nd. I know it's out of warranty, but they're not willing to work with me on a price for repairs, despite the fact that this is a recurring issue.

694,"So i was with my ex girlfriend for little over a year (so not long at all). a fight between us started when she got too drunk one night and started being verbally and physically aggressive towards me. this escalated to the point where she bit me on the forearm so hard I still have visible bite scars, I retaliated after telling her to let go of me 4 times but the pain was immense, she didn't listen to me and bit down harder so regrettably I got her off me the only way I knew how to in fear of loosing a chunk out of my forearm. She then proceeded to gouge my eyes leaving me with a minor blind spot and retina damage my left. I called the cops and instantly got arrested by them. She went to the hospital and wrote out a report of what happened and so did I, but at the station. she put a dvo in place and tried to push it off as pressure from the hospital.

 I was released from custody and woke up to a text message from her the very next day instantly violating her own dvo against me. foolishly ive replied to the text message and believed her for quite some time when she said that she would get the dvo removed because she still wanted to see me. The months that followed after this where some of the worst ive ever experienced. the amount of mental abuse that i suffered and put up with in that relationship to make her happy was monumental. It got to a point where she started talking to alot of her ex's and I made it clear to her that I felt uncomfortable with some of the sexual content that they where speaking of (dont get me wrong I dont have a problem with talking and being friends with ex's but this was different). I put up with this for a few more months and having the threat of being exposed to police by her if i didnt do what she wanted was really weighing down on me. I became agitated because I didn't understand why she was doing this to me, making me feel the way she made me feel. I was at her house a month ago and caught her talking dirty with some dude on social media and pretty much flipped out asked her why she was ignoring my feelings, after being blatantly ignored as she resumed her conversation with said male, I booted the fan across the room in anger. she instantly dialled DV connect and police arrested me for violating the dvo. I got put on  bail and am currently awaiting my trail. she has been harassing me on social media and sending me photos of the males face that was talking to her implying that they are having sex now, proving my suspicions right about the man after getting abused by her saying i dont trust her and have no respect for her. 

She has tried blackmailing me before with sexual images of myself threatening to send them to friends and family if i didnt do as she commanded, she constantly used the threat of law enforcement on me after saying that she would nullify the dvo. basically i was completely controlled by her and i felt like i had no freedom. she puts things in my mailbox and gets other people to harass me since she cant directly do it anymore. this morning i woke up to police at my door saying she is pressing more charges against me. Ive read a message between her and the male saying that i was just ""a main part in her ideal way of life"" and ""im going to send this Fucker to jail"". shes doing everything in her power to send me to prison. I have what i think may be useful evidence in my defence but im really not sure on how to go about this?

Earlier today I was setting my grandmas phone up and added her too the family group chat I also added my aunt and cousins so it’d be easier to tell everyone her new number. I was supposed to delete everyone after but I forgot to but now my mums angry at my sister for leaving it saying it was disrespectful even though everybody else left as soon as the number was told. My sister was the first too leave and my mum thinks it’s her fault everyone else left “hurting grandma’s feelings” even though I said that Grandma didn’t care. Now I think it’s my fault since I made the chat. Please tell me how to deescalate this stupid argument.

698,"Using a throwaway since people I know use Reddit. I'm also 19F if that makes a difference at all.

A lot of the time I feel as though none of my friends truly care about me. I'm always an afterthought and I'm not really sure how I can be better. All my friends have better friends, people they prioritise, and I'm never anyone's favourite. Everyone I've ever loved always ends up leaving eventually and it makes me think that it's me doing something wrong, but I don't know what that is. I also struggle to make friends in the first place, which doesn't help, so I'm not the social person in the world. I think that with everything going on at the moment, it's just making everything worse.

One of my friends was in a bad place the other week due to the pandemic and I reached out to him since I hadn't heard from him for a while and he thanked me and told me everything that was going on. A different friend was going through something similar a little bit before that where her anxiety was super high because of everything and she wasn't talking much so again I asked her what was up and she talked to me about it. 

However, nobody ever bothers to reach out to me and see how I'm feeling. I just kind of feel like people would be better off without me and that I deserve to be alone. I don't want to die, per se, but I don't think many people would notice or care if I did.

I guess what I'm asking is how can I deal with this?",14May2020,1

704,"Hello everyone, please let me know if there is a better place to post this question. 

I left my previous job (we’ll call them Firm A) about two months ago to pursue an opportunity with another employer (Firm B). I will be the first to admit things were rocky with Firm A, to the point where my bosses sat me down to discuss job performance. In all honestly, I had been burned by this employer multiple times and had completely checked out while interviewing at Firm B. (I know this was wrong to not give 100% before I left, definitely a lesson I have learned from.) At the point where my bosses and I had the job performance discussion, I had received an offer from Firm B and was waiting on an official start date before putting my two weeks in. The key thing here was that nothing came from this conversation, no written warnings, no meetings with HR that I was aware of, nothing. 

Due to the virus and WFH complications, when I put my notice in, Firm A allowed me to take two weeks paid so I would not have to set up a WFH situation only to return everything shortly after. I returned my company property on the spot and enjoyed my paid two week vacation staring at the walls in my home before I started with Firm B. 

Now the issue is this: I have heard from multiple credible people (inside and outside of my previous department) that the managers at Firm A are telling everyone I got fired. In my eyes, this is 100% not true. Regardless of the rockiness, I told them I was leaving, and they paid me for two weeks after that day.

Is this worth bringing up to my previous department head or Firm A’s HR department? My industry is highly regulated and I am afraid this rumor about being fired could affect me negatively in future job searches. I would like to at least ensure I actually walked away on my own volition, and there isn’t some kind of dark mark on my record with Firm A or our industry. 

Thank you in advance for all the help!",14May2020,2

My fiance (female) and myself (male) are both young, and we are getting married tomorrow. I'm currently across the country from her and she is flying up today and we are getting married tomorrow. Due to my job and the situation in the world, I can't leave my state (literally I could be arrested).  Her and I have decided that #1: We love each other and want to be married. #2: The benefits of being married for the both of us right now before August (for her school reasons) would financially benefit us and ease alot of our stresses. The way we want our lives to be, we have a perfect opportunity to be married now and we are no matter what taking the chance.

What sucks, is that our family doesn't agree. They don't mind us getting married and don't think we are too young or doing it to early. They just want to physically plan and nice wedding and involve the family and do something nice. Whereas tomorrow we are getting a court marriage without any family. I wish more than anything we could do something small and invite the family, but they won't come to my state because I am so far and I can't go down there. Not even for a weekend. 

My fiance proposed we hide the fact we are getting married and later this year throw a marriage ceremony when I'm able to go to my family's state and get 'married'. This way they got to throw a wedding and see us get 'married' and my fiance and I can get real married now. I already proposed to some of my family members that we have a ceremony later because we want to get married now and they say it's not the same if it's not the real thing.

709,"My mom and dad are separated. My mom works in Europe with her partner (let's call him R) while my dad is with us. My mom is open with her relationship with her partner and my siblings and I often talk to R through chat, but my dad is secretive with his relationship. We do understand and we want to respect his privacy. But one day, my dad's partner (let's call her L) called our home phone. I knew it was her because I remembered her voice from the first time we met. She was asking me where my dad was, but I told her I didn't know. Then the next day, she called again, but my sister answered the phone and L asked where my dad was. My sister also said she didn't know.

A few weeks later, our maid complained to us (me and my sister) about a woman who calls everyday and asks where my dad was. We knew it was her and we were curious as to why she calls every single day.

Then one time, my dad left his phone at home and it just kept ringing and ringing that I took my dad's phone just to keep it in silent mode. But a message popped up and the sender was mad, saying things like ""WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?"" or ""WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING MY CALLS?"" and I got curious so I opened my dad's phone and I saw all these messages (which were super long) and I knew she was mad. I read some parts of their messages and saw that this woman is often asking my dad for jewelry, bags, and hotel stays. They even went on a trip to Korea and an island in the Philippines and my dad paid for all their expenses.

My mom is close to one of my dad's employees at work (let's call her E) and she's like an informant for my mom. My mom sometimes talks to her through the phone and ask how my dad's company is doing and all that stuff. One day, my mom told us that E told her that L went to our dad's office and was insisting that she stays there, when in fact no one is allowed to stay unless you're an employee or a client. Almost everyone was asking her to leave, but she didn't and created a scene. My mom also said that E told her that L had gotten a brand new apartment and it's kind of sus because she works as a car dealer and car dealers don't earn very much and that she has 2 kids that she supports. My mom got so mad because apparently, at that time, my dad also bought an apartment for my siblings and I but the size of our apartment is just a fraction of the size of hers that my dad paid for. She also got a brand new car with her apartment.

My dad left his phone at home again one time and I got curious, so I opened his phone and read his messages. His oldest messages with her can go as far back as 2015, so they've been together for five years. Five years of asking for this and that. I even read some of their fights and there was this one time where she said ""I'm sorry I won't do it again, please drive me home"" like the fucking audacity she has to apologize just because she wants my dad to drive her home? Whenever they fight, she always apologizes but it's obviously insincere and it's disgusting.

Then last year, we heard from our mom that E told her that my dad had another woman and that she's young, probably 19 or 20. My dad hired her as his secretary and I don't know much about what she talks about with my dad, but I'm sure that she's also asking my dad for expensive things. We've seen her Facebook profile and she's an aspiring actress and she's actually pretty, so why would she date someone that's 30 years older than her?

And a while ago, my dad asked us where we kept our old computer at home. We were wondering why he was asking but we didn't ask him about it. Then our mom called, and told us that E told her that earlier, L went to my dad's office and started shouting at my dad's secretary, calling her a slut and even throwing their log book, smashing the computer in the process. So that was why my dad was asking us about our old computer.

My brother had seen my dad's bank statement for one of his banks and the value is relatively low and that value wouldn't even last for a year of expenses. My dad earns a lot from his company but he just spends and spends and spends on casinos and his partners that we don't even know if he set up a trust fund for us. My mom is worried that if worse comes to worst and my dad suddenly dies, we wouldn't have anything left for us because he spent most of his money on his women.

We tried bringing up the trust fund thing with our dad one time, but he just brushed it off and said that he can handle this. But my mom can't go with that because she wants to be sure about what me and my siblings will get from my dad. My mom has no trouble providing for us financially because of her work as a founder of an international school in Europe but she's worried because if an accident happens and my dad dies (I hope not), she wouldn't be able to take us in easily because the processing of paperworks usually takes about a year and a half and because we can't live in Spain when we're already over 18, and my sister's already turning 18 in a year and a half. If an accident happens and my dad dies before we move to Europe, it will be much harder to handle the paperworks and we will be left here with almost nothing.

We can't just talk to our dad easily and confront him about his women, because he'd wonder how we knew this information. He knows that E is like an informant for my mom and he already warned E that if she continues to tell information to my mom, he'll fire her. We don't want to risk E's job just to confront our dad.

I just don't know what to do at this point and we're worried about our dad and our future, so any advice would help.",14May2020,0

I got a zero on the exam, and my final grade dropped down to a 50. up to this day, i still get flashbacks back to first quarter exams. this happened only sometime last year, and after that exam, I stopped cheating. on my semester and spring exam for that class, I stopped cheating. however, I always think back to that day, and it shatters me how I was once a good student and people are probably judging me. it seems as though my reputation is ruined, and my chances of going to a decent college are lower.

I went ahead an texted my ex sooner, at 2 weeks of no contact. He responded and we texted to catch up a bit. His responses were fast. We met up so that he could help me with something he is more knowledgeable about. After he helped me, we took a walk and caught up for 30 minutes. 

During the walk, he said ""I noticed it hadn't quite been a month. Any reason?"" referring to me blocking him. I told him no reason. He pushed a little more, but I just repeated that. Honestly, I felt like I was in a good place in my life, I missed him, and I wanted to know how he was doing. I didn't tell him all that because his question caught me off guard. Also, he is the one who dumped me.

The walk was filled with a lot if smiling and giggles. After our walk, I told him that if he wanted to hang out he should hit me up. Then I left.

I am a 16 yr going through highschool
I met this person through a class, and it was through their friends that I got to talk to them. They were quite reserved and very VERY shy and I thought it might be nice to talk to them and help them get iut of their shell. They seemed very nice. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks, I got their insta, I didn't get messages at first. In classes they started getting a little bit more talkative and open, which was cool. It wasn't the biggest of changes, but nice to see. I started getting messages after a while, it usually starts with ""Hi Nemi"" and I reply most of the time, occasionally missing some because of time but they were pretty regular. The convos were short and went nowhere most of the time.

Then they became daily, ranging from 2-4 messages per day. Always starting with a version of ""Hi Nemi"" I'd try replying, ""how was ur day?"" ""good good"" etc... They'd go nowhere each and every single time. This went on for weeks. For weeks. I just didn't reply at that point. There was a time where they said ""What did I do wrong"" which was where I made my first mistake. Telling them it was okay because I was busy most of the time. (Which was both true and just an excuse) But I also hinted at the fact that I didn't like the way that they message me daily. They said okay and I moved on. They didn't.

Also, about the cockroaches, you need to get a pest control service in here. The way you spoke about them and that ""they multiply because things aren't clean"" is wrong. Yes they will eat food debris, but they will not go away from just keeping things clean. I tried to get a hold of my old co-worker and his wife never responded back. I cannot get the chemicals needed because I am no longer licensed. You need pesticides in order to eradicate the issue. A perimeter spray will keep the pincher bugs and silverfish out (I've seen both in house), and a deep treatment of the kitchen area. It's not a sanitation issue. You can keep everything spotless and still have problems. You have to kill the source. Cockroaches reproduce every 40 or so days. And they lay an egg containing 50+ babies.",14May2020,1

All of my small part time jobs (training kids floorball and teaching English, as well as housesitting and taking care of pets for people who go on vacations, and the occaisional show I play with my band) are currently impossible to do, so I decided I will seek an actual part time job and after replying to several part time job offers, I got contacted by a security agency. The first weird part was that they invited me to an interview straight away, as in - I got the call yesterday and I have been interviewed today. The company is a well established business.

The interview went well, but was also weird. The recruitment manager seemed to eb extremely disorganized, stressed and over worked and I, by no means, hold that against her, I kind apity her. She forgot that I was still a student, and I got taken to a completely diferent group interview, for a full time exclusive job with really high pay and high expectations. In the middle of the group interview, they found out (I was very much confused, but didn't want to embarass myself) that I probably shouldn't be there and that I am there by mistake, so they asked me to go back to the recruitment manager. I explained the problem to her, she apologized a lot. I said, that is' completely fine, after all - she seems to have tons of work.

She then told me about the job I applied for. (Which is a night shift security guard/camera operator at a well known museum in Prague) and everything seemed fine. Ok pay, long shifts (12 hours) but I think I can managa - I mean, I have no other choice right? So, after her askign some questions about me, I said yes. She then told me a guy, who I assume is going to be my boss, is going to contact me, so he can arrange a meeting in the museum and that the meeting should be asap. (Me and the guy scheduled it for tommorow morning) And I am really confused. Everything seems really off - the disogranized hiring manager, everything should be extremely quick and done ""asap"" I am unsure if they are familiar with the fact that I am a student?

\---

*He is a horrible narcissist who mentally/emotionally abused my mother and I for years. He cheated on mom and when she found out, he kicked her out, ruined her reputation, nearly destroyed her career, caused her to become depressed and moved his mistress in without my say. They mentally abused me for two and a half years until I moved out of there and to my mother's after an incident. A month afterwards, his mistress had a baby boy and they were trying their best to guilt trip me into returning to see my supposed half brother. Spoiler, he wasn't my half brother, she cheated with some other guy.*

*I disowned him five months later, a day after my eighteenth birthday. Dad sent a very backhanded, manipulative birthday card , saying that my “baby brother needs me” that my “actual family misses me” and that he and his mistress “thinks I’m being entitled and need to step up as an older sister”. I was so pissed that I tore up the card into pieces, and I mailed the shredded card back to him, along with a very rage fueled note saying that I wanted nothing more to do with him, or his new family, and now that I was eighteen, he was dead to me. After that he left me alone... for a while. (well, he talked shit about me to anyone he knew but anyways)*

\----

Anyways, onto present day.

In October 19, once my parents' divorce was finalized, mom got a job opportunity abroad and we moved to a different country to start a new life. But after we left, dad found out that the child his mistress had gave birth to wasn’t his. He dumped her of course, but now he thinks we’ll accept him back, no problem. He started calling us, insisting that we should move back after the pandemic and that we should start over again, that cheating and the divorce was a mistake. Mom of course doesn’t buy this shit but the calls are clearly upsetting her. I also get calls from him, saying that I should give him a chance as he is my dad and that I owe him.

We’ve blocked over twenty phone numbers… each. We finally stopped picking up unknown phone numbers but then he’d message us and message me through my social media. He's stopped bothering with my mother as much for some reason, which is good, but with me, he's relentless! I've told him countless times that I want nothing to do with him and after another message request from him, I threatened to call the police on him but mom is unsure if they'll help. I was in a very dark place from 2015-2019 and I can't move on if he keeps trying to contact me. I might have to change my phone number at this rate.

**TLDR: Father was an abusive piece of shit, ruined our mental health, abandoned us then is demanding a second chance from us, even though we have better lives now. I want the cops to get involved, Mom doesn't.**

736,"Hi guys, I am very upset right now so I apologize if this is a mess. I am 21(f) years old and on the Autism Spectrum. I am very mild, so you wouldn't be able to tell if you don't know me well. I feel like a horrible, selfish person and I don't want to be like this anymore. I lose sight very easily of the kindness my family does for me. I feel like I bring them so many issues. I don't know where to start. My parents are very kind to me. They pay for my school, car insurance, phone bill, and help me with my rent while I am going to school. Pretty much everything. I recently moved home because of the coronavirus. It has been very difficult, and I know everyone has been struggling everywhere. My parents are very stressed out with work (working 80+ hours). They do so much. They definitely have their issues, but they are good parents.

Anyway, with all of that being said, I am trying to mature. I feel like I am treated like a child by them, so I look at myself like a child almost. My mom will get very angry and take it out on my siblings (17m)(19f) and me. They will tell me what to do like I am 16 years old. I get overwhelmed very easily, so I often say things I shouldn't during these moments. I feel really bad about myself. I feel like a horrible person. I also argue with them when I shouldn't. I have a hard time knowing when I am in the right. I don't know if I am ever in the right when I am arguing with them. I just don't know how to tell. I am working with a therapist right now because I have so many issues, but I am honestly just tired of being like this. I am struggling because I am such a difficult person. Is there anything I can do to be more self-aware? I am a mess, and I hate it. I hate living like this. I'm really starting to hate myself.",14May2020,2

738,"My parents both work in the cosmetology field where they own their own business as nail technicians. The board in my state recently deemed it okay for businesses in the cosmetology field (hair salons, nail salons, ect) to resume work again. They have both been collecting unemployment since they were forced to stop working about a 2 months ago. 

It’s hard to live in fear of this virus but I do worry about them trying to work again because they are both near retirement age and within that range that the virus is quite lethal. Their job involves seeing several people a day in close contact, touching them, and being well within 3 feet of each other face to face. What they do isn’t what I’d consider essential compared to a hair salon. Not to mention the effect the virus is gonna have on their business. It might not even be worth opening at all for them right now. 

Despite that, they told me they intend to go back to work within a few days under guidelines set by the public safety board. If my parents were to get sick and God forbid, die, to paint a couple peoples nails I’d be angry with myself for allowing it. 

As self employed workers with a basically non essential job, are they obligated to put themselves at risk to work in such close contact with people? My gut tells me they should be able to wait longer but the labor board is so hard to reach right now so I don’t know how to confirm whether it would be okay for them to still stay home. Has anyone had to deal with anything similar? I’m just concerned about my parents.",14May2020,1
739,"Back story: My boyfriend and I agreed that besides grocery shopping, we aren’t going to be going out or seeing anybody else because I have been seeing and taking care of my 86 year old grandmother who is in end stage heart failure and has multiple other cardiopulmonary issues. We can’t risk her getting sick. I also haven’t seen his family since March for same reasons. 



Here’s what happened: on Sunday he was at his mom’s house with his sisters to celebrate Mother’s Day. (They’ve all been sequestered together and restrictions are loosening up here but still as of right now there are over 6,000 confirmed cases in my county). 
He said they needed to get ice so he ran to Publix quickly to get a bag. 

We follow each other’s locations &amp; I got an alert that had arrived to a new location but when I checked it showed that he actually went to his aunt and uncles house to get ice, not a store. His uncle is a doctor and works at a huge hospital that also happens to be the #1 testing site for covid in the entire state. 

I told him that I think it’d be ok now for me to come over and see his family for an hour or so if we abide by social distancing or hangout in the backyard, no dinner or celebratory get togethers until later this year- ONLY if he is positive nobody in his family is seeing friends and I specifically included aunt &amp; uncle. He said nobody has and he’s positive.

I know he’s lying but he doesn’t know I know. I really can’t risk my grandma getting sick, especially if now I know I can’t trust him to tell me if someone in his family is actually going out or not. 

Should I confront him and discuss this or let it go? I’m worried bringing it up because it’s been 4 days and I don’t want my bf to think I keep tabs on him and he can’t do what he wants

TLDR: My bf lied about where he was during quarantine and I’m unsure how to confront him",14May2020,1
740,"I'm a 18 year old who is supposed to be starting freshman year of college this fall.

My parents are divorced, and living in different locations. 

My Dad lives in the area, and so does my Mom, but she is selling her house, and due to high costs of living, she may be moving to Florida (which is roughly 1,000mi away from my hometown). 

I have been living with my mom for the past 18 years, but now that she is moving I really want to live with my Dad. I would like to stay in my hometown because all my friends are here. 

To appease my Mom, I told her that if she moved to Florida I would split my time between their houses. However, my Mom insists that I need to have a ""home base"" and she won't move to Florida if I don't visit her. 

She said that if first semester of my college  
is online, she would like me to live with her until the spring semester.

The thing is, I really want to stay with my Dad if that happens. It just makes more sense risk-wise (why travel 1,000mi during a pandemic), and emotionally (even with quarantine, my friends are all still here).

Also, I'm not really close with my Mom. 

She focuses on my triplet sister more, so I don't usually have long interactions with her. My Mom has also had mental health issues which forced me to mature quicker, and I honestly don't see her as someone I can go to for advice anymore. I haven't asked her for advice since middle school. 

How can I avoid hurting her feelings while still living where I want to?

743,"Hi so I am a lesbian exmuslim and I am about to enter community college this September. I have known that I was a lesbian ever since I was 9 years old and stopped believing in Islam when I was 12, and fortunately have not suffered too much internalized homophobia as a result. However my family is extremely homophobic, like my parents have made jokes about how gay people should be killed, brand of homophobic.  I live in the west and went to Islamic school for eight years and public school for five. I also started wearing the hijab as a toddler and don on an abaya (the black robe) wherever I go.  I know that being closeted is eating away at me, however I cannot afford to leave home. I have also noticed that I have developed maladaptive daydreaming as a way to cope with life, this is a condition that I am currently in the process of resolving.

When I am at home I am constantly paranoid of accidentally leaving my phone or laptop turned on and outing myself in the process. I have developed this obsessive complusion to need to constantly check whether or not my electronics are on, even if I know they are off. I am also anxious whenever I am away from my phone/laptop, this is partially because my parents will do random searches of my room and go through all my stuff. I almost outed myself on one occasion at 16 because I walked into my mom reading my diary which I had written that I was gay in. Fortunately, she was just at the beginning, so I was able to just immediately destroy my journal. My parents will also occasionally search up any new books, I bring home from the library for inappropriate (haram) content. I was in second grade when I first go in a lot of trouble for reading an Abby Hayes book that had kissing in it and had my parents screaming/crying in my face when they found out I had borrowed a book written by Richard Dawkings when I was 15. Around the time I got my first job (15yrs old), I used one of my first paychecks to buy jeans that I could wear outside, I had a relative see me and report me to my parents to which I got the disownment speech and they said they would kick me out if I ever found out I was dressing like a ""whore"" on public again.

But my other problen is that whenever I am outside of my home, everyone sees me as muslim which fuels my dissociative identity disorder, because I am constantly pretending to be someone I'm not.  It gets worse because where I live there aren't that many muslims, so people are constantly asking me about Islam which sort of triggers me. Its so weird because the first thing people talk about when they meet me is my hijab and all they want to do is to talk about Islam to my gay agnostic self. Because Im a hijabi, I am sort of by default expected to be a spokeswoman for the religion which really bothers me and stops me from developing meaningful friendships since I'm just lying all the time, which in turn hurts my self esteem and make me feel like a bad person for not telling my truth.

I got good grades during my senior year and I am planning to study biology when I enter into college and then transfer to a 4 year university in order to save money. I have always wanted to study medicine and become a physician but it would take me at least 8 years to get there. Recently, I have been wondering if I should study nursing instead because it would help me become financially independent sooner.  I don't think nursing would be as fulfilling as a career for me, but I also don't think I can live with pretending to be muslim until I'm in my late twenties. I also cant take off my hijab at college because I have older siblings that will be attending the same school as me. All of this is stressing me out, between this and being stuck at home all day due to COVID and having to fast during Ramadan, I honestly don't know what to do about my future. I'm also confused at what point (if any) should be I coming out as lesbian and start living life on my own terms. I know that by coming out I will surely be disowned, so should I just plan move out and leave my family without a trace?",14May2020,1

746,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. 
We moved in together after about a year of being together. 
My boyfriend’s best friend moved in about half a year later.. it was supposed to be a normal roommate instance, but it turned into us providing for him. 

My boyfriend and I have been living with his best friend (we own the house) and we are at a point in our lives where we just want to focus on us and our life together as a couple. 

The problem is that we are concerned that his best friend will lash out on us for wanting to kick him out. He has lived with us for almost two years now and in that time, we have received maybe one or two months worth of rent. He has had several financial issues since moving in with us and the only majorly frustrating part is that he has been unemployed for some time now and seems to have no motivation to get out on his own and on his own feet. 

We basically supply his every need as if we are his parents. He can’t buy groceries for himself most of the time, his license is now suspended because of a traffic accident that happened when he first moved in, and again, we receive no payment for utilities or rent whatsoever. 

The only reason that he has continued to live here is because my boyfriend and him have been best friends for 10 years now and my boyfriend fears that he will lose a friendship by taking this next step in life. 

How can my boyfriend and I properly communicate this to our roommate with as few repercussions as possible?",14May2020,1
749,"We just had 2 neighbors move in next to us and I think they might be selling drugs.  I’ve seen one of the girls get into 3 different cars and drive away a few days ago.   Yesterday my partner saw her hand something into a car that pulled up.  This obviously doesn’t mean it’s drug dealing but it also looks really suspicious.   

I have a 3 year old son which makes me very unhappy about the situation.   The neighbor was sitting on the curb right in front of our house when someone pulled up and she got in.   Literally next door is not somewhere you want a drug house popping up.  Not to mention we live right next to a school.  

I’m unsure of what I should do about it.   I have no proof they’re selling drugs but it looks really odd.   I’ve thought about just asking them about it but that seems risky.

750,"I play the guitar, and I've been playing for almost a decade now. Back when I was younger and was first starting out, I had a great teacher who I would go through grading theory books together (1-8) with and help me understand what was going on. I was loving it, but after a while I grew tired of practising several hours a day. I didn't stop though, because my teacher and my father were the key points of my motivation. This was mainly my dad saying that I should practice until I knew what I was supposed to know, and if I didn't, I'd have luxuries taken away (e.g video games). My teacher wasn't so strict about it, but he did say some motivational things like ""if we get this done now, then the most difficult parts of this grade will be no more"". By 2017, I had finished my final grade and passed, which felt really good. It was at that point where I stopped turning up to my teacher, my dad didn't really see a point in taking me there either. Which I understand because (£20/hr) for several lessons is a lot of money collectively.

3 years have passed since then, and I find myself lacking motivation or the self-discipline to practice. When I do, it's not for very long, and at times I would just play with a backing track instead of looking through a theory book and actually learning more. My computer and my phone are two things that are big distractions for me. I find it really difficult to just stop thinking about using them. I still practice,  but it's not daily. And I know for a fact that I can be a lot more efficient and hard-working during my practice times if I could stop thinking about gaming or YouTube. 

I actually got backlash from this when I applied for a university in Leeds to study Jazz, one of the tutors had asked me how long do I practice. I didn't really want them to know because I knew they would be disappointed about it, so I tried to prevent giving a solid answer. So I just said ""I don't really look at the clock"". Probably about a month later, I was told that I wasn't suitable for the course, but they handed my application over to another area in the university, and I was instead accepted to study Folk at Leeds. (I did only start playing jazz for a year beforehand). While being happy that I got in, because Leeds university has good opportunities, tutors and facilities such as practice rooms, I couldn't help but think that had I worked harder, or maybe if I just never used a computer, or never owned a phone, I'd be in a much better situation. 

I feels like there's two sides in my head battling it out to the death. Every time I practice, I think about luxuries, like video games. And then every time I end up playing games, or watching YouTube, I end up feeling down because I know I should be practising. Some of my friends say I'm being too hard on myself, but I really don't think I am. It'd be nice to get some opinions, solutions, or similar experiences on this.",14May2020,1
751,"Long story short, I’ve lived a life of emotional and physical abuse, being told to kill myself as a kid, choked out a few times, having to take a knife away from my mom and restrain her, I’m 22 now and I just fight back and try to protect my younger siblings. She’s gotten a lot better and I understand where her pain comes from, I don’t agree obviously but I empathize and to be fair I can’t help but still feel bad for her. I love her, she did a lot of messed up shit yeah, maybe was the reason I tried to take my life a few times, maybe the reason why I hated myself so much and have so many underlying problems today. When I got told by the doctor that I might have cancer she told me she prayed for this day. She would say that but then she would cry if you send her flowers for Mother’s Day without a phone call, or if you didn’t give her a kiss goodnight. I don’t know. 

I know she has some mental disturbances or issues, just don’t know what. Anyway, me and her got into a really bad fight a few months ago and my dad bought me a ticket and flew me out to come live with him for a bit. Little did I know corona would come and that I might have to stay here. Anyway, my little sister who is 16 has to take the brunt of my mom now. That said my sister has her own anger issues (guess it runs in the fam), and she does questionable things here and there but I don’t know. Since I left my brother sent me a video of my mom choking her and them yelling at each other, I tried to let everyone contact my mom to calm her down and talk to my sister and be there for her. It’s been almost a month now where they don’t talk to each other, my mom called me yesterday telling me she’s worried about her and that she wants me to keep checking in. Honestly it made my blood boil because I’m sick and tired of my 55 year old mom acting like my 16 year old sister. While my sister does questionable stuff and I try to parent her about it with me giving her the silent treatment I also have to care for her so I can’t even give her sht for the wrong things she’s doing but just to be there for her. 

Ugh man I just don’t know what to do, what if she goes down the wrong path of drugs, she has questionable friends too, and I just don’t know man. I tried talking to her calmly about things multiple times and have gone to give her the silent treatment when I heard of her making a joke about selling drugs, but within 24 hours had to talk to her again and make sure she was okay because of my mom. And I know the silent treatment works on her because I explain my reasoning first and we have a discussion and if I can’t support what she’s doing then I can’t be around it and she always tells me she comes to her senses when I give her that love. Now I can’t parent her that way since my mom is doing the most, and now I’m just like idek how to get to my sister anymore since my spirits are so low with life man. 

She had an essay due and I know she couldn’t do it because her mind wasn’t straight so I did it for her and she just got the grade back and it was really bad. I need her to focus on school too to get a degree and get out of there. And I can’t teach her to against our mom since as messed up as she is she still has a good heart, trust me I got the worst emotional and physical abuse out of all of us, I can say that going against her isn’t the right move. Idk what to do with everything :/

So, I know it's 2020 and men sometimes attend baby showers, but I also know that it's mostly not a good idea. As in, the husbands usually end up clustering in the kitchen pretending to want to talk to each other. 

I feel like I would be intruding on a traditionally female ritual. This is an office baby shower, so it won't be quite so personal as a normal one, but this might be an occasion for female colleagues to loosen up a little and bond over their experiences of pregnancy and motherhood. I don't want to make anyone self conscious over what they share or discuss merely by my presence. Also, I'm not going to be super comfortable either. I don't know what the hell to say, and I really don't want to make a mistake as, again, this is my boss.  

I think I was likely invited simply so that I wouldn't feel excluded. There's a registry set up online and gift cards I could contribute to, and I think I will end up doing one or both of those.

757,"I come here in hope some people had the same problem as me and found a way out of it.

Long story short ; I am unable to read a book if I have seen its movie/show adaption beforehand, which really annoys me. Let's take the Harry Potter books as an example. Since I was very young when I first heard of this story/universe, I wasn't able to read the books at the time and naturally watched the movies. But as I grew older and all the movies had been released, I wanted to read the books as well since I loved (and I still do) reading.

But when I tried to read the first book, I was unable to go over the first chapter. My mind would just take me back to the things I already knew from the first movie and I could not stop myself from making comparisons, even on the smallest details like the hair color of a character (so not an important detail at all as you can see). And every time I tried to pass through it, I just couldn't. 

And the it's the same problem for every books I want to read after I saw its adaptation.

Toxic members went to a different related (dead) Amino to be assholes to someone who missed their friend. The friend was rude to toxic member 1. They’re both well-liked this in the community. I don’t want them to get away with this gross behavior.

-

So the Amino me and these members came from is dedicated to a game. It’s a small but peaceful Amino. Fake names are being used.

Becky got an abusive message from Hailey and exposed her, which resulted in her leaving. There was no other context provided for that message but it made Hailey look really bad, especially since she was seemingly kind on the surface.

Adam was friends with Hailey and said in a chat that he missed her. This resulted in Becky and Jessica going to a different (dead) Amino made for a game that was under the same company. Becky posted Adam’s message with a gross title relating to what Hailey had said to her. Becky also posted an edit with Adam’s name over hanging Sayori’s face with Jessica as Monika. I pointed out how disgusting this was and Becky and Jessica replied with some toxic comments. Becky also put degrading comments on posts from me and another artist.

I haven’t talked to the Amino mods about this, and even if I did, I don’t know if they’ll do anything. It’s not that they’re bad mods, they’re really cool, but the toxic behavior came from a different Amino. I also don’t want to stir up any bad drama in the Amino. Becky and Jessica are pretty liked in the community too. I feel like if I pull this up I’ll come off as petty, but I don’t want them to get away with this behavior.",14May2020,1
763,"TLDR: ½ pitbull,1/4 husky, ¼ german shepard puppy causing my bf to go broke, bf blames puppy for his failing life. Bf wants to get rid of puppy. What should I do?
Backstory: My boyfriend was thinking a lot about getting himself a puppy after we moved in together about a year and a half ago. I already had a 5-year-old German Shepard mix at the time that is super lazy and low maintenance. He wanted one of his own and dreamed of having one someday. His coworker's two dogs, a Pitbull and a German Shepard husky, had puppies in April last year and my bf would go and visit them on occasion and really wanted to take one home. I told him that having a puppy is a huge step and that it would take a lot of work, but I was willing to help as much as I could. He fell in love with a male black puppy and paid for him and took him home as soon as he could. 
All was good as we were adjusting for about a week but then the puppy got sick and we had to take him to the vet. A few hours later I get a call and they let me know that he had contracted Parvovirus and he needs to go into 24-hour care. That was something that our vet didn't offer so he needed to be transferred to a centre that’s about a half hour drive from us. The vet said that it’s about a 50/50 chance that he could survive. My bf and I had a lot of hard conversations about what would happen if he couldn't pay for his treatments. He had a few thousand saved up at the time and wanted to see if he could save him. 
The puppy stayed in the 24-hour vet hospital for 5 days. Each day costing about $1000. I started a Go Fund Me, called and emailed a bunch of charities to get any help so we could save him. His total bill ended up costing just over $5000. That was all the money my bf had saved up and then some. Our puppy had survived, and we had a full two weeks where he needed medicine every 4 hours in the day. It was a really hard time for us, but we got through it and the puppy is very healthy now with no lasting issues, thank god. 
As he got older, we had moved, and we kept noticing him getting into things when he was alone with the other dog. This is something we had been dealing with in little amounts as he got older but when he started getting closer to his 1st birthday he had destroyed a lot of things in our new rental basement suite. To name a few; charging cord for vacuum, power cord for lamp, a couch cushion, armrest on a chair, eating two holes in the drywall, ripping up books, breaking numerous plates, bowls and glasses, a Nintendo switch, our WIFI power cord, and anything plastic on the counter. He’s run away from us twice and has been having accidents in the house randomly even up until last night. 
My bf works in a kitchen about 10-12 hours a day, 5 times a week. He has been doing this since I met him. He's also an avid lifter and strongman and is used to spending about an hour or two at a specific gym about a half hour away from our suite. His initial idea was to bring his puppy into the gym and train him to just chill at the gym while he was working out but because we had to keep him home for 6 months when he was recovering (and because he was very infectious. That virus is very viral.) he was behind in his training and my bf didn't have the extra time to spend training him to be there. He had been taking extra shifts to make up for the money he lost saving the puppy while I took time off to spend at home making sure the puppy got his medicine. 
I work 7:30 to 4 during the week days so it is and ideal situation for the pups as he starts work in the afternoon around 12 so the puppy would only be home with the other dog for about 5 hours 3 times a week as I have Sat and Sun off and my bf has Mon and Tues off. 
To date this puppy has probably costed my bf over $10,000 in vet bills, things to keep him occupied, countless toys and beds he has destroyed, all the items we’ve had to replace or fix in our suite, anything we try on him to get him to be calm while he’s at home without us. It has really taken a toll on my bf. He regrets getting him in the first place. He gets very upset any time him or I come home to see something ruined. We have gotten in fights over how he treats the puppy and how he doesn’t understand him. (He never abuses the puppy, just yells a lot and is easily angered. The puppy doesn’t understand most times about why he’s upset.)
My bf wakes up early each morning to take the puppy for a half hour run to tire him out now. I wake up early to take the older dog on a half hour walk as well. We set them up in the house with nothing of ours to chew on. We have started hoisting our large coffee table on to the couch, so he can’t get to the cushions. We leave him bones to chew, other chews, he has a tub of toys that we dump out for him, he has interactive treat toys, we put calming music on for him, his bed is set up, we turn the lights off and we started giving him CBD oil to just calm him down while we’re out. I also take him and the other dog to a large dog park every day after work for an hour, so they can both run and socialize with other dogs. 
The other dog could give less of a shit about being home alone. I haven’t had problems with him after he turned 2. I don’t remember him ever being this bad. But that said, like having children, my mind probably forgot all the bad stuff I went through. 
The puppy and the older dog get along just fine. They play together and sleep together sometimes. They are a little competitive and jealous sometimes, but it never causes any fights or aggressive behavior. The older one is very good at playing with the puppy. The only issue we have is when they get separated. They both whine and howl. This happens if we both walk them together. They can’t be too far from each other or one of them gets upset. So, we walk them separately and at different times. This doesn’t happen at the park though because they are off leash and can run around as they please, normally not too far apart from each other. 
Now that you’re caught up. My bf thinks we should get rid of him. He thinks he’s failed on every regard since this puppy has come into our lives. He wants to buy a house with me with a back yard for the dogs but feels behind because he has been spending all his money on this puppy that has been destroying our rental suite. Originally my bf’s father had offered to take him if my bf ever thought that he couldn’t handle him because he has a backyard and my bf’s mother is home all the time, but my bf doesn’t think that they can handle him because he’s so high energy. Other options would be giving him up to the animal shelter or asking our friends if they would like a dog. All these options make my bf feel like he’s failed even more because he can’t make his puppy happy after all that he’s done for him. He feels like his puppy is ungrateful and is lashing out at us for no reason. He feels like his puppy hates him even though he waits every day for my bf to get home and is super excited every time he sees my bf. 
I know the puppy has separation anxiety. That’s the only reason I can see for the destructive behavior. I think we’ve done everything in the book to try to curb this behavior. I know it will get better from here but its really getting to my bf. He’s a very strong man and rarely cries, if ever, but he was so frustrated yesterday... to the point that he had to leave the house, go on a walk by himself and when he came back he sat in his car and played music while he cried... I’ve only seen him cry once before that and that was when he was on mushrooms lol. 
I want him to be happy more than anything. I feel awful for how much he has put into making this puppy’s life as good as possible. I feel so bad when he destroys something, but I know it’s not to punish us. I know he doesn’t like being alone but it’s a reality. We are trying as hard as we can to make it work and minimize destruction. I don’t know what to do. It would break my heart to get rid of the puppy. Him and the older one has such a close bond now. I don’t know how he would do on his own. We’ve had him for over a year now and he’s fun and listens to commands way better than the 6-year-old dog. His only flaw is not being able to be alone. 
We’ve thought about day care but its another cost we must add to that $10,000 total... My parents have a nice backyard, but they know about all his destruction and are hesitant to take him especially if they are not home. My bf and I have a plan to save up money for a house with a backyard for them but houses in our area are very expensive and at the rate of pay we have now it will take us years to save up for a down payment. (It’s so expensive and our wages are so low that we were looking at abandoned houses to fix up in our area.)

764,"Hi, so In short I have a dilema between studying international relations or international business and economics. 

Longer version: I currently hold a place at uni of Manchester to study intentional business, finance and economics. I also hold some other offers for similar courses. So I originally decided to apply for business/economics courses due to few reasons. 1. I always wanted to have my own business, it’s just the idea that I developed by observing my grandma running her own business 2. I want to have a job which would allow me to live the same lifestyle which my parents provided me with (Im incredibly privileged that I was raised in a higher middle class family) so I want to earn money. And generally I just thought that business might be interesting, and learning how economics works might be useful. After this path I could see myself working in consultancy, management or policy advisement. Or I would love to do an master in international relations and find employment in international environment, like public affairs or something like that. 

So, as you can see I have a lot of interest in international scene. In high school I have participated in muns (model United Nations) and loved it. So I was wondering whether I should try and switch my bachelor to international relations? I also have a option to switch to economics and politics at Manchester. I definitely have interest in it. The only thing is that I’m afraid of doing bachelor in such a soft degree as I really want to have a good chance of getting employed. I’m also an international student from Italy and I would probably work in my home country after uni as this is the place that my whole family is and being close to them is important. I just don’t know which path to take",14May2020,3

767,"Ever since I was little, I loved fashion. I made jewellry and crochet barbie dresses and sold them at school as an 8 year old. Moved countries and got bullied, learned how to dress myself and use makeup, had a teacher who during lunch taught me how to draw a croquis and we practiced everyday. She believed I was destined to greatness in fashion. I dared my school's dress code. Dared to dye my hair crazy colours, wear makeup and pierced my eyebrow, wore things not allowed, often questioned the dress code and whoever implemented it and always got in trouble. I was a true believer that we should be able to express ourselves in that way. I was fearless.Took up mini courses on sewing and drawing.

Now I'm back to my home country. I learned many things out there, I'm different, everyone thinks I am foreign and I'm finishing college except college doesn't give me hope, it kills it completely. My professors are horrible beings, they barely teach and give us meaningless assignments, they don't believe in being out of the box, they give you a method and you stick with it, anything different or done by me especifically is garbage. I study endlessly, I'm an academic. Now all I get are horrible comments from my professors, no matter how hard I try. I stick to their method, I do as I'm told but none of that matters, my designs still suck according to them. 

My friends say they are beautiful and would wear them in a heartbeat. But the thing is, they're my friends. I'm starting to doubt my ability and wonder if it's even worth graduating this year, I wish I'd heard the advice to take up anything else and keep fashion as a hobby. I feel useless and worthless, like everything I do is stupid and I'm kidding myself by thinking I'll ever become a designer.

Should I even finish? Should I change my major? Maybe I am as stupid as my professors say I am. I wish I was as fearless as I used to be before and still believed in myself, but the endless criticism has taken a toll on my confidence in my work. I think it was a huge mistake to have taken up fashion. What can I even do?",14May2020,3

My best friend myself and a bunch of people decided we wanted to go to the beach and continue the party there.

778,"Longtime Reddit lurker who has never had anything to post until now. I apologise for poor grammar. I'm writing this in an angered state.

The story starts back in September when we had new neighbors move in. They came over and introduced themselves and their two boys. They seemed really nice and down to earth. We would hang out on the weekends, drink beer, let our kids play outside, ride bikes, shoot some basketball. It was like the ideal neighborhood situation. So much so, we were looking to buy a house right down the road from where they were buying a house. As we continued our friendship over the coming weeks I began to suspect something wasn't right. Their stories about their past seemed suspicious. They slowly started to become more and more intrusive into our lives to the point that the husband would just walk into our house looking for us sometimes. When the holidays came around they began driving a wedge between me and my mother. Some of the accusations of what she did seemed plausible because of her behavior at the time so I believed them. As things progressed I noticed my spouse and I were arguing more and more. Something our neighbors did all the time. So much so that we would frequently get texts after a night of drinking that stated one was going to divorce the other. So we'd go over and try to fix the situation. After months of this, the event that broke the camel's back occurred. 

Several of the neighbors from our street were all hanging out in front of their house with my fire pit, drinking, eating food and just conversating. Well after a few hours of this one of the kids came out and said that the 13 year old girl from down the street was dared to kiss my 9 year old on the cheek. My wife who was not drinking that night flipped out and went inside to investigate. After a few minutes my wife came out with our two boys and took them home. The neighbor wife followed them into the house. After another few minutes the neighbor wife came back out muttering to herself about what was said in my house. So I went into my house to investigate. Walked up stairs to find my wife talking to our boys about what happened and why it was wrong. She then took me into our room to tell me what happened when the neighbor wife walked in our door and started telling at us from the bottom of the stairs. My wife and I walked out and asked her to leave, she refused. We asked again, she replied with ""make me"". My wife then said ""get the fuck out"". To which the neighbor wife replied ""make me bitch, come at me"". My wife started to make her way down the stairs at which point I stepped in front of her to stop her. The neighbor lady began coming up the stairs as I'm telling her to leave. Wife then grabbed the closest thing to her and attempted to throw it at her but I stopped her hand and the item fell to the stairs and broke into pieces. The neighbor wife left after that. Not 10 seconds later the neighbor husband walks in yelling and screaming calling wife a bitch and saying his wife will kick my wife's ass. I told him to leave and he responded with punching out 4 of my spindles on my staircase and then punching my door before he left. 

After a few minutes of calming down my wife who was hysterical, I walked outside to figure out what the fuck happened. The husband came charging at me like he was going to fight me. I put up my hands asking what the fuck happened. They began to say some bullshit about my wife was cussing out that 13 year old girl, which was not the case but still doesn't warrant the sort of actions that occured. We all began to pick everything up and head inside. At that time my wife decided to go for a walk and calm down. After picking up everything thing I went to my neighbors across the street to calm down and talk about this. The neighbors husband followed me over there and was talking as well. I then went to go look for my wife and started walking down the street. By the time I got to the next street I heard yelling coming from our street. I turned around and ran back. When I got there, the neighbor husband was telling his wife to go get his gun. Apparently the neighbors across the street were telling the neighbor husband he was an ass for what he did. The neighbor husband then began to charge at our across the street neighbor and the across the street neighbor kicked him the chest and stumbled down the drive way. After that went down the across the street neighbor called the cops because of what happened. The cops showed up and eventually left after 30 minutes or so. As far as I know nothing came of it. The next day the neighbor husband came over and apologized but it was too far gone at that point. We had to make repairs to our house because we are attempting to sell it.

We started to distance ourselves to the point of ignoring them. Sometime later, one of the moms of a kid that our kids would play with came by with some information. Apparently the neighbor kid would pull his pants and underwear down in front of our kids and the other kid. He would also talk about sex and prostitutes among other things he heard from his parents. Yet another reason to despise those people. So we had to have ""the talk"" with our kids way earlier than expected. This all happened mid March and we have yet to speak to them. Then today my wife gets a call from the cosmetology board saying there was a complaint filed on her for doing work out of our house. Which is complete and utter bullshit. The complaint was anonymous but we have a pretty good idea of who it is. We feel like we are trapped in our home and feel emotionally drained from everything. 

There are more details but I feel like this is long enough.

When we text, she’ll often throw subtle digs at me. I was working on a project and she seemed annoyed that I was...working on it?? The tone immediately shifted when I brought up the project and she said “you’re inspired huh” as if she was annoyed that I wanted to do this project.

783,"So I go to a public high school and during quarantine, all the work was optional. You weren't required to do it and it wouldn't count for grades. So naturally, I didn't do any of the work assigned by my French nor English teachers. The only work I did was study physics, chem and math since those are the most important to me and since I'm taking the sciences at college in September.

Today I had to go back to school to return certain items and I saw my English teacher. We started talking and then he told me, ""I'm surprised you didn't do any of the work I assigned."" So I explained myself. But after coming home from that talk, I felt guilty. I've never thought of myself as a people pleaser, but I feel bad for disappointing my English teacher. All my teachers see me as a great student. They trust me, I work hard in their course and get high marks. But I do the work for myself, not for them. So it's not surprising that my English teacher (and all my other ones) expect a lot from me.

I also thought that since I didn't do the work, he no longer thought of me as a hardworking student. Does that mean I care about my reputation? I want to be trusted and be perceived as responsible by others. 

I don't know what to think. My mentality is, if someone told you that you can go to work or choose not to, but either way, you won't get paid... who would go to work? No one. Same thing with school work and grades.

I get there's at home workouts but it's a bit difficult to find the time too to do anything by 6 or 7pm. Back when I lifted weights it was always early but now it's hard to do that. But anyways, am I selfish or wrong for missing that? Am I showing that I'm a bad dad for wanting that life back?",14May2020,5
786,"Hey y'all, posting this on a throwaway because there's some personal stuff buried in my (***27/M*** \- i edited this in after i posted oops) normal reddit account that could trace this post back to me or something. I was going to post this on AmItheAsshole before I realised 3000 characters is nowhere near enough for what advice want to ask.

**A bit of background, and apologies for this wall of text:**

I've been friends with this person for roughly eight years now - from here on out I'll refer to them as ""Dr. Dre"". We became friends in our university classes (music degrees) and we got very close, bonding over similar music tastes, music production and memes. Until recently I regarded Dr. Dre as a sibling to me.

We started a band in 2015 that was sort of successful around our town initially, but struggled to follow similar trajectories of our peers because of one reason or another - mainly disorganisation and laziness from both sides. We had some success opening for nationally/internationally known artists, but the creative juices from Dre's end dried up, particularly in 2016.

I was hell-bent on making the band work while juggling a 9-5 job, while Dre was focused on their post-grad studies - writing their own album for the year. I feel like I was selfish in the approach I took at the time, but asking for Dre to send over contributions became more like begging. It wore my enthusiasm for the band down quickly.

2017 was difficult - we ended up doing a single launch that became me organising everything - promotion, interviews, proper studio time for the song, booking acts to support. Dr. Dre became more self-absorbed - the breaking point around the single launch was hearing the song at a radio station for the first time with Dre and an interviewer. Dre and the engineer mixed it in the studio without me, and they had forgotten all the drums EXCEPT the snare and kick. I pointed this out and Dre told me I was an idiot and that it sounded fine. It was embarrassing. This, and a bad relationship where my ex would do nothing but spout hatred about Dre, ended up discouraging me from the band entirely.

I stopped talking to Dre in early 2018 after one fight too many. Every fight we had was a hard object against an immovable force - except I'd always have to admit I was wrong. I never got an apology from Dre, until Dre reached out to me with a heartfelt apology a year later.

We slowly reacquainted and reformed the band. It started well, the songs we were writing and the comeback show we did were great, while we even managed to get another support slot for a nationally touring act.

But old habits die hard, and Dre started going back to old habits from the first time the band was a thing - saying yes to practices and then not replying to any messages on the day (I'd always make time on my days off, only to be ghosted), or pulling out of shows we'd book either the day before OR the day of. The embarrassment I felt before had returned.

So many reasons (I'm tired, I'm sick, etc) were used - at points, Dre remarked ""you won't believe this excuse"", and acknowledged how patient I had been. We hardly practiced back in the day because of one reason or another and it had started again. The begging for files for songs surfaced again too - I even borrowed Dre's hard drive to find vocal parts they said they had done in a studio, only to be staring into the Pandora's Box of external hard drives, with no vocal parts to be found anywhere.

**Anyway:**

The key moments over the last seven months were payment for a photo shoot in November -  I was told by Dr. Dre at the time that they had plenty of money and would be able to give it to me up front - as of writing this, I'm still owed $100 out of $160 from their share. I paid the photographer six weeks after he sent the photos after it became clear getting the money from Dre wasn't going to happen. He emailed me twice asking where the money was. While it's kind of on me that I didn't pay immediately, I was desperately waiting on Dr. Dre to come through with the rest of the money (I actually asked about getting some of the money in March and got told it'd come through - I never saw it). Again, another embarrassing moment.

In February, I thought I was being a good friend and lent Dr. Dre an iPhone 6 of mine - they later saw me in town and offered $100 for it. I said sure - I'm now down $200!

Also in February, we ended up sitting down with a record label - they loved everything we showed them - and wanted to sit down in the first week of March to start working on everything. It was absolutely positive - a starting path to success, right?

But on the Sunday before the second meeting we were meant to get together to sort out our material. Dr. Dre messages me saying their doctor told them their blood tests had returned positive for coronavirus, but that I could still come over to work on music with Dre. We ended up having a massive fight over this - not just because they were going to go to work at a cafe the next day knowing they were positive, but in Dre's words, I wasn't Dre's parent and I couldn't tell Dre what to do with their life. The blasé attitude threw my housemate, partner and I into a spin - we had to go into isolation and get tested because we'd all been in contact with Dre.

After Dre messaged me at 1 pm, the three of us spent six hours all up making multiple phone calls to our employers and our families to let them know we may have been in contact with someone who is positive with coronavirus. I also emailed the record label we'd spoken to because that was the last time I'd seen Dre.

We ended up getting swab tests done the following day, before going into social isolation for three days. While we were tested, I asked four doctors if blood tests for coronavirus were a thing - they all flat out said it hadn't been developed yet.

As we got home from the tests, Dre messages me and says ""LOL the doctor misdiagnosed me out of panic"". I told my housemate and partner this - they were both furious, and both of them aren't the type to get angry over anything. I told Dre what I had found out from the doctors and the amount of unnecessary drama that all of this had caused - and Dre told me I was overreacting and to speak to them when it had all blown over. The tests were negative, and I seriously began to have doubt over whether any of the reasons, excuses, whatever that Dr. Dre had given me in the past year were real to begin with.

I've spoken to Dre once since the coronavirus antics - they messaged me three weeks ago asking how I was going in ""isolation"" (they're fully aware I work in a supermarket, and isolation is not a thing if you're an ""essential worker""). I replied a week later, and kind of distantly I must admit. Dre hasn't had any money since their cafe shut and had to draw on their superannuation money to pay rent. Surprisingly, Instagram shows them getting a perm a week or so ago.

I've had a lot of time to think about the relationship I have with Dr. Dre and I don't think I can continue to work with them in a professional manner, because despite all the talent Dre has, I don't think they will or want to commit themselves to anything that isn't about Dr. Dre. I also want to continue working with the record label because they were super positive about what could happen, and if there's anything I've wanted since I was a kid, it was to make music more than just a hobby.As for being friends with Dr. Dre, I'm not too sure.

I guess the questions are:

* Do I have any reason to be friends with someone who may or may not be lying to me about their life, and how do I approach it knowing that this is a friendship I need to end properly for my own sake?
* Would it be a bad move to ask my friend Dr. Dre for the $200 in band photo and iPhone money, despite knowing their financial situation is dire right now, despite needing the money myself for rent and the like? Have I been too patient, too lax?
* Do I talk to the record label about working with them by myself, even if it feels a bit like stabbing Dre in the back? Part of me wants to email them and cite ""professional differences"" for wanting to work without Dre, but considering I've only spoken to them a few times I don't know how good that would look?

If you've reached this point thank you for reading my Ted Talk X Post this is an absolute wall of text it is appreciated",14May2020,1

This is going to seem like a very trivial post due to the serious nature of some of the other posts on here. I need help convincing my parents to let me get GTA.

I’m 14 years old, and my parents are divorced (this will be relevant later). My parents let me watch/play pretty much everything under the sun and I’d like to think I’m mature enough to handle the content. My parents are aware of everything I play and look in depth in the content before giving me permission. I watch the Wire with my dad and we have conversations about the effects of violence and it’s consequences.

I play the Witcher and the mafia games, so I’m allowed to play games with violence, sexual content (their number one concern), and themes of crime. Although I am trusted to avoid them when possible. I’ve explained to my parents that most, if not all, of the sexual content is avoidable and that I’m mature enough to handle it. They’re ok with the violence and drug content in it.

The reason I’m not allowed to play GTA V is because my mother disagrees with putting strip clubs and prostitution into a game in the first place, and refuses to support it by giving money to the developer. Which is funny because I own and have played RDR2 and it remains one of my personal favourites. 

Anyways, I let the argument be for a little bit, but now I have a new angle. The game is now free for a limited time. With the game being free she’d no longer be supporting the developers by letting me play it. However my mother still came back to me with the same response. I asked my dad for backup but he said, “You’ve already been shot, I’m not stepping out of the trenches just to join you. At this point your mother won’t back down. Logic has gone out the door.” He can’t say yes because then it makes him look like a bad parent to the courts. 

I understand that I get a pretty good run of it content wise, and the reason I wanna play it is because A.) the campaign seems fun and B.) a lot of my friends play it. I need help figuring out a way to try and get my mother to say yes. My dad is more open too it. If she says yes so does he. If I have a good enough argument he’ll back me up.  I need ideas on how to make a bulletproof argument. (There should definitely be a sub for that)",14May2020,2

794,"Best piece of advice will get an award.

Me and my sisters came from a bad living situation into the guardianship of my cousin. To us she is Mom. But she already had her own children before we arrived and often puts them above us. Other circumstances in the past has put me in extreme odds with my family. I'm going to be turning 18 in about a year, and I plan to move far away. I don't want to leave in a state of semi-isolation from my family because I do love them all very much. I'm trying to build better relationships with them but nothing seems to be working.

My mom is moody and is often mad for reasons beyond my understanding.

My dad acts like a hormonal teenager who takes offense if I say good morning the wrong way.

My brothers are my mom's real kids. They have way more privileges then my sisters and I, making it hard to spend much time with them and get even a little close to them to try to bond. We have very little in common.

I really would like to get closer to my sisters especially because when I leave, I don't want to just walk away from them. We have to stick together the most as there are very little people left in the world who have our backs. But one of them has an emotional disorder and really is hard to talk to. The other one is self-centered and spends most of her time trying to stay on my mom's good side.

I have tried everything I can think of to mend the broken bond. But it's as if they all made an agreement that I'm not worth the bother.

So my question is how can I fix the state of things and get closer to my family members without losing my temper and making things worse?",14May2020,1

Except I have a problem where men keep threatening to kill me. 

Four times in two weeks. 

They usually threaten to kill me when something about them makes me suspicious, so I decide not to meet up with them after all. 

On one occasion, the guy seemed normal until we met up, and forgot what both no and stop means until I asked him if he had planned to rape me, and then he apologized....but STILL kept trying to talk me in to having sex with him???

It’s getting old. How come I check reddit and I’m the only one with stories like this? Is it something I’m doing? Or is it possibly the region I live? Or should I stop being direct and be more passive out of concern that one day one of these dipshits might actually kill me?

798,"I had to move into my mother's rental in the city and she already has animals. I got all my important stuff, I'm mostly worried about the cat. I wont be able to get a place for a few months. I think the longer I wait to get the cat (and the rest of my stuff)  the more she will think she deserves the cat. I've known that cat much longer, it was originally mine and a different ex's from 4 years ago. Then it was given to me and my latest ex because it wasnt being taken care of properly once I left. Now its again left with an ex who wont take care of her properly. But to make it more complex after introducing the original breeder of the cat to my recent ex. They became very close friends and I believe that's another reason why she will think she deserves the cat. Shes not a bad person and I dont think she wants anything bad for the cat but her family has 5 dogs and 4 cats already. I dont have any animals and I really just want her back. 

So for anyone who got through all that. I'm asking if I should talk to her about it soon to get the anxiety off my back and see if she'll even give me the cat. or talk to her about it when I have my own and can take the cat in right away.

801,"[Need Advice] Hey guys, I'm a 25F, still living at home with my father. I am in campus and before COVID-19, I was in my last semester and was set to graduate in the end of the year with a bachelor's degree. He is abusive to me you guys, physically, mentally and emotionally. A fight can break out about nearly anything. He expects me to clean up after him, do his chores and that is okay given that he pays the bills and has paid my school fees. He beats me with such violence, and such hate, that I hate remembering it. Writing this in itself is difficult. He also frequently shouts, demeans and insults me for small missteps for example, not preparing his tea the way he wants to, accidentally dropping a utensil, forgetting to do something etc. He hates me! Also, one time when he was beating me, he removed my trousers and pushed my top upwards (but didn't reveal my chest). He has in other times made fishy comments, inquiring 'why I am always in hoodies even when it's sunny' or 'what it is I am seeking to hide with those jackets I wear'. I am freaked out by the implication of these comments in particular. What, fellow Redditors is he inferring to with these questions??? Please answer if you have a clue. What is he really saying? Please give me your honest opinion.

He has chased me out of the house many times but I always come back because I have nowhere to go. He has paid my education fees, you see. I know that as a 25F, I should be on my own but life just happened. And tbh, in my first and second year of campus, I was wayyyy too comfortable with living in my parent's house. So I messed up there. But I started hustling hard and have never looked back. The money was just not enough to leave. But now with quarantine, I am stuck with this pig and have lost my job because of the lockdown situation. I have so much hate and anger towards him but I dare not even make a smart comment because it might mean another altercation. I have moments where I get flashbacks of me being beaten up, and I find myself throwing whatever is in my hand. Yes, it's insane but I can't help it. I feel stuck. With nowhere to go. In my country, there are no organizations that can help you get out of an abusive environment. The most they'll do is send you food. My mom has no money, if anything, I help HER. Another thing is, he can come to my room at random moments, pull the blanket off me and start yelling at me. He has done this two times. And both times were at night. Reason? Something stupid like, oh why did I fall asleep that early, or oh why have I not cooked his tea... Stuff of that nature. Unnecessary arguments. I spend my days avoiding him, going to the neighbor's house or just walking around. I am beyond mentally exhausted by this situation. I am deeply afraid of him, can't wear certain outfits that are nice around him or have a nice hairstyle for fear of bringing unnecessary attention to myself. Take that comment as you will. I disappear immediately I do his chores, either into my room or to the neighbor's. I can spend hours on end in my room just waiting for him to leave (if he ever does). I'm actually in my room now as I type this. I am looking for a virtual assistant job guys, so please don't assume that I'm content with doing nothing about my situation. I've been studying YouTube videos on how to become one and now I'm looking for a job. I hope that it works out. Really needed to vent. Sorry if it's too long.

803,"So usually my right side is my fuller side and awake side but lately it seems to be looking more the opposite! My left side is where I had a bit of a lazy eye when I smiled ! 

But now For some reason my right eye has changed shape! I’m not sure if it’s because of my face could be changing due to tmj but my right eye instead of a drop is going more upwards ! Also looks smaller ! When I smile now my left eye looks lazy but more awaken. My right side looks off!!

Could it be lack of sleep?
Impacted wisdom teeth ?

Or my tmj 

I’ve noticed it for the past 3 days ! 

I also noticed that side of my face has weird shadows in certain lighting now! It’s sucks now I hav two ugly sides! 

My boyfriend or anyone around me hasn’t noticed !! But the eye thing is recent! More noticeable in photos !

And for some reason mainly this year the past few months I keep thinking my face has changed. I do have tmj and clench when I’m in angry or when I’m stressed also have Bruxism and tmd. Sometimes in my sleep. I think this is a long time thing but worse at certain times.
Lately I feel like my face looks weird. My chin looks bulgy and longer ? 

I have an ovalish face shape! It’s not long long but I feel like it’s getting longer.
I’m getting braces soon! I don’t have a severe underbite but my chin does protrude very mood like it’s more my bottom lip. 

Recently though I feel like I look puffy ! I’m not sure if that’s a bit of weight gain. I’m a skinny person but I feel like what if it’s not face fat but my jaw changing! 
But
My boyfriend saw me after 2 months today and thinks I look exactly the same except for getting more fuller cheeks! He actually said my face looks shorter and the fuller cheeks look nice! My mum said the same thing. She said I looked more healthier! Which is weird I’ve done nothing but sleep all day cause I’ve been so depressed lol. 

Even my friend who I saw after months says she saw no difference !! 
But I don’t see it!! At the same time I don’t know if I’m just tripping. I have bad bdd! I did lost weight last year and was trying to get my face fat back ! I think it’s back but part of me feels like I look bad or the fat is different ? Another part of me thinks I’m getting a square face. 

When I open my mouth I see my massester muscles clearly!! and it looks so bad! I have figured out ways to not grind in my sleep! But I’m scared I damaged my face and it’s already changing! 
What if it’s changing and no one can see it yet. For now it’s giving a “fuller cheeks” illusion but it’s actually something else!!!

Also feel like my lazy eye is getting noticeable !!!
2 weeks ago I felt fine and thought I looked actually normal but it’s started again!! 
I keep taking photos and analysing it! 
My boyfriend sees no difference and says its my 
Anxiety and bdd playing! And the tensed jaw muscles are making me think it’s growing when it’s not !!!
I feel like I look sad when I have a serious face like I look stoned !!! 

I still have a slim face but I’m scared it’s getting puffy looking! 

Right now my jaw feel a bit stiff and now feels like it’s placing itself forward!!! Idk if it’s my anxiety !! 
I’m so scared to eat foods, sleep!! I’ve been avoiding trying to dress up or even wear make up as I feel like it doesn’t suit me anymore cause my face !!!


If I do have these changes can u reverse them ???
Is it permanent?

I’m so scared 
I also have 2 impacted low wisdom teeth I’m getting out soon as well as getting braces!!! 

I’m worried That I’ll need jaw Surgery!!! 
I suffer from bdd and I went from analysing my face shape to then looking at my chin to see what bad change I have! 

My boyfriend is usually able to reassure me but this time I feel so confused!! He says I look the same and he sees no difference or bad change at all!! My mum doesn’t either !

Today my eyes also looked a bit out of place! My right eye (which used to be my good eye) is now going upwards ? But in a more odd way like it’s out of place ! My left eye (least fav side) looks more normal than my right !!! So if anyone knows if this is related to tmj or not please let me know or can this be lack of sleep!!

My bottom tooth seems have also moved forward as it’s touching my top tooth badly !!! 
I’ve also started chewing on both sides idkk if that I ruined my face.

Last night I felt like I looked normal!! And then boom in the morning I saw a weird face again. Then I showered. And it went back to being Norma again until I analysed it.

My boyfriend genuinely has been convincing me that he sees no sort of changes from even end of 2018 when he met me to now except for losing a bit a weight! 

He’s reassured me several times that only very tad difference is I have slightly fuller cheeks again which looks Nice to him. 
I do remember wanting I gain weight again. I can’t tell if this is the same weight or not! It’s like I can’t remember how I look like anymore!!!

My mums been reassuring me too! And said if she or anyone had seen a drastic or even a slightly noticeable change I would have been to the dentist ASAP to get it checked! 

My dental appointment for my braces consultation is at end of May. Was meant to get it at 2018 but I never went back after the first consolation so now I’m getting my xrays redone hoping I’ll find answers.

My mums theory to me feeling like this is also 
I’ve been sleeping all day ever since lockdown, I haven’t dressed up, done my make up and felt that confidence in so long hence she thinks I forgot what I look like when I’m not in home clothes and when I’m usually dressed up! 
And said I haven’t seen my bare face for this long for years! (Btw she’s not implying I look better with make up, she means confidence wise as I’m someone whose very much into make up and fashion)

I’m thinking to buy a neck pillow to sleep straight and posture 

And a jaw wrap like this

The only issue is my six yes old and three year old brothers are awful with him, which has lead my puppy to begin to bite and growl at them after getting provoked.

The six year old isn't a huge issue, he just picks him up wrong or tries to play with him when he doesn't want to which leads to the biting. the three year old is absolutely awful with dogs, including my step dads. He loves sitting on my dog, pulling his tail, smacking him at random, stealing his toys while he's chewing on them, etc, and we have no idea where his behavior has come from. We don't live in an abusive household and he's never been exposed to violence, especially violence towards animals so the behavior is really troubling. My mom and I both try to get them both to stop, but the three year old just doesn't listen, even after he gets bit or growled at.

My dog always growls in warning before biting, and he's not an aggressive dog by any means. He still loves to be pet by them and play with both of them when they do so correctly. The biggest problem is that they keep upsetting him so he keeps biting, which had lead my mom to say that if he (my dog) doesn't shape up, we'll have to get rid of him. I don't see an issue with my dog's behavior but one with my brothers.

I suppose this post is a last ditch effort. I don't want to have to get rid of my dog because honestly it would emotionally destroy me, but I can't afford to move out just to keep him around. I don't know what else to do.",14May2020,1

808,"Hello! To follow this post please go to my profile and read The post in Relationship_advice


So, I think that I am in the wrong now but that Some of my feelings are still valid. I talked to one of his friends and his friend told me why I wasn't allowed to visit their house. He said my mother insulted his wife, I have a lack of honesty and communication, and an aprehension to follow their quarantine rules. I don't deny any of this. Its all true. He also stated that When I went to My boyfriends house where I live, my boyfriends friend, said that I blatantly lied to my boyfriend friend's friend. This is true. I am a compulsive liar but I don't know why. This is such an emotional time in my life and I don't know what to do.I am upset all the time and want it to go away but it won't. I can't do anything until I'm happy again. I apologized for everything that I may have done to misregard them. 

Here is the text My boyfriends friend's text for reference:::


 Its your apprehension to follow decontamination protocol or just wash your hands after you've been out.

Its the lack of care for our requests and requirements.

Its your lack of honesty and forthcoming communication.
You forget that we broke your internal quarantine despite our better judgement.  Because you couldnt take it.  We budged when you threw a fit.

You wont come to us and communicate, instead having your mom bargain with and reprimand (Boyfriend).  She additionally heavily insulted (Bf's friend's wife).

You arent acting like an adult, you are instead acting like a privileged brat.  Which is unbecoming of anyone.

You will not be granted access to our house for the foreseeable future.  You have already stepped too far past that line.

For the record, we don't hate you.  It takes quite a bit for us to properly hate someone.  You have merely ruined any amount of trust we had in you.


Here is my response:

I'm sorry if it seems like I disregarded you. I wasn't given proper guidelines to follow as far as quarantine goes from what I remember, and my household treats quarantine differently so I thought thats how it would be with him too. so I didn't know that you wanted me to be sprayed down, as its the only place i've had to be, and (Boyfriend) asked me to come over, but then never replied-


 -when I asked if it was okay. I came over because I thought he'd want to see me, and that it was still okay, as he told me to bring items with me. He didn't get upset with me, and nobody else did either. he didn't say anything until (Boyfriend's friend's friend)or someone told him that I wasn't supposed to be there after he woke up. So I left. 

 I wanted to fix it by going over there and following the procedures properly, but he was still upset with me, and it seemed like you were too... So i'm sorry if I upset you. I will communicate how I feel more if it's what you want. I'm just not used to communicating negative feelings towards people I consider not being close enough with.


 I have extreme anxiety which is why its hard to open up to people, but I will communicate more with everyone and teach myself on being less of a messy person. I also know that I shouldn't move around freely due to the pandemic, so I won't try to leave my house, unless something important comes up.

 I just don't want (boyfriend) to have to choose between staying with me or his friends, when the pandemic is over. also, I love ( friends wife)a lot and she's my favorite person so I don't want her to be upset, please tell her that I am sorry that my mom insulted her, she did not need to say that. if I don't see her soon.


And His response:

Its not about negative feelings.  Its about ANYTHING.  You didnt communicate anything with us.

And (boyfriend) is chosing to be with us.  He doesn't have to be with us.  He is family, just like (friend's friend)  He is always welcomed with us, even if he has to go into quarantine for a bit.

As far as the (friends friend) bit, he was fine with you coming over when you complied with the decontamination procedures.

He was not fine with you bold face lying to him, saying you were only dropping shit off, then staying the night?  Thats not cool.  Not because you stayed, but because you lied.

---------------------------------------------------


I'm sorry if this is too personal, but I have no one to talk to outside of my family and right now my head is warped of what is right and what is wrong and I dont know how to reply to him anymore. I am very lost and my heart feels heavy and filled with negative emotions
So if anyone can help, please do, because my boyfriend wants me to live with them and him someday, Otherwise, I understand if you're uncomfortable with these types of things

Everything I did as a kid was around this tree and my father doesn't understand why it hurts so much hearing those words. I don't have anything from my childhood that brings back happy memories and almost all my childhood I went through a lot of traumatic experiences. This tree reminded me of the happy times I would play with my grandfather who passed away 2013, I was blamed for not seeing him as often but I was just a teen and no one told me he was ever ill. He would always put out a smile when I came over and made sure I was happy...and then was always told it was my fault he died.

813,"I am hang out with this group of friends a lot and there is some flirting but for the most part everything with the whole group is very platonic. One night one of the friends from the groups admitted that they hooked up with another friend in the group. They both has significant others. I found this out through the grape vine with no actual proof. The two are flirty and one will put their arm around the other but nothing more than that. My roommate knows one of the accused-cheaters significant others but they are not friends. My roommate wants to get an anonymous number or use someone else's phone to let this person know that their SO is cheating on them by saying ""A is cheating on your with B"" and that is all. I feel conflicted because there is no proof, the accused cheater is my friend and I have never asked them about this and an anonymous text feels so shitty. Just throw it out there and leave it hanging? And I think it is pretty easily would be linked back to me because we are very close friend group and the connection back will be able to be made with or without the anonymous number. 

I have been thinking about this a lot and really want to tell my roommate it is not our place to blow up their relationship and it makes me uncomfortable that this will make its way back to me because I would confront my friend before I would reach out to their SO anonymously. However I do feel strange bringing this up because again their is no proof beyond flirting. I don't have any ties to my friend's SO and I know that does not make it right if they are cheating but I feel bad interjecting myself. I have never been in this situation and I am having a hard time determining what is right and wrong because cheating is never okay and I do not support it but meddling also feels pretty shitty when I do not have a definite answer.",14May2020,1
814,"(M26) Throughout my academic career, I always took the safe route. I never really had any friends, I never had a girlfriend, I always had my head in a book. I was talking with my parents, and the conversation was about their time in high school/ college. They were talking about how much fun they had (my mom even started crying about it😅) and eventually they started making fun of me for not “having any fun”. I didn’t understand what they meant so I asked, “what fun?” According to my parents, “fun” sounds like underage drinking, unsupervised parties, SEX, relationships, going anywhere and doing anything without supervisions, driving, stuff like that. Thats not what they said specifically but it’s basically what it sounded like to me. I’ve never done any of that to this day, and I’m starting to question my motives and my parents.

819,"Hello everyone. I’m sure this is a rather common type of post here by now, but I’m truly feeling lost and just looking for any kind of advice. I really appreciate any help you all can give me.

I’m 18 and in college, I was in the dorms last year but am home now due to virus lockdowns. I live with my 16 year old little brother, and my 81 year old great grandmother. My biggest concern with this virus is keeping her healthy and safe. I go into the store for her, I make sure she’s wearing a mask if she does go out at all, overall she’s been a bit resistant but she seems to understand how serious this is and how concerned I am so she puts up with me and follows the restrictions.

However, my little brother would be out partying with friends every day if he could. I’ve had to stop him multiple times from having friends over (“but we’ll stay six feet apart and wear masks! They won’t even get out of their car!” I made that mistake only once. I turned back around and his mask was off and he’s leaning in their window). He fights me tooth and nail for everything I try to do to keep our family safe. 

Further, he works at a local nursing home (thankfully only three workers have tested positive and there’s been no further problems in 12 days, it doesn’t seem to be spreading there). Even though I, my grandma, and our aunt have laid out what he’s to do when he gets off work so that he doesn’t possibly spread the virus (clothes off ASAP, shower, leave shoes in the garage, etc) he doesn’t follow any of those rules. It’s even worse because my grandmother drives him to and from work (neither me nor my brother have a license). 

At this point I’m fed up and done with him. He’s actually not even here right now, he’s been living at a friends house the past few days because he and I got into yet another fight about him trying to have friends over and he decided he’d just leave. He won’t listen to the guidances, and as soon as Illinois lets up it’s restrictions my family is totally screwed. I really don’t know what to do anymore, and I was hoping for some kind of advice. My biggest concern is and will continue to be our grandmother, seeing as she’s the one paying for our food and shelter, but as long as my brother exists my entire life (and her death) is at risk. 

Please, anything you can offer in guidance. I’m struggling to see that there’s anything I can do. Thank you all, truly.",14May2020,1

827,"I am a college student paying he way through retail, I have worked for my boss for about six months now. I have a 50+ year old co-worker who used to own a store like ours but now works for my boss. Apparently he sunk his store. He then worked for another store in this chain and ""left"" to ours. He has been with us for about four months.

After typing this I can see this is a blatant rant about his shit, it made me feel better so Ill make a TLDR at the end.

Every day I am getting more and more frustrated. He leaves work on the tables undone, he leaves trash scattered about, he leaves tools around (and blades open), he brings in tons of stuff from home and throws it all over our (VERY LIMITED) work space, and all sorts of other things. From the moment he walks into the store he is on his phone talking to someone ranging from his family to his electrician, nonstop. We are both basic bitch employees but he expects me to do all of the grunt work. Anti-covid scrub down of the whole store (multiple times a day),  daily vacuuming, daily  dusting, taking out the trash, ect. All of these are supposed to be shared  responsibilities. He will leave boxes out back and refuse to take them to the dumpster meaning they get wet and disgusting for me to take at the end. For the most part I think that he expects me to do all the jobs that should be beneath the owner. Which he is not. 

Every day that I have off and I return to the store the place is in chaos and I have to spend a ton of time getting things back in order. He prints things at work non-stop for his weekend and hobby stuff and doesn't pay for it. I have no idea if my boss knows. He also leaves things half done, if he actually does end up replacing a trash bag or something he won't actually put the bag up, he will leave it on the floor at the bottom and expect someone else to put it up. The same thing goes for things like our inbox of packages, when it's full... you change it, nope, he just stacks it up and up like a toddler. Then I have to go back, manually take everything he has been stacking up in the system (the stuff he left on the counter too) and then remove them, process that box, and then make a new one. Oh and the few times he will actually do it... he doesn't make a new one and just piles shit up on the counter. Any time people call in and ask about when we close he would be super adamant about a HARD 5 and go into detail about not letting them in. He is always in such a hurry to leave he will start counting drawers 3 hours before we close and start closing down equipment too unless I stop him. 

The other issue is due to him being older, he is technologically inept, and refusing to learn. Many times he will stop me from doing whatever I am doing to help him with something hyper simple related to the job on the PC, ranging from moving a file to just sending an email. At first it was no biggie, he's old. But after a point I sat him down and showed him how to do it. It didn't help. I sat him down again and even wrote down instructions, he just refuses at this point and still will stop me from what I am doing. I have done this with numerous electronics we have around the store and it always ends with me doing it for him or showing him for the umpteenth time.

Lastly during the peak of Covid he used it as every excuse to not work. He would tell customers that we don't take cash so we didn't have to balance tills, even though the boss never told us that, then he would get super pissed at me when I still took cash. The dude is like a bolt of lightning when the clock hits closing, it doesn't matter if half the store isn't shut down, he's out the door and expects me to do it. 

Rant off 

TLDR this dude makes me miserable at work. I have already explained to him he needs to share in the workload, stop screwing up, and I have showed him how to do countless things and wrote down instructions, yet he still makes me do them, and at this point I really feel the only thing I can do is narc to my boss. I can't even lecture him because it's so fucking awkward for a dude in his 20's to be lecturing an old man about things you would yell at an elementary schooler for. I feel bad and I don't want to make it a thing but it is really starting to piss me off. My boss loves me to death and treats me very well so I know for a fact he will back me. I just would feel bad to get a person in trouble and cause work relationship strain.

What do you guys suggest I do?",14May2020,1

For reasons i can guess have to do with my parents finding out about my email that i sent to my teacher (check the second post), i have had more strict limits on my laptop so i shouldnt be on it right now but im hoping this'll be quick:

My former teacher called CPS on my parents, something which some of you may be glad to hear. It backfired right in my face and my parents reacted to the email (that i sent to my teacher) really harshly. I did say a few things that may have been exaggerations, (or maybe my parents are trying to make me believe that they are, idrk anymore), and my parents didnt want to be around me (im alright with that lol). CPS found that the claims were unverified. my parents didn't want me to say ""my truth"" but instead ""the truth"" which basically nullified all my claims, so the social worker didn't take me seriously. I knew my parents would be livid if I told them my side. I looked up how long the foster process may take, and it said 6 months, so if I had to deal with my parents treating me like scum for 6 months, i just couldnt bring myself to actually say my side of the events. My case has been closed, and now im in the same position as before, but a few times worse since my parents found out my true feelings for them. I had to try to convince them i was lying or whatever to make them feel better.

832,"So, I live in a major european city in a very hip party part of the town. I like partying and I am tolerant of noise levels, but my neighbours have been ultra loud the past two weeks.

We're all home because of quarantine and it probably gets to them as much as me, but they're essentially making noise, banging, hammering things in to the wall, jumping, and throwing things nonstop for 2 days and then have an off day where I don't hear much, rinse and repeat. They're actually nice and have gifted me and my roomie a bottle of wine for their noise because they just got a puppy. 

The puppy is a pomeranian. There is no way in hell that this is the work of a singular small puppy. The house was built in the early 1900s and has thick, and I mean really thick stone walls/ceilings. But they are actually keeping me from sleeping and waking me up and is making my shelves sometimes vibrate.

I don't want to call the cops because I am very very certain that there are drugs involved and I don't want them to get in trouble for that. My suspicion is that they are basically railing a shittown of speed and then doing the typical things that you do when you take a large amount of speed at home, which can be impulsively rearranging furniture, throwing things and in general being loud. I mean, hell, under normal circumstances I also like coating my sinuses in some sweet sweet amph but not really during a quarantine situation and not for days straight.

I'm also slightly afraid? I'm not very tall or strong and I honestly can't really deal with confrontations, and a speed bender can def make you more prone to insulting people. My roomie also can't confront them because her English is nonexistant.

835,"I got this job at a corrupt pot shop in bay city that I worked at for almost a year. 

In Nov. I was fired for being violent towards an employee that was friends with the manager. 

This employee i had no issue with at the beginning, she was actually chill besides the cursing she did towards everybody,including patients. We clashed one day bc this woman took all of the tip money to buy herself lunch when everyone else was prohibited from getting tips. I asked the group chat where the tip money went and she said she got herself a pizza. 

She wasn't even working that day but she came to the workplace to scream at me for ratting her out in group message while I was with a patient. She even cornered me into a wall.  They had cameras that had audio. The company's reasoning for not looking at the camera was ""they are not made for that""  so I was fired for being violent towards her. 

I filed so many grievances and everything to this company, eventually, I got into trouble for asking for HRs number. When I finally was able to contact HR, I was cussed out by the main branch in another state. I gave up trying to do anything but now I'm having issues with unemployment and i can't contact them at all 8 weeks after filing. 

Am I too late for any legal action towards this company? Would they have the recordings still?",14May2020,1
836,"Tried to keep this short so loads of detail is missing. Just wanted to get the general idea out there. Hoping someone has some wonderful words of wisdom to share. 

I work in the entertainment industry, and as I’m sure you can imagine - there’s not much moving forward since live events are basically cancelled until further notice. Thankfully the company I work for also handles architectural stuff as well. So throughout this virus mess, I’ve been BEYOND BLESSED to have a steady job with steady income. 

Here’s the problem. The company is toxic. Unorganized is putting it nicely. Shady dealings going on. They’d rather omit vital information than deal with a tiny backlash. I’m a female in a male dominated industry, and everyday I find myself battling people who ask me questions and fight the answers I’ve given them because somehow even though they continuously say “I’ve never done this, so I don’t know the answer that’s why I’m asking you!” when I give them the answer they suddenly become experts on the topic. My supervisor got written up for how he speaks to me, then when the state got shut down he and I were the only two required to stay working in our office while everyone else gets to work from home. So I’ve been pretty miserable for the past month or so but that misery was on top of already being miserable at the job. I made a promise to myself to give the company a year of time. I’m proud to say I suffered through a year of unhappiness, an overwhelming lack or support/trust, and above all training to be able to preform at the best of my abilities. I’ve had multiple conversations with those above me to try and rectify the issues I’m having and I’m met with either false hope or temporary change. 

Needless to say, I’m frustrated. And now, I’m scared. Scared to get stuck in this job that is quite literally making me sick. Scared to leave the job and have nowhere to go because who the hell is hiring right now?! Even looking for work outside of my industry seems impossible. I have a masters degree I’m doing nothing with at my current job so it’s not like I’m afraid of that going to waste - it’s been going to waste since I got it. 

I’m just so lost. Do I stay somewhere I’m helpless and unhappy or do I get out and fight being jobless? I don’t know how much longer I can cope.",14May2020,1

842,"19 yo F here. I've never been someone interested in weed, and it's always had a negative connotation in my mind. My friends did it sometimes, but never with me around. That didn't really bother me. The thought of trying it never entered my mind.

I started dating this guy about a year and a half ago, and he does edibles a few times every couple months. For some reason, this REALLY bothered me (it still bothers me, but it used to bother me a lot more). Like, it would almost give me panic attacks, and we had some MAJOR fights over it. I'm not even sure why it bothered me so much. Like, I was concerned he would develop a dependence or do something irresponsible, and I felt insecure about him enjoying weed more than me. I'm not saying all these fears were reasonable. But that's all I could gather from myself. To this day, I'm still not sure why it has been such a problem for me. He has reassured me time and time again that he doesn't expect me ever to try it, and he wouldn't care if I didn't. He said as long as I respect him, he'll respect me.

I've made some big strides in accepting him doing edibles. Our relationship is so great otherwise I decided I wouldn't break up with him over it as long as it didn't start affecting me and he was being responsible. But for some reason I still get so scared when I think of him doing it.

I'm just so tired of being scared of it. And I figure, with growing legalization of weed, it would be best not to be so scared of it. Disinterested, maybe, but not scared. Do you think it would help to just try it, just so it stops being such a mysterious thing to me? What have your experiences been with weed?

I guess what I'm scared of is life seeming less colorful or exciting after trying it. I don't want to develop a dependence either.

Also, if any of you have felt that similar discomfort with a SO getting high, I'd love to hear your reasoning. Maybe it would help to figure out my own feelings.

844,"Okay so it’s a crazy title, but not really that crazy of a story. This happened when I was a kid but it is still unsettling to me due to the event itself and because of other behaviors that my brother has to this day. I was about 7 years old at the time and my brother was 10. We were swimming in a backyard swimming pool (one that you put up yourself every summer). The water wasn’t too deep, but I could only bring my mouth above water by standing on my toes. My brother was sitting on a float (one of those ones that looks like a bed) while I was in the water. I began spinning in place quickly and all of a sudden I was under the water and couldn’t get back out no matter how hard I jumped up. My seven-year-old brain thought that the spinning caused a whirl pool that was essentially pulling me under the water continuously, until my brother grabbed my hand and pulled me out, thus “breaking” the whirlpool. He was still on the float. It was pretty traumatizing because I was breathing in water as I was trying to jump out of the “whirlpool” and I felt like I almost drowned. It all made sense to me back then, but as an adult I wonder whether my brother may have been pushing me under the water, because is it even possible to create a whirlpool that strong by just spinning in the water?? Anyway, I’m wondering if I should just ask him if he did that because the event still bothers me?

846,"Hello, I'm a 24 year old female who graduated college a little bit ago with a bachelor's in statistics.

Long story short: I currently live at home with my parents and my older brother.  My mom is a narcissist and its not the best environment to be in (Please don't tell me that I should be grateful - I am.  I know I'm lucky to have parents that haven't kicked me out or charged an exuberant amount of rent, but being here isn't good for my health or relationships)  I have five cats, one super old cat that everyone in the family loves and four ferals/strays that I take care of.  I also have six chickens.  Before Corona virus hit I had a job that only paid around $14.00 and hour but also had benefits.  After the plague hit I was laid off and I don't know If I'll be asked back.  I am getting unemployment money, so my finances aren't a current stressor.

I feel like a schmuck/loser for still living at home.  Though I am financially able to move out into an apartment doing so would require me to give up the cats and pass the chickens off to my parents or someone else.  I really don't want to do that, so I figure moving out isn't happening anytime soon.  Regardless, I don't know how to go about getting a better paying/more serious job.  I'd like to have a house of my own with some land so that I could  have all my animals but I don't know what steps I should take to make that happen.  I've considered going to graduate school but I'm hesitant about going into more debt and fellowships/scholarships are hard to come by for my field at my school.  I also don't know if I even want to work in my field or if I want to pursue one of my passions like working with animals.  I've also been writing a novel (Yes, I know.  I see you cringing) and I don't know if I should seriously consider writing or if it's just a stupid cop-out dream.

tl;dr : 24 years old with a college degree and I'm struggling to find a decent paying job. I'm stuck living at home with my toxic family and I can't find an apartment/rental house that is cat and chicken friendly.  I feel like a scumbag who is trapped in a crappy house with crappy people.

I have always been someone who struggles between wanting family before 30 and bettering myself (traveling and working as a model, all while going to school) so I’ve put off time in my mid-twenties to achieve some of my goals.

I was in a serious relationship for 2.5 years but broke up due to it being so toxic. I had planned on marrying this guy but he showed his true colors. Luckily, I got out of it and met a really wonderful man (also 27). We’ve been seeing each other for about 7 months now. I’m usually pretty quick to know if I’m interested in long term plans with someone. He himself is very invested in our long term relationship as well.

He wants a family but he’s also in school and isn’t financially ready to get engaged or any further sets. This is completely understand when logically thinking.

The issue is my, what I only assume, biological time clock is loudly ticking in my ear reminding me I’m not getting any younger and if I want kids I better get going. I’m not in the position at the moment but I want to at least have a plan in motion for it to happen soonish.

This same mindset is with marriage too but that’s only because I’d like to have kids. 

My poor boyfriend has comforted me a few times now about being concerned about having kids too late and reminds me it’s not the right time, but I still just beat myself up about it.

I don’t believe I’m the only one. Can anyone give me some advice? Or maybe an experience they have witnessed or been in similar to mine?

And why is 30 such a rude number 😂

The way the dynamic works now is those 2 that I fell out with hangout with our mutual friends during lunch and stuff, and I see them when I see them, usually chat with them everyday.

Even during lockdown, they talk bad about us through messages.  (I've seen the screenshots)  I'm annoyed because I've tried hard to keep their names out of the dirt.  When we had our fights it was messy but I still respect them as people and don't see the point in belittling them.  I understand that puts our mutual friends in an uncomfortable spot.  I don't think part of me is over the pain yet though.  I think I still value their opinions a lot and seeing how much they hate me truly hurts.  Where should I go from here?

855,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. We lived together in university but haven't since graduating. I live in an apartment with a friend and he moved back in with his mom (per her request to help with rent and keep her company).

His mom was physically abusive to him and his sister when they were kids (sis has completely cut the mom out) and is emotionally abusive to him now.

Everything that goes wrong in her life is his fault. It is impossible for him to have a conversation with her without her calling him names and saying ""fuck you"", ""I hate you"", ""fuck off"" etc. Then she cries because he ""doesn't try to be close to her"". She expects him to constantly do her favors like go to McDonalds to get her a coffee 5 times a day. If he says no or not right now she calls him disrespectful, lazy and ungrateful. She calls him fat both to me and to him, which I can see has hurt his self image.

It's driving both of us crazy but it's also making him really upset. He feels like he has no real relationship with his mom (he's right) and can't build one because they can't have a conversation without her putting him down (right again). He has attempted to speak openly about this with her but she just gets upset and blames him.

Surprisingly she also doesn't want him to move out. She is constantly reminding us that our company is the only thing keeping her from being depressed and when he has stayed over at my place she sends us pictures of her heart rate saying she is having anxiety attacks when we aren't with her. I see this as a controlling abuse tactic.

We were supposed to move in together in June but covid has delayed that plan. He can't move into my apartment because he has a cat (no pets allowed), covid, no space for all of us to work from home etc. If it were possible this would be my first move.

Him and his mom live in a one bedroom (his room isn't technically a bedroom - fits a bed and that's it) and they are both working from home. This means that he is trapped in a small space with someone who is cruel to him 24/7.

I've been looking for places for him to rent but there is nothing that he can afford without us splitting and living together. I have a roommate that I wouldn't feel right moving out on without solid warning when times are this tough, or I'd do it in a heartbeat.

I just want to help him with this situation in any way I can but I'm at a loss. I honestly don't know what I can do to help. I want him to have his own space where he can feel comfortable. I don't want to see him crushed by his god awful excuse for a mother every single day. It seems like an impossible situation but I'm hoping someone here has a suggestion to guide us through.

858,"First of all, I wanted to make clear, that I am NOT trying to be “deep” or “existential” in this post. This is just how I feel and I simply had an urge to write it somewhere. To be honest, this is my first experience with this subreddit, so if it´s offtopic, then please tell me subreddit on which this post belongs.

I am 19 y. o. boy and a few years ago I asked myself a question: If everybody is going to die, then why should we even live? I don´t know if this is something everybody deals with and I am just overreacting, but if you think about it, it´s 100% chance humanity, Earth and the whole universe will one day end and practically everything you ever did will be pointless because at this point nothing you created/changed will exist. One day you will die, your family and friends will die and everything you lived for will be meaningless.

I started thinking about it over 5 years ago, but I still cannot get past it. I don´t know what´s happening to me. I can´t be the only one who realized this, but I don´t see anyone else freak out about it. I always have like a 2-8 months long period when I am fine, followed by a 2-8 months long period when I feel basically 24/7 awful. During this time I spend a huge majority just lying on my bed and thinking about why is life in general meaningless. I don´t want to think about it, but I just have to. Sometimes I even wake up in the middle of the night after just a few hours of sleep and I am unable to go to sleep again because I have to think about it. It´s really painful, mainly because I can´t even read books anymore, my thoughts are simply louder than my actual inner voice reading a book. I observed my behavior and I think I am constantly switching between 3 states. 

1. I just don´t want to do anything. I mostly just lie on my bed and think about the meaningless of life. At this state, I am just absurdly phlegmatic. I don´t really feel any emotion. I am not bored of not doing anything nor sad of fact, that we will all die one day. I just literally feel nothing and I do not care for anything. Even if I am hungry I will mostly just ignore it because in the long run it will not matter and it gives me pain that´s less painful than my thoughts. 

2. I am randomly getting sad and I really want to do something, but at the same time, I don´t want to do anything. I am really active in my “ok periods”, so for my body is extremely counterintuitive not to do anything for a longer time. For example, I want to go outside, so I dress up, but by the time I am ready I get really sad and don´t want to go anymore. I just get really sad for no reason from minute to minute. Few times I even started randomly crying in the middle of the street and had to sit down on the sidewalk for like half an hour. At this phase, I am sometimes even thinking about suicide, but I highly doubt I would go that far. 

3. I am quite active but extremely aggressive. At this state, I am usually doing a lot of things, but if something goes wrong even in some small and inconsequential way (for example I drop a pencil) I get irrationally angry and unable to calm for good minutes. This is the main reason why I stopped actively talking to my friends. I just don´t want them to be a center of my anger.

I really don´t know what to do, because I don´t want to live like this. I feel like I am really unstable individual, but I never told anyone about my thoughts. I simply don´t want anyone to worry. I am only writing this because I don´t know what else can I at this point do, so if you know by any chance how to help please tell me.

PS: Thanks to everyone who had read my whole post and I apologize if I made aby grammar mistakes because English is not my first language.

PS2: I know there will be some people that would joke in comments about this post and to you, I want to say – please don´t. This is a very serious subject for me. I never opened to anyone about it and it wasn´t nearly as easy to write about as it can seem.

    The hardest part is that I’m suffering from Depression, Anxiety, and Body and Facial dysmorphia. It’s gotten to point where I have to binge eat to gain weight since my family makes fun of my body weight and my naturally small frame (46kg) . When someone close to me made fun of my weight, I completely broke down. I cut off all communication for awhile.

864,"Hi, this has a lot of layers and I’ve never really talked about it so I’m sorry if it gets long. I’m a younger adult, and I’ve been in a long term relationship with my boyfriend for four and a half years. He is legitimately my best friend, we have nearly identical interests and sense of humor and being with him has never been a chore. People often call us soulmates when they haven’t known us for very long at all and I think a lot of people get surprised at how close we are. We’ve rescued a dog together, and talk about marriage and kids like it’s not even a question. On the surface, I’ve settled down. 

But in reality, I think I may be a lesbian. When I fall asleep, I have wet dreams about sleeping with a woman. Cute girls catch my eyes in stores and on the street in ways guys never have. It doesn’t help that my boyfriend isn’t very sexually motivated, even from the beginning of our relationship, and we’re almost always together so I don’t really have time to fantasize. I’ve mentioned it to my boyfriend before, and on some level I think he knows. I know if it ever came to anything, he’d let it be an open relationship because he doesn’t want to let me hold myself back, but I know it would weigh on him heavily. I love him with every ounce of my being and it’s hard for me to imagine being without him, but I can’t help but imagine what it would feel like if he was a girl when we are intimate. 

I had a really terrible breakdown this year causing me to drop out of college, and I don’t have any friends and I haven’t for quite a while. We’re moving to be closer to my parents because of my possible instability as I transfer to a different school. I’m incredibly lonely and haven’t had anyone to talk to in weeks. My parents are emotionally abusive and have crushed all my self confidence, and the only therapist they’ll let me talk to (I cannot afford my own and they finance this) is one that’s a friend of theirs and also conservative, so I have to mince my words. I feel like their must be something wrong with me at this point, as everyone I encounter seems awkward and nervous in my presence and it feels like I may be incapable of making friends. This, on top of my sexuality, has me feeling terribly hopeless. I have gained 90 pounds in 3 months, the last 30 in 2 weeks, and have destroyed my body, I have stretch marks everywhere and I cannot hide them. I have been dieting for the last month and have only lost 5 pounds despite eating less than 1,200 calories a day and exercising religiously. This all makes me feel like even if I was confident enough to leave my boyfriend and try to explore my sexuality, I would be unlovable and incapable of finding anyone else. It’s to no fault of his, as he has never anything but support me and love me. I have no idea what to do. I feel completely, totally, and utterly hopeless. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",14May2020,1

I've lived in 5 different cities since I moved away from home due to work and school, and I've lived with 22 roommates over the course of that time. I've gotten along with the majority of my roommates; i dont make noise and i clean up after myself. I'm usually out of the house most of the time. But there are 4 housemates out of those 22 who didn't like me, which i get is bound to happen, but they're always the same kind of person. It's always someone who is just angry all the time, and im always the one they make the target. First time was this guy who drank a lot, very racist, very loud, he would try to get the others to hate me. Second time was this girl who smoked a lot of weed and would scream at her boyfriend on the phone every other night; she was very controlling of me but not our other roommates. Third time was this girl who screamed at me for leaving a box on the table while i was literally moving in and had hands full of other boxes, i moved out after a month because she only got worse from there (called me a ""dirty pig"" for leaving literally one strand of hair in the bathtub, which she took a picture of and sent to the house chat in an attempt to shame me). And now the fourth time, my roommate John who literally screams at me and none of the roommates (probably because they're his childhood friends, but he doesn't scream at my boyfriend who lives with us and is way messier). In all these situations, i got along with the other 3-5 roommates who were in the house, and im still friends with some of them. I'm not perfect, but when my roommates bring up issues i always listen and fix the problem immediately. And when i have issues, I'm not mean or aggressive about it.

870," 

This is bothering me a lot so I'm posting here in an attempt to get this off my chest.

Two years ago I got an IUD so I could be safe with my then-boyfriend. After we broke up (it was a bad breakup) I had a one night with a guy, and I ended up having unprotected sex. (I know very dumb of me to do that). After sleeping with him, I didn't experience any symptoms or experience and abnormalities with my body, so I guess I totally ignored the fact that STD's can be severe.

Anyways fast forward a year later, I had sex with a stranger from tinder again... unprotected. I asked him if he had STDS and he said no, but that was honestly very dumb of me to do. After sleeping with him, I didn't experience any symptoms. But 2 months later I started getting weird discharge... and this is where I began to learn my lesson.....

After about a month of weird discharge, I mustered up the courage to go to the OB/GYN. I told my mom I was going to get my IUD removed (which I did) but the real reason I was going was bc I wanted to get tested.

Anyways, I now have my IUD removed and I have been tested...but.....The doctor called and said she wanted me to schedule a follow-up appointment regarding my tests. The appointment is scheduled for Tuesday, but I'm still really scared of the results may entail. She wouldn't ask for a follow-up appointment if the tests came back negative, right?

Anyways, I'm scared that I might come back positive for an STD, and if I do I have no idea how I'll explain to my parents. (I'm the super good kid in the family (good grades, went to a good school, is the ""ideal"" kid that a parent would want) So if my parents ever found out that I had sex like this, they would be devasted.

What should I do if my tests come back positive? How do I tell my parents? How do I stop hating myself for the mistakes that I made in the past?

I (21) have a younger brother (16 soon 17) and he makes the last one and a half year the life for my mom super hard. Early on it began with things like being past 10 outside but it escalated rather quickly with stuff like being super disrespectfull to my mom and bringing the police home because he stole something. That stuff keept happening until a brain tumor was discovered in my mothers head. She had surgery and everything went well but my brother keept provoking her after she came home.He keept going  outside until one at the morning. Mind you we dont know where the fuck he is hanging arround and what he is doing the main concern is that something bad happens to him and that he dosent take school serious. Skip a year later and after many arguments screaming and fighting it still becomes worst. He beats up my brother when i am not arround and hides the ps4 controller so he dosen't play while he goes outside. We found a grinder (i dont have a problem with weed) in his room and he had several problems with the cops. He dosent give a shit about his finals at school and is a overall dickhead and egoist. I am not here to talk trash about him or try to sound like a good person and make him look like the villain but  i think you can imagine how desprate i am when i make a post about him. What would be your solution if you were in my situation and you had a brother that has bad influences around him disguised as 'friends' and does everything that he wants. And please dont come to me with beating the shit out of him i dont believe that violence would solve that.

Oh and he dosent respect the quarantine here and maybe comes home with corona. I dont care if i get sick but i care if my mom gets sick because she is in the group of people that are endangered by the virus.

879,"We are both over 30 years old for clarity sake.

My issue is that my brother is becoming more and more bitter every single time I see him. He lives a couple of hours away, so we see him 1-2 times per month on average. For that reason, I am trying my hardest to just let it go. Unfortunately, it's starting to affect other people and now I feel like I should probably say something. The problem is that I don't understand what is causing this. It's a personality type that I am not experienced in dealing with. 

The advice I am looking for is help figuring out what this is so that I can research a little more about how to approach him.

Here are a couple of examples of what I am referring to:

**Example 1:** We were supposed to be meeting up with some of our mutual friends this weekend for a socially distanced bonfire. One of our friends is a hugger and not the type to be concerned with the pandemic. My brother said that he would speak to him (they are closer friends then we are). We said not to worry about it, but he will anyway. 

The problem is that he won't just politely ask him to keep his distance or not hug us. He will tell this guy that no one wants to hug him and really make him feel like absolute garbage and then follow it up by saying that it's what I wanted him to say putting it all back on me. 

I know that will be the end result because this isn't the first time he has done that. It's just how he speaks to people.

**Example 2:** Everyone in my family loves camping. My parents are a little old now so they are going to stop going. That means they have offered my brother their RV. This thing is worth about $10K-15K in it's current state and age. My dad asked only that he pay about $3K since he still owes that on his ATV. 

My brother shows up yesterday and is non-stop complaining about this. Saying how bullshit it is that our dad expects him to pay anything for this trailer because it would just sit there if my brother didn't take it. He is acting as if he is doing my dad a favor by taking the trailer off his hands. 

To make matters worse, my parents live near him in a small town where they jacked up liquor prices during this pandemic. My dad asked him to pick up a case of beer in the city since he was coming to visit me and the prices are a lot better here. My brother complained like my dad was asking him to donate his liver. Despite my dad basically giving him a trailer for far less than it is worth, my brother wouldn't even stop to buy him a case of beer when he was literally 50 feet from a liquor store.

**Example 3:** We have a 1 year old. My mother's health isn't great so we have been doing our best to avoid contact with her at both her request and our own decision. We have been doing the daily video calls and sending her videos. Everything is going great.

Then my brother starts rubbing it in her face that he is coming to see his nephew and that she can't. He was intentionally rubbing it in her face to the point that she started crying. According to my dad, he has been doing this a lot over the past year. Any time he can hurt her, he doesn't miss the opportunity.

He is upsetting my parents. He is acting extremely ungrateful. Every interaction I have with him is stressful because it's just ""fuck this, fuck that, fuck fuck fuck...."". I can tolerate the negativity to a point, but it feels like that negativity has surpassed my tolerance level. 

The odd thing is that while he was always a bit on the lacking empathy side, this is far worse than normal. I understand the COVID situation is affecting everyone, but the decline started before this.",14May2020,1

I come from a big family so before I met him I was always sharing a room with a sibling and we would often sleep in each other’s beds. For the first few days after he left I had family members stay with me overnight. I feel like I have to face my fears because I’m a big baby and am literally scared of the apartment at night. The last two nights I’ve been sleeping alone, kept all the lights on and the tv but it’s been hard I wake up often and for some reason waking up makes me very emotional I guess bc I’m hyper aware that my husband is no longer really with me. I keep waking up at 3 am super anxious and want to call one of my sisters to come over. I eventually cry myself back to sleep. In the morning I’m sad again because I wake up alone but I feel like I have to normalize sleeping alone and not dread not knowing if I have someone who will spend the night with me.

I was desperate to get a job during my last semester of college so I took this job without any much research.

However, it has been slow and I'm starting to worry that I may be fired soon for not doing a good enough job and not enough business. Like that are other engineers but I think I would be the first let go. 

Btw I've been with this company for almost a year and I stayed with it for this long (I know I didn't like it the first week) because I have student loans and I want to get experience.

To be honest, I've been unmotivated to work as hard as I should partly because I think this job is really boring and partly because I do not like this industry. But its good money.

I do not know if my mental health is affecting my performance or just that I DO NOT like this industry. I've been diagnose with mild sleep apnea so that may contribute to my performance but I don't think its tells the whole story.

887,"My younger brother is 14 years old, and ever since quarantine, him and my mom get into intense verbal fights. I understand that he's a teenage boy whose still going through puberty, and still developing. However, I can't help but feel that his blatant hate towards my mother is driven by more than just hormones. 

No one likes to hear their mother cry in anguish and frustration. When I hear her cry in her room because of my brothers stubbornness and hateful irrational comments I can't help but dislike him. Don't get me wrong I still love my brother, but I don't know what to do about his behavior. I just know that I need to try and do something. 

My mother and I have talked about what might be the issue before. We think he is a compulsive liar because he lies about the most minuscule things. He lies about eating food, watching YouTube when he shouldn't, not doing his homework, and even about how much time has passed. He has convinced himself that his computer deletes assignments when he turns them in blank. 

He acts like a villain's background story. Saying that my mother has never loved him, when it's obviously the opposite. He says that his life is horrible, and that he feels like nothing good ever happens to him. He's very selfish, and protective of his school Chromebook. My mother and I try our best to monitor his school work to make sure it's turned in on time, and actually done. So, we need to look at his computer to do that. 

He gets defensive, and holds onto the computer like a child. (He even growls at us if we try to grab it out of his hands!) He tries to divert our attention from his slow or lack of progress on assignments to how annoying or harmful we are to him. How there is always something my mom has done to hinder his progress and happiness. Not once have I heard him say that he's sorry or in the wrong. Even in situations were we have ample evidence to prove that he's done something bad. 

I hate listening to him try to defend himself because I know he's wrong. He's struggled enough in school, but quarantine has made it 10x worse to the point were they took him out of half his classes. I understand that adolescence is a time of tribulation and growth, but I just feel a little hopeless. I want to see him succeed, and I definitely want to see him be kind to our mother. 

What should I do?

893,"My girlfriend and I broke up on Monday. It’s currently Thursday and I picked up my stuff from her house. I got home and after these 4 days of holding emotions back I broke down. We did not end on bad terms. Nor did we end on the best of terms. We both were deeply in love with each other and thought of each other as the world. Then a December night happened and we both hurt each other. Even after that we tried to work things out together and fix our relationship. Things weren’t the same and that night was just a constant reminder in both our heads. No cheating happened it was more emotional hurt. We tried a break but ended up together the next day at her house. We broke up more than once then got back together shortly after. This time was final though. She had had enough and broke up with me on Monday. I’ve never had a breakup like this. I’ve only ever been in two other relationships that I left since they were both cheating on me. I’m asking for advice on what I can do to help myself get over her and not hurt as much. I want to lose weight since that’s always been a goal of mine that I never got around to. And I work most of the week and this week when I haven’t been working I’ve been going home and staying in my room and just listening to music. Any advice is helpful.

895,"My biggest character flaw I think is that if I get frustrated or upset with people, a situation, not getting my way, I close off completely and want to go home/leave. This happens with my partner's family, at social gatherings where I don't want to do the activity everyone's doing, when shopping for clothes with my partner, or if we go to an event and I'm bored or socially exhausted.

Essentially I become quiet, upset and inconsolable, don't want to converse/talk with anyone, and have a sourpuss face on until I leave.


I just had a big argument/discussion with my SO about how this affects her and I realized this sucks for her and she won't even suggest doing activities she thinks I may not want to do even if she really wants to because of how I can be so ""bummy"" about it.

I hate this about myself, and want to change. Aside from the typical ""go outside, take a walk, do a mantra, meditate, distract yourself"" advice I can google to find, I would love some more tips or even better a BOOK that can help me deal with this problem I have.

Any advice would be extremely appreciated. Thanks for reading.",14May2020,1

897,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

Often in my apartment hallways, there is a smell of marijuana smoke. Back in March, I received an email from the office stating that someone smelled smoke coming from my apartment. I replied and said that there is no smoking in my apartment (there isn't) and the person who complained is mistaken as to the source of the smell. They replied ""ok cool"" and I thought that was that.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this week, I heard an irate individual in the hallway shouting about the smell and to knock that shit off. It sounded close but figured they can't be talking about me because I'm not smoking. Then today, more shouting about it and it definitely sounds like they're speaking to my door. I throw some clothes on and open the door but they're already gone (I can't even smell smoke in the hallway at this point). As I'm peeking out, I do see a woman turning the corner and she looks at me and she looks back in the direction she was coming from, likely at the person who was just shouting. Not fifteen minutes later, I receive a call from my apartment management company stating this is now the second complaint they have received and that this time it was from a different individual that said they definitely smelled the odor strongest coming from my apartment. I told them, I don't smoke. I don't know where it's coming from but it's not me. They said they advised this person to call the police if they smell it again (which is fine, I don't smoke, they won't get anything out of me). They also said that if they receive one more complaint, they are issuing me a lease infraction!

&amp;#x200B;

I have not smoked pot for years. I don't smoke in here period. I don't have candles, I'm not cooking, the apartment is clean so there's nothing that could really be emitting an odor similar to marijuana.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do at this point. Someone is convinced that they smell smoke coming from my apartment which is simply incorrect. There is no proof either obviously because nothing is occurring. Typically, management would be onsite and could easily come down, knock on my door,  step into the apartment, and quickly tell that there is no smoke smell in here. But with the shelter-in-place order, they are all remote. I really don't want anything on my rental record. It's already annoying that I am being accused, but if this turns into a negative material effect, I am going to be very upset and could face issues down the road.

899,"This is a very unique and complicated situation. I am a 17-year-old female. My half brother, Andrew, is 13. We have the same father. We met through him for the very first time a couple of years ago. Andrew lives with his mom, while I was raised by my Grandparents as an only child, then moved in with my mom when I was 14. When Andrew and I met, we didn't really get a chance to get to know each other since our dad very quickly decided he doesn't want anything to do with me. Keep in mind our dad was pretty much our only way to stay connected since neither I or my mom knew Andrew's mom.

 So a couple of years have gone by and I really want to get to know him and be there for him. I've been wanting to contact my dad just so I can get in contact with Andrew, but there's so much bad blood between us I just never could bring myself to send him a message. I have expressed this to my mom and she thinks its a great idea to try and get into contact with him. So I've been spending lots of time gathering up the courage and trying to think of what to say. Well, this morning my mom found Andrew's mom, her name is Vicky, on Facebook and decided to message her. Turns out Vicky thinks its a great idea as well and gave my mom Andrew's phone number and my mom gave it to me!

I am super excited, nervous, overwhelmed, scared, so many feelings. I don't know if he wants to get to know me too, if he's angry at me, or even if he still remembers me. I just want to make a good impression on him and his mom. I want him to like me! I'm super bad at meeting new people. I'm so awkward. To make this even worse, I was raised as an only child so I don't really know how siblings work, and I don't know how 13-year-old boys are or what they like. I guess my main questions are 

1. What should I say/include in the first message? Should it be serious, funny, heartfelt?
2. What if he isn't interested in getting to know me?
3. What are some good ice breaker questions I should ask him if it gets to that point?

Let me know if you have any questions. I'm very anxious so this might've been kinda messy and all over the place haha. Any input/advice would also be very appreciated. If you have a similar story and would like to share, I'd love to read it! Thank you so much guys. Stay safe and don't forget to lead with love!",14May2020,1
900,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 20 year old male that just moved in about 5 months ago with my girlfriend of 3 years, who is also 20. We love each other very very much and I don’t see a life without her. However, I feel like I made the jump too early.

Our hometown is San Jose and I moved to Washington with her in hopes of starting our life together. But upon moving in, I’ve encountered a number of problems that just make me feel like going back home. For instance, after starting my new job, I met a coworker that are female that I love hanging out with. She’s probably one of my best friends. But my girlfriend has a jealousy problem &amp; even after talking about the situation with her, she still gets upset and I feel like shit.

I just don’t feel like I can keep living here anymore. But I feel stuck because we had just bought a car. Before you guys go off on me saying that was the worst decision... I know. I completely understand. She put $2k and I put $2k for a down payment and we are now owners for a 2016 Honda Civic. Beautiful car. I love it so much. Everything is under my name though, just for the record. When I was doing the paperwork online it wouldn’t let me add another person (we bought thru Carvana). 

Please give me ideas, advice, anything. It’s not like I stopped loving my girlfriend, I just don’t think it’s a good time to be living together just yet. And any information that you guys want to know I’d be happy to add in.",14May2020,2

I can’t get her to calm down and she threatens our relationship. I’ve told her she needs to go to therapy and learn some good communication skills, and she makes no effort to do that. For example, I just asked her why she was crying, she says its because I treat her bad, but all I’ve asked her to do this morning was to be patient because I’m busy filling out an application for an apartment. She just asked me what I’m doing, I told her ‘nothing’, she responded ‘it looks like you’re busy’, I replied with ‘I just need some time to myself’ so she storms off and says ‘I guess our relationship is over for good then’.

Hey all,

Looking for some advice on the best way to help my 13 year old Yellow Lab with a couple issues.

The first thing (which I think I'm headed in the right direction with) is her ear.  Most of her life, she has had reoccurring ear issues that we believe are related to allergies.  Every so often, one (sometimes both) of her ears will become very wet with what seems like very dark ear wax or pus, and the same ear definitely seems inflamed.  My mom usually treats her ears with otic rinses,zymox, benadryl, and usually after a week or so the symptoms get better.  Since my mom is convinced her ears seem to be allergy related, she has done her best to try different dog foods to see if grains or other things could be the cause.  Right now I am setting up an appointment with an animal dermatologist specialist to check her ears, test allergies, and whatever the specialist may recommend.

The second issue is related to her hind legs.  Obviously my lab is up there in age, and I don't expect her to be running around like she used to, but I want to make sure we're doing everything we can for her.  13 is undoubtedly old for a lab, but my girl is amazingly healthy all things considered.  She has had BOTH her ACL's redone on her back legs and she's been run over, but man, this dog keeps on chugging.  Every morning at 8am she busts into someone's room and gets them up to feed her.  She's pretty lazy and has been a porch potato since birth, but I can't really say that her personality or behavior has changed.  She'll still run out the back door to bark at squirrels or whatever else with our other dog.  Every time I come home to visit she gets up to see me or my girlfriend, she has no trouble remembering things I have yet to see signs of mental deterioration.  There was one point late last year where she was really grim, apparently she wouldn't leave my parents' bed for over 24 hours and wouldn't eat.  We thought it was the end, but the vet ran some liver numbers, put her on gabapentin, and she literally rebounded in the next day.  She's been fine since, like it never happened (she's still on gabapentin). 

Her one thing is her hind legs definitely seem to be the most affected from her age.  She's a little slower to get up and lay down, and when I feel her legs, it definitely seems like she's lost a little bit of muscle mass in them.  She's a teensy bit wobbly in them, but less like she's shaky and more like she just isn't as fine tuned with their control.  The other thing is that her bark is pretty much gone.  It's pretty hoarse, seems more like forces air than a true bark, but she hasn't really exhibited any other significant respiratory issues.  She did have a weird symptom for awhile where throughout the day she seemed to be trying to clear her throat.  It wasn't coughing and seemed to be all in her throat.  Mom says that this has pretty much disappeared since the gabapentin.  She is convinced after some pet WebMD that it's GOLPP, relating her vocal issues and her legs.  I believe the vet might have also concluded this as a possiblity too.  I don't doubt this as a potential cause, plus I'm sure with her age arthritis and other things have aged her joints.  I want to say she's also on Dasaquin/Cosaquin, but I'll have to check with my mom.

The reason I'd like some advice is because I sort of question how thorough our vet was.  My parents have used the same veterinary practice for all our dogs, but sometime in the last few years the vet that we really liked moved or began at a different practice, and since then, the new primary vet has just been ok.  I don't doubt the man is knowledgeable and has a professional education and experience, but the few times I've been to our dogs appointments, he has seemed a bit nonchalant and minimally communicative.  My girlfriend and I moved to Philly last summer, and the vet we see for our dog is extremely thorough, communicative, and honest about our options for our dog.  I can't help but think that if our lab saw a vet like that, I would feel much better about a diagnosis or other reasonable means of tests and specialists for her (within reason for a 13 year old dog).  My impression from him was that he saw a 13 year old lab that, despite two prior leg surgeries, is in relatively good health, so he didn't feel the need to encourage my mom to do too much.  Even my mom has said that she didn't feel like he was the best vet.

The reason my eyes have opened more to vet specialty practices is because the dog we have now has had a crazy bout of eye issues that required a dog opthalmologist to diagnose and treat.  7 prior vets had no clue, and it wasn't until the last vet recommended an eye specialist that we even knew vet specialists really operated and existed for domestic pets.  

What would anyone recommend in terms of getting my dog checked for her symptoms, since we're not big fans of our general vet practice right now?

921,"I was homeschooled all my life, graduated last year. Apparently I got my diploma. But I don't know because I have to take my parents word for that and they aren't exactly the most reliable. I'm working my second job currently but temporarily laid off until this covid-19 thing is over. Parents will be moving in a couple months, once they move I will be out of a job for the second time due to relocation. All my life I've been moving around, this made me a lot less motivated to seek out friendships. They are saying if I move with them I have to live with them for another year, otherwise I have to move out now. Thing is, I'm in no position to move out. I have no social or life skills, and no one to share an apartment with. So they are basically forcing me to live with them for another year because they know there is no way I'm moving out now. I already buy all my own food and pay rent, so I'm already paying a lot. I want to move out but just don't know how. I also don't have any friends/hobbies/whatever. I'm super depressed and sometimes I think about killing myself. I just fucking hate existing. I know it sounds like I'm just playing the victim here and maybe I am. I just wish I was more skilled and motivated like other people. I wish I was given a proper education and direction in life.

I'm not in college. I'm kinda interested in philosophy. Should I go to community college and study that? Idk. I guess my only goal right now is getting a good paying job and getting the hell out of my parent's. The rest such as having a social life is so far out in the distance that I'm not even thinking about it right now. Another thing that tends to make people hate me is my self deprecating attitude and how I state my opinions. People get uncomfortable with what I say. People always treat me like shit. Never had a girlfriend (obviously because I'm a fucking loser and no one would ever like me). I hate socializing with people my age. Even at my job all they do is call me names because apparently it's super funny to laugh at a depressed suicidal homeschooled socially awkward kid.

Honestly yes I'm looking for advice but I would have rather just not been born at all. Maybe it's my extreme depression but it's honestly more just rage at this point. I'm jealous of what other people have. I'm mad that I was even placed on this capitalist slave world with the shitty role of the dice. It makes me just want to destroy something that's how mad I am every second. I almost got sucked into that whole incel shit. It satisfied my urge to rage at everything and everyone. I gave it up because I realized it was just gonna make my problems worse. I understand no one cares about me but it's not because I'm ugly just because no one wants to be around a fucking freak like me.

Social anxiety really fucks you up. I can't leave the house without being nervous as hell and being super self conscious. No one ever talks to me. I just want to blow my fucking brains out.

On top of that I've never been vaccinated because my parents are stupid anti-vaxxers and I don't have my own healthcare. I don't want to risk using theirs in case they find out and proceed to kick me out of the house. I'm probably gonna get a preventable disease and die, but at this point I hope it's painless and quick lol. And no I'm not paying $400 dollars for it just because our healthcare system is shit and you have to pay for basic needs like vaccinations

I do have a driver's license, I feel like that's the only thing I have going for me lol, I'm too dumb in all other aspects of life, although I am trying to learn here and there to make up for my shitty education, but I feel it is probably too late

I don't have a car yet but plan on getting one when/if I move.

Yeah I think that's all. I know that's a lot to read but I would appreciate any advice you can give me. Please don't give me generic hopeful ""it will get better, don't worry"" shit, because I know it won't unless I actually do something about it. Maybe I need to seek therapy. All I know is that sitting on my ass won't do anything. I'm not exaggerating by any means. My life is shit. Haven't had a friend in 10 years. Tons of mental health problems. If my parents let me slack off I probably wouldn't even try to improve my life tbh. I'm not being dramatic at all. The average person has a life that is 100x better than mine.

The worst part is I'm probably gonna forget about this post and go back to being a lazy piece of shit. Help me Reddit. My life depends on it (seriously I'm probably gonna kill myself if I don't get better, I can't fucking take this shit anymore). Please shoot me a DM if you can help

922,"For some background information, I’m an essential worker at a veterinary hospital. One of my coworkers who just started a few months ago has been harassing me since day one. He’s made sexual comments to me, asked what type of birth control I used, asked how much I have sex, and he even got my phone number from the work computer. He’s been texting me non stop.

Yesterday, I decided to confront him. But it was one encounter with him that really pushed me over the edge. 

As we were treating a dog, he proceeded to remove his mask and SNEEZE right in my direction, less than a few inches from my face. He thought this was hilarious. He then took his tissue and chased me with it like it was a game.

I’m taking this virus situation extremely seriously, and I can’t stand when people think it’s something to joke about. 

I basically told him to get the fuck away from me. My HR rep was standing right there and she did nothing, maybe she didn’t hear the interaction. He made some comment along the lines of “wow, what are you on your period or something?”

Anyways, later that day I confronted him and told him his comments/actions and general obsession with me makes me very uncomfortable. He apologized, but basically spent the rest of the day mocking me and laughing with my other coworkers about how “sensitive” I was. 

Should I take this issue past HR? They don’t seem to care at all about his behavior, especially because my HR rep is the one who hired him, and she’s known this guy for 15+ years. I just want him to leave me alone.",14May2020,1
923,"I honestly didn't know where else to go at this point. I have been stressing over my life for the past 3 months and I'm terrible at making decisions and need some different opinions to see if what i'm thinking is actually reasonable at all.

I'm 23 year old female and I live on the east coast, I have all my life. But I've never been able to focus on me, really. What I want. It's always been about my relationships or parents or whatever the case. I went from a 4 year relationship with someone who manipulated me and made me feel worthless straight into another 4 year relationship with someone who is wonderful but has their life figured out and I feel like our love has...lost its touch. I also just finished my associates degree and I want to get my bachelors. I've also always wanted to live west. I hate it here at this point lol. So I was thinking, even though I have pretty bad social anxiety, that I am sick of being so depressed about my life. I can't live this monotonous routine anymore. I feel like I'm moving nowhere. I've looked into a college in the west and I have a really good chance of getting in. I could move my life there for at least 2 years and live on campus and make new friends and better myself and my life. But it's also a huge change and I will know absolutely nobody out there and it slightly terrifies me.

Am I crazy for wanting to do this? Is it unrealistic? Should I lessen my dream and do it a different way? I don't know. Please, opinions welcome!",14May2020,1
924,"(I am 19 btw, student, school just got out) 

Example: Last night I went to bed before midnight. Today I woke up at 7:20 AM, showered, drew a picture, browsed Reddit, played Pokemon, made cookie dough, and did some sewing. But nothing really makes me happy. I've been in quarantine mostly since mid-March and, despite being homeschooled and staying home a lot as a kid, I feel like I'm all alone and losing my mind. Nothing makes me happy, and I basically just have the same 4-5 friends I talk to and as of late have not been getting along real well with 1-2 of them.

I just feel so hopelessly bored. I read math on my own, I do art, I've even started applying for an online tutoring job, and I go on walks, but everything just feels like the same old same old. I want to GO somewhere, I want to MEET people, I feel so trapped and alone and every day feels painstakingly the same. There's only so many hobbies I can do before getting tired of it all y'know?

I try to make friends/dates online but it doesn't usually work out because I'm nothing like 99% of people I meet, which makes me feel even more alone (I have aspergers and am trans, but that doesn't mean I get along with everyone else who is in one of those categories). In fact, I don't get along well with most people I meet in person either -- I used to put a lot of effort into making friends, but hardly anyone reciprocates that effort. My personality has developed more over the past few months and I feel like I no longer can relate very well with some people I used to relate with, and the loneliness is overwhelming.

I just want someone who ""gets"" me, and something to do that actually brings me joy. Any advice?

(Also, I am on an SNRI, but you know, quarantine has been a very different experience than any of us are used to, and it's finally taking a toll on me -- but I don't want to wallow in self-pity either)",14May2020,1
925,"Hi, I'm about to start my own photography instagram and I need some help with the name.

My photography instagram will be for people to check my work and see my services. I will photograph various things (portraits, events, abstract, landscapes, boudoir)

The name I first wanted was @gkcaptures (gk because it was the initials of my father that just passed away..)

That name is already being used and as such I thought of 2 options, @gk.captures or @gk22captures (22 was our favorite number).

Marketing experts told me the dot would ruin everything, but I think the 22 is just a bit too much, what do you think? And please feel free to suggest a new name! The only rule is that it must contain ""gk"" and be photography related and original. Thanks.",14May2020,1

927,"Sorry, I tried posting in r/relationshipadvice but it said I am not allowed. 2 nights ago, I (23M) texted my GF (25F) asking her if I could call her later in the night. We talk every night, and I wanted to stay up late because I am a night shift nurse and had a shift the following night. For me it's really helpful to stay up late the day before so I sleep in on the day of my shift. I texted her at 1050pm asking her if it was cool if I called her later in the night because I was going to play video games with my friends (we usually talk somewhere around 9-11pm). She said it was okay, I sent her another text saying ""are you sure? It's prob gunna be pretty late, I don't wanna miss you if your already tired."" She responded ""don't worry, I'll be awake!""

Fast forward to 1250am, I call her and she doesn't pick up. I call her again, she doesn't pick up again so I figured she fell asleep. I text her saying good night and that I'll talk to her in the morning. I also apologize for missing her before she fell asleep.

I woke up the next morning to a missed phone call at 130am and a few texts. The texts said ""hey, we need to stop doing this, I really wanted to talk to you last night and you weren't available."" She also sent a text commenting how she feels like she has to fight for my time with my friends. I thought this was 100% fair, so I apologized again for missing her and told her I wouldn't let it happen again. I have no issue with her voicing her opinion, and up until here I don't think she has done anything wrong, but it has totally spiraled out of control from here.

She has been extremely passive aggressive with me since then. I have apologized 4 more times, all of which she refused to acknowledge. I called her the morning after to talk about it, she said she didn't want to talk and rushed off the phone. Then she started texting me telling me she was having a bad night mentally that night and wanted to talk to me. Again, I apologized, said it was wrong of me to expect her to stay up so late, and told her I would work on prioritizing her from now on.

It still was not enough. I was very nice and civil the entire time, but at this point I started to get annoyed. She later texted me saying we need to talk, so I immediately called her. We got on the phone, she said ""I wasn't expecting you to call this fast, we should do this later."" I said okay, we hung up, and I texted her telling her she can call me at 540pm on my way to work if she decides she wants to talk. 

She called me at 540 and starts digging into me telling me I don't prioritize her enough. I, again, apologized and said I would work on it. At this point I was sobbing, and she starts yelling at me that my apologies aren't good enough and ""I don't sound sorry enough"". She yells at me saying ""you don't sound sorry enough to me"" over and over until I start full out crying on my way to work. I tell her I can't talk anymore because of this and hang up. We texted a little more that night, but she didn't budge. She is insisting that I am wrong and not sorry enough, so she can't forgive me.

The thing is, even though I feel bad that she was having a rough time and I wasn't there, I didn't do anything wrong. I told her exactly what I was gunna do, I did call her that night, and even through all that I still sucked it up and apologized when she told me she was upset. Right now she said ""I gotta think about things"" is where we left of last night with a little more texting. I expected to wake up to a text from her when I woke up an hour ago, she did not reach out.

I def feel like I could have done better, but I also don't think a late phone call is worth blowing up a great relationship for. I just spent 3 days with her this past weekend and it was amazing. We both had a wonderful time and neither of us wanted it to end. I'm honestly so confused rn.",14May2020,1

First of all, I need to get into a high calculus class and I am currently failing the one I'm in.

Plus, what job would even request for a biologist with cartoon animation skills?

My whole life my older brother has been putting me down saying that I’m weak and a pussy and he gets violent when I tell him logical completely normal things.  

For instance, he was about to chop up coconuts on the carpet (WTF?!) and the first thing I thought about was him chopping mangoes and completely forgetting about the mess he made on the COUCH AND FLOOR of sticky dried juice and peelings. It SMELLED DISGUSTING. I had to clean it. So when he was about to chop the coconuts I told him “Bro, don’t chop those up there and make a mess that I have to clean!” And he got all gangster tone “WHAT YU SAY TO ME? YOU WANT TO FIGHT?” And he slammed me hard I got bruised up banged my head nothing too bad. 

Another instance is he got violent when I didn’t let him manipulate me into saying that my stuff is his (He steals clothes and says they’re his and gets violent when he is lying). 

He subliminally says stuff that shows he doesn’t care and sees me as inferior or an enemy sometimes. He acts really childish and it’s questionable whether he’s a psychopath. 

He has a gun too so I wouldn’t try to fight him I’m scared we’re gonna make the news one day. In fact I’m trapped in this apartment we rent out together because it’s under my grandmothers name and it will ruin her credit.

Currently live in a severely roach-infested house, landlord (who also resides here) does not anything to control the issue and I am moving out, with my new apartment move-in date being the first week of June. I told him I'd pay the whole month of June but now I've changed my outlook as the roach quarantine and cleaning process is costly.

I have purchased a storage unit to quarantine my belongings as well as a place to bug bomb them and clean everything and inspect. I have also purchased numerous cleaning supplies as well as have to purchase a new piece of furniture that was a nesting place. They are German cockroaches.

My questions are 

1) How do I safely clean all my belongings from being touched by cockroaches

2) How do I tell him I am not paying until the end of the month and will instead pay the first week as the cleaning process. 

3) How do I quarantine these items before moving them to my new place",14May2020,1
935,"I’ll try to be as brief as possible. I was best friends with a guy for 4 years before we started sleeping together. His mom had just passed and he was at a bad place right before we first slept together. He would act like we were exclusive but he was sleeping around with multiple women. The signs were there I was just dumb... not blaming myself for his actions, but his words and actions were clearly different. He would act like he wanted to be with me and tell me that he loved me with me while lying to me and sleeping with other girls. I believed him because we were best friends and I would stay with him for days at a time. 

I ended up cutting him off completely because I went to college and had enough of the toxicity and being lied to. He would act like his mom passing is the reason he didn’t want to be with me but he ended up in other relationships so I feel that’s BS. I don’t doubt he was hurting but if he wanted to... he would’ve. He did some REALLY messed up things like bringing me around the girls he was sleeping with and disappearing for a while (in group settings) to go sleep with them then come back to me like nothing happened. Every few years he will contact me and we talk for a while as friends before something happens. We get alone great as friends. In the first 4 years, we never argued at all. We would talk for hours about anything. He was a very quiet person at first and he always thanks me for bringing him out of his shell. 

Fast forward to now, 7 years later, and he contacted me again. We have been talking as best friend again and I like it. It’s mostly platonic but he makes sure I know that he “still loves me” and wants to marry me one day. He said he feels regretful everyday and now knows how I felt because every  woman that he’s dated since has made him feel how I felt. Disregarded, disrespected, and disposable. During a conversation rehashing the past, j realized that I hadn’t healed like I thought. I still harbor some pain about his betrayal of our friendship because he could never just be honest with me. As friends, he never lied; but as a sexual partner, he was a piece of shit. I can blame some of this on the pain he was in during the time where he was my sexual partner. 

I know that I’d never date, sleep with, or marry him; but would I be stupid to be his friend? I want to separate our friendship from his wrongdoings but he is the same person in both instances regardless. It has been a long time and I really miss him as my friend but he put me through a lot once I had sex with him.

937,"So my family is going out of town next Friday, I’m planning on having people over on friday night bc every time I have people over while they’re here they complain about music the entire time and say “shut it down at 12!!” Even if it’s a weekend Which is way too early for drinking.. (but when they want to drink and blare music all night when I have work in the morning I never complain) figured I’d take advantage of the time they’re away to have fun without the constant bitching and complaints and have 3 of my close friends over to drink and listen to music. I also will be the only one who will be able to let our dogs out and feed them that Saturday so I do need to be home. Our dogs fight sometimes and need occasional separation, and they are very energetic so I can’t just lock them up all day. 

I just know I will most likely be scheduled to work next Saturday bc of how my schedule has been this week. I don’t drink the night before I have to work ever, so that would ruin my whole plan of having my friends over. Plus I wouldn’t be home to look after our dogs. And I don’t want to call in sick bc that’s obviously bullshit if an employee calls in on Saturday morning. I’d just rather request the day off before the schedule is made which is tomorrow. So I was planning on texting my manager this evening.

My step sister and I have a good relationship, we like to hang around the house and talk and watch movies and stuff. Recently I’ve really enjoyed being around her and spending time with her, and because of that I’ve started to noticed that she’s on her phone so much of the time with the exception of when we’re talking about something serious or having a more political discussion.

Whenever we’re watching TV or when I go talk to her in general she’ll stay glued to her phone scrolling through Instagram or texting people, where as I always put my phone to the side and focus on her and/or whatever we’re watching. Even though she responds fully when she’s on her phone and still engages in conversation it feels like I’m talking to a wall, like there is a disconnect and it makes me feel uncomfortable.

It annoys me a lot for some reason, and I feel weird for being upset by this cause it doesn’t seem like it bothers others I know. It puts me off going to talk to her and spend time with her cause it makes me feel like I’m talking to myself, since her phone is always in front of her face. I’m completely fine with people using it sometimes when we’re together but the fact it’s in her hands most of the time just gets to me.

Around that time was when I decided to actively eat, count my calories and make a real attempt at gaining weight. In March 2020, I turned 18 and was 107lbs and 5’5. I was extremely proud of the progress that I’ve made. My end goal was to reach 115-120lbs. Once quarantine officially started, my motivation to actively eat went down. My meal schedules were inconsistent because I was sleeping so late and waking up late. I overall stopped eating as much. With school in place, I had a specific schedule of when to eat and what to eat. As a result of my inconsistency, I have lost 7lbs and am 100lbs. 7lbs may not seem to be much but that took about two months and a half to put on. I feel as if all of that has gone to waste. I lack the motivation to continue, although I am extremely insecure about my body image. I want to reach my goal, but cannot find it within myself to put in the effort.

952,"I'm 32 and he's 29. I just bought a house a couple of months ago; and as a single guy I have a LOT of spare room, more than I know what to do with to be honest. I never left our hometown, I prefer to be close to my parents. My brother and older sister however didn't stick around much longer after high school and both eventually moved to the Calgary area.

For a while he seemed pretty happy, he was originally just staying a month while house sitting for a cousin, but he landed a good paying job and stayed. My Sister and her husband were close by to him as well, so he had support from her as well. But then my Sister moved to a small town a few hours away from our hometown and he was alone. The company he worked for also went under after maybe a year. He's had a few jobs and has been absolutely miserable ever since.

Recently he quit his job and decided to do just artwork for a living. Apparently he has a contract with some online company where he can undertake commissions at his own choosing. I'm happy he's made this decision because he really needed to get out of his previous job, but I'm worried about his financial stability.

He's told me he has like 25K+ in savings, and I've seen his Patreon page and know the money he brings in from art is nothing to sneeze at, but I just don't know if he's going to consistently be able to make a living. The way he talks, I think it's clear he's kind of done with the big city and wants to move to a smaller town.

I've been talking to my Mom about him, I think it would be a great idea if he moved into my place for a while and live really cheap while he gets himself re-established. She's planted the idea in his head by just mentioning in conversation how much space I have if he wanted to come over. He shot it down as a sort of pride thing over having to move back in with his family.

I'm thinking I should just talk to him in person, and maybe if he's hearing it from me that this is what I want, he would perhaps be more willing to do it. I'm just wondering how one would approach such a subject without pushing him away. I know him better than anybody else because he's just like me and this could go either way. I just want to help him get his piece of the pie before it's too late, I can't live in peace if I know he's not happy.

My sister (20F) also moved out last year and has been living with her gf.  We don’t have the best relationship. We always seem to push each others buttons, and just don’t get on very well (not for lack of trying over the years). 
Now to where I need some advice, with corona in full effect my sister returned home with her girlfriend (20F), as I was still living away from home they took my childhood bedroom, as it is bigger than hers. 
I specifically stayed away from home knowing this was the case, and that my anxiety would be extremely difficult to deal with if I returned and was not going to be in my own room. Due to my bad relationship with my sister and her gf I also knew I would not be able to live long term in the same household as them - this has come up over the last few years where they were in the house over Christmas and it ended in me moving out due to various mental health issues caused by in being in the household.

I was very upfront with my parents about why I was staying away during lockdown however I have medical conditions that make me high risk so my parents decided it was best for me to be with them - and forcibly brought me back the household against my will. 
Since returning I do not want to be in my sisters room as it is right next to my room and I feel extremely uncomfortable. I’ve been sleeping in a outhouse, there’s a mattress but no bathroom facilities, wardrobe or space for my belongings. 

As lockdown extends I’m finding it increasingly difficult to be here but am not allowed to return to my house. I have discussed with my parents that I want my room back or to return to my home numerous times but they have told me I need to make sacrifices during this difficult time and I’m being childish. How do I get over my upset and accept that my room is not mine anymore?",14May2020,1

959,"Sorry for the long post


EDIT: I’m 27/f

I know that sounds like click bait but I’m stuck in a difficult decision right now. A few weeks ago I had to take a pap and the results came up bad. I had the colposcopy today and I’m trying to stay positive. Nobody knows besides my husband and maybe two friends and I’m unsure if I should tell my mom and my mother-in-law.

Why it’s complicated: 
Mom- we get along fine but I have a lot of trauma from growing up so we never really have a serious conversation. I had a lot of issues growing up and when things get tough she has a head in the sand attitude.

My mother-in-law- we’re currently sharing a house so if it is cancer she’s going to realize once I started getting radiated like a TV dinner on a consistent basis.  Also telling her is like telling the entire side of that family. They once found out I had attempted suicide and I had a parade of 8 people walking me into a hospital to check myself in. I’m still not over it. 

I’ve held off on telling them because there is still a chance that I’ll be okay. There’s also a chance of precancer or full blown. I’m just so overwhelmed all around because the nature of the appointment triggers ptsd symptoms and then there’s the possibility that I might actually be sick. I just don’t want to worry anyone if it’s nothing. 

But what would you do? Should I just tell them if I find out it’s full blown cancer? Do I tell them? Do I tell people? I’m sorry for the long post I’m just losing it and I can’t stay of google or stop thinking about all of this.",14May2020,1

I normally dont believe dreams have meanings but this one has stuck with me for a bit now and i would love some sort of help. Heres the dream info: In a dream i had about 2 weeks ago i only remember the part where my dad had nonconsensual sexual intercourse with me (i am a minor and was still one in my dream) i used to believe i was NEVER touched or hurt like this way with anyone in my life but after this dream i felt like it was telling me something i have pushed very far in the back of my brain. Ive had dreams when i had some sort of intercourse but with people i cannot remember by now. I am no way accusing my dad of doing anything to me as a younger kid but i feel like if i dont get some kind of answer ill make myself believe that. he isnt a bad dad at all but its weird to have a dream like this with a person you look up to if you know what i mean.i hope someone could give me some info and advise to help me deal with this and sorry if theres a lot of grammar or spelling errors. hope this is the right place for this, thank you

not climaxing, but is upset i lied to him to make him feel good about himself.

Now that i told him about it, he is absolutely crushed. He's disappointed on himself, and he feels like he's done something wrong to make me lie to him, that he feels so small and pathetic. He told me that he wasnt upset that i couldn't orgasm, but he was upset that I lied to him about it to make him feel good.

 I feel devastated for making him feel like this. I shouldn't have lied to him about it in the first place, and came clean every single time I failed to reach an orgasm. I also have told him that he hasnt done anything wrong, and the sex feels amazing and wonderful with him.

963,"Long story short me and my gf has been together for three months now (we have known each other longer that that), we have a long distance relationship and she lives 6 hours with train from me (in the same country tho). We have only met twice but then this virus came started. My mom has no problem with me visiting her and supports me and my dad was supporting me as well at first (mostly because mom convinced him) and after visiting her the first time he told me that I could visit her whenever I want as far as it doesn’t affect my school (I am 17 btw). Now when school is about to end I want to visit her in the beginning of summer so I asked mom she said it was okay and then I asked him if it was okey he asked my why I want to go there sarcastically and then I answered him and he was really negative to the idea and then I got to know that the reason I can’t go there is because he doesn’t want me to have sex with her (no sex before marriage)  but I don’t get it because I want to marry her but he doesn’t want that so what, is he going to make me not seeing her for a year until we can marry each other? It’s not even logical. 

Mom said that I should ask him a week before I am going there and that he will sure change his mind but like it’s not 100% sure and I am really sad because when summer comes it has been 4 months without seeing her and I really can’t handle it anymore both I and she are really sad about and miss each other so much we can’t wait any longer and then summer is the best opportunity to meet because afterwards we both has school can’t see each other more than once a month. I really don’t know what to do like I can still go there without his permission because I am allowed to live with her the whole summer her mum said that she is fine with that she loves me.

965,"I am M(20),we(me and that friend)  were schoolmates, actually we started talking since mid 2018 . Eventually I shared most of my things,do did she, we never felt anything romantic about each other...
So we were bros, sharing even the most intimate experience,like she used to share even her sex life to me... I'm single but I used to tell her about how a girl I loved rejected me...we used to talk mostly on Phone..we live in different cities now

This happened in end of Jan...so I expected her to trust me completely...the friend who I thought trusted me...
I already have an Amazon prime account but due to some reason I didn't want to use it..I asked her to share the password just for a minute so I could order a book... really nicely
She avoided sharing it... saying she'll order it for me...I said please trust me...I'll just logout...you won't be able to order with exact details..she again insisted that tell all the details and she herself will order....🤒
The order was wrongly placed.. book never arrived... fuck the book.. that's not the point....
The point is....my closest buddy..my homie doesn't even trust me with a shitty Amazon password...

BEFORE JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS :
I am kind off a very observant person..I usually know what other person is thinking... even this friend and everyone around acknowledges this...

So I started talking to her less... it's just.... there's no meaning to this Friendship...I just couldn't take how casually she didn't realise her act and pretended everything is cool
..... eventually I couldn't take replying to her msgs, started ignoring her calls.. because I hate it when someone distrusts me....
She has been trying to contact me ....like yesterday..she obviously doesn't know why I cut contact...two close friends of mine have backed me (I showed the conversation to them...on different days..both friends are from different equation... don't know each other)...these two friends too felt what I feel
Now she called me yesterday too...I am really comfortable...like I really don't care that much after that day...I have other good friends too and am really cool with cutting people if I want....so should I reply her or ignore her as I have been?",14May2020,1
966,"I'd like to preface this by saying that obviously it's not guaranteed that I'd get into ANY of the unis I mention; they're all very high standard. However, for the purposes of this post, these are the ones that are relevant and the ones that matter the most to me in terms of dream/reach schools.

Some context: I'm (16f) in my first year of sixth form (penultimate year of school) and I will be applying to universities soon. I'm a classic 'Oxbridge' student who has always had good grades, excellent GCSE results, expected high A-level grades, passionate about my subject (Classics), etc., and for a long time, Oxford (or maybe Cambridge, not sure yet) was my goal. However, I have recently started seriously considering American universities/colleges. I hadn't really thought about them properly before, but since I had a brainwave a few days ago that they existed, I've been doing frantic research, had a (Zoom) meeting with my head of sixth form, I've been looking into financial aid in detail, been researching SAT test centres nearby, etc. 

I've been pretty excited about it all, and one of the biggest draws for me was that it was something new. Obviously, there's no guarantee I'll get into Oxbridge, but still, Oxford has just always been the 'expected' path for me. When I was younger I just assumed I would go there because my mum went there, and my dad doesn't talk about his uni experiences so I just sort of thought that everyone who was vaguely smart went to Oxford. (I know now that's not true, but my point is that since I was little, when I thought about 'uni life' it was synonymous with 'Oxbridge life'.) But now it was getting kind of boring. Oxbridge felt like it was so obvious, so predictable, so dull. I already could imagine exactly how my life would be, whereas if I went to Harvard/Princeton/Yale, it would be something new and fresh and exciting and unexpected, while still maintaining the level of prestige and incredible education that I want. 

However, my mum hasn't seemed at all happy about it. She hasn't been getting enthused in the way that she did when I was looking at Oxbridge colleges, and she just generally seemed to think I was being stupid/silly to think about it. This evening, she told me that she thinks the only reason that I want to go to the US is to cope with the fact that my brother (18) has got into Oxford. Frankly, it was unexpected that he got in, and even after that, people didn't really think he'd get the grades. However, now, with the whole coronavirus debacle, he probably will be in. My mother thinks that I don't want to be at Oxford because he will be there, and I don't want to be at Cambridge because I prefer the Oxford Classics course, and so I'm taking what I see as the 'only option left' and trying to prove I'm interesting by going to the USA.  

It's true that I tend to be very competitive, especially concerning my brother with whom I don't really get along, and it's true that only in the last few months (since his A-levels were cancelled) that I've really believed he'd go to Oxford. I also accept (though I hadn't thought about it all in this way until my mum brought it up) that the fact he will be at Oxford has made it so it doesn't feel as interesting or exciting to go there, and I'm exactly the sort of person that would go to university in a whole different country just to prove I can.

But is that a problem? It may be an unusual reason to do it, but surely I could go to uni in America and still be incredibly happy there, even happier than I would be at Oxbridge? Surely this could be an amazing chance for me to do something I wouldn't ever have considered otherwise? Or should I just go to Oxford (assuming I can get in which is never a given) and forget the whole sibling rivalry?

Tl;dr, my brother has pretty much got into Oxford, and now my mum thinks the only reason I want to go to college in America is because I want to prove I'm better/as interesting as him. Is she right? Does it matter?",14May2020,1

i made a fake instagram account and threatened my crush’s ex (and my crush) ... They suspected me right away (cause i used my real email.... and got rejected by her and she probably knows im jealous) i used stalking photos of them

So my school believes me and says im not guilty BUT they will contact the police and find out who it is.

973,"I got my own check via direct deposit a month ago, but twice now I've received mail from the IRS for someone who doesn't live at my address, and is not one of the two elderly people who've lived at this address since the 60s, nor does this person share their last name. I sent the first envelope back with a note saying the person is not at this address. I got the 1444 notice for the same person today, almost two weeks later. The first looked like coloured paper through the clear window of a smaller envelope, so exactly like the stimulus check.  


I've looked on Facebook, and the only profile I can find is for a child (maybe preteens) who only had 8 friends and last posted in 2011, and is in Michigan (I'm in Pennsylvania). If this is the guy: while he could be a young adult now, I doubt he's even still using that profile.  


I've googled two variants of the name, dropped the middle initial, I did find a pinterest. The name on the envelope has an R as the middle initial and this person's Pinterest username has the same first name, ""Robert"", and the first 3 letters as the last name, but the account looks like it was hardly used. I sent them a message and am hoping for the best.  


If that doesn't work, is there a way to contact the IRS to make sure the check gets to its rightful owner? Or should I try using social media to find this person? I really want to get their check to them (and find out why such important mail has ended up at my address twice lol).",14May2020,1
974,"Hi there, Last week I took my online final for my math course over WileyPlus.  I personally am not the biggest fan of using wiley because making one small mistake can cost you the entire points worth of a problem.  To be more specific, a problem required me to prove an equation's exactness then to solve for the general solution.  I filled out both areas and submited the answer and moved on.  To my surprise the problem had to be submitted in two seperate instances instead of just one submission on the bottom of my page.  But fret not, I made sure to highlight that the equation was exact it my work(submited seperatly to a different website), so there should be no need to worry.  Despite having respectable grades my other two exams during this course I tanked the online final with a hefty 37%.  This is when I looked over the test and found the error above and found a few other small errors that was either a small calculating error or wiley really picky with the rounding.

Now I looked into the work I submitted, unopened.  I screenshotted a picture of the submission onopened and emailed my profesor asking him if planned to look at my work before grading my test and if the grade I recieved was final.  He responded saying that he ""tried"" to open the files, that he had trouble reading them, and that he had gave me the maximum extra credit (""Partial"") for the test. 

Effectively what I believe happened is the professor is coating a curve as ""partial/extra credit"". I have photographic proof my professor submitted my results before looking at my work despite offering partial credit.  I have also emails from my professor lying to me.  My Uni offers a grade appeal and I was wondering if I had a case because it doesn't look like my professor is budging at all.

975,"So here's the situation:

I'm a 20 year old male in the U.S. Navy. I'm currently at A-School which is a technical school where you learn your job before you join the fleet. School is going fine I'm crushing it. I don't really have too many problems fitting in but honestly I don't spend any time at cookouts or trying to bust my way into social circles. I'm just kind of ""there"" - I go to class, go to my apartment, study, etc.

We all have 2 weeks left before we leave to go to our permanent duty stations. There is a girl in my class that I have been interested in for a few weeks now. I could tell she was interested in me too because she would come around me a lot, was always giving me signs, smiling, etc. Sometimes I would walk back from class with her and talk about stuff but I didn't ever escalate our relationship too much even though I'm interested in her. I started pulling away from her slowly and I stopped sitting by her, talking to her, etc. Honestly I don't really know why, but I think I was just too afraid to commit to something and I feared rejection. She stopped talking to me too. I tried to get the situation out of my head but it bothered me more and more. I told myself to let go of it but I see her everyday so that is kind of impossible. The situation snowballed and now I can't even think of what to say to her when I do see her.

Yesterday I went up to her and said, ""hey, I think I like you"" and then just walked away. I think she was shocked but I didn't give her anytime to say anything back because it was in the middle of the classroom with tons of other people around. I just felt like if I didn't just SAY it then I would regret it and I couldn't move on. I was literally just trying to move on and get over it but she's there everyday and I can't help but feel like I should have just sucked it up earlier and told her how I felt. Lesson learned.

Anyway, now I'm just wondering what the BEST way to handle this whole stupid situation is. I normally don't overthink things like this too much but this one is really getting to me and I don't know why I can't just get over it. If the best thing for me to do is to talk to her one on one, then I'll do that. If it is to ask her on a date, I will do that. If it is to go my own way and ignore the situation entirely I will do that even though that hasn't been working lately.

980,"Life decisions are to be made, though I feel I'm (28M) always making changes. The background is important and I'll try to be brief. I grew up poor as hell, but also shy so I never asked for much. Nobody had made it past grade school in my family. I navigated blindly, tagging along with the educational system as opposed to my own intention. Somehow, I got out with a finance degree, a summer exchange in China under my belt, and a job at a Fortune 100 company (after hundreds of applications). I never pictured getting that far. It felt like life was set. That was over 7 years ago. 

Since then, I realised corporate wasn't for me and I've spent the last few years appreciating autonomy and share options while running finance in startup companies. Since then, I've bought and sold a home, concluding I prefer the flexibility of renting. Since then, I've had relationships that progressively improve each time, as I learn more about myself and how to be. I've spent months volunteering, building startups, in Asia and Africa. Yet I still feel restless. It never feels like enough. I've road-tripped 3k miles in the US too. Travel feels like a temporary fix now. I fear I can't contain my expectations after broadening my horizons this much.

I have a growth mindset and an eagerness to learn. I've ploughed through hobbies, often stopping once I'm good at it, almost like I only do it for the challenge. Travel and hobbies are dynamic areas, therefore I think it's the static finance career that's unfulfilling. I'm aware I need to check my privilege, especially after coming this far from zero, and I shouldn't risk losing this comfortable life.

My instincts say, ""Who cares about societal norms? Screw this life of boring stability. Let your life be an adventure! Move to S. America for a year, teach English or whatever, who knows where it'll lead. You might stumble upon something you love.""

My boss is a small business owner of a cleaning company and we were forced to stop working due to being non essential. Or so I thought. All the hours of research I have done on NAICS codes and business licenses have led me to understand that we are classified as non essential. The license she has is ""professional and/or personal services unclassified. 812990 is the code. For our state, that deems us non essential. She never knew what her license was or how to find out her code, nothing. Over time her response changed from ""I don't know what I'm going to do!"" to ""We are essential and never had to shut down."" From ""Many customers have cancelled and don't want us in their house"" to ""My phone is blowing up from people wanting to be cleaned!"" 

She is very unorganized, doesn't run her business very well, paid me under minimum wage and blamed it on the accountant not telling her, etc. So I have tried to educate myself and I know the type of person I'm dealing with. If she had gotten a janitorial license we would still be working, however she got a different license that I'm sure was cheaper because she is just that type of person. 

The other day she just flat out says in a text ""We're working starting May 20th."" To which I reply, ""Oh I thought they weren't reopening the economy until possibly June 1st?"" And she goes on a shpeel about how we never had to close etc etc. I simply asked her what our NAICS code was and after many hours of no response, she snapped on me saying ""If you don't want to work let me know NOW so I can hire someone that does!!!!"" I told her that I just wanted to make sure we were allowed to operate (which as a business owner I thought she would want to know for sure about something like that) and that we had all the supplies we need as far as protection and cleaning supplies etc and I told her that me not wanting to work is not the case. I've received no reply since. 

I'm not an expert on licenses and codes, only what official govt websites tell me about her license and business classification. Am I wrong for asking? How do I handle this? I'm not trying to be insubordinate or disrespectful. My fiance says I should just let her deal with the business shit and just go to work. Which I'm sure is what I'll do... But I'm just like wtf about this.",14May2020,3
983,"Long story short: I (25F) had a friend/acquaintance (26M) for a short time in university (think the occasional coffee together). Over time, he showed patterns of aggressive, wildly intolerant (i.e. racism, sexism) behaviour that I could no longer tolerate so I cut ties, saying I no longer want him to message me and blocked him on all social media.   


Now \~5 years later, he apologized and I forgave him. However, due to his intolerant and overly persistent behaviours, I have no intentions of rekindling our ""friendship"". He has since created another account just to message me, pestering me to unblock him. He is mentally unstable so I worry if I block him again, he will only create another account. I worry if I tell him to stop talking to me, he will get angry. He becomes even more persistent if I take a long time to respond. I have no idea what to do. Any advice is welcome.

986,"basically i dont know how to say this but i did some really fucking bad thing. basically i lost my entire mind and ended up cyber-stalking this girl. i started having delusions that she was sending messages on twitter and that anyone who contacted me online was her. then the hallucinations started up and i was 110% convinced that she was invisible and was living in my house. then i started posting a bunch a shit that i was convinced was true on twitter and she found them all out. and i had accounts thinking and saying that we were dating and telling stories about things at the time i was convinced she was doing. like being famous and that she was stalking me and micro-chipped me. and then after i started thinking that any post i saw was her communicating with me and that she was supporting me. so then it turned into me sharing personal details about my life and problems shared very personal things about my friends on it thinking that these messages where going to that girl and she would keep them safe because we were in love. but it turns out i was hallucinating and it was all a grand delusion.

guys i was so convinced that i was right but now i see that i was just fucking crazy. and now ive lost my oldest friend and this group of people rightfully think that i am genuinely crazy. but i realized that it was all in my head but its far too late for anyone to take my side because i did all those thing and the excuse of  ""i was having severe delusions and am willing to take full accountability for my actions but now im better"" is not going to cut it. this girl who i put this through is never going to forgive me and rightfully so. but i dont know what to do because my friends all know what i did and i dont even know what to say to them.

987,"Maybe this is the wrong place, but I am asking seriously. I have found that I am quite unfiltered as a human being. I don't idolize celebrities whether they are singers or actors/actresses. Growing up I have never really looked up to any movie star or singer. I find the idolization we put around people to be overrated or that it separates us from forgetting we are all just people. That doesn't mean I don't have a favorite actors or singers or that there is not something to appreciate about these kinds of people. A lot are involved with charities, are supporters of human rights, etc.

But today I actually just learned it Cher was. I don't think I get it either. My girlfriend was surprised my younger sibling who is 16 (I am 24) knows who she is. My mother obviously knew who she was. Am I just missing something? I recognized Cher's songs but growing up I never liked them and so I just never associated her with those songs. I didn't even recognize her when I saw her on Mama Mia 2. This is not the the only popular celebrity this has happened. I didn't even know who Destiny's Child was.

A brief background: My mother met and married my father when she was 19 and he was 36. They got married because my mother got pregnant with my older sister. All I know about my father’s past is that he used to do a lot of drugs and drink a lot and that he was married once before my mother. 
One day when I was about 8 or 9 I was in my parent’s closet looking for something when I found a picture. It was a picture of my father and a blonde woman and three children. Then I remember my mom walking in and snatching the picture away and she wouldn’t answer when I asked who was in the picture. I’ve been thinking about it a lot over the years, and I think the picture was his ex-wife and possible siblings. 
There’s no way I’m asking my father about it. I haven’t talked to him in about eight years and I’m going to keep it that way. He also has no family I could ask. And my mother has a tendency to lie, so even if I ask her, I may not get a straight answer. 
I want to know if the kids in that picture are my siblings, but I don’t know how to find that out or how to go about finding them. I have no information about my father’s past life or his ex.

999,"Hello,

So little background, I broke up with my ex because I didint like some stuff about her, I didint really like how she behaves around people (Im extremely nice and a people pleaser, shes more of a fighter), I didint like few other things, after a year of relationship I decided I dont wanna put up with it, how ever I realised I wasnt trying to move the relationship, I was just complaining to myself and not telling her that I dont like that or this, so in theory I was just running around sinking ship not picking up the buckets. How ever, she comes from a social family, as in she doesnt have her parents, she has a sister, who they grew up together in a social home, so their view to life is quiet different.  I didint really trust her with stuff, because I never really gave her a chance. So that is kind of debatable. How ever. I still have feelings for her and she does to. Shes really humble, but shes a fighter, that kind of gives me a point of view where she can stand up for both of us, since I like to please people. And I was her world, I remember that she literally was stuck to me like honey, when we broke up, it broke her, alot, she cryed and I really felt bad for it, but at that point I thought its the right thing to do.

The thing Im worried mostly about: since I really dont like her sister because shes just rude and party animal, so in theory thinking about family, if we have a kid or kids, I would not trust her sister to watch over kids or similar stuff. The idea is that my ex didint really wanted to do stuff with me and her sister (Like all 3 of us), but what if that changes. Should I really take note of her surroundings - like her sister and think about future as in THAT MIGHT HAPPEN? I've been really couscous in life, this is kind of tough call to make, but what if shes just right for me and Im missing up on one in a life time opportunity?

Im thinking of inviting her over a coffie and when I see her if I still have feelings that she annoys me then its no go, but if I see her as something I really like and want in my life, Im wondering if I should go or instead I should try to find someone I would like more? 

Keep in mind that Ive been dating for this break time, so its not like I was hung up on her, I met some great people along the way, well 2 precisely, but it just didint feel like it made the cut.

1011,"Me (19f) and my husband (21m) got married a year ago and I am starting to see why everyone thought we were too young. That said, I love him more than anything and want this to work. He is a college dropout, has been fired from multiple jobs because he sleeps through shifts, etc. During all of these, I have worked a full time job in a management position and been taking classes. We are supposed to be moving to Chicago in the fall so I can attend school and he was going to work a pretty well-paying job with his uncle, whom he looks up to a lot. This job is the only thing making me feel secure enough that he will actually be able to contribute and hold down a job because of his uncle. 

Unfortunately, due to recent circumstances (briefly, due to COVID-19 he has gone full doomsday) my father in law has been threatening my husband’s uncle and other family members. Here’s the part I don’t know what to do with. As can be expected, my husband is very stressed out by his dad’s actions. Every time I try to talk about this (or anything involving his feelings) he freaks out and storms off or says he “just can’t deal with it.” Today, I finally pulled out of him that he won’t ask his uncle for the job because of his dad’s threats. He won’t tell me what the threats were or say anything else about it. After he told me about this, I didn’t say anything because I knew he would just freak out, and sure enough when He asked again what I was thinking and I said “I just don’t think without the job with your Uncle we can move to Chicago.” Sure enough, he spazzed out and left. 

I have an awesome opportunity to go to a school that has a major I love but I cannot be the only one working and going to school and he simply can’t actually be trusted to hold down a job.

1019,"Un-friended* sorry I’m new to reddit:)

I (f) met (fake names) Jess (f) at the beginning of the year (more like she followed me out of the classroom and just started talking to me but ok) and we hung out every day and became best friends ever since. She had always told white lies everyday but whenever I confronted her she would just go quiet and it was just awkward for a couple mins. Another thing is she got with her boyfriend John ( he broke up with her after like 4 months) and during that time she always acted psycho and “yandere” and it was really weird since he honestly seemed like he had no interest in her. Another thing, after he broke up with her, she still called him Senpai and he even asked her to stop ( she didn’t). 

Now the important info. All the time she was really really clingy and it was obvious she really cared (in some way) about our friendship which I loved since my ex friend group was pretty toxic and made me feel like the problem. When we would talk she really often talked about sexual things, I think because she was into that, and it made me uncomfortable. Also she hugged me all the time and once she had her hands over my chest ( hug from behind) and I said she had her hands on my chest but she didn’t hear I guess? Either that or she didn’t want to move her hands… but I try not to think that.. After half a year of being besties we had a friend group, one day one of my friends, Jane, asked how I felt about Jess, she had done several other things like lie about bigger things and then get mad when I don’t just forgive her even tho she doesn’t apologise, but you get the idea. I told Jane about these things and she said that she’d been doing the same kind of things to everyone (when I asked other girls in my classes they say similar things) I up to that point thought it was just me and it was normal for friends, it’s not, but now that I had support I felt a lot better, I got the worst from her since I was her bestie but another girl who got it pretty bad, Amy who happens to have a history of lying, supported and talked to me a lot. I felt confident. 

The story. We were all at the hangout spot and stuff led on to me telling her I don’t want to be friends with her. I really regret the way I said this because I basically said she was an awful person and really raged all the stuff I never got to say, she ended up crying and people told me that they understand my rage but I was too harsh ( I really think I was way too harsh). After that I felt relieved and good that it was over but after about 3 months I really regret everything and think that she really didn’t realise what she was doing. I feel like I should’ve given her a chance, but now it’s way too late and I feel like she hates me, even though she never was or is the kind that got that mad, just sad. 

I know that it’s too late now but I don’t know how to get over it and my friend group kinda just forgot the stuff she did ( according to Amy she put her hand on her crotch area and asked if she wanted a wet willy which I now doubt) now I feel lonely and sad and just wanna be able to get over it.

1021,"I've been in a group chat with my high school friends since tenth grade (we're all now 22-23). This chat is the best way for me to stay connected to them since we mostly went separate ways and I now live on the other side of the country. I love them all to death. The chat is used for a mix of memes, light chat, serious topics, and emotional support and it feels like I know them as well now as I did then. The problem is one of the guys in the chat. I'll call him Dan.

Now none of us were exactly popular in high school. We were band kids, theater kids, nerds, etc. So someone missing a few social cues or being awkward wouldn't be a problem. But Dan has gone beyond that. He constantly spams the chat with memes, breaking up the flow of conversation and dominating the chat. Between the memes and the shitposts, he overwhelms the chat. However, that would merely be annoying. It's not the main problem.

The main problem is that Dan consistently, at least 3-4 times a week if not more will have what I call ""Sad Boi Hours"" where he will essentially scream into a void about all his anxieties and depressive thoughts. Except the void isn't empty, it's occupied by all his friends. And when he does it every week for five years... my empathy has begun to run dry. He is always, always saying things like ""sorry I suck"" and shit like that. And, especially with the fact that he never takes any of the constructive advice we offer, it just seems like he wants to wallow in self-pity and lament to us about how bad his life is without making any effort to fix himself. And it is throwing the brunt of his anxiety at his friends without warning and without consent that I find abusive and toxic.

And I want to be clear, I like helping people, especially those I care about. I want to listen to people's problems. And I have no issue with the groupchat being used when you need comfort from your friends. But it is the consistency of it, the fact that it dominates the space to such a degree it is difficult for others in the group chat to talk about their shit because it feels like it's always Dan's turn, that infuriates me. I know people who have permanently muted the chat because of his shit and that sucks because it feels like I lost them as friends to a degree because of Dan's actions.

I know what some of you are already thinking: just kick him out! Some problems with that. 1. His brother is in the chat too. So kicking him out, especially when they're living together (thanks Covid) would put a burden on Dan's brother. 2. He doesn't really have anyone else. I'm genuinely scared that kicking him out will either result in him heading down the incel/4chan rabbit hole or killing himself. 3. He's not wholly bad. He's a funny guy and we have a long history. I don't just want to slam the door in his face and say buh bye.

As a last note, we have tried talking to him about his behavior in the past. And every time the same thing has happened. He's apologized profusely, quit the group chat (which forces someone to have to add him back, effectively forcing us to deal with his bullshit), and promised to do better. And he does do better... usually for about 2-4 months. Then he backslides, and the constant shitposting/woe is me routine resumes. 

I guess I'm just looking for a path forward. He fills me with a lot of rage and while I feel some of it is undeserved, I see the effect he's having on the main way I stay in touch with some of my closest friends. I can't stand seeing what he's doing and not being able to help him or stop him. So if you have any solutions/need to know more, please respond. And thank you for reading.",14May2020,1

When I did go out, I wore gloves and a mask and I shower down as soon as I get in. I've been overly cautious this entire time. My company has been struggling lately and after a lot of push-back from me and continued pressure from the owner, TOTALLY against my better judgment I hopped on a plane on Monday (before the test) and had the antibody test on Tuesday (which came back negative) meaning I more than likely contracted the virus during travel. My flight home is scheduled for tomorrow, but morally I can NOT get on that plane. I also can't rent a hotel room for the same reason. Luckily I do have a rental car, that's supposed to be turned in tomorrow (but I can obviously extend that) Now, the obvious answer is to drive home, but I can't drive 31 hours straight.

1025,"Hello. So I'm not sure where to post my quandary but I'll try here. 

Yesterday I met with my old next door neighbor. They lived next door maybe 5 years and moved away in 2017. 
I do miss them, talking to them, the kids playing, etc bc I dont mesh that well with the people who moved in after them 

Ive never been to the new house and really havent seen them since the move. The kids are the same age, same classroom at school. I enjoyed hanging out, pouring a drink while the kids rode bikes and jumped on the trampoline. 
It was a nice time, we had dinner there and everything. 

As we are leaving, then comes the damn locking me in. A beach trip. A camping trip. Sleep overs. All in front of the kids who are gung ho for it all. It wasnt a private talk, it was putting pressure on me to say yes I feel. 

I dont like to travel with just anyone. I cant do it. I dont like shoestringing a trip together financially.  

Camping is with the sister, mama, brother, girlfriends, boyfriends.. No. No thanks on that too. 

Sleep over? No. No no no. Their older child has a pornhub acct (13, and uses it a lot) and I really cant risk it. Plus, my partner will nix it. All of it. Yet I'm the one who will have to deliver the news.

I'm debating lying.  My kid is sick. They didnt do their homework. They were back sassin again. Their grandpa is coming over. 
Or going the ""we're having big drama at the house"" route.  

Either way I woke up today really feeling pressure about their invites and it's making me not want to go back over. I dont feel good about this relationship anymore. 

So best course of action? 

Tldr: saw an old friend and they tried locking me in to trips and sleepovers that I'm just not ready to do",14May2020,1
1026,"My best friend recently just screwed me over by stealing my business idea and remaking it into his. No, I'm not being dramatic, he quite literally ditched our agreed-upon partnership just hours after I revealed my written timeline and said that he was going to start his own similar business.

My other best friend has also hurt me more times than I can count, but she's not the least apologetic. She always says that she doesn't feel sorry about what she did, so she doesn't think that she should apologize. It's insane, because I would assume any sane person could realize their faults, especially if they've done the things she has done.

I just constantly feel like I'm being screwed over by these 2 friends, and I can never seem to get over it. I know that I should own up to my feelings and ditch them for good, but I am just too attached to them. I'm also scared that they'll belittle my emotions if I tell them how I feel. 

The last time friend #2 betrayed my trust, the FaceTime call started with me asking for an explanation and ended with the two of them ridiculing my every flaw. I understand that those flaws need to be worked on and I apologized, but the two of them do the exact same thing and act like they're superior humans. Friend #2, like always, said that she didn't feel like apologizing for spilling my secret.

I don't think I'm a pushover because I voice my opinions whenever I feel upset, however no matter how many times we hash our problems out, I'm always left feeling unfulfilled and in disbelief as to why they would do that to me in the first place. They've both expressed their annoyance with how I can't get over some things.

I just feel constantly unhappy because of these two people, and I don't know if I'm just expecting perfection with my too many emotions, or if they're legitimately toxic people. I don't think that I'll be able to drop them, because when things aren't bad, they're *really* good.

I'm two years out of law school, had worked at this firm as a legal associate for a year, and finally passed the UBE this past February. My old boss called to see if I’d want to return to the firm. But would need an answer after the weekend otherwise they need time to advertise and prep for the graduating law class.

It would be out of Boston or NYC.

But as far as salary goes, it would take a couple years to be where I feel comfortable, bc it’s \~10k/year raise but

Salary—-

Now: $50,000 + $10,000 signing bonus

Jan 1, 2021: 60,000

Jan 1, 2022: 70,000

Is what he said. And to expect a $10k increase every year as long as firm meets goals (for comparison, my friend there makes $90k+bonuses to hit about six figures, and he started in late 2015)

The first few years of that tho. That’s what I’m debating with myself bc not what I had envisioned as a salary for my next job, especially if I’d be in a city like Boston/NYC where prices are $$.  
It's a boutique anti-discrimination employment firm, so not a huge biglaw practice or anything.

so now I can decide between taking the job with this firm I know and like but it’ll take years (I’ll be 34?!) to get to a salary point I’m comfortable with. I’d be grateful for the stability but at the same time that salary is the very low end of ppl I used to go to school with so I'd be privately a little frustrated/embarrassed

1036,"I have been awarded the title of ""most evil stepmom."" \*sigh\*

I do not understand how I got myself in this position or more importantly, how I could have prevented it. Although I cannot change the past, I am utterly confused about where to go from here. I would appreciate any advice- good/bad/ugly, hit me with it!

A little backstory for you:

My husband was a single father of two teenage daughters when we first met- and I a single mom of one toddler-aged daughter.

Life was perfect for the first couple of years. I immediately connected to his daughters and grew a very strong close relationship. All was well for quite a while until one day, 4 years ago, we had a disagreement about moving. During the disagreement, they let it be known that they were upset and jealous of me and my daughter and they asked my husband if he had to choose, who would he pick. Of course, my husband didn't entertain that question and said there is no choice to be had.

From that day forward, they began smearing mine and my husband's name on social media. They completely quit talking to me, my daughter, and my husband for quite a long time. His youngest moved out and in with her mom, his oldest was already living on her own by this time. Within the last two years, they started coming back around but, only speaking with my husband and even then it is on a rare occasion. I miss them greatly and my heart aches that our relationship was jeopardized for something out of my control- what I honestly thought was out of my control, but now I even question that. Was it?

What brings me to this post today is that I just saw another smearing post on social media. Yes, we had a disagreement all those years ago but I am not a cruel person, I never spoke down to them, never cursed at them, never even raised my voice at them. I have replayed that day, and the days afterward, over and over and I know with all my heart that I did not do anything to warrant such hatred.

His daughters are now adults and I had hoped things would improve as they matured. But, I am concerned they will never improve and most definitely never go back to the way it was before. This has created such a wedge between my husband and his daughters, and at times, between him and I because I feel so guilty that my presence is causing angst.

I've tried talking to them. I've tried reaching out. But then nothing comes of it. I'm saddened and wish I could have a redo.",14May2020,1
1037,"I’m 20 years old both my parents and my older brother vape and smoke.

So to my knowledge my mom has been smoking for at least 2 years, I believe. Soon she got my dad into it, too. They used to smoke when they were younger before they became Christian and have slowly brought the habit back.

Then they started vaping to stop smoking and for a while they did stop smoking and it was just vaping. I know there are still health risks that come with vaping but it’s at least a step away from smoking. I thought that eventually they would quit completely but now they vape AND smoke and have gotten my older brother (who only used to do weed (for anxiety) and vape) to occasionally smoke a cigarette with them (he has asthma so it’s very worrisome for me that he’s doing all 3).

I feel like if I tell my dad he’ll be more understanding but that doesn’t mean he’ll stop. I’m just worried about their health... I honestly didn’t mind the vaping but now that they’re doing both it’s making me really anxious... should I just tell them? Or let them be? :/",14May2020,2

1042,"I am a 24 year old man from Ireland. I'm smart and have graduated college with a medicinal chemistry degree. However, I've been made unemployed by COVID and my former job was boring and not particularly well-paying anyway. Being unemployed has got me thinking about my life. I feel like I am unfulfilled and want more than this. I feel like the opportunities for real great achievements here are limited, so I've been considering trying to move to the USA.

Of course there are pros and cons:

I will be far away from my family and it'll be expensive to travel home. But I also feel like this is MY life and I shouldn't let it stop me

I'm not even sure if I could get a Visa, but I have no criminal record so it must be worth at least trying surely?

My social life is mediocre. I am single and to be frank my friends are boring. The thought of meeting new people, of city life in LA or the hustle of NYC excites me more than Ireland ever could. I know it won't be like the movies, but it still seems so great.

I could get further qualifications if i needed to to find a job. I found school and college easy and I think I could get a Masters. There would be no issue of being under-qualified for a middle class job.

But it would be a massive commitment to uproot my life like this. I don't know American culture and lifestyle well and if I changed my mind I  would be screwed, but it's not like this is completely spontaneous. I've been unhappy living like this for over a year. Like I said, it would be fresh and exciting. 

I posted this because I know a lot of others will also be reflecting on their lives in the current situation and maybe this is similar to how you feel.

I suppose my question is to Americans: Is the US all it's cracked up to be? Should I risk all this money and sacrifice being with my family for a chance at a great life? Has anybody else here uprooted their lives, and how has it worked out?

1043,"I’m (22F) in my senior year of college. I’m also a year behind, so I just finished up my 4th year and I’m entering my 5th year. I was an accounting major, and enjoyed it, but not enough to do it as a career. I made it through 2 senior level accounting classes with Bs. I switched to marketing in March, and I’m currently taking my 2nd marketing class and just started a marketing internship. The problem is, I’m an introvert. I really struggle to get myself out there and look on the bright side of things. And I hate sales. I hate it so much. I hate calling people. I hate talking to people. I’ve worked in sales before (insurance) and had an absolutely terrible experience. In my current internship I’m really not enjoying myself. I think the marketing class I’m taking is boring. I’m realizing I hate it. 

I’ve taken several “what should I major in?” quizzes and they all point to computer science. My school offers Computer Information Systems, and it’s infamous for being one of the toughest business majors. I don’t have a strong computer background. I don’t know if it would be a good fit for me. I don’t know if I’m smart enough to do well in CIS. I can’t take any CIS classes this summer because they’re full, so I would have to start in the fall, and switching majors again would likely put me another semester behind. 

I’ve already signed up for 3 more marketing classes this summer and 4 in the fall, so I’m pretty much set to graduate in the Spring of 2021 if I stick to marketing, and would likely graduate in December 2021 if I switch. My biggest hold up is I’m sick of being in school. I’m embarrassed that it’s taking me so long to get my bachelors degree. And what if I realize I don’t like CIS? Then I’m behind at least another semester. Also, I don’t want to waste any more money on classes I don’t need. 

So, I think what I’m looking for is: has anyone majored in CIS and can tell me your experience? Has anyone changed majors in their senior year, and did you regret changing it or are you glad you changed it? Does anyone work in CIS and can tell me what you like/dislike about your job? Thank you in advance for taking the time out of your day to help me. (:",14May2020,1
1044,"This is a long story so please bear with me. A couple years back I met my bestfriend Ben on a game that I play. We immediately had a connected and quickly became friends. We grew to have the same friend group. A couple months into it, we both confessed that we like each other. We dated for about 3 months. He randomly broke up with me and I didn't realize it at the time, but it was because he was battling depression and sadness and didn't want to make me sad, even though we both have depression. He was distant for about 2 months, and then we slowly built our friendship back up. 6 months after the breakup go by and he tells me he's in love with me. I was hesitant at first but it's what I wanted too.

We went out for about 6 months. We would hang out and talk basically all day everyday. A month ago, his grandmother passed away. She raised him, so in a way she was like his mom. 2 days later Ben broke up with me. He told me he had been unhappy for a month. He told me that he felt like he couldn't hang out with his friends or like certain things. I've been desperately thinking about every single interaction we've had over the past month, and trying to find where I went wrong. I remember that I did feel sad twice when he was hanging out with other friends and I shouldn't have expressed that to him. It's normal and healthy and expected for your partner to hang out with other people a lot. I shouldn't have let him know my feelings in that moment. Another thing I regret is I told him I didn't like his character on the game we play. He said ""I don't wanna do something if you don't like it"" and I told him ""you can do what you want with your character but I'm still gonna feel the same."" I didn't mean this at all and I regretted it instantly. I should've told him how sorry I was. I had no idea that he was unhappy. We both were feeling really stressed out that past month and I could feel that, but I didn't know he was unhappy and feeling like I am manipulative. Sometimes we would get upset at each other and he would get mad and say hurtful things to me, but he apologized and told me he didn't mean it, and I understand that. We both are terrible at communicating, in different ways. When he broke up with me he told me that he has been lying to me and I wish he would've communicated more with me, but at the same time I feel like it's all my fault. I feel so guilty. I cannot express how guilty I feel. He told me ""I still care about you and think you're a wonderful person but it's best that we are not friends.""I feel so stupid because I thought I was being such a good girlfriend. I told him all the time how much I loved him and how I care about him more than anything, and I would surprise him with little things that I knew he liked. I had so many things planned to surprise him with. We had plans for the future to get married in the near future and have kids in the far future. Now I feel like I was a terrible girl friend and I am terrible person. I feel like all I did was hurt him. Even writing this now I just feel like I'm making excuses and trying to manipulate him more. I want to tell him how sorry I am but I am not going to because I know he doesn't want to talk to me.

Last night our friend messaged me, his name is Kaden. Kaden told me that he despises me because of what I did to Ben. He told me he wants me out of our friend group. He told me that Ben wanted to ""drop me completely,"" and he told me he doesn't know why I'm convinced that ""Ben will come back to me."" I don't think Ben will come back to me and I don't blame him. I just miss my bestfriend so badly.

I'm not talking to Ben so I don't know how he feels and it's hard to know what to make of this situation because of his grandmother passing away. I want to be there for him so badly. I care about Ben so much and I want the best for him. I want him to be happy and feel free. I feel so guilty, especially because of what Kaden told me last night.

I don't want to lose anymore of my friends. I've already lost my best friend and now one of my close friends hates me. Everyone in our friend group is friends with both and Ben. It's not fair for them to be in the middle of all of this but I don't wanna lose anymore friends. I can feel them drifting away and it's killing me. I know I don't deserve them but I really love my friends and they are my only friends I have.

I don't know what to think, feel, or believe. My depression is telling me to kill myself because I am a burden and a terrible person who just makes people feel bad, but part of me is saying not to do that.

Before last night, I had partially made peace with the situation and was feeling much better. Kaden's message really threw me for a loop.

I'm not sure if this is relevant information, but I am autistic and I'm pretty sure Ben is too. We both have trouble interpreting, expressing, and communicating our feelings. I'm sorry if I typed irrelevant details but I genuinely don't know what's relevant and what's not. This was my first relationship. I just feel so guilty and feel like a bad person.

1045,"I'm just going to dive right in with this I guess. I am 17 years old and I work in fast food. I think I've been working at this place for like 4 months and I've recently realized that I just can't handle the environment. I show heavy symptoms of ADHD and I was diagnosed when I was younger but I guess my parents never took it seriously because they ""haven't seen it in action"" whatever that means. My main issue with this job is that I just can't multitask without forgetting everything else that I'm doing which makes it really hard to function in that sort of environment. The last time I went to work I was taking orders and accidentally left a drink to overflow on to the ground because I literally just forgot about it. It took me forever to land this job and my parents basically forced me into it which is why I'm hesitant to just leave and either job hunt again or remain unemployed until I turn 18 and am able to work somewhere that I actually enjoy and doesn't make me anxious. I work tomorrow morning and I am absolutely dreading it so I would just like some advice on how to handle this job for the time being. Thank you, reddit &lt;3

But I don't really see myself as a great friend or person. I've got somewhat of a dark/sarcastic humor which not everyone vibes with. I've never been intentionally mean and people generally like me but I'm not really anyone's favorite person, and when I do meet with the very few friends I have, it's always me asking them to meet.

I don't feel like I'm interesting enough,  I enjoy painting, playing piano, gaming, anime, which could make me interesting but I'm not overly devoted to any one of those, I could talk about each thing for a little bit but if I'm taking to someone who is really into one of those things I can see them start to lose interest and seem somewhat disappointed once realizing I'm not able to follow everything they say and elaborate much on any subject.

I also have somewhat of a veiw that everyone has second intentions, people being nice to be or doing something to me must mean they are just joking or wanting something in return. Which makes me somewhat cold. I even pride myself into ""catching"" the person's intentions before they are able to trick me and feel like I've managed to out smart them.

Plus I'm not sure if I'm just lazy, but I find it really hard to gain the energy to try new things or even get more into one of the things I already like.

I am a reck. In the day with my friends I feel completely fine. But at night, when I’m alone with my thoughts and trying to sleep, I can’t stop thinking about her and I fall into spurts of denial, disbelief, and sadness.

I still want to make this work, but I don’t know how.

Can anyone tell me good ways to fix a relationship that seamlessly ended out of thin air.

Or if not, good ways to get through shit like this...",14May2020,1

1051,"I (F15) am a sophomore in a pretty small HS  with about 90 people in each grade. One of my best friends, Sarah (changed her name), got into the school with me Freshmen year, which we both disliked because we didn't want to depend on each other, and we ended up doing exactly that. However, she got closer to 3 girls, and I didn't get as close, which was totally cool, obviously. And I was friends with 2 of the girls, having had classes with them and working in projects together. Sarah and them became really close, hanging out after school, yada-yada, and I could tell she didn't really want to me to be friends with them, so she told one of her friends that I wouldn't want to go to her birthday party, which I did, and other stuff. We talked about it and later apologized about it.

We went on, and sophomore year came around, and we weren't as close, but I sat with them and we were friends and got along. And we got a transfer student, and Sarah and I didn't like her all that much, but she joined the group and became friends. Now, I and the other girls at the table got along and had fun, but we really didn't click amazingly, having different world views and priorities and such, and that was okay as I wasn't looking for best friends.

But I still felt left out. They had a GC I wasn't apart of, they didn't invite me to sleepovers or to hang out,  and I am of Latin American descent, not as rich, while they all are rich, Ukrainian/Russian Jewish, upper west side people. They all seemed to bond over that shared heritage, which is cool, I just can't relate.

And now with quarantine, I haven't seen them in a while or had contact, which yes is my fault to an extent, but they never tried either, and I had felt all throughout the year that they didn't really accept me, so I was hesitant to try and reach out, feeling like the odd one out, but I only seemed to dig myself into a deeper hole. I found out from one of my best friends, Sarah, that they have weekly zoom calls. 5 days ago, it was one of the girl's birthdays, and I reached out to both of them, wishing of the girls a happy birthday and initiating conversation with the both of them, and it was going well till all of a sudden they stopped responding and left me on delivered/read, which just made me feel bad and more unwanted by them, like a burden. I found out from Sarah that they had a zoom call, that they had Netflix party as a birthday celebration, which really hurt my feelings that they didn't invite me too, as we were friends, got along, sat at the same table every day, yada-yada, and then seemed like they didn't want to talk to me.

And then today, It was the other girl's birthday, and I texted her happy birthday, and she said thanks, and when I tried again to talk, give another chance, I got left on read/delivered, which obviously hurt. Now I feel like they don't like me, only put up with me cause they were nice and I and Sarah are best friends. I still don't know if that's the case, but I can assume that. I always knew we weren't as close, but I figured we were friends and liked each other, and if thas the case, I didn't expect them to feel that wayl. I even talked to them before about feeling somewhat as an outsider and had assured me in the beginning of the year that wasn't the case, and we were friends. However, now I feel that's changed, which is a horrible feeling. I don't want to deal with that terrible dynamic and feeling for the next two years, where I'm constantly left out, feel like a burden, etc. I don't want to face them and act like everything's fine when I can tell it's not, I don't want them to feel forced to be my friend or include me.

But I can't just find new friends, switch it up, cause its so small, the school, that finding new friends, starting over, isn't going to happen. I don't know. I was thinking of transferring to another school, but I live in a small community in the Bronx, while a good area, the zone HS is dangerous and terrible. So to transfer I would have to move to my house out of state and go to the local HS, which is fine IG, but I love my friends in my community, I love my school, and it would be a hassle with it conflicting with my mom's job. And my school is one of the best in the country, which I am grateful for going to it so I don't really want to transfer in terms of academics because of what it offers, but living the next two years, depressed, out of touch, unliked seems unbearable.

I'm not upset bc we're not as close, as that's was partially my fault and we don't click amazingly, but I figured we were pretty good friends, yk?

Idk what to do. I really want to start over, but I don't know if that's best. Sarah is also thinking of transferring bc she hates the school community, doesn't like our friends all that much despite being pretty close. Should I just suck it up or what?

EDIT: TL;DR: I feel my friends at school dislike me, or that I'm a burden, and I hate the situation so much I'm thinking of transferring, but IDK if I should. ",14May2020,2

1064,"  So first off my girlfriend (34) and I (37 male) have been dating for about 6 months. It got very serious very fast. She's a nurse and recently was accepted for a position with the Department of Defense to do tests on Special Operations soldiers, some of which are physicals. So before she took the job she told me about it and even said she wouldn't take the job if I didn't want her to. This job would drastically change our plans. I know it's a good step for her career path moving forward and I knew I couldn't be selfish so I agreed she she take the job. 

  My issues are this. First off she's attractive and I can imagine I wonder if a guy is going to disrespect her or do anything that would make her feel uncomfortable. I have respect for the military and it's soldiers but guys are guys and a lot of these guys are muscle heads. I know some of these guys because a lot of them live in my neighborhood. Hell my next door neighbor who I hang out with regularly is a retired special operator. I also know how guys talk about women when they aren't around. I'll admit, it bothers me knowing that she's probably gonna have to give physicals to the guys in the neighborhood at some point if she hasn't already and how they will perceive her or me and what type of comments they will say to each other.

  I hope this doesn't come across as a rant, I just want anyone who is willing to give me advice on this issue with myself to know the whole story.

  How do I get over this and quit letting it bother me? It bothers me quite a lot to the point where I almost want to leave her because it's hard for me to deal with.

  Also on a separate but related question, how does someone in the medical field separate what they are doing without getting some sort of rise out of it? I imagine if I was a gynecologist it would be hard not to get aroused if I found an attractive lady in front of me? These guys are in top shape, how the hell does she not say to herself, ""Well that's a nice dick I have in my hands?”",14May2020,1

His responses have went from fast to here and there, they’re usually short messages as opposed to us literally sending paragraphs to one another talking about all kinds of stuff.

1077,"I hope this doesn’t come across misled in any way, Im hoping to learn more about this from others who have experienced it so I can better understand where my friend is coming from. 

My best friend has been feeling off towards white people after a couple miss haps with some of her friends. (And other realizations) 
To sum up my friends situation: she was born in canada but her family is from south america. She has grown up around mostly white communities and her friends, that she has known  since she was 8 , have had a falling out due to what seems to be a lot of miss communication. but my friend feels that white women are too privileged to understand her. (I am one of her white friends but when she talks about it I dont feel like its directed at me as its coming from anger frustration with in herself, her friends and situations around her)

sometimes when this topic comes up I don’t know how to respond so I usually just listen and ask questions but It feels like she is experiencing feelings of cultural separation and she describes her self as being too white washed and how she needs to teach white women to be more respectful and understanding.  this is coming from a couple different situations and it has sparked through some patterns she has noticed throughout her life. 

I have learned alot from these discussions, especially about white privilege and how it effects people and perspectives. I have also noticed her friends do treat her like “one of them”  but they do not really show any interest in how diverse everyone is (whether that be race culture or religion). What my friend is experiencing seems to be something that is easily not noticed but definitely still exists. 


Now on to the questions: 

if you have experienced this feeling with in your cultural identity can you describe what brought it on and how you have dealt with it? What have you learned? 

What should I be more mindful about when this topic comes up?

The main reason Im seeking advice is to have a better perspective and not feel so threatened when she talks about “white women” aggressively. I don’t disagree with this at all as its her experience and her feelings and I am white so I haven’t experienced this. Im just hoping to find a better approach with in these discussions because I have noticed she has become more angry and frustrated and its directed at white women as a general population.",14May2020,1

1080,"Sorry, didn't come up with a better title. 
So first off, I'm a teenager from a somewhat highly-developed country, but zero knowledge about mental health problems. Totally zero.

I've been feeling this particular way since I remember and idk what it is. Can't talk to anybody about that so here I am talking to strangers. I can't even go talk to psychologists because I'd need my parents consent and I have a really bad relationship with them and they are what you call ""boomers"".
I don't really have lots of friends, maybe 3 or 4 but it's not like I'd tell them.

So I'm generally labeled as weird in my class. I bite my finger nails and cheeks even though I am a girl, I have this habit of like putting my hand in my hair on scalp in public. People are kinda scared of that, but I can't stop it.

Teachers say I'm in my own world. I can't pay attention in classes at all. I know that if I don't, I'll get spanked, but still can't and it bothers me.

I'm extremely socially anxious and awkward. When I talk to people there's what you describe as awkward silence. But it depends. When it's a chat about weather stuff, there's lots of awkwardness but when I talk about things I like it's actually pretty good but idk if people really like it when I tell them about my hobbies.

And the hobbies are... mostly normal. Like some of the board games and sports. What I really LOVE doing though (and it ain't rly popular) is CATEGORIZING things. I love reading Wikipedia, browsing categories on Wikipedia. Could be doing this all day. My favorite thing ever is learning administrative divisions of countries (and Special Adm. Regions) in East and Southeast Asia, mostly Taiwan, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Mongolia, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam. Seeing a country divided into smaller parts is so cool and I like it very much, but what is better is that when I have access to computer I have this program Google Earth Pro and I can use Street View. This is also so cool. I use GADM database to download Google Earth Pro maps with administrative divisions in them. This is very very cool but nobody does it :(

As the quarantine started, I was feeling bad because my life turned around like 180 degrees and I so don't like lifestyle changes. Now I'm used to it and it's actually better for me. I don't have to spend time with people from my class AT ALL. We do have lessons online in my country but you don't necessarily have to speak and take part in them actively. 

Have I mentioned I'm total shit at math? What others consider easy is a nightmare to me. I feel so bad when I make mistakes after so much time of trying. I start throwing books and notebooks all over my room which is also not very normal. On the other hands teachers say I excel in languages and geography. My studying is not balanced. My grade average is around average but not like I only get C's. I get F's and A's depending on subject so it's finally a C.

Idk why but I'm so emotional over every stupid thing.

Please help me people of reddit. I can't go to a psychologist, only in few years when I'm 18. I need somebody to help me cope, somebody who's similar or somebody who knows what's up. I'm only writing now because in middle school I wasn't picked on at least.",14May2020,1

1085,"I (f16) have had a pretty good childhood, I don’t remember anything very bad/traumatizing happening to me and I’ve been relatively happy with life since I was a kid. My relationship with my parents is okay but not perfect. I don’t want to get into my relationship with my mom, but it’s a lot different than with my dad. For as long as I can remember I’ve always felt like I’ve had to prove myself to my dad and that if I fail then I’ll embarrass myself and he won’t be proud of me. Earliest I can remember of this is when I was around 5 or 6. I had these little egg music shakers and trying to play a song on them but worrying my dad would hear it and think it was bad. In elementary school I never liked talking to my friends in front of my dad because I felt like he would think they were weird. In elementary and middle school, whenever he would come into my room to check on my and I was playing on my iPad or iPod I would put it down as if I was never on it in the first place because I didn’t want him to think I spent a lot of time on electronics. 
He’s always had an issue with me dressing in “revealing clothes” which is where one of my main insecurities comes from. When I was 8 or 9 years old in the 3rd grade he was gonna take me to see a movie and I was excited so I put on one of my favorite outfits at the time which was a multicolored skort and a tee shirt or something like that. It was a child’s outfit, there was nothing “revealing” about it. He told me he wanted me to change it. I didn’t understand why. I was so confused and felt like I had done something wrong and that he was mad and disappointed in me. I remember crying to myself and wondering what I did wrong and why the outfit was bad. 
From that age on him and my mom were weird about what clothes I could wear. They didn’t want me wearing shorts unless they were long and they didn’t like me wearing leggings without a longer shirt covering my butt. Same with short skirts and dresses, I wasn’t allowed to wear it. 
This created a deep feeling of shame in me that something was wrong with showing skin and that my parents would love me more if I covered up. My body was still that of a child, I didn’t have any development so I didn’t get why i was being treated different. 
This continued until I was about 13 or 14 when they lightened up about being as hard on me wearing “revealing” things. I sometimes wore shorts, skirts, some crop tops, leggings, etc. All of it was simply out of liking the way the clothes looked and wearing what made me feel confident. I didn’t do it to attract boys or whatever my parents were thinking. I was at an all girls during this time period (middle school years.) this still didn’t stop my dad from making comments to me. When it was my first day at a new school, I showed him the outfit I was excited to wear (red tee shirt with white pants.) he said that the shirt “sent off a message that I was looking for sex” because if wasn’t a crew neck it was a little bigger around the neck and showed my collar bones. I got a lot of comments from my parents like this. I wasn’t looking sex I was looking for a comfortable and cute outfit I could wear to express myself to my new classmates. I felt sexualized in a setting where I was trying to be a kid.  
Now I’m in high school. I wear what I want and if they tell me not to wear something I find my way around it (if they say a skirt is too short then I pull it down more when leaving the house etc.) 
I don’t like feeling repressed in what I can/can’t wear. I understand that I’m a minor and that I shouldn’t be trying to “grow up too fast” or however some people think but why is it my fault if perverted adults look at me in a sexual way. Why was the brunt of that placed on the back of me at 8/9 years old? 
Even around my house I feel like I have to hide from my dad when I’m wearing a tank top or pajama shorts to sleep because if he sees me I worry he’s gonna think of me as dressing like a “slut” or “asking for it” like him and my mom have influenced me to believe. I’m in my own house and I just wanna be comfy on a hot day goddamnit. Not everything is about sex, just because I’m a woman I have to worry about being seen as giving off this subliminal message when I’m just trying to be comfortable. When my dads around I often find myself wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt or a big tee. When my dad isn’t home I feel comfortable dressing in whatever pajamas I want and am overall a lot more comfortable in my own house. 
A few days ago four swimsuits I ordered came in the mail, I tried them on and I felt so confident and happy with my body (I also have a lot of body confidence issues so this was nice to feel). I showed my mom and she said I looked amazing but that my dads going to be mad if he sees the bottoms. A few days later I’m in the kitchen with mom and dad and my dad says “so I heard you bought a bunch of butt-floss bikinis” (that’s what they call swimsuits that don’t completely cover your butt) (also, these swimsuits were a little cheeky but they weren’t even close thongs) I said they’re not that showy and that we are literally in quarantine so it’s not like anybody is going to see me wearing them. My mom was like why did you buy ones so showy??? And I said it’s because the trendiest ones in style on the sight all have their bottoms cut like that (because they do!Tie dye bikinis are so in right now.) She said “no you didn’t, you bought it because you like it. Don’t lie.” And then my dad proceeds to draw a drawing of a girls butt and legs and where the swimsuit should cover. I felt objectified and shameful afterwards because once again I felt like I disappointed him. 
When I started Drivers Ed, I began doing driving lessons with him teaching me which usually resulted in him yelling at me and me coming home, going to my room and crying once again feeling like I always disappoint him. (This story makes me sound like such a crybaby but these moments hurt me a lot)
This February (like three months ago) we had a big fight while driving and because of that he canceled my drivers Ed classes with my real instructor because he told me I was too “sensitive” to drive with. I was very mad and me and him were distant from each other for about a month. (TW) This put me in a dark place and I began self harming again (I had previously dealt with self harm a few years ago in middle school.)  
Another things he does that makes me feel ashamed of myself is when he judges my best friend. My best friend is 15 and is on birth control because yes she has sex with her boyfriend who she loves and trusts and has been in a relationship with for a year. She gets tested and uses protection and follows all the safe sex rules. My dad had an issue with this at first when he found out (because I told my mom about it and she told him.) he would just make kind of snarky and rude comments and give looks whenever I’d talk about her and it really upset me so I told him that I didn’t like him talking about her that way and that i can’t stop him from having an opinion but that it’s not his business whatever she chooses to do with her body. 
Also in general my dad is not very good at being emotional and whenever I’m sad he doesn’t really know how to comfort me instead of just being silent and giving me a hug or something. Whenever I get in trouble it’s always my mom yelling and lecturing me and my dad just sitting there staring at me in disappointment. Whenever that happens I always imagine what he’s thinking and the things I imagine are not good. I never talk to him when I’m sad because I don’t feel that level of closeness with him. He’s just sorta my father who is good most of the time but other times does things that make me hate myself.

I think I’m gonna wrap this up before it gets too long but these are some of the main things that really have hurt me/affected my relationship with my dad and have created a feeling a subconscious self hatred in me whenever I dress revealingly or am around my dad.

1088,"Hey everyone (19M), first time posting here. A little backstory, i've been friends with this guy since grade six and we were extremely tight throughout middle school and high school (we both went to private school but don't categorize me) we hung out lots throughout those seven years and ill never regret a minute, however, in March 2020 he brought up the idea of buying a necklace online and splitting the cost (it was a BOGO where the second chain is free), I wanted to get a new chain anyways so I said yes, he ordered it, it came in, and I asked him how much do I send over he said $288, I asked for a receipt right after and he said he would give it to me the next day. Next day comes and surprise, no receipt and I kept asking but forgot for a while until today, when I messaged the online shop and (i honest to god didn't think they'd tell me but you'd be surprised what information people give out if you have the basic information) they had told me the total was $202.24. I immediately cut him off and a few hours after that he sent me an e transfer for $300, my question or advice that i'm asking is what should I do from here? I think the right thing is to deny the money and move forward but he sent the e transfer with no password to my email, which is a sign that he's sorry since I could deposit that money at any time, but on the other hand if he was truly sorry he wouldn't have done what he did in the first place. I'm so conflicted internally because i've never really been screwed this much before.

TLDR; Sent my 'friend' $288 for something that was $202.24, sent me an e transfer for $300, where should I go from here?",14May2020,1

My boss was able to get a small business loan to hold us all over until June 13th (summer camp is cancelled) but I’m not making nearly as much as I was before. 

My issue is however, the preschool I work at is in a church so “technically” I’m a church employee and my boss contacted the pastor and he informed her that the church doesn’t pay into the unemployment thing (not sure what it’s called) so if I were to file, I’d be denied. 

I tried applying for jobs but the only experience I have is childcare. I tried signing up for ubereats and I was under the impression I was on my parents car insurance buttttt I’m not, so my name isn’t on any paperwork that would allow me to drive.

1090,"This may be lengthy, but I hope someone reads it and can offer something.
Let's start way back in 2003, I was in 7th grade, I had this girlfriend, we were together into 8th grade and it ended like most young teen relationships. Into high school we were both in different cliques but always seemed to talk and joke around and everything. We graduated in 2008.

We talked over messaging apps a few times here and there since 2008, but nothing too major until about 2012-2013, when I just came out and said I never completely was ""over her"" even from 7th grade and all through high school I wanted nobody but her, I actually dismissed any girl that showed any interest in me because I wanted her.  I can't remember her reply exactly word for word but it was something along the lines of wishing that I'd said that in high school and she waited senior year to get a prom date hoping I was going to ask her.  

Since then we've communicated here and there.  I've never felt good enough and that she's too far out of my league, she went to law school and is a lawyer, I'm just a blue collar worker making enough to live and have a little extra.  Things that don't really make us common in social circles.

About 5 years ago, I met a girl, we hit it off and began dating, eventually getting engaged last year.  We get along great, argue maybe once every couple months, I mean she's an awesome person and I do love her.  Recently she started discussing children, she's 28 and is getting worried about her ability to produce them.  I also want kids, I'm almost 30, but I can't decide if I want them right now or in the next year or 3-5 years or what.  It's definitely a deal breaker for her if I can't provide a set date I wanna have kids if it's not within 2 years.  So to connect the first story, I still think about the 7th grade girlfriend everyday, I dream about her weekly,  wishing things would be different, even if I had just tried to be with her and failed, at least I'd had known, I probably sound like a damn creep.  

My fiancee is a great partner and would be a great mother and everything would be perfect.....for her.  For me, I'm an extreme introvert, can't discuss feelings, have none really, barely talk about anything, but I'm going along with the engagement, probably kids, etc, just because I'm 30 and society says I should be married and have kids so it is what I'm supposed to do, even if it's not what I 100% want, plus I feel 5 years in, it's too late, she invested so much time for me that I need to  just put on a smile everyday and romp through life like I'm supposed to so she can enjoy life and be happy.  I'm a coward by not doing the right thing.

What does anyone outside think about this situation?

We were through some stuff together but the stuff we've been through I feel like its my fault.  They had a toxic friend  to them and they love them for a year before they met me. I told them  I dont like them talking due to the event im about to explain in the next paragraph. So they decided to blocked them on social media and don't talk to them

But before blocking the friend didnt love them back and just had them wrapped around their finger. Two weeks before they asked me out, they did something sexual with the friend. (We were talking during this time and flirting back and forth) I didnt find out until a week later after my s/o ask  me out. The friend they did it with dm me and got my ex who I was on good terms on to tell me not to go out with them. But neither of them didnt go in detail on what happen and instead make it out that I did something wrong to my s/o. (First time this has happened in a relationship I felt extremely bad for a different ex because of me hurting them that I had a breakdown for them)

So me not getting details that it was because they had sexual things, but instead I was thinking I did something so bad to them. I ended up having a break down. But when it was clear up that I didnt do anything  I felt I was  lied to by my s/o. Because during the time we talked before they asked me out they were telling me they had no feelings for them or wanted to anything with them.

So after the block and no talking I found out they were texting here and there. When  I pointed it out they stopped talking to them.

I feel like because of this event that hurt me is the reason I dont love them any more, and instead of relationship it feel like a chore/friends with benfit type of thing.

I want to tell them this but I dont know how or when.  They shower me with things but its just the same sayings over and over that I can guess whats they will say or do.

1098,"Hello to anyone reading this :)

Sorry if this is very vague, I’m not the best at explaining things - let alone my emotions.

There’s a certain period where things will be good for a few weeks (less than a month). 
I will wake up in the morning feeling well and motivated to do things and overall feel like it will be a good day. I get scared during these times, because it’s all too good to be true. Every. Single. Time. 
Eventually, that will pass. Incredibly quickly as well. Everything that could possibly go wrong, goes wrong. I just feel like breaking down every minute of the day wether something happened or did not happened. I wake up feeling completely unmotivated with horrible anxiety, I feel like vomiting, my entire body will ache. I keep waking up every day at the same time. 2am. Not even due to a nightmare, in fact I never even seem to be dreaming. 

The past few months (March, April &amp; May) have been that way. Every bad thing you could think of has happened. Being in quarantine makes it even worse, everyone is on edge. Everyone is negative. I feel suffocated. When I was 10, I caught my dad cheating on my mother and that shattered me. It shattered my relationship with my dad. It shattered my trust. I’m nearly 17 now, my parents are still together and very clear they aren’t happy and are just there for my brother and I. (My brother being 12). 

I was always able to tolerate my dad, although it was never really and truly the same. Recently, he’s just been so angry and hurtful. I don’t know what to do when he’s around. I try to avoid him by being cooped up in my room all day, just looking at his face invokes an emotion I don’t know how to express. My little brother made a mistake and spend a large sum of money on his credit card without knowing and he’s been stressed. I understand that. But he’s taking it out on everyone. The minute he walks through the door the entire house changes. It’s quiet because we’re afraid to speak. The negativity REEKS. He threatened to destroy everything my brother owns and my stuff as well. I found it unfair as I wasn’t involved, but was too afraid to speak up. He’s been criticising everything I do. I’m never enough. He gave me this long lecture about what is wrong with me and that I will never be enough. I know he’s angry and he doesn’t mean it, but it hurts nonetheless. 

That doesn’t help with how I feel. I’ve been suicidal for a long time, I think. I want to die. I wouldn’t kill myself, but I’ve felt like it. I’ve thought about it many times. If there was an opportunity where I had to die, I would be content. Relieved even. It’s not because of this situation with my dad. I’ve felt like this for a long time. I can not be here. I don’t want to be here. I truly and honestly don’t want to be here. I go to bed sometimes wishing I just don’t wake up. I have no particular reason, I just feel like that. If it weren’t for the fact that I know my passing would hurt many people, I would’ve killed myself a long time ago. I had a plan to do it, I would drown myself. I tried to, in my bathtub but my little brother knocked on the door and I didn’t have to get up but I did. I don’t know if I regret it or not. I feel crying everyday. The shower is the only place I feel content. It’s my safe place honestly speaking. I haven’t told this to my friends or anyone, really. I feel stupid talking about it. I don’t know what to do.

1106,"This is going to be a long, complicated story, TL;DR at the bottom.

So my ex (who I'll just call my ex) told me last week that his neighbors granddaughter tested positive for coronavirus and that my ex's home could be exposed because ex's father (who my ex lives with) comes in regular contact with their neighbor, as they share some farm land. The problem is my daughter lives with me as well as her dad and this happened while she was in his care.

She was supposed to come back to my home, but because of the situation I can't bring her back because I live with my boyfriend and his family. My boyfriend has three siblings who are very immuno-compromised, if they get this virus they will die.

So here's where the shit get's ugly. My daughters father is refusing to get her tested because she did not come in direct contact with the person who has the virus or anyone in the house hold where said child lives. He's telling me that his father is the only one truly at risk therefore if his fathers test comes back negative everyone in the home is fine.

I asked him simply to get our daughter tested just so everyone's mind would be at ease and that I couldn't pick her up from him because there's still a risk, even if his father comes back negative  there's still a risk that they could get it. Even though it's a small risk it's a risk I can't afford to take when the people I live with will die if they get this virus. He hasn't told me whether or not his fathers girlfriend is getting tested, she also lives in the home. He told me his doctor said that if his fathers test comes back negative there's no reason for anyone else in the home to get a test which really doesn't seem likely to me.

At this point I've been without my daughter for two weeks and I just want her back, but I don't want to risk anyone else's life because of it. I've asked him repeatedly to just get her tested so we can all have piece of mind and he just refuses. I want to take her to get tested myself but if I pick her up from her fathers house we'll have to find somewhere else to stay until we can both be tested and get negative results, and I don't have anywhere to go for that amount of time.

I've been careful throughout quarantine and very nervous about continuing to exchange her throughout this whole ordeal, but he begged me to work with him because he missed her which I understood, so I did. He told me when they went out he said they wore masks, and that they were generally being safe. 

Am I overreacting because she wasn't directly exposed? I feel like it's better to be safe than sorry.

1109,"I've always wanted a Nintendo Switch. Mainly because I'm a techy and I would love to explore everything that jailbreak and home brew has to offer for the switch. I thought that quarantine would be a perfect time to jump into a new hobby.

Enter craigslist ad. I'm trying to buy second hand as that's most likely where I will find switches capable of being jailbroken. This ad lists an unopened switch for $180 (a steal compared to anything else) and is fairly close, only 15 min away. They said they have the serial number (I asked because there is a way to check if a switch is jailbreakable by its serial) but they don't want to give it out or check for me online. I guess it's understandable, but they ensured me it's generation 1 and jailbreakable.

The catch is that they only want to do shipping or drop off, not meet in a public place like a gas station. They also want half payment in PayPal.me (non refundable) before the drop off, or full payment through PayPal.me and then they would ship. All signs point to this being a scam, and I have huge issues with putting any money forward before even seeing a physical product. Should I just move on and keep looking?",14May2020,2

1124,"Male - 28 yr old.  


TL;DR : My dream is to be a prominent voice actor, and I've made great strides (see below) but it hasn't turned into a career yet. My girlfriend thinks I should put that on hold for a few years and get a degree in something else and pursue acting in my spare time, and I think I should I should pursue my dream non-stop.

For the past three or four years, I've been putting everything into becoming a professional voice actor. I've taken lessons from notable voice actors Richard Tatum and Crispin Freeman, and winter before last I finally recorded my professional demo in Santa Monica and used it to land an agent in Seattle (MAM Talent agency). I've landed some small paying roles in video games on my own, but those never led to big money, and the games themselves either haven't been completed or have been released but without any dialogue from any of the actors on the project so I haven't seen any publicity from any of the projects either. On top of that, my agency led me to believe they had plenty of voice acting opportunities, but in the year I've been with them I can count the opportunities they've give me on one hand.But I feel like I shouldn't give up, and need to keep throwing myself at it with everything I have to make my dream come true, and have a career that I really care about, and enjoy, that can also support my girlfriend and I in our future plans and passions, like travel. But my girlfriend sees my lack of progress as a sign I need to put it on hold and should pursue a degree in something that will lead to a career elsewhere where I can pursue acting on the side. I'm not against the idea of getting a degree, per se, but I don't think I want to put the time and money into pursuing something I don't really want. I've never enjoyed school, though I do like learning, and I want to spend all my time pushing after my dream instead of spending it on an education that I don't really think will be worth all the time and money, and which I honestly think I wouldn't get to really use just like a lot of other people that graduate from the American education system.

Part of that is that once uni goes offline again, I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep up, since I now have a job and I don't know if I'll manage to attend all lectures, and I don't want my grades to drop and my mum to be disappointed.

That's been on my mind a lot, so I've forgotten about the one other thing. I'm a first year uni student. I am studying in the same city as most of my friends from high school, but only one of them is at my uni, and they're in a different degree than mine. I've made 'friends' in my major, but nothing that is anyhow similar to my friends from high school. No regular group chat that's just random talk and memes. There's one person I chat with regularly, but that's it. 

I do chat daily with people online in fandoms we share etc. But I'm super scared of not having friends IRL.

1134,"Hi y'all - going to give a brief backstory on this one. I am an only child who is fairly close to my parents except for my sexuality which is part of my life I have completely hidden from them since being outed at 17 in which they told me I was ""too young to know"". I came out (again?) as gay 2 weeks ago (as well as told them I have a girlfriend) to my parents who told me they were ""shocked"" that I was gay but that it wasn't a big deal. While they initially brushed it off as no biggie their behavior soon became very odd.

I'm unsure if me coming out is related to their behavior but the timing leads me to believe that it is. They immediately started to demand that I Facetime them every day at night (I have tried to facetime them every night but when I couldn't it wasn't a huge deal) and when I said I was too tired or busy they told me that I am distant and that it has ""brought them to tears"". When I tried to tell them I was too busy to talk sometimes due to my job or having hobbies they told me that that is indicative that I ""don't love them"" and that because of the current climate I should be WANTING to speak to them every single day. They keep making comments about how they are the ""two most important people in my life and that they love me the most out of anyone"". They have also made vague comments about how they hope I'm ""doing a good job at work and not being distracted by anything"" and that I seem ""more tired than normal"".

Now here's the part that is starting to truly get under my skin - my mother's reaction to my girlfriend. My mom had factimed me when I first came out about my girlfriend and asked some general questions about her (where she worked, where she was from, etc). My mom asked for her last name which I told because I obviously want to be open with my mother about who I'm romantically interested in.

Fast forward to last weekend when my mom brought up my girlfriend again - this time to ""warn"" me about her. My mother had gone on google and searched my girlfriend's name only to find out she had a DUI 2 years ago (my girlfriend had already informed me about this and she ran a yellow light and got pulled over). While I know there is NO EXCUSE for this as it could have killed someone it happened 2 years ago and she has paid her dues and hasn't ran into any trouble remotely since then. I tried explaining this to my mom who truly wanted no part of it. She told me that this girl is ""bad news"" and that I need to ""watch my back"" because this is a ""bad person who has ruined her life and will never get a job"". I know for a fact that my girlfriend is NOT a bad person when it comes down to it. She has had SEVERAL great paying jobs as a paralegal and is currently making great money and living on her own.

Now I understand why my mom is concerned but it seems like she is completely blowing it out of proportion. Even though I know everything is out there on Google it just seems odd that she would go ahead and start diving into seeing what is out there online about my girlfriend after I trusted to open up to her about this part of my life. What my girlfriend did was a BAD thing but it was a mistake that she has learned from and to completely shut her out and label her as a ""bad person I need to stay away from"" just seems to be too much. It's very frustrating to me as I would love for my mother and my girlfriend to get along and have a healthy relationship as that is truly the reason why I wanted to come out to begin with.

1135,"My best “friend” is my crush. I say it like that because I dont really see her as a friend. I want too so I can move on from this pain.

I confessed to her 2 months ago. We didn’t know each other so well before, and I told her I liked her. She didn’t know what to make of it and told me she really likes me too and she sucks at expressing her feelings and she just needs to get things figured out. General rule of thumb is if it isnt a yes, its a no. 

However, that surprisingly didn’t affect much. We continued being friends and we got really close. But my feelings for her never faded. And honestly just recently they have grown stronger and out of control. Its gotten the best of me. Reason why they have grown stronger is because shes always telling me how she loves me and whatnot. Our convos sound like how a couple would talk, and its just... it hurts. It hurts feeling what it would feel like but knowing it isnt hurts really bad. 

It hurts even more especially after just recently where she started joking around saying we’re married and shes started saying “Love you hubby”. It’s hard to see her as a friend.

1136,"I don’t agree with this in the sense that his mom keeps hinting she’s going to stay with us when the baby is born so she can help with “waking me up for feeding time and then she can help burp the baby”. To me that’s too much. Like, I kind of want to learn how to do all that myself. And though I get along with my mother in law, sometimes I don’t always agree with how she views things or does things. It just bothers me she wants to stay with us and hints it all the time. I don’t know if I’m just annoyed by the idea or what my deal is. I want to be open with help but I’ve had friends who had babies and they didn’t have anyone over ALL the time at first, if at all. They had help from their moms and mom in laws, but my mother in law has also hinted to us about living with us before when we rent places or talk about buying a house she will say “oh I can just live downstairs” or “I’ll just help pay rent and take a room” but my husband and I are like no it’s ok. (His mom is single and can literally live wherever and also we live in the same state.) But besides that I don’t want to be rude, I want to be open to help, just not ALL THE TIME like if she’s staying with us. (I don’t think). Maybe I’m just being a brat but I love learning myself and even my mom said she didn’t have anyone stay with her. I want both my mom and mom in law to be close to their grandchildren, I guess I just don’t want to be “smothered”. (Which is my assumption, but I don’t know how else to think about it.)

I really am dreading it because my husband is like “trust me, you will want someone around to help” and I’m like, isn’t that supposed to be him? We both work from home, so he will need time to work, but I just really don’t understand why I will need all this “help” at first. Isn’t being with the baby your self all part of the process? I know my husband will help, but he thinks we will need that “nanny” type help at first. Maybe I’m stubborn? Idk. 

Now, I’ve never had a baby and my husband doesn’t have kids either, and I don’t know what it’s like. So please help me either be more open, not be a brat, maybe I will need help, maybe I won’t, maybe I am overreacting, maybe I’m not. I just don’t know why it all has to be speculated now. I think I’m more annoyed when people talk about stuff like that before it happens because we won’t know the situation ahead of time completely, ya know?

I want to know how to deal with mother-in-laws, how to be nice, understanding or what am I supposed to do? I don’t want to tell her she can’t come and do that when literally no child is even in my belly yet, and also I don’t want to get into it with her when there isn’t anything yet. But this has come up a couple of times and my husband assured me we will need the help. It irks me.

1137,"I’m 16 right now living alone with my mom and I’m quite not sure if she is abusive or if I’m overreacting. My mom has had a temper since I was little, and she’s always been quick to yell at me, but she’s rarely physical. When I was little I got in trouble at school a lot but it’s almost nonexistent now. I have a habit of forgetting a lot, from putting shoes away to doing chores to leaving out ice cream. I try but it’s difficult. I also tend to have a very messy room, I think it’s because I’m depressed but it’s still not right.

If my mom sees my room is messy she’ll yell and tell me it’s unacceptable, and sometimes that it’s disgusting and that there’s no excuse. Even with small things like the shoes, if it happens enough times she’ll yell and curse about it. When she’s mad at me for longer periods for whatever reason she’ll slam doors and cabinets and just yell out, like you would when your frustrated and have a lot of pent up emotion.

Recently when she saw how messy my room was, and then I later had left things out when I shouldn’t have, she opted to ignore me for days. This led up until Mother’s Day and because she wouldn’t go near me we didn’t celebrate at all. Now she blames me for not trying to talk to her even tho she was in a bad state. This kind of thing isn’t uncommon. She also tells me to apologize when she never does, and if I’m upset at her and ignoring her for more than a day she acts like I’m overreacting and need to get over it, even tho she does the same thing but for even longer.

Whenever I try to explain this to her she chuckles or shakes her head like she can’t believe what she’s hearing. She mocks me and says “wow so it’s all my fault? You do nothing wrong it’s all because of me? Of course, you go on and believe that, feel whatever you wanna feel” but then when I do feel things she tells me I’m overreacting or being disrespectful, even I don’t say anything to her. She also never offers a solution or tries to change.

Is this me miscommunicating? Am I misunderstanding something here? I know I’m not perfect and I have a decent amount of issues but I feel like they aren’t bad enough to warrant her types of response. It’s gotten to the point that I can’t feel things and have it effect her, I have to just smile and act like it’s fine, I can’t even say I’m tired because “I got only 4 hours of sleep, you have to right to complain about being tired around me” is her response.

Am I right? Is this kind of behavior something I can report? I’m scared to report it and someone come and say that none of this is abuse and that I’m overreacting. Because if she finds out I did that I’ll be in so much trouble I won’t see my friends for months, I won’t have a phone or communication for so long I’ll wish I was dead. So please be honest, and if you can, suggest some solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

if you following someone because your friend ask you then you befriend them on purpose just to get information out of them and your intentions isnt to be there friends then that's considered being fake and instigating. people do bad things to others then they blame the victim for situations they created. instigating is a choice. harming someone else is a choice. thats the choice they made when they were doing that to me. its like when i treat them the same way they hate it and start to make up lies. im the kinda of person that minds my business. i dont follow people i was friends with or people i dont like, in real life too i stay away from people who i know that are bad but in real life i dont have this problem because no one does this in real life.

its only on social media where people feel tough behind the computer screen. if im friends with someone i do my all to make sure they are okay and protect them and be there for them. i never onced betrayed a friend. even if these people befriended me to instigate only ,that still means they fake. they were being fake. do you think im fake?",14May2020,1

For my whole life, I've lived in my sister's shadows. I'm not your typical youngest child; I didn't get all the doting attention from my parents. In fact, both of them are older siblings themselves, so they lack empathy for me. My whole life, I have been ignored by my family because of my sister. Not all of it was her own doing; everyone in my family is immigrants. We moved here when I started elementary school. So for my sister, they had to give her a lot of attention, because they were in a new country. For that reason, my sister has a very ""I'm the greatest at everything"" attitude, which turns off many people, although no one ever says it to her face. She is a lot more open to taking risks, and is more of a talker than a listener; I'm more cautious and anxious, resorting to listening before speaking. Many have told me for these reasons, my sister often gives younger sibling tendencies than I do. Despite this, my parents still paint me to be this vicious younger child, my mom often comparing me to her younger sister, who she hated. My dad especially loves my sister, often showering her in compliments, telling her attitude right now is good and that she'll succeed in life. However, throughout my years of living, I've learned that while my dad will always be my sister's biggest support, he will always be the first to criticize me, even if I do the same things my older sister does.  
 When my sister sheds a tear, his heartbreaks, when I shed a tear, I'm too sensitive. At times, he's even told me that I wouldn't be fit for my dream job and that my sister would do better than me. He's told me multiple times that I will fail in life, while my sister will only find success. Maybe I am sensitive, but now I get scared to show emotion in my household in fear that it will be dismissed. While my mom used to help me when I was younger, she spends her days been incredibly narcissistic, scolding me for not being the idealistic child. I am convinced that she has a borderline personality disorder, although I'm too scared to tell her. For these reasons, while my sister has become more extroverted, I've become an introvert. During Quarantine, I try not to come out of my room too much. I've had trouble sleeping at night, so I often look like I just came back from the dead. To make up for this sleep, I sometimes take short naps throughout the day. While I've been trying to stop, this doesn't stop my sister from making fun of me for everything I do.   
Ever since she has been to college, she's been incredibly insensitive. She acts as if she's higher above others, ignoring them in hopes that they will talk and praise her first. She also got a boyfriend during college, which was a big scandal in my family, coming from a very strict Asian household. She recently has accepted a job and often flaunts to me that she has money, practically throwing insults at how ""poor"" I am because I guess as a high school Junior, I'm supposed to have plenty of money? My parents made her break up with her boyfriend. However, she's still dating him. While I'm sure that the argument between her and my parents impacted her a lot, it significantly impacted me more as I became the messenger between both of them. My parents verbally abused me, calling me a slut, and giving me the responsibilities of delivering tough messages. Then I was forced to comfort my sister. Her grades started slipping, and my parents immediately softened. My grades also started dropping from the immense pressure and stress, which they belittled me for. I begged my sister to break up with her boyfriend because of all the pressure I was under, and the only thing she said was, ""if you love me, you wouldn't say that."" I understand why she said that and feel bad that I told her that, but to this day, she is still dating that guy. She is only nice to me when she wants to talk about him; otherwise, she returns to her rude, hurtful words.   
During Quarantine, my mom has been paranoid that I'm not getting work done, because she's scared that the COVID-19 Lockdown will stop my education. I currently have to worry about my SATs, APs, and piles of school work. So I'm always working. My sister used to be chubby when she was younger (not really, she was just a little curvier, I guess), while I used to be very lanky. However, she decided to take up exercise as a hobby, which is terrific. I'm happy for her. But now that she's lost weight, all she does is belittle me for not working out and for being ""lazy,"" even though I have significantly more work than her. She often brags about how skinny she is, which is excellent, I'm happy she loves her body now... until she starts throwing insults that me. Keep in mind that I'm about 5 inches taller than her and only weight 15 pounds more. If I eat something, she mentions out how I don't work out. If I'm studying, she mentions how I don't work out. If I'm watching a movie, she mentions how I don't work out. When I close my door and study for a big exam, she tells my parents I'm sleeping, and they open my door furiously, saying I'm lying. When I'm sleeping at night, she comes into my room and steals my things, and when I demand them back, she argues that I ""gave them to her a long time ago."" Or while I beg her not to come in because I'm busy, she'll start fidgeting with everything on my desk. I have AP exams this week, so I've been studying from dawn to dusk, but she purposely tells my parents I'm putting on a show and not actually studying. All while she says she's studying, but in reality, she's calling her boyfriend and deciding what to name their baby. I'll cook food for her, and she'll laugh and tell me how ugly it looks, even if I spent time making it. But then she'll demand I cook for her again.  
I feel like I can't talk to my sister without getting insulted.   
And more than that, I feel like I can't tell my parent's about what's going on without them invalidating me. It's always, ""you can't take a joke"" or 'you're too sensitive.""   
All that my sister has done since shes come back is make my parents not want to trust me despite not doing anything wrong.   
So what do I do now? Do I ignore her? Do I just endure it for one more year until I go off to college? Do I continue to stay in my room?  
I have so much ""dirt"" on my sister, which I could use against her, but I never do. Why? Because I'm not that person. But I know that if my sister were in my position, she would have already slipped. She would try to turn my parents against me.  
This might just be normal sibling rivalry, and I'm just truly being sensitive, but I can't seem to stop thinking how unfair this is.

I'm so sorry for writing this much, and I feel like I just spilled out my whole life dilemma with each member of my family. While this is very biased, because this is only coming from my eyes, this is genuinely how I feel. Although I doubt anyone will read through this, I don't mind. Writing all of this was very therapeutic for me.  While I am still stressed, I feel like a great weight has been lifted off.

If you read through this all. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart.",14May2020,1
1144,"I’ve had one of those days today where I feel sad and have absolutely no idea why. I do not have depression or anything serious, and I don’t have days like this very often. But today, I’ve just been stuck in a whole of not being able to distract myself from how I’m feeling.

Maybe it’s because the finale of a show I love was yesterday, and I got the ending that I wanted so bad, and maybe I’m just sad that I don’t really have anything as cut and dry to look forward to anymore? But that doesn’t feel like the real reason if that makes sense.

I’m usually able to keep myself happy by thinking about when my school restarts and seeing my friends again, etc. 

What should I do to make myself feel better? (The more specific the suggestion, that would be helpful :)",14May2020,1
1145,"So two weeks ago I noticed a leak above my hot water heater. Nothing crazy, but about a drop every second. Long story short, I called the emergency maintenance number and they said they'd check it out the next day. They've come back and forth looking at the leak, telling me different reasons.

Last week, they came out and said the new upstairs neighbors AC unit was causing the leak but they couldn't unclog the drain until the following day because it is below their hot water heater. (Still acting as if it wasn't a big deal). The next day, the leak had stopped and I assumed it was complete.

A week later ( today) it has just started leaking again. I called the office and left a voicemail because they are closed. Should I bother calling the emergency maintenance number again to let them know, or should I just wait and call them in the morning?",14May2020,1
1146,"I was raised by my dad, my mum left us a couple weeks after I was born. My dad has told me in the past my mums full name, and it's not a common name really so was easy to find her on facebook and I could match her pictures to the 1 picture I have of her holding me as a newborn. I never looked at her fb much cause it would often upset me to see her with her ""new family"" and she looks happy, like she never even cares about me. Anyway, so this was a while ago, I worked in Morrison's. One day I was working and a woman with 2 kids came up to me to ask something (I honestly don't remember what), it took me a second to realise who she was and when I realised, I swear my heart stopped beating. I felt hot in the face and I have no idea how I managed to get my words out. After I helped her, she thanked me and I left. The rest of the day I was in a world of my own, when I went home I looked at her facebook again and sat there and cried. I wish I spoke more to he. How can I move on from this? I feel like I think about her everyday and I don't think that's healthy",14May2020,3

1148,"So me and 3 of my best friends decided to get a house together for college. My other best friend told me she would be living somewhere else. So my 3 friends and I were looking for a 4 bedroom house together. My other friend a few months later (April time) told me she had changed her mind and wasn't gonna look elsewhere, I reminded her that I was under the impression that she was looking elsewhere. I ended up finding a 5 bedroom and asked did she want to apply with us ... We didn't end up getting it. After this we ended up getting a 4 bedroom house which meant unfortunately she could not join in the hosue with us. She has not replied to any of my messages since I text her 2 days ago and I am so worried that I have lost her for good

PS I do feel very guilty but also not either as I always am the one the one ensure everyone is happy. But I cannot shake my feeling of feeling pure shit about it and worrying that we won't be friends again

I just need advice I suppose on this whole situation all together... I hate conflict and don't know how to deal.with it",14May2020,1
1149,"This is sort of a part 2 of the post that I made yesterday.

So today I told my mom about my depression and anxiety, hoping that she would help me. I sent her a text saying that I'm really struggling with my mental health and that yesterday I was about to kill myself.

Then, she came over to my room to talk about it but I started having a panic attack. I started to unintentionally harm myself but she didn't notice, and she started to ask me why didn't I want to live, etc. Thing is, because of my anxiety I wasn't able to tell her anything, I tried to speak but nothing came out of my mouth. So then she started to like interrogate me but I wasn't able to tell her anything, I just said that I wanted to go to therapy. She told me that I won't be going unless I tell her what's happening and why I feel like this, and threatened me saying that if I didn't tell her anything, she would bring every single one of my siblings until I ""confessed"" and let me tell you, during all of this my panic attack was through the roof and I didn't know what to do or say. 

Then, she started to get mad because she came to the conclusion that I didn't want to tell her because I supposedly thought thought that she was stupid, which is a complete lie, and before she left she told me ""You don't want to tell me because you think I'm stupid, right? You're just like your grandma, always judging me"", while the only thing that I said during the entire conversation was that I really needed to go to therapy. She also tried to invalidate everything that I feel by saying ""Your siblings have suffered through so much and they never got depressed"", which made me feel terrible.

So, I don't even know what to do now since I'm afraid of how she'll react. I'm also very afraid since I haven't done any homework because of my depression. Please, I'm really desperate and don't know what to do, besides killing myself.",14May2020,2
1151,"i (20,f) know it’s a weird title and definitely very trivial, but i’ve been running weekly quizzes on zoom for my friends in which i’ve paid for the professional version so we can have longer meetings. i also write the quizzes, make a powerpoint with transitions, a separate answer sheet in case i need to give clues etc and a spotify playlist for a music round each week. i’m happy to make these quizzes as i tend to make rounds based on what’s rattling around in my head that week and i find it a bit therapeutic to write it all down in a way that also entertains my friends and gives them something to look forward to. 

my problem comes from two friends in particular who constantly talk over me, sometimes shout out the answers and generally derail the quiz during the entire thing. i have to repeat myself about five times per question (and there’s normally at least fifty questions per quiz) and sometimes they have distracted me so much i’ve slipped up and read the answer instead of the question, making me ruin my own quiz. 

during last weeks quiz they complained constantly about one particular round because there had been a vaguely similar round the week before and they were apparently tired of having rounds on this particular subject. i don’t know if i’m justified in being upset about this bit, but it just really hurt my feelings and i’ve felt down ever since. it’s a stupid thing to feel down about in the grand scheme of what’s going on at the moment, but everything just feels so heightened that it felt like a really heavy blow to my confidence and enjoyment in making these quizzes. 

this weeks quiz i’m thinking of seeing how they behave and if they keep talking over me and being rude about my quiz i want to ask everyone to mute themselves while i read out the questions and only unmute if they have a question and at the end of every round in case anything needs repeating, but i really don’t want them to think i’m trying to treat them like children or police their fun or something. WIBTA for asking them that if it all goes to shit again this week? 


TLDR: friends keep derailing a quiz i work really hard to make for them each week and i want to ask them to mute themselves next week to make it easier for me.",14May2020,1
