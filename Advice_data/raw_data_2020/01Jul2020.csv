0,"My life is weird right now, My mom and her boyfriend (Call him Tom, he was basically her husband they just never got to get married as they worked a lot) decided to move to the town that they worked in because they drove an hour and a half every day to work. She did this after my older brother graduated high school. Me and my two other non graduated brothers and she moved into a two-bedroom one-bath farmhouse with no central heating or air. We lived there while they both looked for more permanent housing. Then during the holidays (specifically the day after Thanksgiving), Tom committed suicide. This caused us all some trauma but we got through it. After the holidays my mom found a nice apartment on the near us that looked like it would still be in the same school district, we moved in, and not a week after moving in we found out it was just barely out of the school district. So we had to go to a new school that was farther away. Once school was canceled for the rest of the year my mom decided to move back to the town she grew up in which is about 20 miles away from our original town (sorry if it's a bit confusing it's hard to describe without using town names) but this still means that its another new school and new people just way closer to old friends yet so far at the same time.     


Now, this is where my dilemma is. My dad lives an hour to an hour and a half away from us in a different state. He lives with my stepmom and two half brothers along with my stepsister that is there every other week. If I moved in with my dad I would be close to the same distance away from my friends as I was before I moved. At the same time, I would be moving away from my brothers my mom and most of my family. I would be semi alone most of the time as my two half brothers are just toddlers, but I'd like to say that I'm more of a friend than a brother to my step sister. This still means new town new school and all of that.  


At my mom's it is still a new town and new school but I'm closer to old friends and my family along with having better internet. I'm not necessarily close with my brothers full brothers but they are my brothers and I'm not sure what it will be like if they are gone. Having family close is nice but at the same time I hate it because I'm used to not being with them as much as I am now.   


I am not sure why I want to live with my dad so much even with all of the negatives but I just feel like I want to. Maybe it's because I'm introverted and socially awkward but I have to decide by the end of July and I'm not sure what to do at all.",01Jul2020,1
2,"Basically like the title says, i would like to start seeing a therapist. i don’t have any friends to really vent to. i do have a boyfriend, and he’s amazing with listening but sometimes i feel like i put so much on him and he definitely has enough going on without me adding onto it. i feel like seeing a professional is all around better.
my parents basically hate me. i’m their only child that has different views to them. they’re a heavily religious, homophobic, republican household. i’m atheist, pansexual, and we do not agree on politics at all. 
i don’t think they would allow me to see one. i’m scared that if i ask, they will laugh it off and leave it at that. nothing has happened to me, why should i need therapy?  
i don’t know what to do. not to mention i feel like they would make me pay for it. they would have to drive me to the appointments because they have refused me a license for the past year. 
but i’m also scared because i don’t know if what i tell the therapist can get out to my parents because i’m underage. i don’t tell them things. i would like to keep my problems out of my parents life. 
any advice?",01Jul2020,1
3,"Let me give a quick rundown. When we needed to move, I found out my roomie doesn't have the greatest rental or financial history (he has a 3 year old bancrupcy I know nothing about). I've already spent over $200 on denied applications. He's a cool guy, but he has two kids, and expects the bills to be halved (groceries, the whole 9. I buy half of diapers for his kid even.) I feel like I've become a second parent to his kids (10 and 5), which is amazing, but a huge responsibility I didn't ask for. Not saying I don't love them, it's just a lot. Now, instead of focusing on saving money (like someone who needs to move should), he is either having friends over to party (drink, smoke, more sometimes) or going out to party. He has done this every night since Wed of last week.

How do I tell him that I need to leave, to focus on me? He helped me out in a hard time by becoming my roommate. It will probably leave him overwhelmed and short on cash. It will probably break the kids heart. And it doesn't help that he's the angry type. I've seen him throw exes things off the balcony when they get in to an arguement, etc.

I don't want to lose my friend. But I need to live my own life.",01Jul2020,1

5,"Art of deducing

“Hey guys, need a little help! 
My ex(D) used to text me while I was dating my present guy(A). What was unusual was that D would know whenever I used to get a message from A and whenever I used to text back A. It was like he knew when I was texting A and when A was texting me. And he pointed that out quite a few times to make me suspicious of how he got to know the same. Now when I asked him about how he got to know the same, he said that it was cos he is very good at the art of deduction. I didn’t give much thought about it and moved on. Now 3 months after that happened. D texted A on his work mail regarding me. And the thing is D doesn’t know A. Even I don’t mail A on that work mail. Also, when asked D told me that he had more info on A, all of which was right.
QUESTION:- Was him knowing when I was texting A cos of art of deduction or did he have my phone bugged?”
Keeping this in mind. What ways could D get in my phone? And will changing my number help?",01Jul2020,1

12,"Greetings, 

I am a Business Administration student in a notable (for Europe) university and next semester I am going to be on my third year of the four year degree.

It is the right time to slowly start figuring out what path I want to take and what kind of indurstry I am going to follow. Also I have to start thinking on what I am going to be majoring. 

The truth is that I am not sure yet. I have a big experience in the tourism industry as I have worked in various positions again and again and also did a project with Softomotive (now owned by Microsoft).

I really like many industries and I would love to have some experience in all of them. However it is quite unrealistic to expect to have a chance to get to work in every industry before you know what you want to do. 

I am aware that the final industry that I am going to follow is going to depend on the opportunity that is going to come up to me. However these opportunities depend on my current and future actions and I would be really thankful to have somebody that has passed this proccess and found something that really loves tell me how he did it, the dos and dont's, mistakes and his general experience.

Thank you for your time.",01Jul2020,1
13,"Hello I am here today to ask for some advice about being around uncomfortable family members. More specifically my grandfather. After he lost his house he moved in with my family this was around the time I was in third grade. Now I'm in high school. But in recent years I find it hard to be around him. He lives in the garage and drinks all day. He rarely ever eats. My house doesn't really have a back yard just a concrete slab with an over head and rocks. It very small but almost always that is where you will find him, sitting in a chair smoking. I find it hard to talk to him, almost every time I do talk to him he asks about my weight and hieght. I get really uncomfortable about this because I don't feel like it's his business. I'll ask why it matters but he doesn't ever answer. Like he doesn't hear it. He's a pretty stubborn person. Some day's like my on mother's birthday, I was inside doing dishes and my grandfather came in. My parents were outside along with my older sister and her boyfriend. They were just having a good time. And he started talking to me about how they are kinda crazy, and how their form of celebrating is different from what he would do. I have no idea why he felt the need to tell me that but he does almost all the time there is an event or someone comes over. He just kinda gets close and I can smell the beer breath. Over the years of living with him my view of him has changed and I feel bad saying that. When my sister and I were little he would come over and bring us popsicles. But that was so long ago, now he is rhe person who never leaves our house, who lives in the garage and drinks and smokes all day. One time I was talking with my sister and she told me something that just didn't sit right with me and made me way more uncomfortable. He definitely just says things that make people uncomfortable like there is no boundaries. But this definitely felt like something you shouldn't tell people. Our grandfather had told my sister about his fetishes he has and that he masturbated to the thought of her. It definitely made my sister very uncomfortable but she said she trys not to bring it up or things because she wants to remember the grandfather who brought us popsicles when we were little. But after hearing that it made me really uncomfortable talking to him and even being around him. Those uncomfortable questions about how much I weigh or any other body comments he would make. Even looking at him is uncomfortable for me. He necer eats so you can practically see bones when you look at his legs. He always wears short colorful shorts or boxers, and usually a bright colored tank top. This is at least in the warm season like right now. But in the past three years there has been a lot of death in my family and we are not sure how long my grandfather has left. Especially with his lifestyle. I want to try and make an effort to be around him like my sister does. Everytime she comes over she makes a point to go sit out there and have a conversation with him. Any advice on how I can deal with the uncomfortable feelings I have?",01Jul2020,1
14,Trying to decide if it’s going to be the right move. I’ve noticed that I tend to start my jobs very strong but over time my low self esteem drags me down.

19,"I had an experience about a year ago that I feel like has been bothering me for a while. It makes me feel sad that I put myself in this situation. It’s not something that I have been able to talk about with anyone, and I’m not sure that I would even want to. 

Basically, my boyfriend of 5 years broke up with me when I was around 21. The relationship was pretty bad for a while, so I just kind of pretended that I didn’t care. I had gained quite a bit of weight during my relationship and had (still have) very low self esteem. A couple of weeks after my break up I made a tinder account and started hooking up with random guys to try and feel better about myself. I only had face pictures, no body pics. I wasn’t huge or anything, just slightly overweight on top of hating having my picture taken regardless. 

There was one guy who wanted to hook up. We talked/flirted a little bit before hand. I sent a couple of nudes, I think (no face of course). He asked me to bring my vibrator. 

He was insistent that I come over during the day because he had roommates that would only be away during the day. I wasn’t exactly sure why it mattered and I said I would rather go over in the evening/night just cause it felt more normal. He said no and I obliged. I got to his apartment around noon and we went to his bedroom and I started picking out a movie. He started putting his hand on his pants. I was reluctant because I was still trying to find a movie. Then he got more aggressive and pushed my head “suck my dick”. I was immediately turned off by this honestly. But, I felt like I couldn’t leave. We continued having sex with him being super aggressive and selfish (if thats the right word to use). He finished and that was that. Afterwards, I put his hand on my vag because through text he was talking about how he was going to make me finish and to bring my vibrator etc. No surprise there, he refused. 

I ran out of his apartment crying while blocking his tinder account and phone number. I felt so gross and mad at myself for even putting myself in this situation. Everything started running through my mind that he must’ve just thought I was a “fat” girl he could take advantage of. I just feel shitty about it to this day. I obviously know that many women have been through worse, which is also why I feel bad for even being upset about this. I really just want some advice on how to forgive myself or something. I’m mad at myself for not running out of his apartment as soon as I realized he was a shitty guy.",01Jul2020,1

21,"He used to be a cool dude. 

My best and longest lasting friend. But lately Myself and the rest of my social circle haven't been inviting him to do anything with us. 

Why? 

Because every fucking conversation he has HAS to involve politics. And it's the same no nuance ben shapiro talking points. 

I've tried to invite him to discord servers and group chats. And we'll be having a nice conversation about like recipe's or games. or something we're interested in and he'll just jump in with 

""HUH HUH 13% OF THE POPULATION"" or ""This youtuber is a communist in disguise""  or ""this immigrant in this other country stabbed a bunch of people""

Nobody wants him around because this shit is constant. And it's rubbing off on his girlfriend who is also a close friend. 

AND EVEN SHE HAS MENTIONED IT'S A PROBLEM

He's even talked about how in communities he's in nobody likes him. and then hand waves it away saying ""yeah but this one dude turned out to be a pedophile so they're all just hypocrites""  

I don't know what happened to him. He never used to be this way. And whereas other people have chosen to just distance him and exclude him. I want to believe that the friend I used to know is in there somewhere. 

I think as it continues on he'll eventually learn that the problem isn't that everyone else hates him because we're indoctrinated. 

it's that he's being an asshole who has zero nuance or understanding of how to read a room",01Jul2020,1

30,"I’m here asking for how I can help my step-brother. I’m gonna give a bit of background but you can skip the first paragraph if you want. 

So my parents are split up with only two children between them, myself (17m) and Carl (15m). When we were about 12 years old or so, my mum was with a man who had a son and a daughter of his own, both raised in European countries but his son (John Bender) had just moved here. While his father lived with us so did he. Myself, Carl and John became very close because of this, lots of video games and memories. But a year after my baby sister were born, they split up, a lot of toxic patterns in a relationship were there. After this, John soon moved back to his mum because “there was nothing left for him in this country now”. Well once Covid-19 started his home was hit very hard so he got a flight back here and started living with my mum instead of his dad. 

When he first got here I introduced him to psychedelic drugs, he immediately fell in love with them. Over time his habits were soon realised to be more and more toxic, one month into staying and he still hadn’t spent a night at his dads, he started calling my mum his. But everything he ever did always felt like it was to feed his ego and his self image. Whenever he would be given out to he would either shift blame or call someone else out for doing something and not once have I ever seen him clean without being asked, even when he was it was always minimum effort. Nor have I ever seen him talk to either of his little sisters without giving out to them, one a 5 year old. 

The last two months he has become obsessed with sociopaths, even to go so far as to buy the book “Confessions of a Sociopath” which reading (especially in English) is very out of the norm for him, but we encouraged him to. After a while his behaviour started getting worse, his relationship with his mum was not being fixed, this entire time he hadn’t sent a single text to her because of some ‘incident’  and that she’s crazy. His father has PTSD as well and he seems completely oblivious to this, saying that both his parents are mentally “retarded” and that he’s destined to follow them. He started dating a 23 year old as well, and from what I can tell he lied about his age, all though he was only turning 18 in two weeks. 

 Well the other day, he came out to me telling me that he knows he’s a sociopath, I looked at him and told him I already knew. But he felt like he had to prove it and started saying that “he doesn’t give a shit if his sister dies”, that everyone in his family is mental, he used to be a ‘mini gang leader’ back home and that he’s never been able to feel the energy in the room. The thing is, I feel like after he’s learnt about sociopaths he’s been trying to mould himself into one. Saying that “we sociopaths love drugs”, that he “knows I think he’s smart” and trying to call me smart because he’s the only one “he’s never been able to manipulate” which is him trying to manipulate me IMO. 
See the way I’ve always seen John is the part of me that I am trying to work against, every action that he’s ever taken I’ve been able to completely understand why devoid of responsibility, in a way I see him as who I’d be if my ego was in control. I still love him, but I know he’s been stealing drugs off me, I’ve known for a long time but never really had enough evidence to go against his bullshit. I feel like he’s trying to turn himself into a sociopath and that yesterday was a combination of a cry for help (“it’s too late to fix me) and to feed his own image of power. 

Tl;dr step brother is trying to turn himself into a sociopath if he’s not one already, one of the most ignorant people I know but I still love him.",01Jul2020,1

Every time I see something change from my childhood to something different it makes me sad, like today we had to chop down this tree but I used to eat the berrys from it and now it’s completely gone. I also think I got into politics and other stressful things earlier than I should have.

38,"I was on the phone with my girlfriend(age 15), when I heard her say ""I want to get drunk right now."" Now, I am very much against underage drinking just because of what it can do to someones body at this age, so, I started asking her why she liked it so much and asked her to stop because her entire family have drinking problems and I don't want her to fall into that kind of life. Eventually, she hung up on me because she was angry at me. (From my POV, it was simply because I care a lot about her and was trying to advise her in the right direction.) Later, she texted me saying I should be supportive of the things she does as her boyfriend. She made the argument that she had been supportive of me doing ""bad"" things like magic mushrooms, but, magic mushrooms are actually considered the SAFEST drug. Later that night we had made up, and she was in pain because shes fairly tiny, but has very large breasts (Pain was in her neck, shoulders, and back). She made the statement that she needs a new bra (She hasnt been bra shopping in 2 years), and today she had the chance to get a new bra, or a swimsuit. She chose to get a swimsuit. I told her that I was upset because she chose to put herself in pain for the next 1.5 weeks. She told me over text, ""Please stop telling me what to do"" and ""I have it figured out"". I feel like the only reason shes mad at me is because I'm asking her to practice healthy living, but she's getting annoyed by it. I care very very much about her and her general well being.",01Jul2020,1
39,"So I've been very fortunate in my career up until now, and I've managed to accumulate enough money to place a nice down payment on a house. I'm living in NYC, and even before this whole COVID situation happened I was thinking of moving to the suburbs so I could have more space and be closer to friends, but now that's been more on my mind. 

The entire charm of NYC just isn't there anymore. The same density that made NYC a fascinating place to live is now a liability. Plus, I'm a little tired of living in a small apartment in a big city. I've been crashing with family in the suburbs and working from home, and this whole time I've been thinking about how nice it would be to have some more space and easier access to nature and a car and a basement and an office and whatnot. 

Problem is: I'm single, and I'd prefer not to stay that way forever. My dream was always to meet someone and then start a life together, part of which would involve choosing where we'd live. Now, I've got this pile of cash, an apartment in the city that's a glorified storage unit, and a burning desire to have a music studio in my basement.

41,"I work at a hotel and we have a guy, Armando, that calls regularly. He will use different names but you can always tell it is him. 

Now Armando likes young white female voices to get his kicks, if you know what I mean. Once I know it is him I typically just hang up the phone and don't answer any phone calls for the next 10 minutes. I have gotten talked to by management about it but this guy legit will call randomly once he knows I am working. He will also use my name and it creeps me out. 

Now the only time I can get this to stop is if I have a male answer the phone or an African American coworker.  I have been told to deepen my voice to get him to stop but I sound like an 8 year old, trying patheticly to make a monster voice. In other words, I haven't been able to stop this on my own.

Management knows about this but won't check into the number or get it blocked. Another local hotel has found the number and knows this guy's caller ID name is in fact Armando. 

We don't know where he lives and he does this to multiple hotels.. what freaks me out is that everytime I answer the phone I give the caller my name and my exact place of employment/location.

44,"Okay, this is probably going to be long and I am grateful for anyone reading this and giving me advice because I really need it. 
Last year I graduated high school. I wasn't quite sure what to study but especially my father wanted me to study law. I was unsure of what to do but told myself to no be influenced by my parents wishes. However, I still decided to study law and seriously I can't tell wether that was because of my fathers wish or because I thought it a good idea. So I am now in my second semester and I failed all exams in the first semester (I failed the 3 main ones, there were 2 others but they were not really related). I failed because I didn't do enough and because I just didn't get the concept. In the last month before exams I really shut down. Well, then 2nd semester started plus coronavirus and all went to hell. Online classes + extreme fear of failure to the point of just ignoring everything + social fear was not a good combination. I was too scared to take part in Zoom meetings since interacting like that terrifies me so I didn't take part in any exercises. I stopped watching the lectures and doing anything at all for uni and here I am now. Not even a month til my first exam and let's be real there is no real chance that I will pass any of them. I know it is all my fault. 
The problem is what do I do? I have no talent for law which is what adds to my frustration since I don't remember anything from the lectures which I heard at all. It doesn't stick in my head. I also don't know if I am even interested in it but I can't even tell at this point anymore. The problem is as well that the more I think of what to do with that degree (assuming I would get it haha) because I don't see myself in these fields. I am too far behind as well and I don't know what to do. My parents are very strict and they put a lot of pressure on me. But they are also paying for this and I am feeling so guilty I can't put it into words. I am a total failure and disappointment. The last month I called only a few times and evaded the topic of university while pretending to keep up which obviously was a lie. My mum knows I failed the 1st semester though. She is going to kill me at this rate. I can't sleep or think anymore because of my guilt, desperation and self hate for months but I still am not doing anything. 
So my question:
What should I do? 
Should I call my mum and come clean? And how do I do this? Should I tell her that law isn't for me? Should I try to catch up? I just don't know anything anymore",01Jul2020,1
45,"We just moved into a pretty nice new apartment, and so far it's been a lovely place to live for the most part. Our next-door neighbor is a very nice woman, let's call her Amy, who introduced herself soon after we moved in and is very pleasant to chat with.  I think she probably has some sort of developmental disorder - I don't know her medical history, but her manner of speaking and moving suggests it to me.

Amy been lovely whenever we see her in public, but in the evenings she will start screaming at the top of her lungs.  I mean like, wailing, ranting, with a level of emotion that I would associate with a mother who has just seen her child murdered in front of her.  Amy seems to live alone and I never hear other voices, so I don't think it's fighting or abuse.  I think she's either yelling at someone on the phone or is having a private rant.  We can't quite make out the words but it's clearly audible and frankly pretty disturbing.

I think we could reasonably call in a noise complaint, it's almost every evening and it's very disruptive.  But if she's struggling with mental illness, I'm not trying to get her evicted or anything.  I also don't feel super comfortable bringing it up with her.

- Physical Health
- Dating/Relationships/Sex
- Home/Apartment Maintenance
- Vehicle Maintenance
- College
- Career

The last day we were working together I spoke with someone else about it. Apparently she IS really mad at me because she thinks I’m being lazy at work and pushing off my responsibilities. None of this makes sense to me, and it’s definitely not true. Apparently she’s been talking to our supervisors about it. She even said to our other coworker that she was going to try and catch me not working to get me in trouble. 

I want to deal with this issue and confront her about it, but I’m pretty upset about the whole thing. I don’t want it to turn into an argument, but I know it needs to be addressed.

55,"Hello,

It was recently in the news that one of my high school teachers had an inappropriate relationship with a student, which I won't give details about out of consideration for her.

I've been dealing with a lot of guilt that I don't know how to resolve. When I was in his class, he treated me differently from other students in a way that I didn't realize was not OK at the time, then did at some point of getting older. My class was right before the lunch period, and multiple times he would ask me to stay after class to speak with him, and would end up keeping me through the lunch break. Sometimes it would start off with him praising some piece of writing I'd turned in (this was an English class) and sometimes it would be to talk about music/other things totally not to do with the class. He asked where my friends and I hung out, and said I reminded him of his friends in high school from the way I dressed and the things I was into. He would also sit on my desk sometimes while talking to me, and touched my bracelets and hair under the guise of ""Are these spikes allowed under the dress code? Ha ha, I won't tell,"" or ""Wow, new hair color huh?"" and things like that. Somehow none of this seemed off in my sixteen-year-old brain, and I genuinely never thought much of it other than appreciating that he seemed to think I was cool. I'm also a lesbian, which I only discovered a few years ago and didn't realize in high school, but with that, was never attracted to him. I don't know if feeling that way would have set off any red flags.

Once I got older and realized that he might have been crossing a line, I never did anything about it. Nothing had happened that would warrant me reporting anything, I thought, but I've felt shame since making this realization that's been exacerbated by this news coming out. I still feel frozen and don't know what to do, or if I need to do anything.

Thank you so much for reading, and for any advice you can offer.",01Jul2020,1
56,"I have semi recently (before lockdown) broken up with my Ex who I was with for 2 and a half years. She is the person I care most about in this world she has helped me through some really rough times and we’ve been through a lot during our time together that meant that she was closer to me than anyone ever had been before.

The reason we broke up was a culmination of some rough times for both of us mentally.
She was unsure about her decision as we love each other and mean a lot to each other but she felt like she needed to to protect both of our mental states. But she didn’t want to as she was scared it would be the wrong decision and there would be no going back and we’d lose each other.

For a while after we broke up it was like nothing had changed we still spent a lot of time together and things felt good and we stayed as close as ever if not closer. And I thought that I was dealing with it very well, that is until (being from the UK) we were placed in lockdown. Now neither of us are very good at checking our phones ,so as the weeks turned into months of not seeing her I began to feel very isolated and alone and thoughts that had clearly been buried previously began to surface and I had the realisation that I am not ok with this and am certainly not dealing with it like I thought I was(neither is she). We still love each other very much and I miss her terribly but I feel that this lockdown has stopped me talking about my feelings properly with her.

58,I just wanted some suggestions on which of the two is a better option.,01Jul2020,1
60,"I (White female, 26 y/o) am opening a new thrift store in downtown Las Vegas called Alt Rebel. I hired an artist that my family has known for 10+ years to do a mural at the front of the shop. The artist is black. I told him to do anything he liked that incorporated ""rebellion."" He decided to do a mural of Kathleen Cleaver, a member of the Black Panthers. The artwork is extraordinarily beautiful &amp; I am so happy he did it! 

So fast forward a few days, and the artist decides to reach out to a couple of local papers who then feature the artwork. The artwork gets shared on social media. 

That same day, I see a post by an old ""friend"" of mine (½ white ½ black girl mentioned in title--we have known each other for 15 years) that reads: ""It's 8:53PM on a Thursday, and yet another white woman business owner has used black imagery to promote her brand... Should I drag them? Or do I save my energy?""

I figured she was probably referencing me given that the artwork had just been posted on social media. So I thought it would be polite of me to reach out. This is how the conversation went:

me: ""Hey, I'm just wondering if you're referring to me in this post? It's okay if you are--I'd like to hear you out on it.""

her: ""I was very hurt by your post. Especially when I searched your page in the hopes of reaching out for business advice. I honestly don't want to have this conversation. I'm exhausted, and I've been doing labor for white people for the past 10+ years only to see continuous appropriation and/or flattening of blackness for consumption... by yt people for yt people--in acts of performative neoliberalism. We are all trying to be better, but I do not have the energy. Be well.""

me: ""I'm sorry you're so exhausted by this conversation--I can only imagine how redundant it must feel. However, considering how hurt I made you feel, I feel it is appropriate for me to at least explain my side of things. Dray is the artist who painted that mural. My dad has worked with him on other projects for literally 10+ years and I have always loved his art, so I reached out to him to do the piece--not because he is black, but because of my familiarity with him &amp; because I respect his work. I told him to do anything he wanted for the piece--anything that reflected ""rebellion."" That is what he chose to do. I didn't tell him to do a black person or anything related to BLM. He chose that 100% on his own accord. Considering those facts, I don't know how I could have done anything to be less hurtful to you.""

her: ""Omg. Thank you for your ""not me"" explanation""

me: ""How is that not a ""not me"" scenario when I gave the artist 100% discretion over the art? Would it be better if I only hired white artists from now on? I was just hoping if I explained myself you might feel differently considering you have known me for such a long time &amp; you know I'm not like that.""

her: ""This entire situation was you coming into my dms to feel better about yourself. You definitely wasted your time bc I already said I did not want to do the labor to educate you. Plz cashapp me n I will be happy to talk about blackness for my time. And the fact that you think that because I--a black womxn--has known you for a long time, does not excuse you from the responsibility that comes with the public display of black femme iconography. Nor does it excuse you from sporting box braids...since we bringing up me knowing you.""

As a disclaimer, when I was 20 I styled my hair in box braids because I thought they were so cool &amp; beautiful. I literally had no clue that it was offensive. I now understand that, and I would never style my hair that way again. I only had them in for a week &amp; then took them out when someone told me it was appropriation. I felt extremely ashamed &amp; embarrassed about it for literally years and apologized about it on social media. I understand that what I did was wrong, but it was done out of ignorance, not hate or desire to appropriate someone else's culture.

Anyway, I feel that she is being extremely harsh given the situation, but I also know black people are going through a lot right now, so maybe some of what she is saying is warranted. I'm just trying to figure out if I'm being a horrible person because that is definitely how she is making me feel.",01Jul2020,1
61,"Hi reddit,

I am an 18 year old male who has recently been presented with 2 big opportunities. The first one presented itself a couple months ago when I was invited to play for one of the top DIII football programs in the nation (American football just to be clear). The second opportunity is at my place of work. My managers told me that they see me having a place in management and I am currently looking at a promotion. So this is my problem, I can't do both no matter how much I want to.

If I go play football in college, I would have to quit my job and move to the university, which is several hours away. As previously mentioned, the university is a DIII school, which means they cannot give out athletic scholarships. Because of this, I would acquire nearly the full amount of my student loans, minus whatever meager grants I am given. Now I would initially be either second or third string for my position, at best, if I am not red-shirted. However, this particular football program is known for winning and is always competing for a national title, which makes me understand that many people would kill to have an opportunity like this.

Now if I choose to stick with my job and take the promotion, it would be huge for me because it means I get a $40k salary, full medical, my college education paid for, and potential for another promotion in the near future (1-2yrs). I aspire to be an attorney so saving on $200k+ of school loans would be great. However, I would only be able to go to school part time so it would take me a few years longer to graduate, probably by the time I am 28 or 29 at the latest. But  I would have no debt and have been earning good money the entire time.

I also cannot simply put in a job transfer application to a location closer to my university because in order to be eligible for the football team I have to be a full time student there and my work would not allow me to become a full time student.

I do realize that in both options neither one may play out like I would think it may or want, but I have to pretend that they will, otherwise I will remain undecided until its too late. Now my family has told me both options are opportunities of a lifetime and they will support me in any choice I make. However, I would like some more feedback before I make any decisions. I do realize this was kinda long and I sincerely thank you for taking time out of your day to help a stranger!

P.S. I graduated High school with my Associate's Degree if that is in any way relevant.",01Jul2020,1

64,"Ok so some backstory I guess. I'm 26, female and from the US and since getting together with my boyfriend, we have both gained 200lbs each in 6 years. Yes alot. We weighed ourselves on Sunday. I weighed in at 380lbs and he at 410lbs. We were both fucking horrified and appalled it was at that level. We knew we were fat but that was just completely out of our mind it was that bad.We both have blood pressure and sleeping issues in relation to our weights and he was diagnosed with diabetes this month. So yeah we need to lose the weight. The reasons I feel for our gain is probably due to Laziness,bad habits,comfort and lifestyle changes. I also feel enabling and sugarcoating from my friends and family enabled us. I can tell my mom is concerned with how much I've put on but since she's so nice she just sugercoats it and is never direct about it. I feel like hearing her true feelings about it would better serve to motivate me as the sugercoating and nice words have led to me getting this bad. How can I get her to talk to me about weight?How can I introduce it to a chat?What should I say to her?",01Jul2020,1
65,"I currently have a boyfriend and we’ve been dating for 3 weeks now. I know this is too early to decide and feel love but we’ve both said “I love you” before. However, I’m unsure if I actually do. 

I’ve been comfortable enough to lose my virginity to him and even do very intimate things which isn’t like me at all. It’s really hard to make me comfortable and he does that to the point where I can be romantic, very open, honest, and even have sex. 

Yet, when I say “I love you” it feels like I don’t mean it and most importantly, I can go days and hours without contacting him. I don’t even get mad when he doesn’t message me or call or anything. I’m not sure if this is because I hate talking on the phone, value my alone time,  gotten used to being alone because of quarantine, or if it’s because I’d like to give him space and time for him to play video games. This factor really makes me question me loving him and if this feels more like a fwb situation, but he makes me feel so different unlike any other. I’m so concerned.",01Jul2020,1

71,"My sister, 26 F has a disease that affects her behavior. She got it around 20 years old, caused lesions and scars on her brain including a plethra of other health issues. Today she was triggered by a balloon. 

She recked my house. Threw things, dumped the trash onto the floor (had dirty diapers in it too), poured cooking oil on the clean dishes, tossed my phone behind the washer, poured motor oil onto the grass, yelled at everyone in the house, &amp; punched me in the face.

This isn't the first time she's had problems. I could write a whole book about her illness. My mother is convinced that she just needs to increase her medication dosage. I asked her if my sister could be put in a home. I don't want it to come to that but for all I know she could set the house on fire while we're asleep next time she has a meltdown. My mom said that no home would take her.

She isn't severly mentally handicapped. She got the mental capacity of a 13 year old, so can function somewhat normally but does have severe anger problems at times. I don't know what advice I should be asking for. Maybe there is a program I could look into? Who do I call for help? Should I find her a hobby? Does she just need time to calm down?

73,"I got this thing that happens frequently to me and I’d love to know the much needed answer. I am not the calmest guy ever but let's say that in certain social encounters I could have been more engaged, and I wished to be so. I do not lack confidence, however there are certain times when I just feel like my brain shuts down for some reason and I feel inhibited for whatever reason. Even when I come to this state of inhibition I am fully aware of the fact that it is irrational and it results from meaningless reasons. There are also times when I give a more lively ‘performance’ in my social interactions (more talkative, focused, participating actively in the talk or chit chat with speech that launches intriguing ideas that trigger people to talk back etc) for the first hours and then my brain gradually slows down to a point where i become rather more ‘passive’ than active.

BUT, and this is where I wanna point out with my whole post. Whenever I get an external stimuli from something or someone (e.g. a person said something stupid, offended me somehow) it feels like my brain just flips the switch and I become so aware that I am determined to argue anything with anyone and become so motivated to prove that my opinion is right. I will then become more receptive and focused to any ideas or things directed towards me.

My question is, do you think it may be possible to be this active all the time and not only in the situations that I have mentioned above? It feels great and more enjoyable to just live with such higher brain activity because I feel like I am more in control of everything. I know that this all depends on your brain that releases certain chemicals that empower you with these 'abilities' lets say, so the explanation to my attitude of being more active in some situations or rather passive in others is because of brain chemistry. What is responsible for the release of these chemicals? What are they? Can I regulate myself in any way to have that flipped switch in my brain?",01Jul2020,1
74,"I have a few problems, but I wanna get to the main one at the moment. (I’m on mobile and writing this in my free time at work so sorry if it may seem all over the place.)

So recently i was discharged from the army for a medical condition that became symptomatic. I got home about February of this year and hit the ground running as best I could with my situation. I barely had the money saved up to buy my car and get some maintenance done for it. That same week i had gotten a job at a local Kroger and everything was going fine. I had to start living with my grandparents since my parents were selling the house and moving into a travel trailer. They’re really sweet most of the time, but they seem to have this weird version of me in their head as someone that’s not really me. 

I love them unconditionally, but I feel like they’re almost complete strangers. Most of the people in my life feel like complete strangers even if I’ve known them almost my whole life. I find myself constantly staying out after work just that little bit longer so I know they’re sleeping or going to sleep when i head home just so I don’t have to talk to them. There’s 4 people I don’t see as strangers in my life and only one of them is actually family. I’d go to college if i could afford it and had what I needed, and the same goes for moving out into an apartment with a roommate or by myself, but with my current job and job experience, I can’t land anything better than a cashier in retail. When I’m home I can’t even really enjoy time to myself and do what I like to do because they always want me to be at work every moment of everyday. I’ve already thought about just living in my car, but where I am, it gets too hot to do that.

78,"My husband and I just recently moved to where we live now and no one we know is able to or willing to watch/check on our cat. Everyone's busy, you get the idea. When I lived with my dad and step mom we would leave our two cats alone for about four days to visit my step mom's parents. We'd leave loads, and I mean loads, of food and water. The cats also had two large litter boxes that we cleaned before leaving and cleaned immediately after getting home. 

We've had this cat for about a month and a half. He's gotten used to us and the house, as well as using his litter box where it is and he knows where his food and water is. He's also not fixed yet, it's been difficult finding a place around where we live because of covid. Everyone is trying to catch up with their current animal patients and aren't taking any new ones yet. I'm not sure if there are kennels or boarding places like there are for dogs, but I highly doubt they'll take our cat on such short notice and considering he's not fixed. He has all his shots and all that though. 

This is my last resort and I don't like it, but I'm wondering if this is a bad idea or what. I got another extra large litter box and filled it up with litter and it's right by his normal litter box. I got him two huge dog food/water bowls and filled them up with food and water and he's gotten used to them. I'm considering leaving out large containers of food and water around his normal area. He just goes to his food when he's hungry, so I have zero worries about him gorging himself with food on the first day we're gone. 

My main concern is he'll be alone for so long. I'm not sure what other options there are considering where we're going is four hours away. Our neighbors aren't too friendly and I'm just not sure what else we can possibly do. Would this be neglectful to leave food and water out like I mentioned and like my dad has done with previous cats?",01Jul2020,1
80,First time posting here so forgive me if I break any rules. So my roommate (28f) and I (29f) have been living together for almost 2 years and have been friends for 4. Her and her mother are extremely codependent on each other which means her mother is at our apartment like 3 times a week and pre covid she would sleep over. I didn't have a problem with it at first until Shenanigans started. It seemed like every time she came over something went awry. A few examples our dustpan went missing (I'm pretty sure she accidentally threw it in the trash). No big deal we bought another one. Then when I came home from work one day the chain lock on the door was magically locked. She claims she didn't do it but my roommate knew it was her. The last straw was when she took a bunch of laxatives and sleeping pills (she's addicted to them) then fell asleep on our couch and pooped. My roommate apologized nonstop as we cleaned it up but I was fed up. Her mother helps her pay rent which she throws in her face if she doesn't do what she says but she doesn't help me pay rent so I'm beyond over it. Today her mother was here doing her laundry and I told her that her mom needs to go and if she wants her mom to do her laundry then take it to her house as I was about to start work and didn't want to be bothered. My roommate has a hard time standing up to her mom but told her to leave and she did. I kind of felt bad but it's my apartment too and she doesn't need to be here as often as she is.

My issue is that sometimes, like tonight apparently, I finally really feel my heart. It sounds crazy, I know, and it probably is. But all of a sudden I'll start crying, usually bawling and it goes from being about 1 thing to being about 100 other things... I can really truly feel a pain in my chest, although it seems more like a painful void than anything else. It's exhausting. I don't really know what I'm asking for... I guess I'm just used to bottling everything up in one way or another and although I usually feel normal everyday emotions, I block out anything really severe. For example, when I was 11 my stepmother died and I didn't cry about it at all until 5 months later after a winter concert because I realized that she would never be there for any of those, and I suddenly hated myself for saying I hated her before she died(although not to her face, it was approximately at the same time that she died...), but 5 minutes later I was fine, and I guess I'm not really sure where I'm going with this...

I tell him of course that I have no problem with it, but wanted to know if he was ok he said he would explain when he got there and oh boy did he explain. 

When he got to my house he told me that because he didn’t take some things out of his dads truck that his dad got very upset started to yell at him and call him things like “pussy”, “bitch” and “ not a man”. At this point my friend did not raise his voice at all he simple said that he apologized and tried to go get the things out of his dads car. You should know that my friend used to go to the gym A LOT before quarantine started so he is very strong, when he gets to his dads truck as soon as he tries to open the door his dad locks the truck and my friend rips the handle clean off. At this point is dad is screaming even more at him calling him those same names and says he is going to call his sister. My friend hurried back inside and apologizes for the handle and says that he will personally fix it himself and that he is sorry, but his dad isn’t having it, he gets on the phone with his sister and starts to tell her all the stuff wrong with my friend and how shit of a son he is. The sister is not having it and knows that he is pissed. My friend makes the mistake of going towards his dad and trying to get the phone so he would hang up. His dad takes a swing at him. Tells him to try again and that he isn’t afraid to hit him. All while he is still on the phone with my friends sister. My friend just goes and sits down in the chair across the room from him. At this point he is nervous and scared of his father. My friends sister hangs up on the father and then he starts screaming a little more telling him that he needs to “get the fuck out of my house you piece of shit”, he then proceeds to get up and start towards my friend who is still sitting in the chair. His father starts to choke him. My friend breaks away from him and runs to his room. He gets all of his stuff in a bag and is ready to leave in his car but when he opens back up the door his father is standing in the middle of the hallway and won’t let him pass. At this point my friend takes out his phone and starts recording just incase. As he begins recording you can hear the sheer terror in his voice practically begging him to just let him leave that he doesn’t want to be near him. My friend stops recording and goes back to his room, but since he doesn’t have a lock on his door he sits right up against the door so his dad can’t get near him. He calls his mother and sister to get home right away because his dad is acting very out of line. He sits and waits in front of his bedroom door for them to get home. Once they do his dad completely denies all physical attacks he did to him and says it’s only a small fight and it’s “how he grew up”. Both the mother and sister sided with the dad and made my friend hug and apologize to his father. After that he finally was able to leave and start to get to my house only after his mother made him tell her where he was going.

The next day (today) his mother calls him and tells him that if he doesn’t get home right away that he is never allowed back in their house and he won’t have a car anymore. His mother showed up at my house and they drove off together. She also told him that he want entirely in the wrong for the whole situation.

We haven't seen each other since graduation, but we've been talking lately and my crush on her has been amplifying a ton. It's at a point where I'm 99% sure I'm going to confess to her EVENTUALLY.

96,"Hello, everyone! I’m new to Reddit and wanted to test the waters. 

Today I had an interaction with my boyfriend that completely broke my heart and it is entirely my fault. We were in the kitchen, baking some pastries and drinking a bit. We play fight every once awhile and it’s something that has never felt ill-intentioned or negative. It never exceeds playfully hitting/nudging each other, you know? 

Well, he came up behind me and embraced me from behind so I playfully smacked his crotch. Admittedly, sometimes I don’t know my own strength. I hurt him a bit and he expressed that, so I apologized. He proceed to reach over and smack my tit from underneath, playfully, not aggressively or painfully at all. I did the same to him but I accidentally reached up to far and ended up smacking his chin. He immediately froze up, made the most fear-filled facial expression, grew stiff and quickly moved away from me. It was a clear sign of discomfort and fear. I felt horrible. Immediately I asked him what was wrong because his reaction was so fearful, negative, and heartbreaking. I never intended to hurt or scare him. He got choked up and started to frantically apologize to /me/ for reacting negatively. 

What the fuck?

Why is he apologizing to me? I’m the one who should have never laid my hands on him like that. He said that his reaction wasn’t my fault and that it was due to the abuse he endured from his mother. She lays her hands on him consistently, even now that he is an adult. As soon as he said that, I immediately realized that I had triggered him in a way that I never have before. There is no excuse for it and I am well aware that I am at fault. I apologized to him but he refused to accept/acknowledge it because he’s so fucking traumatized that he didn’t see what was wrong in MY actions.

My heart hurts so fucking much. Words cannot describe the pain the comes from the love of your life looking you in the eye with complete fear. I’m trying to understand and believe him when he says that it wasn’t my fault, and instead a result of the trauma he has endured from his mother. But as someone who has also experienced parental abuse, I simply cannot just go along with this and accept it as a small mistake on my end, let alone blame him for it the way he is asking me too. 

I’m not sure what kind of response/advice I’m searching for. All I know is that I feel so horrible for triggering my boyfriend and bringing him so much fear and discomfort. From now on, I don’t see myself play fighting with him anymore. He doesn’t deserve to relive his childhood AND current trauma. I need to be the safety and positive in his life, not a reminder/example of what he experiences at home.",01Jul2020,1
97,"I(20F) got pregnant and about 6 almost 7 weeks into the pregnancy I had a miscarriage. I told the man(M21) I loved I needed space etc. This was to figure out what I was going to do with this child. I was scared to have an abortion and needed time to think about it but I knew he would have wanted that.  I took some time to really decide for myself first. By the time I was gonna tell him I was pregnant I got blocked on everything and being my stubborn self decided I was gonna deal with the situation on my own.
I then miscarried at 6/7 weeks, it was like a double loss. Honestly, I think I was too scared to take action but I know I was not ready for a child and needed to have an abortion so it’s like fate I guess. However, I have this deep feeling of loss and emptiness and at the same time I feel relief almost like my mind has cleared completely and I feel really guilty for that too. I’m worried how I can ever talk to anyone again but most importantly I really, really, want to get rid of this feeling of guilt/loss; move on and put this miscarriage situation behind me.",01Jul2020,1

Okay, so, some background.

Me and a couple of other online friends (we're all in our teens) hang out online together and chat and have a good time. We use this site, and it's basically a site to track your reading, but there are private groups you can make on it to socialize. This has been going on for a good few months, maybe since March. Anyways, our little community is very tight knit, and we're somewhat wary of accepting new members, mostly because of the dangers of online and whatnot.

A while back, this girl (We'll call her Amy) started talking to a lot of us in some of the public groups. She seemed really nice and acted like she was our age, so soon she was friends with a lot of us. Well, we decided to start accepting her into the private groups, because she was our friend, after all. Amy was really nice to all of us and said she was a good Christian. (Not that this matters to me, I don't care what religion you are if you're religious at all, but this matters later in the story.)

However, I kind of had a bad feeling about her from the beginning. Something just seemed... off. Amy was the type of person to rant on and on about her problems. Which was completely fine, of course, because we all supported her. However, I started to find there were little discrepancies here and there in her stories. She might call someone by the wrong name, or maybe say her age was a year higher or lower than it actually was.

I kept my mouth shut for one main reason. One of my best friends on there, we'll call her Sam, was very close friends with Amy. Sam is a very big Christian, so they almost immediately bonded over that. They seemed to be very close, going to lengths where they would even change their profiles so they could give shoutouts to each other. They were both writing stories, if I remember correctly, and both of them wrote the other in as a character.

Then, Amy disappeared. I don't remember why exactly, I think her excuse was that her parents found out or something. Anyways, maybe a day after that, someone new happened to show up and started friending us all and being all goody-goody. I'm sure you can see where this is going.

This new girl soon said that she was Amy's sister. Now... I didn't really believe that, but again I kept my mouth shut. About a week later, this sister (We'll call her Emily) came on in a panic. She said that Amy was about to commit suicide. We all freaked out, of course, and tried to talk Amy down through Emily's screen. It was awful. She already seemed so far gone. Sam was having a mental breakdown this whole time because of everything.

Then, Emily decided to say a few words. It was something along the lines of, ""Oh, you're my sister! You make memes funny!"" Or something like that. That's.... not the kind of thing you say to someone suicidal. At least, not in my experience. Amy's mood completely shifted and she was suddenly all better.

Everyone cooled off for a while, until a NEW girl entered the picture. Her name was Maddie. She was only there for a few days, and then we didn't see her again. Well, there was a reason for that. Emily came back on and said that Maddie had stabbed herself, and that Alex was suicidal again because Maddie was dead. (They all seemed to know each other irl, I think Maddie was the ""cousin."") We obviously all freaked out again, including Sam. She was devastated.

Once it all blew over again and everyone was safe again, I stopped to ask some questions. Again, there were discrepancies with the ages. Plus, the parents never seemed to be around. And there was one big point that kept bothering me. Amy and Emily told me they were working on burying Maddie.

There was no police report or anything. I mean, a simple google search can tell you that you have to call the police when something like this happens. They have to pronounce the person dead and at least make sure it was a murder, for goodness sakes. So I came to Amy and I called her out. I told her I didn't believe a word of any of this, and that she was faking it all.

She told me I was wrong, but soon deleted her account after. Fast forward a couple of days, and she comes back and spills her whole life story. Maddie wasn't real. Emily wasn't real. They were both fake accounts. Her name wasn't even Amy. She just faked a death and acted suicidal for attention.

She basically told us all her sob story of how she was a foster kid and had been through mental hospitals and everything. And yes, it sucks for her. It does. I feel so bad that she went through all of that. (I'm aware that she could be lying about this too, but I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt.) However, I believe that doesn't give her an excuse for all of this. Sam is still devastated. She thought they were best friends.

Now, Amy's asking us to trust her again, after all of this stuff she put us all through. I really don't trust her anymore, not one bit. But... there's a small voice in the back of my head saying that she's been through a lot. That I should take a chance on her. That voice is calling me an asshole because she should deserve at least someone to be there for her, since she's been through so much. Everyone deserves at least someone, right?

So, what do I do in this situation?",01Jul2020,1
99,"I have a dysfunctional family, and my brother being extremely careless went out during this pandemic and got COVID-19, as a result he is stuck in his room for about a week or so more per doctors orders under the view that his illness is essentially over.   


However, he lives in the same house as us, and although I never had close contact with him for the last two weeks, just the thought that we share the same house pretty much guarantees to me that I've somehow contracted it. I feel fine at the moment and have not had symptoms in the last week or so. I was very insistent that we get tests done to see who's contracted the virus, and who to put away in quarantine or to send to the hospital. However, my mother stated that since his illness is nearly over as the doctor stated, and since we haven't had ANY symptoms at all, that I should be put away in my room for 10 days or so. My mother also stated that its more likely, I'll catch COVID at the actual test site than at home.  


This seems really unnecessary, and I feel that getting a test would be key to figuring out if I have the virus or not, or to spend nearly two weeks in my room.   


Should I get tested? Or should I remain in my room for two weeks until my brothers case has passed?

TLDR: My brother caught COVID-19 in a household of 7, his doctor told him to remain quarantined for 2 weeks since his illness is ""over"".

Im going into my 3rd year uni, we're both 20 this year.

Ive been helping her look into post secondary options for like ~5-6months. Emailing advisors for more info, taking her to open houses (b4 covid), and looking into bursaries with her...classes she could take in the summer just to taste a little of university/post secondary. She seemed receptive and asked to go to another open house since she cant drive,i take her.

There has been a tipping point where I now dont really want to associate myself with her. I know thinking about the future may feel suffocating for some but when i ask about the things she said she wanted to do (practice driving with one of our mutual friends, setting up advisor appointments, looking into programs since idk her interests/strengths/weaknesses as theyre very different from mine,looking for another job) she just doesnt do any of them.

Is it messed up i now want to distance myself a little? I may have come to a realization that i want my friends with some ambition, not a lot is needed... Heck, i dont have that much compared to some of my other friends.. but a friend who is investing into their future, someone i can grow with.

118,"Hey everyone! This is gonna be a long post because the advice needed is due to a story spanning 4 years... I'm gonna try for a TL;DR at the bottom. 

I am 21M.

So this story needs some backstory. A story within a story, if you will. 

There's this girl, let's call her Etain (there's a reference there). We met a little over 3 years ago (we were both 17), and almost immediately had a strong connection. Just in case she or someone she knows has a Reddit, I'm going to leave out some details. Basically, we saw each other once a week and everyone in the same class knew that these two spots on the couch were our spots. Even if one of us was running late, no one took our seats. We didn't claim them, didn't tell people not to sit there, and we didn't have assigned seating. It just somehow became a known fact that we always sit next to each other. We had the same sense of humor, and we definitely flirted with each other during the length of the class In the year and a half that followed, we discussed our feelings and had kissed a couple times. It just wasn't the right time for us, neither of us were ready. 

Cut to a 1.5 years later, I went into a relationship with a toxic woman for 2 years and wasn't allowed to speak to anyone. I broke that off and reconnected with Etain. First time seeing each other in years, we picked up right where we left off. Joking, flirting, laughing, and having deep conversations. We connect on all levels; religion, politics, rights, humor, and family history. Cut to a couple weeks later, we hang out at my place. It was an amazing night. We get dinner to go, watch a movie, and then we kissed again. She left later that night and kissed me goodbye. Cut to a couple months later. We hang out again, and just have so much fun. Cut to a couple days ago. We hang out yet again, and it was easily the best date(?) I've ever had. We both just turned 21 so I ask her out for dinner and drinks. I drive 2hrs to go see her, and for the 5hrs we hung out, the longest we didn't make each other laugh was 5 minutes. We had dinner, we drove around with no destination, we did some adventures, and were on the same page that we both thought of the same absolutely random joke at the same time on multiple occasions. I finally felt like I could be myself and just be stupid and have fun. I asked her ""What color do you think of when you think of me?"" Without hesitation, her answer was ""Red. Because I think of everything you do and red makes me think of passion."" She asked me what I thought of, and I said ""Yellow. Because I think of sunflowers, sunshine, summertime, and happiness."" She made a joke ""HA that's funny, because I'm a depressed b\*tch. Or maybe you don't see that side because I'm happy around you."" Then My response was ""Or maybe I think of yellow because you make me happy.""

My feelings for her have been growing for weeks at this point (they never stopped from near 4 years ago). I decide on the drive up that I'm going to tell her how I feel. But at dinner, I find out she's talking to someone. But I still need to get it off my chest. So at the end of the night, I tell her ""I know you're talking to someone, but I need to tell you how I feel so that you know where I'm coming from. I like you. A lot, and I've liked you for a long time. I know you're talking to someone so I'd never come between that, I just wanted to make you aware.""   
She told me that she's thankful that I told her, and that we can't deny that we've always had a super strong connection; but life has taken us to two different places. That we shouldn't change our relationship right now, but that we should wait and see what the future holds.   
I agree with her 100%. I didn't tell her this because I didn't want to pressure her, but I want to wait for her. I want to improve myself to become the kind of man she deserves.   
I normally see heartbreak I go through as ""Stepping stones that teach me lessons to prepare myself for The One"". But for the first time ever, with this what I felt was ""I feel taht all the other things that happened to me and will happen to me... those lessons are getting me ready for **her**"". I've never had the continuous thought of ""I will wait for this woman.""  
Overall, I want her to be happy. Even though I'm not what's providing that happiness right now, I'm hurt but at peace because *she's happy.*   
I'm really, truly head over heels in love. 

Here's where I need the advice. 

How do I let her know I'm here waiting for her without disrespecting her, the guy she's talking to, or her relationship?   
How do I give respectful distance to that, while not giving up on hope? 

TL;DR: This girl and I have had feelings for years, and it's never been the right time. I finally told her how I feel again (this time recently) and I was too late. I truly believe she's the one, and I'm not the ""Fairy Tale"" type of guy.

121,"Over the past several months I've had about eight different in-person/final interviews and I've been rejected for all of them. The process is extremely stressful for me, and I want to stop feeling stressed, but I don't know how.

The process always goes like this:

1. Apply for jobs. 

2. Take calls from recruiters (not too stressful) 

3. Do a phone interview (moderately stressful) 

4. Get scheduled for a final interview. 

5. Stress about the final interview for the days leading up to it, being unable to focus on anything else. (Very stressful) 

6. Study and practice for the interview, and worry about all the ways it could go wrong. (Very stressful) 

6. Do the final interview and experience a brief wave a relief when it's over. 

7. Get a rejection letter, feel absolutely devastated, and cry for a bit.

8. Repeat

How can I stop feeling so stressed and emotional about this process? I wish I could just feel normal when I have an interview coming up. I wish I could just feel a little disappointed when I get rejected, instead of feeling devastated. I also wish I could stop wasting time fantasizing about what it would be like if I got an offer, because fantasizing just makes it harder to accept it when I get rejected.

122,"Alright, so before I begin, let me just say I'm a male (17 years old) and this dude I was talking to was 21. I'm straight, he's bisexual.

Anyways, me and this dude were cool with each other for about 5 months. 1 month into talking with each other, he wanted pictures of me shirtless (to pleasure himself, I would later find out), and I said no. I assumed it was a slip-up, nothing more. 4 months later, after we were becoming close friends, he asked me again (this time though, he was trying to convince me I wasn't straight). I asked him why he needed it, and needless to say I hated that. I blocked him from all social media, but he was desperate to be my friend. He would do anything to make it up. 

Now, I know you may be thinking: ""Are you crazy for wanting to talk to him?"". You may take it that way, but I've been thinking about giving him one last chance (the 3-strike system). Me and him had common interests and we used to go to the same school. We ended up in a GC with his friends, also around here (and a few my age too). I want all of thaf back, but I will warn him: he has one opportunity not to fuck this up. The block was meant to sent him a mesaage.

Anyways, should I do it?",01Jul2020,1

124,"Hello. This is obviously a throw away account. I am from Florida.

Sorry this is a sensitive topic but I don’t know what to do. 

I broke up with my ex and he asked me to come over to talk to him. 
I thought we were going to have a conversation and he started getting touchy feely.

I turned to leave, and he grabbed me from behind, and I’ll spare you the rest of the details.

I tried filing a police report and they seemed understanding at first but then kept saying they would get back to me, and I didn’t hear anything. I kept calling and trying to reach out, but still heard nothing...and in the meantime my ex actually left town and disappeared.

Four months later a detective called me and said I had no case, I shouldn’t of gone over there and he didn’t break any laws because I didn’t try to leave so I have nothing. It was written in the report that I tried to leave and was restrained.

The detective explained how he did not make me get in my car and did not make me drive over to his house, so I wanted it and they’re not going to move forward. (ie: dropping it) Then said if I have any concerns I can reach out to the supervisor.

I tried to call the detective’s supervisor, and the detective would pick up the receiver before it went to voicemail and then hang up (I could hear it pick up and slam down), this happened five times. Tried a different number and I would get transferred back to the same line to the same result several more times.

I don’t know what to do and I don’t know why they are behaving like this.

Please give me some advice for the next steps, because I am shocked and at a loss that this is happening and I don’t know what to do about it.",01Jul2020,1

I’m just going to caveat here and say that I work in the arts and I felt posting a picture similar to showing one of my pieces in the way that I’m not sharing it to show off but I just want people to see if that makes sense. People that follow me on the insta would know me as a humble, quiet guy that keeps himself to himself but also not afraid to poke fun at himself.

But I’ve been worried for sometime now how it would come across. I’m afraid that it will come across as arrogant and braggy, although in many ways I suppose it is a humble brag.

133,"Three years ago, I was violently raped as a freshman in my high school’s locker room. My rapist happened to be a black man. After that experience with rape, I was dealing with the most severe trauma a person could ever experience. Not only was I inflicting self harm upon myself and attempting suicide, but my attitude changed for the worst. 

I thought making racist jokes was the funniest shit in the world. I would constantly throw around the N word (both hard R and wit the a) like it meant nothing. I would use my Twitter to call out singers (for some clarification I was apart of music stan twitter) like Normani (a black pop singer) “Normonkey” as a means to be petty and edgy.  Before I was raped by someone who happened to be black, I would consider myself at the time a very “woke” individual. But after the instance, I began to say horrible jokes about black people as a fucked up coping mechanism to deal with my own trauma. 

Now, I don’t say any of the things I used to say. Thanks to so many hours of trauma-based therapy and educating myself on race issues, I have not said anything offensive about race in forever. I have educated myself about the current plight of racial issues and tension perpetuated by the police force, gentrification, and so on. I have donated so much money various black organizations specifically centered around black trans women and those affected by police brutality. In short, I guess I’m worked than I used to be. 

That being said, I feel like a horrible and disgusting person for the things I said years ago. I know that person who I am now and I’ve been able to educate myself, heal from the trauma, and hold myself accountable unless I say and slip something offensive. But the past keeps making me define my current self. I know deep in my heart that I don’t hold any animosity or prejudice to anyone regardless of their skin color. But I still feel like a fucking terrible person. I don’t want the past to define me. I know that I am educating myself and focusing all efforts on bettering the world while educating those about racism. Am I a horrible person still? Or is it okay to grow from a horrible thing and try to do better?",01Jul2020,1
134,"So, my bestfriend since college has been a godsend - absolute best bestfriend to have. Unfortunately - he isn't the best with his dating life. Truthfully neither of us are and he actually stepped in more than once to keep me from continuing my own really doomed relationship a while back - which is partially why I feel I need to step in when I think he's doing the same thing.  His current girlfriend - call her Alice - has a toddler, some hefty emotional baggage and has caused drama in our friend group more than once. She's also dumped him three times since January.  The first two months of their relationship started with him cheating on his last girlfriend with her (I was totally unaware and if I had known I'd have tried to put a stop to it then).  Now today, I got a text from him saying that he and Alice are now engaged. I wanted to congratulate him but it just feels super not like a good idea and I'm really worried about him doing this. I tried to talk to him about it but she was in the room so I didn't want to say anything that could create a problem. I don't know how to go about this, I'm afraid that if I don't stay in my lane on this that I could lose my bestfriend and no longer be able to support him ---but on the other hand if I don't try to talk him out of this I'm scared for what that will mean for him.

How should I try to handle this? Should I just leave it alone and hope it sorts itself out? Is that even morally appropriate? What can I do?

136,"Hi everyone! I’ll try to make this as short as possible. 
I (31F) recently moved from out of state to live with my single father (63). I came here in March and only planned to be here for one year while I work, go back to school, and then move into my own place. When covid hit, my state shut down. This was less than two weeks within moving here and my job offer was withdrawn. My dad still works and part of his job is managing covid prevention at his work. 

Since I was sent to boarding school at 13, I haven’t actually lived with my father since then. We would really only see each other twice a year for a family vacation and then the holidays. We would normally talk on the phone once a week for about an hour. We generally had a good relationship, but living with him now reminds me of why I have kept him at a distance since I left college.

My dad is from another country whose culture holds some sort of old ideas about gender roles. You know, women stay home, cook and clean for the men- are always working in service to the men. Not that I think there’s anything wrong with that as long as its what they actually want, but my father tried to project a lot of these ideas on me from a young age. 

Since I grew up in the United States and spent almost all of my school years in a communal setting, I’ve come to be pretty independent in my daily life. I tend to be a bit of an introvert and I highly value my alone time. Right now while “staying home” I have been super focused on personal development and building habits that support my health. This is where we are beginning to clash. 

I do a lot at home for my dad, since he is still working and I am not right now. I am very grateful to be able to live here rent-free and to have an opportunity to finish my degree and break free from low-paying jobs, and to be able to spend some time with him. 

That being said... he has a lot of patterns and behaviors that make things extremely stressful for me. He is very clingy. When I first got here he was constantly asking me to rub his back, or adjust him as if I were a chiropractor (I am not,
I am an out of work photographer).There was also an issue of physical touch, like we would be sitting on the sofa and he’d just put is feet on my lap and be like “hey can you rub my feet? Just a little bit, come on!”- I really despise uninvited physical contact. Now he asks maybe once a day. I want to be kind and polite but this was getting to be too much and after a lot of just saying no, he finally stopped asking all the time and just asks (maybe) once a day.

I do all the cooking and cleaning at home right now. He works less than a mile away and comes home for lunch every day. He expects me to make a big meal for him. I used to, but now since I’ve been focusing on my health, I eat at different times and leave Tupperware containers full of food that I make on the weekends for his lunch. He refuses to eat this most of the time and gets mad at me that I don’t want to custom make some big lunch every day- which I can’t even participate in. He will call me from work like every two hours. He calls me to tell me he’s on his way home, he will stay on the phone until he gets home, and then he wants me to be in the same room with him every waking moment that hes at home. 

This is extremely exhausting and stressful for me. I feel like I am parenting my own father (and I’m realizing that I loved boarding school so much because this is exactly what I had been doing when I was like 12). He is super needy and if I’m not in the main room watching tv with him, he will call for me like every 30 minutes just to ask me what I’m doing.

It’s also really hard too because anytime I express how I feel about things, he makes it about him and completely misses the point. Just tonight he put a tortilla (mind you, the last tortilla that I was reserving for my lunch tomorrow) into the toaster and almost started a fire. I could smell it burning and asked him what it was. He was just like “ohhhh.. I put a tortilla in the toaster”. I’m like... “the last tortilla? You know that was for my lunch tomorrow?” He just sort of shrugged and didn’t even bother to get up and check on it. What hurts me the most is that he didn’t even acknowledge that he had taken something from me and he didn’t apologize. I also asked him not to put weird things like that into the toasted because it could easily cause a fire. He acted like he didn’t even hear me. He can’t handle the slightest bit on constructive criticism and I’m pretty sure he sees nothing wrong with his behavior. 

This is something he does often- and anytime I ask for an apology he explodes and minimizes my experience. He just has these horrible manners that literally only my brother and I are capable of putting up with. The rest of the family just keeps him at arms length and sympathizes with us.

Ok- sorry this is long and I really hope it makes sense. Don’t get me wrong, I love my dad and he’s done a lot for me. But in that doing a lot (sending me off to school) I’m just not the affectionate and doting daughter that he wants me to be. Sometimes I just want to be left alone without him taking it personally!

139,"Ever since before the lockdown started my future sister in law (23F) has been staying at mine (24F) and  my partner's (27F) appartment with us. It was fine at first because as far as we knew she'd be staying for a week tops and then leaving back to uni. Of course then lockdown hit and she's been stuck here with nowhere to go ever since. This wouldn't be so bad but she's currently sleeping in the living room, despite the fact that we have a spare bedroom that she could sleep in, meaning that we can't stay up past a certain time before we get kicked out of her 'bedroom' because she needs sleep and can't go in there in the mornings at risk of disturbing her. On top of this every time it's brought up that we might want her to move into the spare bedroom, she complains about how even if she does move in there, she wants to do so under condition that she can still choose to sleep on the sofa if she wants to.

Of course given the circumstances it's not like she can actually go anywhere, but this is becoming very stressful for me personally. She's very controlling and borderline childish (won't let me and GF watch certain things on TV because she doesn't like them, sulks if we watch things we like on youtube, outright objects to other things, badgers people into doing things/playing video games when all they want to do is relax, etc...). I have anxiety, depression and am autistic and her constant sulking and demands are driving my entire body into overload on a daily basis. I practically have a physical reaction to being in the house now.

It feels kind of silly to be asking, but I really just dont know how to handle her anymore, especially knowing that I have another six months of her living here. Nothing I try seems to work. Any recommendations people have would be absolutely great.",01Jul2020,1

She tells me it's mt fault her job doesn't get done (child welfare), yells at me for three hours for one small mistake (forgetting to take trash out, having an anxiety attack over my sexual abuser). Blames me for my abusive ex friends. Yells at me for talking to her about my issues, but then yells at me for ""lying"" when I don't tell her. She made me do her job for her today and hit the dog with a pen because it was itching itself.

She called me a retard and started yelling at me because I couldn't hear her and wasn't strong enough to move an object.

Yelled at me for rushing her when I was literally feeding the animals?

She has me do everything for her, which isn't a problem but she expects me to be available 24/7 then yells at me for ""following her like a stray"". Then calls me a disappointment for not having hobbies or friends when she doesn't let me go anywhere. 

She yells at me for depression and talking about how my ex step dad was abusive and how his actions ultimately led to me meeting my rapist.

I told her that I was molested as a child and needed therapy, she told me no because she didn't want dhs involved. I told her i was self harming and needed therapy, she denied it and yelled at me.

She yelled at me for being gay and when she found out that I had a girlfriend she threatened to beat me.(more about lying about not having one, i was 14)

 I couldn't hear her talking to me as I was asleep, she kicked my door open and started screaming at me because the cat meowed twice. She's done this multiple times. My cat is WITH ME most of the time.

I realized today when I hear her stomping in the house I freeze and have panic attacks. She guilt trips me for leaving a room and tells me to only pay attention to her. When I mention that makes me uncomfortable, she tells me to grow up.

I don't know what to do, I have so much pent up anger and confusion. I can't even leave because I don't have anywhere to go, or even a fucking car. No way for bus or uber because I'm in a tiny town in the buttfuck of nowhere. 

I realize I've made horrible mistakes, but I keep trying to correct them. I'm in no means perfect, but I don't understand? 

Is this abuse, if so, what can I do to get the fuck away from it? How do I move out without ending up homeless?

145,"My husband and I have been planning to move for a while. It's a little difficult for us since neither of us drives. But my mother had agreed to help us as long as we were moving closer to her and assured us that my brother would help too. My mother and brother live in different cities in the same state while my husband, son, and I  live in a completely different state entirely. Despite tentatively agreeing to move closer to my mother, my husband was hesitant about completely uprooting our lives since his job does pay him pretty well despite how terrible it is in other ways. Still, we were looking at places in the area and contacting the ones we had narrowed down to. The thing is, I was the only one filling out applications for apartments, not my husband. And I couldn't get any places to contact me again because I'm not the one with a job. My husband did apply for jobs though, just not apartments. Anyway, about two weeks ago, my mother called and offered to look at the places we had narrowed down to. She asked for the list but then didn't even respond to me about it specifically when I sent her the list. That same day, she called me, angry/frustrated that, according to her, we weren't doing anything to show that we wanted to move. I tried to explain to her that I had filled out applications but hadn't gotten any responses and that I had done as she had asked in giving her the list of places we had narrowed down to. Then she was mad at me for our moving date not giving her enough time to get things together. But since we hadn't heard back from anyone, our move in date was tentative at best at that point. She said she wanted a solid date, which I do understand because she and my brother would both have to take time off to help. But I thought I had given her plenty of time since I told her the potential move in date several months ago. But there was a massive miscommunication over that on both sides somehow. She continued to get aggressive and pushy, which caused a lot of tension between my husband and me and caused a few arguments. I was still trying my best to get ahold of places. But kept getting no responses from any of them. My husband still had not filled out any applications at that point. Between me trying to explain to my husband that I needed him to fill out applications too and my mother getting more aggressive with me as if I was being a defiant child again, I snapped under the pressure. I texted my mom because I couldn't call her in my condition. I told her that while I was thankful for her help thusfar, we were no longer moving closer to her because I just couldn't see how we could pull it off at the moment. She called me a little while later and then proceeded to tell me that she saw this coming. She also told me that the reason she was getting so aggressive is because my brother had told her he was willing to pay for the whole thing. But neither of them had told my husband or me about that, despite having the opportunity to do so. I asked her why she didn't tell tell me about my brother offering to help in such a big way. She told me she didn't have to tell me that part then declared herself a terrible person in a biting tone (not a remorseful one) and hung up on me. I immediately texted my brother, thanking him for his generosity and filling him in on our plans falling through. He never responded.

This has been getting on my nerves lately and I’m trying to debate whether I should not speak to him until he breaks up with her or continue speaking to him deep down I really don’t want to speak to him because it’s just like first off I’m like a big secret second If you can’t have a social life because your girl wants to be selfish don’t speak or hang out with me at all .

148,"Throwaway because I don't want this on my main account.

I'm currently taking a summer class online and there is another student who responds to my original posts rude and condescendingly. This student almost always replies to my original posts this way, but they are not rude towards anyone else in the class. 

The first time this happened, they responded ""if you get an A on this, then I am getting ripped off"" before changing it to sound more professional. For this assignment, they pointed out that one of the statements I made on my assignment was pointless and sarcastically replied ""No Way"".

So I’m writing this this for my gf since she doesn’t know how to use reddit.

My gf (18F) lives on her own and works 2 jobs: in the morning she’s a cashier/barista at a coffee shop, and in the evening she’s an office secretary. She has worked 30ish hours a week at both places for a couple months now, and both bosses are aware of her other position. Yesterday, a shift manager at the coffee shop approached her and warned her that her morning shifts were about to get drastically cut. Apparently the GM/Owner told the shift manager that he had to give those morning shifts to his son because he wants to teach his son hard work. Since gf is the newest employee by a factor of years, and because his son can only work mornings for some reason, she was the only one whose shifts were taken away. As a result, she’s going to go from having 4-5 shifts a week at the coffee shop to at most 2. Even though this is her second job, this is a devastating loss of income for her, especially because she lost 2 months of income due to Covid (she filed for unemployment but never saw a dime). She reached out to the Owner via text and asked if this is in fact the situation, and he replied saying that she’s doing great so far, but he’s going to use his son in the morning to “maximize efficiency” because he feels like he can be harder on him (which sounds like admitting to nepotism to me, gf is way more qualified and son has never had a job before). He said that she’s more than welcome to work closing shifts, but she can’t do that because of her other job, and he knows this. Thanks to Covid work is few and far between, so just quitting and finding another job isn’t a great option. 

What should she do now? Any advice on how to approach the boss? He’s otherwise a generally nice guy. ",01Jul2020,1

She was also in a toxic relationship, and after months of telling her to unfollow her ex and to cut him out of her life, and her complaining and not doing anything, I cut her off. 

I wrote a whole article on AITA where you can gain some more insight on her and why I ultimately cut her off.

Now, it has been quite a couple months into the COVID pandemic and I don't see her at all. However, I have found a twitter account associated with her. She has about a 2,000+ twitter following and I found a lot of tweets directed towards me. A lot of them include her twisting stories that happened between us, to make it seem like I'm the bad guy. She has also taken screenshots from my personal twitter and has posted it for her followers to see and hating on me. 

Should I confront her about the tweets? Or should I ignore it?

162,"Hello, for about 3 years my family (sibling included) have been my biggest problem as they have been the main source of my depression, anorexia, and anxiety. Before I lost weight my parents and sibling would always make fun of me calling me fat telling me to lose weight, etc. After I lost weight I realized I lost my period for a few months, and I knowing that I had no intercourse recently knew that I wasn’t pregnant. So I searched it up and found out it was from undereating (&lt;800 kcal daily) so my friends helped me start recovering and I slowly starting eating normally and gained back my weight but of course my parents and sibling started telling me I was fat again hence why I got anorexia. And i tried telling them I had a problem and they simply turned a blind eye and pretended nothibg was there. Next thing is through their words (ure fat) and why can’t you be more like you’re sister and why are you rude? Where is the little girl we knew before? Etc. I nearly killed myself and none of them knew because I didn’t want them to feel guilty even when I fully know it’s their fault for me doing that. In addition to that most of the time my anxiety reaches high levels to the point where I couldn’t sleep despite the fact I was so sleepy because of my angered thoughts towards them and everything that they’ve done to me and that I’ve held all my emotions in so my parents and sibling don’t have to feel guilty yet I get nothing but hate in return. I even tried confronting my mom I had depression and I ask for a psychiatrist and she turned it on her self saying “if you don’t fix the problem I’m leaving you”

164,"Hey guys—thankful for this community and those in it. I decided a while ago to be better, and have made massive improvements in my life including health and wellness. However, my one problem that I still need to fix is one that I’m sure many deal with: a social media addiction. I’ll take any advice I can get. 

I started using Instagram solely to attract women—and after two years of being active on the app and posting high value content—it has worked. I wasn’t having much luck with attraction in person, so I figured I’d use the “wormhole” of Instagram to showcase my most desirable aspects. The amount of options in dating for me has gone way up.  However, I have become so invested in the app because of it. It is interfering with my productivity and I have noticed that I’ve become quite dependent on the likes and comments. I actually don’t even post that much, but when I do I always get massive engagement. People always tell me I’m “the goat” and put me on a pedestal because the nature of my job allows for really cool content. If I quit Instagram, my dating life will literally spiral downhill because I put so much into my account. I feel like part of my identity is tied to the app. My feed is really really well done—and I don’t say this as a brag, but rather to communicate my feeling of loss if I left it. I never intended for it to be a source validation—but that’s exactly what it’s become. I’ve tried getting off before, but I always end up back on the app. I don’t know what to do at this point. Any advice?",01Jul2020,1

166,"So, this is about my girlfriend.

She (18f) is stuck in a shitty home situation (overbearing parents that border on straight up emotionally abusive often, lesbian in a very conservative household, etc). She has a HS diploma and a pretty good GPA, but can only afford college with financial assistance from her parents, and they will only pay for schools close by so she still has to live with them. She has saved up a couple hundred bucks but nothing major. 

So, her goal right now is to move out, get independent, and then apply to colleges once she's on her own (and qualifies for more financial assistance). She hopes to move out of her current state.   


I wanted to ask about a few things:  
a) What jobs to apply will maximize income while not requiring a college degree?   
b) Any tips on moving out, moving across states with little income, getting out of situations like this, etc.   
c) Any tips about saving money in general, ways to earn money from home (it's been very hard for her find a job with COVID stuff going on, especially considering her dad is high-risk).

While there she happened to run into her manipulative abusive ex (let’s call him DB) and to make a long story short somehow convinced her to get back together and live with him. 
Since this has happened it is alike she has been held captive by this evil DB. He doesn’t allow her to have a phone, he doesn’t allow her to leave the house for anything other than work, and he only allows her to contact her parents under his supervision on speakerphone. We have attempted to make contact with her to which DB answered on her account calling himself her “fiancé” and texting stuff like straight out of a Steven king movie such as “she’s doing fine and looking to improve herself, and she won’t be getting her phone back ever so don’t bother trying to contact her.” I forget the term of when someone who’s abused is “hooked” on their captor but that’s what she’s got. 
She’s attempted to leave a few times only to return after DB threatened to kill himself. And a few times her parents have drove down to Texas to attempt to rescue her only to be berated by DBs parents (which I assume he lives with) to basically piss off. (What a cluster of a trash of a family.) at this point we have very little ways of contacting her other than hearing updates from her parents and we need to get her away from DB for good.

I've never been a people person. I was always shy, quiet, kept everything to myself ( you know the classic kid this days) but when i got to highschool i decided to change that i started to getting friends and meeting new people and that's when i met her.  
In the start of my second year of highschool i wanted to get a girlfriend or atleast a very good close female friend for the first time. So there was a girl in my class that kinda desperted my interest (Let's refer to her as Karen) so i decided to atleast try and talk to her. We became super close and i ended falling hard for her, but when i told her i liked her i got the friendzone card. And here enters (David) my best friend who was also friend's with karen and the one that intruduced us both. They we also super close and he also ended up falling for her, and also got shut down.  
Even tho our roads took us to the same place we ended up taking different paths. I cound't take no for an answer and ended up hurting her and using people to try and get something working, i even tried to burn him to get a better chance (Needless to say that didn't work) I just kept forcing it and forcing it until she couldn't take it anymore and we ended up stop talking to each other. By this point you probably think i am a terrible piece of shit, and i got to agree. I tried to force something instead of moving on and preserving the friendship i had. I ended ruining my relationship with almost all my friends my family  had to repeat a year in highschool never got any good grades so had a real hard time getting into college and even ended up with a depression. (Not trying to make myself look like a victim just stacting the truth) I've never agreed with us stopped talking but i always respected her decision.  
Fast forward 3 years, Karen after 3 years of not speaking a word a msg anything, we would see each other on the street sometimes and we would ignore each other, decided she wanted to try again, she wanted to see if we could try to be friends again. At first i wasn't to keen on the idea but i ended up trying. In all that time all i could think of was of better myself. I ended highschool a year later got into college in a place were no one though i could go i've had jobs while studying i made peace with almost 100% of my friends even David who i tried to burn for my own good, i spent all those 3 years bettering myself, i wound't stop until i made up for all the shit i did when i was younger, but i could't forget about her. I always tough that i made peace with it, moved on. I mean we stopped talking for 3 god damn years it was natural but... as it turns out David and Karen started dating today, and i can't stop thinking that if wasn't so stupid maybe that would be me. I changed so much but i can't just forget about her. His (David) is someone that's stuck in life. He can't finish college because he doesn't have motivation or will , we are going to be 22 this year and he still acts like a god damn kid all the time and he still thinks like a kid when talking about life choices and what to do with life, and yet. I've finished college in the degree i dreamed i got one of my dream jobs i still try 2 better myself in every aspect every day and yet.... If i could trade it all i would.

I have the ability to get into some amazing schools across the country, but my mom won’t let me. I need to figure out a way to get there. I’ve considered emancipation, but the process is very messy and I don’t think I’d be able to do it before I turn 18 (I really want to qualify as independent when I go to college so I won’t have to ask my mom for anything). I honestly can’t stay in this house any longer. Please let me know what I should do",01Jul2020,1
195,"Hey, I’m 17. Sorry if this sounds super dumb. Let me preface this by saying I’m not one of those annoying girls that considers herself “different than other girls.” I am well aware that I am like other girls and I am fine with it. 

The problem is, I’m like, fiercely competitive, and it makes me hate all other girls my age or around my age. I am okay with any woman 30+ because I don’t see them as a “threat” to me. 

It’s making my whole life so much more negative than I want it to be. It’s weird because I never considered myself to be insecure. I think I’m relatively attractive, fit, and happy. 

For example, I’m going into the marines so I train with the other future marines every week. In terms of fitness level, I dominate over the other girls. We have a fitness leaderboard hung up on the office wall and I am on the top of every category for females. I should not feel threatened by them. I still hate them. I don’t know why. They are kind to me and good people. 

I feel this insane inner competition with every girl I see whether they are a stranger or a friend. It drives me absolutely mad. I hate to see other girls succeed. I KNOW and I TELL MYSELF every day that another girls success, beauty, fitness level, whatever, does NOT take away from my own success, beauty, fitness, etc. But no matter how many times I tell myself my brain just won’t believe it. It’s like I’m fighting for a spot on a throne that doesn’t even exist. 

It’s weird because I am actually friends with those girls and I like them a lot and we have a lot of fun IN THE MOMENT. but then later on in the day when I’m not directly communicating with them I get this like inner hatred for them for NO REASON because I get this weird tight feeling in my throat thinking that they are going to steal my “position” as like the “best female” which I know I am not. 

When I see a guy succeed I am happy for him, genuinely. When I see a girl succeed, I feel like I’ve been punched in the gut. I can’t control this feeling. 

I wish I could have girl friends who I love and that don’t make me feel so weird and upset. I know this is my problem and it has nothing to do with them. I wish I had girls to talk to and be friends with and have girl talk but it’s so hard because I have this stupid inner struggle. :( what can I do to stop seeing other girls as “threats” to me.",01Jul2020,1
196,"Whenever I try to learn something new, I refuse to move on until I completely understand it and it often takes me a very long time to do so. For example, if I'm given a formula, I get stuck trying to wrap my head around why it works. I know how and when to use the formula, but the moment I try to apply it to something, I won't accept the answer I get until I fully understand how that formula was used to develop that answer.

To give a more specific example; I remember when I first learned multiplying negatives, I was taught that when you multiply a negative number by a positive or vice versa, the resulting number would be a negative. Everyone in my class took that and answered the practice questions using what they learned, but I got stuck figuring out why. Like why is that the case, how does that even work, etc... Looking back it should have been very simple to understand but I think I spent way too long trying to grasp it.

This applies to everything I do and it becomes irritating when I just can't wrap my head around it. It makes me feel very stupid at times, especially when everyone else has already moved on to other things. The lecturer would talk about the next topic, and I'd be missing out on new information because I'm still stuck processing what they said 10 minutes earlier.

Does anyone else have this issue? Is this what it means to be a slow learner? And is there anything I can do to speed up my learning process?",01Jul2020,1

So i was gonna fight the guy but she told me not to and that she was gonna handle it, so i left it alone. Then he ends up in our gym class and he's trying to get touchy with her and so when i start to walk over he leaves and then i talk to her about it and she said she was still handling it. Then one night she told me that he keeps texting her. I asked her if she blocked him and she just avoided the question.

 So i started staying near her in gym class so he wouldn't come bother her but whenever i wasn't around he would always harass her. I told her to call me over whenever hr bothered her she said she would but then she never did. Then i told her to tell a teacher about it but she never did.

200,"My coworkers are a married couple. The wife is half Cuban, half Puerto Rican and her husband is full Puerto Rican. They invited me over to their apartment for dinner this Saturday night and the husband said they’re having ribs and Puerto Rican food, his words over the phone was “you’re gonna eat like a true Puerto Rican!” which is what makes me think it’s food from their culture. I’m assuming their 11 year old daughter will also be there.

To be truthful, I’ve never eaten Puerto Rican food before so I’m excited.

The dinner is kind of a celebration for their family and to thank me for giving them a car I have that I no longer have need of (that they need). While I know all that, I feel like it’d be inappropriate to show up empty handed and I’d like at least to bring something. I was thinking maybe alcohol like wine, but I’m not sure since they have a child who will probably be present. Maybe wine and another non-alcoholic drink so it’d be less appropriate? And if a wine or other alcohol, what kind?

I know the wife pretty well from work. She’s fun to talk to and we joke and tease each other and the husband is cool too. But I only know them from work so this is kind of the first time meeting with them outside of work.

I’m a single guy, by the way, in case that matters. They told me to bring my SO, whoever he/she might be, but they didn’t know I’m single until they told me this.

209," 

This is my first time doing this, and before hand i must say i am not an english native speaker so my writing can be a bit difficult to understand.

I've never been a people person. I was always shy, quiet, kept everything to myself ( you know the classic kid this days) but when i got to highschool i decided to change that i started to getting friends and meeting new people and that's when i met her.In the start of my second year of highschool i wanted to get a girlfriend or atleast a very good close female friend for the first time. So there was a girl in my class that kinda desperted my interest (Let's refer to her as Karen) so i decided to atleast try and talk to her. We became super close and i ended falling hard for her, but when i told her i liked her i got the friendzone card. And here enters (David) my best friend who was also friend's with karen and the one that intreduced us both.

They we also super close and he also ended up falling for her, and also got shut down.Even tho our roads took us to the same place we ended up taking different paths. I cound't take no for an answer and ended up hurting her and using people to try and get something working, i even tried to burn him to get a better chance (Needless to say that didn't work) I just kept forcing it and forcing it until she couldn't take it anymore and we ended up stop talking to each other. By this point you probably think i am a terrible piece of shit, and i got to agree. I tried to force something instead of moving on and preserving the friendship i had.

I ended ruining my relationship with almost all my friends my family had to repeat a year in highschool never got any good grades so had a real hard time getting into college and even ended up with a depression. (Not trying to make myself look like a victim just stacting the truth) I've never agreed with us stopped talking but i always respected her decision.

Fast forward 3 years, Karen after 3 years of not speaking a word a msg anything, we would see each other on the street sometimes and we would ignore each other, decided she wanted to try again, she wanted to see if we could try to be friends again. At first i wasn't to keen on the idea but i ended up trying. In all that time all i could think of was of better myself. I ended highschool a year later got into college in a place were no one though i could go i've had jobs while studying i made peace with almost 100% of my friends even David who i tried to burn for my own good, i spent all those 3 years bettering myself, i wound't stop until i made up for all the shit i did when i was younger, but i could't forget about her. I always tough that i made peace with it, moved on. I mean we stopped talking for 3 god damn years it was natural but... as it turns out David and Karen started dating today, and i can't stop thinking that if wasn't so stupid maybe that would be me. I changed so much but i can't just forget about her.

He (David) is someone that's stuck in life. He can't finish college because he doesn't have motivation or will , we are going to be 22 this year and he still acts like a god damn kid all the time and he still thinks like a kid when talking about life choices and what to do with life, and yet. I've finished college in the degree i dreamed i got one of my dream jobs i still try 2 better myself in every aspect every day and yet.... If i could trade it all i would. I've never felt something so strong for anyone. Ik i am young and that i'll know lot's of newer people along the way but.. I've been in love with the same person for almost 7years now, and i don't know what else to do. They are my best friends i am happy about them but at the same time i always get sick thinking about it. What should i do? Should i give up? Should i stop talking to the both of them?

Hi, I (f 22) just celebrated my birthday and I’m in counseling for my childhood trauma. We talked about how awkward my birthday is. Well it comes down to the lack attention, kindness, and love I didn’t have growing up. This teacher was the first person who I felt didn’t hate me. All the homes I had been in were abusive and so I moved around a lot. I felt alone and hated by everyone until I met her. She was kind to me. I didn’t have friends and I would eat lunch with her.

I’m going to college rn and I just finished my junior year and have nothing figured out and I’m still struggling to find a plan that I can stick to. I don’t have a job and I have no job experience. My dumb ass still doesn’t even have my license even though I know how to drive. My dad would take me around teaching me what I should or shouldn’t do while I had my drivers permit and I never made a driving test appointment (I never made one because I never knew when my parents would be free to take me, they both work and I felt bad taking them away from their work cuz they use they’re paid time off to go on vacations with us). 

My parents are great but can feel judgmental. They said they would support me financially as long as I’m going to school but as soon as I start to mention that I don’t wanna go to school anymore, their attitude changes almost entirely. I feel like they look down on me cuz my sister just graduated from college and my little brother wants to go to a good college and I want to drop out. Whenever I mention wanting to do art and how much I like tattooing, they always give the advice that I should keep that as I side hobby. I don’t want to put a bad name on my parents because my mom has been putting a little effort in understanding but I just don’t know what I’m going to do. 

I pretty much have no experience when it come to anything as an adult.....like make a bank account, how paying off credit cards work, how to get good credit. (I realize The whole bank account think would probably come with getting a job) pretty much all I’ve done throughout my whole life is go to school and I’m tired of going to useless classes that barely interest me. 

School has always been pretty easy for me, I could usually pass the class even with putting in minimal effort but the lack of interest I have  along with how these classes work (memorize things for a test and I’ll probably forget it in about a month) has left me not having any motivation to put in any effort in my classes. 

I don’t even like telling my parents how I feel around my older brother and sister because every time I do they think I’m being immature or make me feel like I’m being irrational or like I shouldn’t be scared even though I remember my older brother going through the same thing a couple years ago. 

School also gets less and less appealing when I see that my sister graduated from a university a year ago and still has nothing to come from it. 

I don’t want to disappoint my parents but I also don’t want to be disappointed in myself from what my life will become. I wanna do what I’m passionate about but I want my parents approval. I want to make enough money to support a family but I have no idea how.

216,"Mid-teens, living with parents. 

I should preface this by saying that I'm currently in a very safe and healthy situation. I don't do anything to get in trouble (other than than small stuff like forgetting to do chores), nobody mistreats me, etc. The chances of my being forced to leave home are small.  

But about a year ago, I realized I'm bisexual. My friends and one of my parents know and are very accepting. The rest of my immediate family don't know and are anti-LGBT. The parent who doesn't know told my family that he would definitely mind if myself or one of siblings were gay. I don't *think* he would kick me out, but there's a small chance that he would if he found out unexpectedly. There's also a chance that my situation would change significantly if I were to be outed.

So this brings me to my question. Should I prepare for the possibility of having to leave home in a hurry? I have a few hundred dollars in cash (from birthdays and gifts) that I could grab in a hurry and enough to buy a meal in my phone case. Should I hide any of it? Should I research potential places to go in my area? Once school starts, I'll have a backpack packed with supplies like a toothbrush, deodorant, bandaids, phone charger, change of clothes, water bottle, etc (all are things that I normally have in my backpack for school, I'm always overprepared )

But I don't know if I'm being overly paranoid. I've had a few slip-ups (following an LGBTQ account on Instagram, for example) but I've been able to pass them all off as being an ally. If my family did find out, they'd be shocked and upset, but most likely would not make me leave. My supportive parent would almost certainly step in to help in bad scenarios anyways.

219,"I have strong feelings for a good friend who's been there for me in really hard times. She has a boyfriend of about 9 months. The guy is nice, but I make up reasons to think he's a creep. He's not. (Probably--I'm not really in an objective position to tell.) I assume jealousy makes me instinctively dislike him. 

I got out of a relationship recently that went on about half a year; it wasn't a good fit, for a lot of reasons. I cared about my friend before it started; I repressed it for a while; but after the breakup, the feelings surged back. People tell me they'll fade again. But I don't want them to. 

I've been infatuated before, two times. Both took years to resolve completely. When I latch on, I latch on hard. I think I'm anxious-preoccupied. It's so painful knowing, that everything I feel, is just insecurity.

I hate rejection. I expect it. I dread it. 

Even if my friend did leave her partner, given the baggage I carry, I doubt she'd ever be with me.

I have been in therapy for so many years. I've tried so hard to change. I am so lonely and isolated.

I want someone to trust me, but I know the hard way that intimacy takes years to build. 

I want someone to love me, but I know that my personality and behavior pushes people away. 

I tell myself I love my friend. I know it's just me craving to be in love, with anyone. 

I know the standard procedure; when I'm problematic, I'm supposed to cut ties with the other person. Give them the space to be free and healthy, and give myself the space to move on and heal. Except I never heal. The hole covers over, but it's always there. 

The self-pity is so toxic. I'm so depressed. This is a down moment; usually I'm doing better. I get ghosted on dating apps as soon as the other person realizes I'm graduating late because I fell behind. I put myself out there, but the market knows I'm damaged.

221,"Hey everyone,

Sorry if I come across as a whiny little teenager, but these are issues I've dealt with for a few years and have had no one to talk about them to.

My parents have always pushed me towards success, and I've done good in school for my entire career. My older brother was valedictorian, and my older sister was in honor society. My siblings are all far smarter than me, even my younger ones for my age, but my parents still push me as if I'm them, not me. 

When I bring this up to them they tell me ""We're only pushing you for success"" which I would care about if they ever pushed for me to be successful in any of my personal hobbies, sports, relationships, or trials. 

A recent issue is my parents putting timers on my computer. Which I didn't have a problem with initially, until online school started and they limited my time to 4 hours a day. I got out of the year with straight passes (our school went pass fail) but as soon as quarenteen started up they limited my time to 3 hours a day. This is especially annoying for me because I only have 1 irl friend atm, my other 2 close ones are online. They have helped me with my personal life far more than my real life friends or my parents. 

Is especially annoying because all of my hobbies are digital recently. Digital art, animation, video editing, and some light programming. And over the years I've purchased a lot of the tools I use myself. Like my Kamvas 13 Drawing tablet, or my second monitor, or tons of cables and adapters. But when I offer to pay then for the laptop they partially gave me, they decline. And they scold me for only having digital hobbies. 

Like, alright. I'm sorry that no one in my damn family has ever taken interest into anything I care about, so I found others via the internet to further my passion, and I feel more comfortable talking to random people on reddit about my issues and emotions than anyone in my family or personal life. 

Then being strict has not molded me into a good person. It's taught me how to lie to make them happy when I fail, how to hide my emotions, and how to live seperated from my family. I feel like my family and I are roommates. Not a family. 

The most aggravating part is that whenever I bring these things up to my dad, he punishes me. And whenever I bring them up to my mom, she gets offended and turns the tables calling me ungrateful for the things she provides, like food, shelter and clothing.

I can't be the only one who feels like this? Right?? Just because a parent provides necessities doesn't mean they can flake on the relationship side of being a parent. Anyone have any advice? 

I'm sorry if I come across as a brat, or ungrateful, it's just difficult for me to talk about emotions or things like that cause I've never really done that with anyone.",01Jul2020,1
222,"I am an 18 year old girl, I've  been dating for more than a year now (he's 18 too), but my parents never accepted it because my boyfriend is an atheist and they are christians.

They are religious for a lot of time and I grew up in an evangelical church, but a couple of weeks ago I decided I wanted out of it and follow another path, know other stuff and become who I really am and who I am happy being.

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to my parents about wanting to go out of church... It was a tough and complicated talk for me, and they put it very clearly how I was frustrating and destroying them with my decisions, and how much they were disappointed with me. They also blamed my boyfriend, saying he had influenced me to do it, when in reality it was something I wanted to do (and did) to myself and for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

It didn't stop there... My mother decided to talk to me and asked me if I were still a virgin (I wasn't a virgin anymore, I lost my virginity with my actual boyfriend and I don't regret it, it was good for me).

At first, my mother's reaction was peacefull, but hell broke lose when she told my father. She said he wouldn't be mad, she promissed me.

When mt father went to speak with me he started crying while opening a bible in which talked about women who had lost their virginity before marriage, and in it they were called prostitutes. He looked at me and said that is what I am, a prostitute, a sinner, and that if he had the opportunity he would take  all my stuff and kick me out of the house. He started screaming that if I had the maturity to fuck and my boyfriend the same, he should provide for me. He said he's desire was to throw all of my things at my boyfriend's house...

He said he will never be able to look at me and trust me again anymore, and that it is up to me now, that every step I take towards my boyfriend and my relationship I would be moving away from him, ""the person that had raised me and done everything to see me smile"".

I felt so humiliated, so dirty and down, I was getting screamed and treated so badly that I couldn't  say anything, I felt so tiny and powerless.

While all of this happened my mother just kept looking in silence, letting it all happen.

When he left me alone I had a mental breakdown, and I have depression, anxiety and self harm problems, and all of that makes it extremely hard to deal with things, specially this, so I really freaked out and got desperate. So, my mother, who promissed me he wouldn't do that, came to me, pointed at me and told me I better not throw a fit, because if I was able to do adult stuff I should deal with it as an adult.

I don't know what to do now. I hurts me a lot to see my parents sad and destroyed with me, even after this, it hurts me to see them like this... But they hurt me a lot, a lot... I've never felt so humiliated, so small as he made me feel, I've never felt so bad. I wanted to take all my pills and die.

But I still think he's my fahter and I don't want to leave him...

I really don't know what to do, and how to deal with this.",01Jul2020,1

He just replied with a simple ""oh"" before he received them. After she sent the nudes to my friend, her dad texts my friend on the girls number saying that he's going to call the cops on him.

The girl was 17 btw. That's why my friend, an 18 year old, is super worried. The girl also lives three hours away from him. I calmed down my friend by telling him that she's in the wrong for being on a dating app while seventeen. Most dating apps require you to be 18 or older. 

My friend told me that there's no indication that the nudes are hers because it doesn't include her face...so yeah. I have a feeling that this is one of those blackmailing tricks that catfishes use to get money but ""her dad"" hasn't made any mention about money.

225,"TW: depression and suicide

Im 20 and have been suffering from severe depression and anxiety and constant suicidal thoughts for over 4 years and have been on medication and had therapy for these issues. Recently i've reached a really dark place after feeling I've tried everything to improve and nothing will work. 

After speaking to my Psychiatrist, he strongly suggested a specific private hospital that I have heard positive things about and think will be beneficial to my mental health. However this place costs $1000 a night and I would need to stay at least a week. 

I'm currently unemployed and am not receiving any form of income as I have just completed university so I do not have the funds to afford this but my parents say they want to pay for it by switching to a private health care insurance plan that would cover the majority of the costs. I feel guilty allowing them to do this as I fear it wont be worth it if this doesn't work and I'm worried my family will come into financial troubles due to the current state of the economy. Should I allow them to pay for this or should I not go and try looking for another solution for my issues?

231,"Sorry for the long post.

TLDR: Mentally abusive and manipulative mother refuses to do anything to help herself, keeps dragging me into bad situations, and has pawned all of her animals off on me. How do I get out? 

&amp;#x200B;

 My mom, who has a long history of drug use (which she has refused to admit to me despite me seeing it myself), just got kicked out of her house after knowing for at least 6 months that it was going to happen, if not a year. She was mentally abusive, manipulative, and downright disrespectful in every way which is why I moved out in the first place. It had gotten to the point where she was taking my keys to my car and leaving with no warning, making me late to work on a daily basis. Now that she's been kicked out the animals that she had (3 cats and a Medium-Large dog) have nowhere to go. Before she got kicked out my wife and I offered to take one of her cats to my house to give it a place to stay while she figures things out. As that short time passed she still had not gotten a job (she's been unemployed for 3 years. I paid most of the bills while she lied to me about the costs without me knowing), looked for a place to stay, figured out arrangements for her animals, or made any attempt to stay in her home. She kept one of the cats with her while she was in her car with nowhere to go, asked the neighbors to take care of the dog, and just left the last cat on the street outside the house. I felt bad for the cat (I've lived with all of these animals for years prior to my moving out) so I went over there and picked her up, despite definitely not wanting more animals in my small apartment in which I already have 2 small dogs of my own.

   The next day (she ended up crashing on a friend's couch, whose house she is still at now) she told me that the neighbors decided they didn't want the dog there and were threatening to take it to the animal shelter if she didn't go get it right then. After she kept laying it on thick and guilt tripping me, I offered to take him in for a very short period of time as long as she came back asap to get him (which she claimed she would be back to get him the next day) since I didn't want him getting sent off to a pound. As far as how the animals are behaving: The first cat that I offered to take is absolutely lovely, she is welcome to stay as long as she wants. The second cat is awful. She is clearly very stressed and having separation anxiety from leaving my mom and her home. She's being very defensive against both of my dogs, hisses and swats at the first cat constantly, and howls all night long. We've had to start keeping the first cat in our room at night with the door closed just to make sure they don't get into a fight, which of course makes her howl even louder. Then there's the dog. Once we got him home, he got a really good bath since he was absolutely filthy. We tried to introduce him to our dogs, one of which he was totally fine with. He was growling and glaring at our very small chihuahua puppy. Then when I tried to get him to lie down on a blanket I had set for him he started peeing everywhere. I ended up having to lock him in the bathroom all night, which I feel awful about doing.

  Now I'm in a situation where my mother has pawned all but one of her animals (the last cat is 100% not welcome here since he isn't neutered) off on me. I don't have the time, or space, to deal with all of them for much longer. This morning she, without asking me, attempted to rent a car in my name (her license is suspended) and asked me to sign off on it without giving me a choice on the matter. I told her that I wasn't comfortable putting my name on her rental car and she got upset claiming how much she's done for me and how I should be helping her. She's also been trying to guilt trip me into putting my name on a lease, which I know she won't end up paying. 

The whole situation regarding my mother is very hard to put into words on a single Reddit post. The trouble that she has caused goes back years beyond what she has caused for my wife and I just this week. I want to get away from her as much as possible and be free from her dragging me down. I've considered getting the animals new homes, knowing for a fact that they'll all be happier with almost anyone else. How do I get out of her grasp without making the situation worse for us? I'm happy to clarify any details or give more info if it helps, I can go on for hours but there's only so much time in a day!",01Jul2020,1

I felt bad for her and then asked her to make me a list of her dating requirements so I could show it to my boyfriend and see if he had any friends who met that criteria. And her list was actually not much different from stuff that you‘d see on most girl’s  lists. That is until the last three......

Here are her requirements:

\-Honest

\-Has a good job

\-Respectful

\-open to equality (I.e., letting her pay for dinner when she wants to)

\-Faithful

\-Can’t be any older than 30 (she is 26)

\-sense of humor

\-Athletic

\-Must be taller than her (she is 4’11)

\-Looks that are made for Hollywood

\-Can’t have too many past relationships

\-She loves men who are highly ranked in their professions. For example, if he was in the army than he‘d must be a Captain, Sargent, Liutenent, or et.cetra.

257,"Alright, this just happened an hour ago so I'm still mad so sorry for any errors

So today me a couple buddies and that 'friend' from the title decided to play overwatch to kill time.We kept playing til it was fairly late at night and my dad came into my room to tell me to shut up.

My friend decided it would be funny to provoke me during custom games to get me to shout and for my dad to come and yell at me (creative I know)So I end up loosing at him after he disses me and talking sh!t at me and my dad comes in.

I quickly mute my mic and leave and he goes ""HAHA I made her rage quit""

After I heard that I didn't even know what to say so I stayed quiet and reflected on everything he's done to me.He has talked sh!t about everyone in family including calling my mum a pornstar.He has stole my ideas and jokes and plays them off as his own and receives praise for it whilst he looks at me with a sh!t eating grin.He spread lies about me so now a few ppl in my school have off feelings about me, he slapped me and has made everyone in my friend group cry.

He seems like absolute douche to most but everyone seems to gravitate towards him, he's everyone's best friend.

I dont even know what to do I cant even hit him cause' he knows a bunch of athlete's and to top it off he's told me to kill myself more than ten time's for no reason and calls me gay, queer and every other colour of the rainbow.

So reddit, how do I shut him out of my life for good so I can live without being told to jump down a cliff?",01Jul2020,1

261,"I'll just keep it short because it's extremely messy.

Basically I reconnected with a friend who had a kid (A) and me and her have been texting for 4 months daily. She's 21 and I'll be 21 in 30 minutes. This entire sequence of events caused me to cancel my plans for my 21st.

We went and hung out for the first time after 4 months of texting and drank at a friend's (B) house. They haven't seen each other in years, but this friend I've seen recently multiple times and given rides to. This night was okay, and although A constantly interrupted me, I chalked it up to her being excited for finally getting out of the house. Okay, whatever. A few days later, about 3 and a half weeks ago, me and A go to B's house again. B is a depressed alcoholic (21, female) and was talking about how she hit 3 parked cars drunk and drove off (has no license from a DUI), A laughs. Should have left there. 

B is blacked out completely and suddenly takes off her shirt and bra and jumps and lays on me while I'm sitting on the couch. Mind you I'm not sexually attracted to B, and in size I am 165 pounds and she has 40+ pounds on me. A laughs as this happens. B gets angry drunk and says she wants to hit someone. She's volatile and has called me drunk saying she's going to commit suicide and at this point I engage in a playfight with her. Mind you that although I don't take blame for the first incident, this incident I do for engaging in a playfight with a blackout drunk person, although I didn't know she was blackout drunk until the next day. 

In this ""playfight"" she cranks it to 10 and hits me for real a fuckload of times. There's video, and I'm saying ""leg kicks, leg kicks"" aka ""stop punching my arms"" and ""stop headhunting"" aka don't punch me in the face. I'm intoxicated at this point. I tell her we're just wrestling and to not strike and ""round 2"" after some playful wrestling she continues to punch me full force and goes for my head, I realize she's not going to stop so I take her to the ground and apply a triangle choke to her and she ""taps"", ending the playfight. I'm so stressed from both incidents I get black-out drunk for the first time in my life, and I get ubered home and wake up with 20+ bruises on my arms and torso. They are all from her.

So I'm in a ton of physical pain but also traumatized from the first incident. I saw her breasts and felt them against me. I kept replaying it in my head, her across the living room stripping, sprinting at me, jumping and laying on me while everyone laughs. I tell A a few days later that B's actions made me feel uncomfortable. B says she's sorry and she loves me. About a week after the incident I'm still processing trauma and am still in pain, I realize I have a sprained arm and the bruises are all over and dark, one still here almost a month later that at the time was dark purple, the size of an orange on my left arm. I'm stuck inside my own head so I tell A that I felt sexually violated by B's actions and in the subsequent playfight felt that she hit me too hard and I was upset about that. Within 5 minutes, I get a text from B saying ""What the fuck is your problem?"".

Throughout the past month this has been drawn out and has been wearing on me, but A tells lots of people ""her side"" and I confide in a few friends about B jumping on me half naked and laying on me. A tells me that I was not sexually assaulted, and says ""it's the same thing as a guy running at me with his shirt off"", calls me ""delusional"", says I'm ""seeking attention"", and says things like ""why didn't you push her off"" (I froze), ""if you're so smart why didn't you do anything"", ""you have a victim mentality"", ""you need professional help"" etc. etc. She also says that I'm to blame for her hitting me as hard as she could because ""YOU said you wanted to fight"" (why would I actually fistfight a drunk girl? This is her actual reasoning), even though in the video it's clear I'm being playful and she is taking things too far - she says I should have done something like hit her back or ""stop it"" which is difficult when people are recording and laughing, and I'm in a position where I'm confused that someone is hitting me as hard as they can when I want to playfully grapple. Although I did engage in playfighting with her, I don't think it is okay for her to have hit me as hard as she did as many times as she did after I repeatedly told her not to, I shoulder some responsibility for engaging in this period but you don't hit someone 40+ pounds lighter than you full force in a playfight, period. If it were a guy, I would have hit him back.

She says I wasn't sexually assaulted and that it was mt fault I got hurt and has been telling a lot of people about the event, when I simply tried to confide in her that Ifelt I was sexually assaulted and physically violated. So basically I lost most of my friends over this, my 21st plans for tomorrow are in the gutter and I'm stuck in my head, debating if I'm a bad person simply seeking attention. I don't sleep, my dog died 10 days after in my arms and I relapsed, I think about killing myself more frequently and I've not spoken to anyone for days.

I really need an unbiased answer on this... I turn 21 in 10 minutes and I can't focus on that or celebrate because I'm stuck in my head. I don't trust anyone else, but I also don't trust myself; I feel like a piece of shit. My heart is pounding.

Thanks.",01Jul2020,1
263,So I’m not sure if anyone has any insight on this type of situation but I used some very very small nails to hang up some rope lights on my wooden balcony for my apartment. In my lease agreement it explicity says that I cannot use nails or glue to hang things inside or outside. I’ve used very small nails to hang up pictures inside my apartment and the lights outside. Not really concerned about the inside stuff but if they find out about how i hung up my outdoor lights does anyone know how much I would be charged for that? If you take the hooks out you can only see the holes if you are staring straight at them or are looking for them. Thanks!,01Jul2020,1
264,"A friend of mine I used to work with, let's call them ""Blondie"" is a pretty cool person. They have great taste in music, they have a solid sense of humor, and are all around a solid human being. But one of their friends, who I will refer to as ""Dagwood"", is an absolute dickhead who crossed a LOT of lines ""fortehlolz"". Those particular lines aren't major for most people, but they were significant enough for me to see them as disrespectful, inconsiderate, and out of line.

Blondie and I only worked together for a little while, but we would chat here and there and found out we had a lot of similar interests, and I enjoyed spending time with them on our shifts. Blondie left, but we remain friends on Facebook, which is where Dagwood comes in.

Dagwood originally added me after I made a few jokes on one of Blondie's pics that Dagwood was in. For a while, it was fine, just ""hey, we both know Blondie, we also kinda like the same things, that's cool"", so I was fine with adding Dagwood even though I'd never met them.

Then one day Dagwood crossed quite a few lines. This may seem minor and petty, but the specific and deliberate method in which it was done makes it a dealbreaker for me. Dagwood and I used to be part of a Facebook group dedicated to memes that are pro-wrestling themed and ""low-effort"". Around the time Avengers: Endgame came out, there was an unofficial moratorium on spoilers for it. The group also had a hardline rule about memes involving Chris Benoit, a wrestler infamous for murdering his wife and son before killing himself, for obvious reasons.

One day, not long after the release of the movie, Dagwood posts spoilers for Endgame using an image of Benoit as the background. They were booted quickly after, but enough people had seen it for it to spoil the film, including myself. Dagwood played it off as ""look at these idiots getting worked up about something that doesn't matter, it's a comic book movie and they're getting so upset, how hilarious.""

Eventually, the group booted their other accounts (apparently also dedicated to trolling), and Dagwood posted on their own personal page something along the lines of ""Don't spoil WrestleMania XX for me, I haven't seen it yet"", an event which saw Benoit win in the headline match, another move I found indecent and unnecessary. It's one thing to not want spoilers for a movie or event that happened over a decade ago (although I'm fairly sure Dagwood wouldn't have been spoiled) simply because you hadn't seen it and you wanted to be somewhat surprised. In my opinion, it's another matter entirely to deliberately spoil something literally millions of people had been anticipating for years using a meme that's utterly insensitive to anyone with any sense of decency just because you think it's funny. (I later left that same group after I was bullied for hours over my opinion about something, including being told to kill myself. The mods said it wasn't their job to ""police every post"", but they kicked Dagwood almost immediately for their offense. Priorities!)

I told Dagwood to fuck themselves and blocked them. I even told Blondie why, they didn't reply, but I figured I should at least tell them what happened. Blondie and Dagwood are still friends today and I completely understand. I wasn't expecting to sway Blondie's opinion at all. They've known each other longer than I've known Blondie, they have much more in common with each other, and there are a lot of other factors I don't know about their friendship.

But from what I've seen of Dagwood, they're willing to do incredibly insensitive and needless things just to amuse themselves. And that's something I have no tolerance for anymore. Maybe in middle school or high school, but not when I'm a legal adult.

And here's where I'm stuck. Blondie's a solid person, at least as far as I know, and it's not my place to judge who they are by who they associate with. But they're also friends with someone I don't think I can forgive for being a deliberate asshole and crossing truly insensitive lines for their own amusement. And I don't know if this was a one-time thing or a pattern of behavior for Dagwood, but this instance alone seemed sufficient to me to judge their character.

I know this is a petty thing in the grand scheme, but it's something I want to at least come to terms with. Should I forgive Dagwood for being an asshole, even if they're genuinely insensitive and would happily ruin people's enjoyment because they think it's funny, and just accept that's who they are if I still want to be friends with Blondie? Should I disconnect with Blondie simply for being friends with an asshole because I don't want to ever meet Dagwood in person? What should I do? How do I accept all of these things at the same time?

TLDR: How do I reconcile the fact that a person I consider a friend is long-time friends with someone I only know as an asshole who crossed lines I consider unforgivable for their own amusement?",01Jul2020,1
266,Okay so I met this girl through tinder and we’ve been chatting slowly but surely. She constantly sends videos of her day just like random stuff (idk how to reply to it) she sends snaps saying I look “cute” says stuff like “hey daddy or hey bae” and has sent me a pic of her covering her tits and I didn’t even ask. We FaceTimed last night for an hour she was really upset when I told her I had to go and she kept apologizing and just seemed really insecure. Anyway she’s pretty cute she has some emotional issues tho like daddy issues her father left her very young and she seems to have depression. I’m 90% sure she likes me how should I approach this? Should I FaceTime her and ask her out on a date? Then what should we do? But I don’t want to get in a serious relationship because 2 months from now I move out of state for school. I’m just really on the fence any advice would be helpful. On whether you think she likes me or what I should do to ask her out or even if I should. Thanks :),01Jul2020,1

273,"Is my mom just over protective or this crazy behavior??

Reposting this bc I didn't wanna be too specific ..

So my mom is very strict to say the least. Shes a single mother and my dad passed away years ago. To understand my mom, shes very protective of her kids and she basically doesn't have things of her own. We moved states a few yrs ago she never attempted to make friends here and she doesn't work rn, and when I tell her to go out she says she doesn't wanna go places and waste money. Which I get, bc we do struggle sometimes but we're stable enough to afford going out once a month.

So now, I don't want to go so far into detail but she has a lot of strong cultural/religious beliefs. (Guess which one lol) Backstory on me and my mom, we've fought a lot as she found out I was dating another girl and she was crazy abt it, basically always looking through my phone, blocking her number, not letting me go anywhere. It was a lot, but I got through it and now I'm 20 and things are slightly better for me bc I just work a lot and am very school focused so I'm just busy most of the time. Still, when I do go out now she doesn't really have a say bc I try to not listen but she doesn't let me out late and not like 4am late, like not even past 11pm. And a few months back, I went out of state to visit my friend and my bf (who she also doesnt let me see and I have to sneak around so much to see him) and it was so hard for me to go my older sister who's married and doesn't live here got involved to force my mom to let me go, and my mom called my friend who stayed with continuously and like .. I'm 20. Anyways what made me write this post, i have a brother (16m) and I'm worried abt him. Tonight at 9pm my brother said he was gonna go skateboarding w some friends and be home by 12am. This sent my mom to go crazy, she thinks him thinking he can be out of the house after 10 was crazy and he hardly goes as it is bc she doesn't let him, and my mom started screaming that this was crazy, and she made a gc with my sister and I to discuss him. And she's been continuously asking me to check his location and texting him where he is and what' he's doing. And my sister is usually on my moms side, and Sometimes i understand and I know shes worried abt covid which is valid but this is a all the time thing.

I think I'm kind of mentally vulnerable at the moment and I'm trying to not let bad influences influence me but I still manage to absorb these things I don't want to just because of how my brain works? I could use some advice on not letting certain things get to me. An example would be seeing someone with an awful political take on an innocent social media post and taking it in rather than ignoring it like I used to be able to. I don't agree with it, in my mind I'll infer that the person is kind of a loser (because maybe I had a similar take when I was a huge loser), yet it'll sit in my mind way longer and I'll feel some kind of reaction which I don't want. Like I'm actually agreeing, even though I know it's bad. Because I guess exposure to something during a low point for long enough is enough to change someone. I hope I've explained my position clear enough, hopefully someone has some advice. Thanks for any tips!",01Jul2020,1

286,"Hey, I live in Miami, Florida. I recently signed a lease at this apartment complex called Country Club Towers in Hialeah. On the first day I moved in when the night came around 50-100 baby roaches crawled out from underneath the sides of the peeling carpet in my room. Even though they fumigated the room it only seemed to make the problem worse. This still happens every night so I've been renting at hotels. They said they would seal the sides of the carpet and never did. I have asked many people in my building and they said they have the same problem and live their lives using random things to keep the roaches away every day. As a matter of fact, there's around 7-10 buildings here and even people in different buildings also say they have roaches! I wanted to make a petition and help all of the residents there take some sort of action but, I have no idea how I could go about this. All I know right now is I can forsure get over 100 signatures. Any advice on how I could go about this?? Also, I wanted to know if anyone knows any way I could get out of paying my lease",01Jul2020,1
287,"So I am a third year college student and I’ve been living with my roommates for a year now. One of them is really awesome and I love her, I’ll call her E, the other is a total bitch, called K. It wasn’t a huge problem until recently when I got a kitten. I have pretty severe anxiety so having a kitten really helps, it makes it so I can take a lower dose of medication. 

k has had a cat the whole time and it has free reign of the apartment. It can go in to any room it wants and it’s mean. It bites and attacks both E and I and generally is just a pain. Not to mention the cat knows how to open doors, making it so we have to lock our doors. 

K seems to think that my kitten should have to stay in my room all the time, and that her cat should have all the apartment. On top of that she has never once (and this isn’t an exaggeration) put away the dishes. She rarely takes out the trash, and she has the audacity to fake cry today when my kitten got out and her cat hissed at him. 

I would go to the apartment agency but unfortunately she works there. She could report my kitten for anything and he could get taken away from me. I’m terrified to do something but my kitten can’t just stay in my room his whole life. She’s unwilling to work with me or listen and despite E and I’s attempts to stand up to her nothing has changed. The leasing agency says that if they deem an animal to be too intrusive or too bothersome to the other tenants it can get taken away never to return to the apartment but since she works there she could make something up and get Loki (my kitten) taken away. 

I don’t know what to do but if her cat gets to roam the apartment mine should too or at least they could take turns. Loki is getting really restless.",01Jul2020,1
288,"So my best friend is openly queer (most likely bi but doesn’t want to put a label on it) and I’ve also recently started questioning my sexuality. I find some girls very attractive but have never had a crush on a girl so I’m still not sure about anything. 

Ever since I started confiding in my best friend about this and talking to her about how it’s frustrating not knowing what my sexuality is, she’s become a little pushy with me. She often brings up this one thing that I happened to say a few years back (which I vaguely remember), which was “I get the feeling that we’re gonna kiss someday.” 

I remember that I said it in a light hearted way and didn’t mean it too seriously, as I literally almost forgot that I even said that at all, but she most definitely has not forgotten. About a year ago she reminded me that I said that and started jokingly (but not so jokingly at the same time) making a move on me. She’s done this several times. Each time I’ve just laughed it off and been like “haha I’m not ready yet!!” but I’m pretty sure that she senses my discomfort with the whole thing. She’s said before that she doesn’t want to pressure me into anything, but I definitely DO feel pressured. 

Recently, she sent me a tiktok that was about best friends who kiss each other just to “practice”. She’s also been calling me more pet names than usual (we sometimes do this as a joke, but she’s definitely been doing it more as of recently). And she often says that she misses me (we live an hour away from each other so I don’t get to see her very often). When we talk about the next time that we’re going to meet up, she often mentions wanting to cuddle with me. We’ve cuddled once before, but it was completely platonic. I’m just getting different vibes this time. I’m honestly kind of scared for the next time that we meet up since she’s gotten a lot bolder recently. 

So with all of this together, is it reasonable to assume that she might have a crush on me? Or am I overreacting?

And if that is the case, how should I handle it considering the fact that I don’t feel the same way? She’s a very sensitive person and can be pretty hard on herself, so I really don’t want to completely shut her down or anything. I desperately want to stay best friends with her but I don’t want anything more than that. Please help!",01Jul2020,1

291,"Ok so, Currently-
I’m living at my mother’s house
She’s driving me nuts, We fight constantly for a myriad of reasons.(she is codependent with her BF, an alcoholic, and incredibly overbearing to name a couple.)  
Living with her genuinely makes me miserable and impacts my mental health. Aside from her, the limitations and lack of privacy that come with living at home with having virtually no autonomy also makes me miserable. 
The situation at my father’s is not any better, (potentially worse and more dangerous) However, in terms of options those are the only members of family that even remotely care about me 
Also I hate living in the state I’m currently in and find the winters to be unbearable, though it’s summer now, I don’t want to get comfortable and suddenly wake up with ice on my car. 
I want to move, but Covid or not, for starters I just don’t know where to go. 
Financially speaking, I do have the means to move but any in person job in another area obviously could potentially expose me to Covid or cease to exist because of covid and as a result my income could run out. 
ALSO if I move out of state, hate it as much as I do, my parents are my main support system and being that far away could be difficult or dangerous especially if I faced eviction or sickness and could potentially land me back at start so to speak.

297,"I went to a friends birthday yesterday. Before I went I had to go to the hospital to get checked out because I had pains and felt ill.

Anyways got to the house late and it was all good. Had a good time. I was a bit quiet and tired so I kinda just sat back and talked every now and then chilling because I just didn’t have the energy to do much. My friends and I don’t have many photos and one friend said this bothered so we needed to take some. I’m not a fan of photos but ya know they’re my friends they want some memories so I got in them. 

We took a few photos (I didn’t see any idk why they jsut didn’t show me them lol). Cut to today in the groupchat someone asked “can someone send the photos from the party pls.” The birthday girl (who has the photos) says yeah and sends in photos. She sent every photo I wasn’t in. Not one photo had me. I mean I’m not the most attractive person and I know I’m not photogenic at all but it still hurts. I mean I hate seeing myself in photos and seeing photos of myself but it still hurts that my friend obviously feels the same way. 

Idk just sucks and idk what to do rlly. The night was weird as well. Since I was tired form being at the hospital and also worried about what was wrong with me I just didn’t do much. I talked when I felt like it but like I said I mostly just sat back and relaxed. My friend kept giving me looks, looks of either concern or judgement and I always smiled to her. 

Everyone started getting drinks and they were asking what I wanted. I said since I was at the hospital and felt sick I didn’t wanna drink anything and the same friend kept giving me looks as if I was ruining the party or something lmao. Two other friends were fine with it ofc like normal people would be I mean one kept trying to get me to drink but he kept saying I didn’t have to and making sure I felt alright anyways he just didn’t want me to feel left out. 

Idk its jsut weird and with what’s going on with me with the hospital and now this I just cba to deal with it but I feel like everyone is weird with me since I left early too and idk what I can say. I did text after I left saying “sorry that was really sudden I just didn’t feel too good” and the reply was “yeaaaahhh” and then since then nothing has been said apart from the groupchat photos.

I have no other friends here. I’ve lost pretty much all of my casual friends/acquaintances since the pandemic started, as I just realized they weren’t even really my friends at all.. 

I’ve floated in and out of friend groups in my time in college and none of them stuck. I don’t know why. Maybe I’m just not friendly enough?.. I lost a really good friend last year as he had grown feelings for me that he couldn’t deal with. I accepted it. I’ve always gotten along better with men, but they seem to catch feelings for me which makes things complicated. I finally found an amazing girl best friend and she’s leaving now too. I’m just so upset. Sorry if these thoughts are just a bit all over the place...

I’m just dreading this last year I have in college. This should be the best year....the year before I go into the real world and work. I LOVE going out, drinking and partying, staying in having girls nights, etc. I am a very social person.. Which makes the isolation I’m going to face that much harder. I love hanging out with friends but it seems difficult for me to make friends, or like people are friendly but they don’t want to take the next step of hanging out and being friends :( how can I make this year not so completely terrible? I don’t want to be lonely and sad the entire year.. I was going to join some clubs but then the pandemic started and I don’t know if I’ll even have the opportunity to do that now.

302,"There's this girl i met online, i made another post about her a week ago, but we’re interested in something casual, the only problem is we just don’t have a place to actually do the deed at. She’s got a kid at home, i live with my mom and i don’t really want to pay for a hotel. Too much money. I told her about my living situation, that i live with my mother and that i was sorry for lying at first. She took it well, i think. Not as hostile a reaction as i thought. 

But, yesterday afternoon, my mom had to take my little brother to a doctor’s appointment, so i’d have the house to myself for awhile, cause they’re usually really slow at that place. Soon as i heard, I called the girl and set up a date for that time. We started kissing as soon as she got here,  but before we even got too into it, my mom got home. She was complaining about how the office cancelled the appointment and saw her. I had no idea what to do, it was just completely quiet. After a bit, i introduced them. I said she was a friend and i was gonna take her home.

We got into a slight argument in the car though. I told her I couldn't help it. She denied that we go to her place and pretty much demanded that if i didn’t take her to a hotel, i wouldn’t “get any” and she’d end this relationship because she’s tired of me playing games with her. So, i told her about a nice hotel in town. We were driving to it, but i got another idea. There was a park close by and it’s usually empty by this time of day. Almost night. My plan was to get her “In the mood” in the car, before we got there. (Keep in mind, i'm pretty broke and can't really afford hotels. If i pay for one, i'd have to go without necessities i need to live.)

So, while i’m driving, i am kind of reaching over and “touching her” to spare the graphic details. When we get close to the park, i just commented i couldn’t wait to get to the hotel, i wanted to get it on now. So i pulled over to the park, which she was on board with, that way it was a little more spontaneous and didn’t come off as me just being cheap. We got a secluded spot and started kissing, unfortunately some man was jogging by and saw us. So we had to leave. 

I was out of ideas and just drove around a bit, then i found an alley behind some garage. It looked secluded, so i parked my car and took her behind the wall and we actually got to finally be intimate, uninterrupted. She seemed really into it during. But afterwards, she got pissed off out of nowhere. She said i made her feel cheap and to never call her again. She started ranting about how she wanted it to be in a bed and calling me a cheapskate. That i didn’t respect her enough to pay for a hotel and was treating her like a hooker by taking her to an alley. She regretted doing it like that and called her friend to pick her up. I told her i was broke but she didn’t want to listen, she said i should’ve said that from the start, and that if i’m broke, i probably shouldn’t be dating.

So, she changed from really eager to bitter and mad. Is there anyway i can salvage this? Cause i do care about her.",01Jul2020,1

309,"Hi,

Politics sank my career (Mechanical Engineering).  It happened in slow motion - over a 9-month period.  What they're doing is morally abhorrent to me, but not illegal so there's no watchdog I can report it to.

This upset me a great deal and the girl I was seeing left me - well, she essentially ghosted me.  She said she wanted to be friends and planned to visit then never did.  Haven't heard from her in a month now.

This upset me a great deal and I've been rather dysfunctional.  I started antidepressants two months ago and they've mostly only seemed to make things worse I guess.  Psychiatrists have been rude more than anything but I've got a new one I'm trying tomorrow.

I loved my niche field, but there are no job openings because of the pandemic.  Anything else available would be a steep step down in prestige, pay, and satisfaction.  Unfortunately with all this madness, I can't tell what I'd even enjoy doing.

I was raised in an abusive family and I'm estranged.  My friends said I was too depressing and stopped talking to me.  I spent my 31st birthday alone 1.5 weeks ago.  I'm seeing a therapist who is decent, but I'm between a rock and a hard place - I want to leave my toxic job, but there's nothing else I'd rather do.  I'm already ""getting help"", but I'm not really gaining traction.

What else can I do?

I'd try to exercise more, but I injured myself badly last year and I have to limit myself.  Maybe I can see one of those trainers who has a BS in sports medicine? (I forget what they're called).  Physical Therapists mostly just helped with low intensity stuff.

I could see a nutritionist...

310,"I’ve recently turned fifteen, and I’m embarrassed to say that the best years of my life were in elementary school. I didn’t have to worry about being ugly, and my best friend was with me all the time.

I’ve been comparing myself to this friend a lot. She was my best friend from preschool to sixth grade. Then, in middle school, she became really popular, and I didn’t. She’s a pretty and athletic straight-A honors student. She’s around me a lot in my life because our moms are friends, and I always feel worthless around her. I was her best friend for the first twelve years of my life, but now, I can’t even hold a conversation with her.

Honestly, she’s a genuinely good person, but she unknowingly makes me feel inferior to her sometimes. She’s really pretty and skinny. Sometimes, she’d talk about her relationships (I’ve never been in one) or talk about drama with her friends (they’re all the popular kids). 

Anyway, her family visited us a while ago (before the pandemic). I was reading my textbook for a test, and she said, “I thought you were smart. I took tests for that class, and I got perfect scores without studying.” 

I replied, “Well, most of the questions for my tests are based off of the textbook.”

But what I thought was “Why would you say that? It’s not fair to say that I’m not smart because I have to study. Why can’t I be more like you? Why am I so lame?”

We don’t have much in common anymore. I’m a boring teenager who pathetically avoids social media because it makes me feel bad about my face, body, and life. I don’t know anything about celebrity news, I don’t use TikTok, I don’t like playing games like LOL or Minecraft, and I only use Instagram to follow artists that I like and not to share how amazing my life is. I have nothing interesting to share on Instagram, and that’s my own fault.

She recommended a show for me to watch, and when we opened up the episode, an ad popped up about losing weight. She’s 5 ft, 4 inches and around 70-80 pounds. She joked about the ad being a message for me to lose weight. For reference, I’m 5 ft, 6 inches tall and I weigh 110 pounds. The numbers seem pretty average, but compared to almost every other girl at school, I’m fat.

I’d like to say that I know that many people have worse problems than me. I know that being pretty, skinny, and popular aren’t the most important things in life, and that saying all this makes me sound really shallow. I’m sorry, I’ll try to fix my mindset.

The usual advice for this type of thing is “be yourself.” In my case though, I want to improve myself so that I can become someone that I can appreciate. I’d love any advice on how to do this or any stories about people who went through a similar situation.

TLDR: I can’t stop comparing myself to my ex-best friend. I want to become someone that I can admire and not be ashamed of.

311,"Firstly she has serious mental health problems. She has depression, potentially ptsd and i think she might have anorexia. She has had a run of homelessness and unsteady homes.

Also our grandfather passed away and left us a relatively small inheritance. 


The biggest problem is that she is very unrealistic about money she is alright with money and doesn't spend much but she is very optimistic about living off selling her art and that she has so many ideas.
That are so unrealistic and she doesn't understand how difficult it is to for example make a living off music especially without knowing any instruments.

312,"So, essentially we all had sex in the same room. Separately but stuff kind of went odd and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. Me and my girlfriend got there and we all joked about having sex but me and my friend said no and just blew it off kind of. Fast forward, we all got high and thinks began getting hot and heavy. We both looked at each other that we were ok doing it and that it would be our sort of group secret. We ended up doing this sort of synchronized same room sex 3 times over the course of the sleepover. Now that by itself was kind of weird looking back but not bad, just sudden. But during the whole thing, I caught his girlfriend looking at me while she was getting busy with him and we made eye contact which made me freak out. I saw him go down on her we all heard each other. 

For the past 2ish days, i've been slowly comprehending and processing the experience but I keep having flashbacks to moments like seeing him go down on his girl or making eye contact with his girl. Me and him have talked and we're good, we're just a little mentally marked by the experience. The thing is, he wants to do this again and so do I but i'm bisexual and I kind of want to experiment with all 4 of us together.

313,"My sister’s 8 year old kid has been picking her toenails off. This isn’t the start of things, though. She’s always had behavioral issues. She bullies her sister (spills yogurt on her head, pinches, throws things), she picks the pain off walls, and picks her skin. She is currently missing 3 entire toenails. We’re completely lost on what to do. This is very concerning and confusing for us. 

She was recently prescribed Prozac and has been taking it for about a week. She’s been having night terrors, not sleeping or eating well, and the self mutilation has progressed overtime.

I'm already planning to attempt the SAT at least 3-6 times before collage applications are out and planning to take either the volleyball, fencing, or soccer (our school requires us to take at least one sport).

319,"So I'm in a bind here, guys. Just before the quarantine here in the US, my Psychiatrist transferred after telling me I could discontinue my medication for bipolar without withdrawal due to concerning side effects. Well, I suffered really bad withdrawals that left me suicidal and housebound for several weeks. I just found a new doctor who is sending me a new medication that will take a few weeks to work. Being stuck at my apartment alone was miserable, especially given the reality that I didn't have a job or a way to pay rent for the following month. 

I wasn't too concerned about finding work because I am usually on Educational Benefits through the Veteran's Administration. Still I looked around, and I have been struggling to find something. 

Going to school full time leaves me with enough money to cover rent and my other expenses. Before Summer semester, my classes moved online, and the availability changed for me. So I couldn't get into a full time schedule to receive a paycheck for the month of July. At the time, I thought I would receive some kind of paycheck (partial), so I didn't fret too much. Well, I found out today, I will not be receiving anything. 

I've already tried applying for loans, and I was denied because of lack of employment and some credit card debt. I've been going around to local businesses for the past month or so trying to get hired after filling out the online application. I think being in a 'mixed episode' (bipolar term) is effective people's perception of me, as I'm very paranoid and I have been twitching a bit from my medication withdrawal. I tried to apply for a delivery or ride sharing job, but I was penalized for not being able to pay my registration, and now I can't afford the penalty especially to get it renewed. 

I'm kind of on the edge here. Really having a hard time. I'm a really hard worker. In the military, I was promoted quickly into leadership, despite my difficulties with mental health. Now, I don't have much left going on for me. I don't have family around to help me. I'm thinking I might end up homeless, and that isn't something I could live with. I'm struggling a lot with mental health, and I don't have a lot of friends around me, but I'm trying to stay happy and keep a smile on my face while I say hi to my neighbors. 

Tomorrow is the first, and I guess I'll have to take a credit card advance. This will be my last month will any help. I'll get paid the following month (hopefully), as I resume full time classes, but I don't think I'll be able to pay off the debt from taking out several thousand in credit card advances. I really need help here; any advice is appreciated. Making a couple hundred dollars isn't going to cut it this time. I probably need to make at least 1,600 this month. Thanks for reading. Sorry it was long.",01Jul2020,1
320,"

I can get like, really happy and really angry, but that’s it. I never get sad. I just go numb. That bothers me but I’ve accepted it. Now I have a new issue:

BACKSTORY:

I’ve always been bad at reading people. I always manage to say the wrong thing. I think a lot, like I really like psychology and philosophy. I have really strong morals, in that I believe humans are inherently good, and that nothing is entirely bad. For instance, if someone steals my laptop I would be pretty pissed but if I later found out that they were a single parent who had recently lost their job, I wouldn’t mind nearly as much. 
I believe that there is an explanation for everything. I only look at facts. The reason I believe nothing is entirely bad is because most of the time, when you do something, you think you’re doing the right thing, or something okay. So we as society can see it as terrible, but it can’t be entirely bad because someone sees it as good. They could have every mental illness out there but they still see it as good. 
Anyway those are my morals. I hope they made sense. 

The issue is that my mom pointed out tonight that I’m doing that I don’t take emotions into consideration. I never realised this. The way I see things is like I mentioned above with the computer: there’s a reason. Facts will show the reason. If I know the reason then I’ll be at peace. Apparently I’m the only one who sees it this way though. My mom was trying to explain how I can’t say stuff like that in public cause it could trigger someone with serious trauma. This doesn’t make any sense to me. As hard as I try I can’t understand why someone wouldn’t want to know that. 

EXPLANATION OF GENERAL SITUATION:

I can be happy. I get really happy when something makes me, well, happy. I can be angry, generally with very little prompting. I can be anxious. I don’t cry. I awkwardly shake (occasionally) because I feel like I have to. I don’t have empathy. People have said I need to be empathetic since I was little but I still don’t get it. All I care about is facts. I believe emotions revolve around facts. I know that’s all insensitive. I know. People say I’m pretending and that I need to “grow up” and “be mature”, but it really doesn’t make sense to me. 


ACTUAL ADVICE:

Should I talk to my parents? I don’t think they’ll believe me, not in a bad way, but because I have a history of being dramatic. I see my therapist again in a few weeks. I’ve been diagnosed with OCD but I think I probably also have ASD. I’m a hypochondriac so I try to put that into view, but I don’t even know if this is an ASD thing. Regardless, I’m just scared that something is wrong with me. Can someone please just tell me what to do?

Tl;dr: I rarely experience emotions, except occasional joy and sometimes anger. I don’t have empathy. I’m really concerned and I don’t know what to do or who to talk to.",01Jul2020,1
321,"So my girlfriend has a gay and lesbian friend that constantly suggests threesomes with me and it makes me feel uncomfortable. 

When the lesbian suggests it she’s clearly just after my girl and when the gay friend suggests it he’s after me. I’ve told her that her friends have no boundaries and don’t respect our relationship and she said that they are just playing. Then the gay one decided that he’s bisexual and he wants a solo sleepover with my girlfriend and the lesbian was gonna join too. My girlfriend told me but they did not which suggests to me something they want to try.

I want to go to school to be an animator, but getting into the one I was in was already a stressful thing.

324,"Hey guys, I’m a 21 year old college student (hoping to be a doctor some day) and since about the age of 19, I’ve been constantly worried that I’m losing my hair. I’ve talked to my parents about it and they keep telling me not to worry about it and yet I continue to do so. I’ve talked to my dermatologist a few times about it only to receive lukewarm “If you really feel that way I’ll help you” speeches which felt dismissive and not helpful. However lately, it really feels real, my hair feels thinner and less dense and the hairline which I felt to be receding seems higher than ever. As a ginger, this feeling of losing my hair feels all the more real. In the past, I’ve been very shameful of my appearance. I basically can’t tan and throughout life parts of my appearance have been mocked by friends. I’ve been called an albino and recently, a friend of mine even said that if I go bald I’ll look like a Bond villain. The only part of me that I took pride in and people ever complimented was my hair and losing it really feels like doomsday for my self-esteem. My parents seem to not think I should care until it actually bothers them so I feel like I need to make a decision myself. I don’t wanna lose my hair, but the medications like finasteride seem like a risk to my sex drive and mental state that I don’t know if I’m ready to take. But on the other hand, the slow loss of my hair seems unbearable too. It has already been hard enough to accept myself as I am so losing the component of my appearance that both I and others see as attractive seems like I’m also sentencing myself to be seen as even more of a freak than I was before. If anyone has been through a similar time in their life or has any advice on whether to take action or not I’d really appreciate it, I feel helpless and don’t really have anyone to talk to about this and as a man I feel like I am obligated “man up” and choose to become uglier. What are people’s opinions on the ways to keep ones hair? Should I try to fight it? If anyone has any way to give me advice or help me find a safe solution I’d be really appreciative. Thanks.",01Jul2020,1

Yesterday I shot my own foot with my behavior: I wasn’t able to register for any classes this semester because I procrastinated the deadline, meaning I wasted half a year on nothing (even though I did my classes, I just won’t be able to get graded/do the exams). It made me realize how overwhelmed I am with having to be responsible all on my own for my studies. I cried myself to sleep because I don’t know what to do.

327,"Every time I talk to my parents, or anyone really, they ask “how are you” and I always say “good” or “fine” when I’m definitely not.

I’ve felt pretty depressed for about 4 years now and the last 1.5 have been even worse but more bipolar. I feel extremely lonely and I don’t feel like I have a purpose. I struggle to find fulfillment. I also have very internalized anxiety.

It’s actually practically impossible for an outsider to tell that I’m not happy. On the outside, my life is perfect and I am happy; I was born into a wealthy family, I go to a good school, and I’m pretty smart. I have a few really good close friends, and I’m super active. This is a façade.

I do have all these things, but my life is not perfect and I am not happy. Don’t get me wrong, I’m super grateful that I’m able to focus on my feelings rather than my survival, but aside from that, I am not enjoying life so far.

I could go on for a while about this stuff, but rather than waste more of your time, I’ll get to the point: I’ve never been one to truly express my negative emotions and I have this anxiety voice in my head that makes me second-guess my own feelings. When I’m thinking of telling someone I’m not okay, the voice tells me I’m just looking for attention. Coming out as bi? Attention-seeker. Maybe I’m so good at lying that I’m lying to myself about being bi and I believe it. These are the kinds of things the voice in my head makes me think about.

I feel like no one knows me even though I have 3 great friends that I’ve known for years, one since I was 2. I know I need to tell someone about my emotions, I’ve heard it a million times about how important it is, but it’s not that easy.

All the advice says “tell someone” but none of it says how. I feel uncomfortable about telling my parents about it even though my sister had depression and I had many problems with feeling depressed in elementary school. But I don’t know how they learned about those things. And now I’ve been “good”
for so long that I don’t know how they could possibly react to me telling them I’m depressed out of the blue. What should I do? I feel lost and these feelings aren’t going away by themselves.

TL;DR: I feel depressed and I need help, but I am struggling to tell my parents because I’ve always appeared on the outside as happy and leading a good life. How can I tell them?",01Jul2020,1

I didn't know how bad it got until just recently. You see my friend can't walk properly. He can kind of stand or walk if he holds on to something or if someone helps him. She constantly tells him ""i do everything for you"" and ""where would you be without me."" She also hits him. He can't hit back, not really anyway. He also can't run or walk away. And whenever she hit him she would starts apologizing and crying, saying she didn't mean to or anything. And he would forgive her. I. have told him to leave her several times. He always says ""she's not that bad. She just has issues.""

But now he says he's finally done. He said she's been having him take these boner pills, to better their sex life. Because he can't always get it up. And that when they don't work she gets angry. And has him do other things. Thing's that he says ""kind of hurt, but she just keeps going"". And when they do work she rides him like an animal even when he tells her he wants to stop. He said he's tried to push her off but it's difficult for him. Afterall their similar in size and he's practically dead from the waste down. He said he's also woken up to her having sex with him. And that last time she tried something like this it REALLY hurt. He also said that he was afraid to tell anyone about this because he was afraid he would be made fun of.

He was 12 at the time. Apparently they were watching something on TV one day and somehow started talking about how he wasn't sure if he would ever be able to please a girl or have a girlfriend.

It is night while I type this so I hope to wake up to a couple of notifications. So, we have some family visiting for July 4th and I was pretty excited since I’m an only child and it’s fun to have my cousins over. And then I realized they’re actually my nieces and nephews from my moms side. And... as much as I love my mom, three out of the four children are total monstrous brats. They take my stuff, break my stuff, make fun of me, call me names, make fun of my weight, and they’ve made me cry multiple times. Just so you know, I’m very close to my mom and I love her a lot.

When these kids came over, it was pretty alright until they began taking anything and everything I owned. I began trying to make sure they didn’t break anything because, while I know things will come and go, I get really attached to objects with sentimental value. Anyways, they began asking to use drones and my switch and my games and my paints and eventually they ended up playing around with this toy lightsaber and they ended up breaking it and I had to throw it away. That was difficult, it was a birthday gift from my aunt on my dads side. 

I told everyone to get out and that my room was now off limits. They protested and I ended up blockading the door. Maybe I overreacted but at that point I was fed up. I went to my mother to complain, and I asked if I could kick one of the more problematic kids out of my room and into their parents room where they had plenty of space. 

My mom got furious, and I told her I could show her what happened to my room and how much of a mess they made. I showed her and she didn’t see a problem (which was ridiculous because if I usually have a mess she will freak out and tell me to clean up) 

She then kicks me out of my room and now I have to sleep in the living room. Whatever... I give up. I just have to live with it, right? Well then she starts to mock me and make fun of me and call me a drama king and more right in front of me for the rest of the day. What did I do??? She thinks I’m making this all up!! 

I am genuinely confused, this isn’t like her. We’ve been close for so long and she doesn’t really do this, but I feel so unwanted and I have so many urges to just run away. Should I do something? Or am I just being a stupid kid and should I grow up??

Now recently he has been making me put my ac unit on 83 and on low not even full power, the low setting I wake up feeling lightheaded and obviously sweaty. Whenever I say I at least want it at 81 so I don’t feel sick he says unless I’m paying the bills it’s not and that he will rip it out if I complain? Is it just me or is this ridiculous like I’ve gotten to the point of crying from lack of sleep. they get mad often there ac unit gave out a week ago so they think I’m fine most times but truthfully I’ve never dealt with heat like this in the house outside feels better most days.. not sure how to handle all this really.

344,"So I just moved into this apartment and there are a tons of problems with it. Now I’ve had a super hard day and coming to the new apartment with even more problems? The blinds don’t close, there is a whole in the ceiling with no light and just wires; none of the rooms have actual lights just outlets, floor is warped, missing cupboard drawers, scratches and chipped cupboards, doors won’t close/stuck leaking bathtub faucet, and broken appliances. It had been an awful day and I’ve been crying since I got here. I pay over 1200 for this apartment- it is not worth the cost and I don’t know what to do. As an added bonus I just split my toe open, so yeah great night",01Jul2020,1
346,"TL;DR: How do I deal with a toxic friend who makes me feel stupid, tries to get rises out of me, is violent sometimes and uses traumatic experiences and sensitive things about me to make fun of me and generally against me.

I(19f) have a friend Jamie(19f) who is toxic.

I knew Jamie back in grade school, she was always one to speak her mind but didn't give much thought to feelings. She was a year under me so we drifted apart after 6th grade. A little under a year ago I got a job and after about two weeks Jamie got the same job. I was glad to see her and we immediately became friends again. After about a month or so I introduced her to my friends Kacie and Dani (don't worry, none of these names are real). Dani also got a job there and her and Jamie became close friends. 

Things were going good, then December hit. To sum it up, this is what happened in order: I was living with two gaslighters for a month already, Dani's (15 year old?) cat died on her birthday, Dani got drugged and assaulted and thus ended up in the hospital, my 12 year old cat got sick and almost died, my aunt got a concussion and ended up in the hospital, and I moved out of the gaslight apartment. There was good stuff too like a nice trip to the beach, but yeah. 

Anyway the beginning of 2020 I was a wreck. I was the saddest I have ever been, crying a lot, not talking a lot, second guessing myself all the time (this is what gaslighting does to people). I was talking to Jamie on a drive home one night and told her about what I was going through, tears running down my face. At the time she was supportive and showed genuine concern for me. It was nice. Over time I got better and was finally pulling myself out of that sadness with the help of friends. Meanwhile Dani and Jamie get even closer pretty much best friends at this point.

Around march or so I was talking to Jamie and she was using the facepalm emoji. I was still sensitive from the whole gaslighting thing so I felt like I was an idiot when she used it and was hurt. I tried to talk to her about it but she just told me that was stupid but agreed to not use it. I thought to my self ""Ok a little rude but I still call it a win"". Then Jamie sent a snapchat to the group chat with me Dani and herself. In the chat was a pick with the caption ""Ugh, that crazy sensitive girl who is (insert sensitive stuff I told her here) doesn't want me to use (facepalm emoji) because it hurts her feelings"". She then sends a message saying that she didn't mean to send that to that group chat. Dani stays silent and I just tell her that I think what she did was extremely rude and that I have lost a lot of trust in her because I told her that stuff in confidence. I then decide I don't want to take a break form this and put my phone down to clear my head. In that time she tries to justify it with ""I only told one person and you don't even know her"" and ""You're being so sensitive"". I just tell her ""I don't care, you know you shouldn't have told anyone but you did anyway, you fucked up, I'm gonna take a break form you for a while I don't know how long."". It wasn't super long, only about a week, but I still don't trust her.

I'm not close with her anymore. We used to go skateboarding together, don't do that anymore. Used to hang out after work, don't do that anymore. She is closest with Dani as she has ever been though.

Dani doesn't really see anything wrong with her, but recently we had a birthday party for Kacie at her house in early June. Kacie's brother, two of his friends, me, Dani and Jamie were all there. Before Jamie got there Dani wanted to know if Kacie would be ok if she came. We talked a bit about her, Kacie saying that Jamie is pretty toxic, but she can still come. I nod along and Dani looks at us in shock asking ""Wait Jamie is toxic?"". We explain it to her but she doesn't have much to say about it.

Once everyone is there we start playing a card game. I'm sat in between Jamie and Kacie's brother. The game gets going and Kacie's brother plays a card against Jamie. Jamie doesn't like this and reaches over me to slap the brother. Everyone then starts getting all confused and saying ""woah woah woah"" and the like. The brother just sits there and tries to figure out why the fuck she thought that was ok. I ask her ""what the fuck? It's just a game. Physical violence is not ok"". We carry on with the game but everyone now has this understanding that we want to get Jamie out of the game. Now Kacie really doesn't like Jamie and Kacie's brother isn't super fond of her either. 

The most recent thing she did (a few days ago) though was kinda small but makes me a little bit more convinced that she does something. On snapchat there are stories your friends can see. On Jamie's story was a picture of her cat laying on the railing of her stairs. I sent her a message about that pic saying ""just haaaaaaanging out"". I thought it was funny. She did not. She took a picture of herself on snapchat of her rolling her eyes with the caption ""Ugh, Anne swiped up on my story and I'm like ewww gross"" she sent it to me this a follow up of her with a shocked face with ""omg, sorry, wrong person"". I sent her a short message of ""oof rude"" and left. I've learned she doesn't respond well to long ass paragraphs about how she has lost my trust so I thought this better. She then sends me a few messages about how she was sorry. Didn't talk about it anymore after that. Later I'm over at Kacie's and I tell her about it and my theory; She really did mean to send that to me. She just wants to get a rise out of me. Something to point at and say ""wow what a weirdo"" and ""wow so sensitive"". But this time I didn't give her that. She actually ended up unfriending me on snapchat, I assume so I would do what I did when she did that before; ask her what's up and if she needs to talk or something. But I actually didn't notice until she added me back later that night. Like I said, even back in grade school she said whatever she wanted and didn't care about what it did to people's feelings.

So anyway, I know this is long (I probably overexplained some stuff, sorry) so if you stuck out this long, I thank you and I would appreciate some advice on how to deal with this toxic friend. I know I could just drop her as a friend but I am worried that she will hurt Dani in someway. Kacie and I have talked to her about it, so she knows but I just hope Jamie doesn't do anything rash or isn't already doing anything like making her feel stupid.

Thank you.",01Jul2020,1
349,"A peer from my high school reconnected with me over Snapchat today. We talked about music and such. He then asked if I wanted to hang out at his house after quarantine eventually ends. Anyways so I said yes but I remember him and I always remember having an uneasy feeling when sitting next to him. there’s no reason I should feel uncomfortable but somthing about his motions and movements and how he talked disturbed me. He reminded me of my brother who is diagnosed with sociopathy or whatever the term is. Should I feel this way and is it fair to him that I feel this way.  

**On a side note his name even sounds like a name a future serial killer would have.",01Jul2020,1
350,"I’ve been struggling with my sexuality for a long time, but I’ve always described myself as bi because it included everyone, therefore no one would be confused about my sexuality and question me. I’m sure I don’t experience the same kind of attraction to men as I do to women. With women it’s always stronger, and I feel connected to them in a way I’ve never been able to do with men. 

For a long time I’ve been sure that I wouldn’t be able to form a healthy relationship with a woman (for what reason I don’t remember but I didn’t question it), but I now I feel like forming a relationship with a man would not only be impossible, but straight out repulsive. I don’t know, with men I always feel like we’re always standing a few feet apart and will never be able to come to the same understanding as I do with women, no matter how far in a relationship we are. 

I was never really drawn to men in any kind of way, even as friends — if I ended up as friends with one, it was always because of a shared friend. I had a boyfriend a few years back but I never formed any kind of romantic attachment to him, didn’t really feel the urge to touch him, and treated him more as a friend than a boyfriend. I’m sure I had a crush on him, but the moment I knew he reciprocated my feelings I instantly didn’t want anything to do with him, but went along with it because I was embarrassed about myself, and thought I was just creating problems that didn’t exist. We kissed a few times, but I didn’t really like it, just thought it was weird and told him I just don’t like kissing. Now I feel like gagging when thinking about kissing a man. 

I had multiple crushes like this on men that never really progressed past the “you’re exciting and I want to spend time with you” phrase. Now I think I just found the “mysterious and unknown” part exciting, and not the men themselves. 

I love books and I read a shit ton of ya novels when I was younger (heterosexual couples ofc), but I was never really interested in a relationship itself, and always got bored when every problem was solved and the couple was happy. It sounds kind of vile of me but I think what drew me to those books was drama. I don’t think I’ve ever read a lesbian love novel, it’s just that when I think about picking one up, my brain just fucking glitches and I get the feeling that it’s “dangerous” and I shouldn’t even touch it. 

Even when I’m watching porn I’m always concentrating on a woman, the man always feels like a part that’s unwanted but somehow needed. I love lesbian porn, though. I think I’ve never watched gay porn. 

I heard about compulsory heterosexuality and have been wondering whether it is what I’m experiencing or whether I’m just bi and overthinking it. I don’t really have any romantic experience with women (not counting crushes), everything I’ve said is based on my friendships. I’d love to have a girlfriend, but unfortunately, I don’t really know anyone who’d like to date me. 

Two of my closest friends were sure I was a lesbian and were constantly teasing me about it when I thought I was bi-curious, and I always panicked and instantly shot them down saying I was straight. I can’t ask them about it because we don’t really talk now (they know I identify as bi now, but I don’t know what they think of it).

I’ve always thought that lesbians just knew they only liked women, but I’m not so sure anymore — maybe it’s a process? Unlearning compulsory heterosexuality? Is this what is happening to me or am I just bi? 

I’d also like to note that I’m 16. What should I do besides finding a girlfriend (no idea where I could even find one)? I’m turning to reddit because I don’t really know where I should ask.",01Jul2020,1
352,"A couple of weeks before we went into confinement (not US), my husband started the interviews for a nice position in a big consulting company. They are pretty much global. They offered him the job, and he said yes, so they stated they'd send the offer letter that week, but they didn't. And by the end of that week everything just froze because of COVID and we were supposed to stay at home, and whatnot.

The thing is, during those weeks, HR kept calling him just to keep in touch, reassuring him that the minute this passed, they would restart the process, and they were still very interested in him joining the team. That went on for over three months.

About a month ago, HR called him and said hiring processes were reactivating so they'd let him know soon enough what the next steps were going to be. Two weeks went by without any notice, so he called and asked. They said that Friday —and here's where it starts to get a bit shady—, the hiring committee was meeting and she would call him on Monday to let him know everything was OK. She didn't. SO called again and she said the same thing, that it was going to be that Friday, which started to get annoying, but whatever, ok. No call next Monday either. He called again and then he got to talk with his future manager, who told him that it wasn't actually a committee, but our country CEO who was deciding who was getting hired and who not. That for the previous two weeks, and it was actually going not as expected because apparently he was declining pretty much everyone, so they decided to wait before putting his candidacy forward. But wait, there's more. Now, it's not the country CEO. It's the Europe CEO who's taking those decisions. And he apparently stopped his candidacy because he asked some questions about it and HR didn't know the answers. Word-for-word what his manager said.

It sounds like bullshit that a man that probably makes close to 1M€ per year is wasting his time deciding which candidate gets hired, one by one, in the whole continent. That's what HR are for, they get the guidelines and apply them to the processes. 

So we're pretty much devastated because we've been waiting for this for the past 4 months, since the department wanted to hire him, they kept in touch throughout the confinement… only for this. We don't know if they're lying to us or if this is actually something that happens, but at least it sounds a bit surreal. Anyone around with corporate experience could throw some light upon this?",01Jul2020,1

355,"My superiors introduced an open feedback system where once in a while ppl can sit in a circle and give a good and bad thing about a person's performance. However I feel that my colleagues use it as justified method to give unsolicited feedback.

I was rightfully mad when they said that my actions do not show that I care for the team, despite honestly making a conscious effort to the whole time. Looking back at all the things I did and when I brought them up, ""you only say the things you remembered doing. If you did care, you wouldn't remember all the good things you did."" So how do I defend myself?

When I defend myself, they attack my said defense and say that it's not valid. They push me to give honest answers instead of giving ""politically correct"" ones, but when I give honest answers they attack on it. Hence I stopped trying to defend myself. Our most recent one was to the point that they twist everything I say, my battle buddy didn't respect me ""you are 22 you should be mature enough"" etc and even insensitively questioned my intentions on why I enlisted into the army. I just started sobbing because it tied back all the way to my childhood. None of them even apologised or even think that they went too far.

To them, they bashed me because I was doing it for personal glory. Yes. But I never disclosed that I also enlisted so I can be a strong individual who protects others so they don't have to experience what I had gone through as a child.  

During lunch a few kept saying that they're are not attacking me, and that they want me to improve. But at this point, that's all I see. Assholes giving unsolicited feedback. I don't feel the need to defend myself anymore seeing how it'll always be rebutted. They do give valid feedback at times, but nowadays it's attacking others for something they don't personally agree with. They give me shit for not sharing food when food is ample enough. They call me selfish and terrible when I don't see what's wrong. Think about other people. Yeah. I do. But there's enough food on the table? Why the need to share? Now I'm getting terrible peer appraisals because of stupid shit like this, instead of my military performance. 

Oh well. I'm graduating basic in 2 days. They are nasty people who think they are holier than thou and seeing how they treat our neighboring squads , I am glad I am out of this toxic cesspool. Our superiors think that I am the problem since it's an obvious majority versus me. But I personally think that they are the problem. If it means to stand alone, so be it.

361,"Sorry if it has a lot of errors, my first language isn’t English. I leave out some details that are not that important to know. Sorry it’s really long.

Some backstory-ish information first

It started yesterday afternoon when I got confronted again by my boyfriend about my attitude towards him and how I always assume that what I think is right, is right. These things are bothering him already for 4 months, and it has really bad influence on our relationship. Every time when he confronted me about it, and we talked for hours about it, I said I will change my behavior. But 2 days later my attitude and shit fucks me over again. Something that happend a lot these last 4 months and he is at a point he can’t forgive me anymore if we fight about it one more time. We haven’t really talked it all out yet, I talked with him about me being not really happy anymore with myself as before. I do want to talk another time about it because he said things to me that still really bothers me.

I be honest, in general I did made too little effort to change my attitude. I might have a problem with motivating myself to do anything that cost effort, like making my homework for my education. My bf calls it being a lazypig. I do 100% understand why my boyfriend gets really angry about it, and is almost just done with it and me after 4 months of having this bullshit.

My attitude is mostly just being really really moody and being basicly a walking moodkiller. I am really insecure what is also starting to annoy people, my boyfriend by example. Yesterday in the evening I was over at a close friend his house, and he told me that he gets a bit annoyed by me being insecure and stressed all the time we chill together. I got a intense wave of sadness and the urge to cry over me and I almost broke down with tears. (Forgot to mention that that evening 2 other goodfriends of mine were there and my boyfriend). I tried to push it away or stop it as soon as possible because I hate crying with people around me. Even though they are rlly good and close friends of mine, I prefer having a breakdown or cry session alone or with my bf. It’s just that I already knew I look insecure and stresses, but not that bad and I didn’t think it was so bad that people get irritated from it. 

He did ask me if there is something bothering me, like do I have a mental illness etc. I said no, and nothing about the fight between me and my bf, because I just didn’t want to and still don’t want to. 

My close friend told me he didn’t mean it as rude as it sounded when he said it, and ment is only to help me and let me realize it. He also didn’t want to make me cry but I reassured him it wasn’t his fault. 

I need to tell you that I appreciate the honesty and being straightforward from my boyfriend and my close friend. I rather be hurt and not lied to, with knowing what I do wrong or can change, then annoying and bothering everyone more and more and not knowing about it.

Anyway, the thing is that I noticed how bad I still feel. I compaired it to other times my bf and I had fights, and how I felt after it and I never felt like how I feel now. I do need to mention that we talked those fights out 100%, so the bad feeling can be caused by still having shit bothering me.

But it is not only that, when we had the fight yesterday, he got really mad(which I totally understand) he scold me and called me things like stupid and useless. I know he might say it out of anger, but this was a different fight then the others we had. 

Sunday and monday, we had a really amazing, romantic and just basicly perfect 2 days together. He smotherd me in love and affection, complimented me, called me by my nicknames, and more. I felt like everything was fine and I did change and everything will go back to how it was.

I was wrong about that, like I said this fight was different then others. He told me that love can go away and that it did go away since the day he noticed I wasn’t who He thought I was and blames me for not showing the real me, that he doesn’t care anymore about me because I obviously don’t think he is it worth to change for. I can understand why he thinks that after so long of fighting about the same stupid thing.

When we don’t have fights he encourages me to be myself and that I don’t have to be insecure. That he loves me for who I am and that I‘m perfect for him. He gave me so much confidence in the time we know each other and loves the confident me. Before I met him my self-esteem was lower then a 0 and I saw no worth in myself, he changed that.

Now, it’s the morning after yesterday, it’s 8.30am and I just don’t know what to do with myself, I don’t feel confident about what I want to say, about my personality, about who I am. I find it hard to still be confident while I feel so crushed by everything. It is not only the fight that causes it, knowing now that I give a insecure and stressed vibe to people that irritate them makes me upset. I thought that being myself was good but I heard once from my bf in a fight that people hate how loud I am and that I am mean to our mutual friends a lot, while I can’t remember being so mean. I can make sarcastic comments sometimes, even my bf does it even more then I do. 

I want people to be direct and honest at me, and tell me if I do something wrong or something that annoys them. So I can stop with it. But this is just, idk it hits me different then normal. Mostly the fight with my boyfriend.

Idk what sort of advice I even should ask for, I just want to stop being so moody and annoying to everyone and just be myself without being all the time human trash.

Thankyou for reading everything, I think I also needed to vent a bit.",01Jul2020,1
362,"This autumn, my s/o is moving into their dorms at a college not too far from their home. About a 3 hour drive and we've already prepped some stuff that they'll need.

363,"My younger is sister and she’s 2 years old. She cries a lot. Her crying alone does not hurt but my parents would be mad about it. When she cries, either of them will end up being upset and blame one another. I don’t think it’s the case but I feel like it’s my fault that it happen. Like I can’t do anything while this happen. Also, mom is biological and dad is step dad, their first language is not the same and they use english to communicate but my mom’s English is really bad. So there are 2 things that can happen. 

First, my dad is asleep and my sister just have to ask for his attention while he’s asleep by crying really loud at night (she stays awake until 12 plus usually). This of course annoyed him and he would blame my mom for letting this happen, saying that she can’t take care of kids and he has to do it but in fact my mom took care of her for quite long but she JUST have to call him up. Then there’s me who don’t know what to do, I can’t calm my sister down so I just really do nothing and I feel like shit.

Second case is that my mom has to do beauty services at home sometimes. When this happen, she needs everything to be quiet, almost like a spa. But again, my sister just need to have my mom attention and cry for it. My mom, who has to deal with her customers feels very pretty stressful so she said things like “if she cries, my customers will be very scared and annoyed” to my dad and of course he felt offended and both ended up being upset with one another. Again, I can’t do anything. 

My sister is very stubborn and I feel very stress out when she is at home together with my step dad. I am doing my A levels now and honestly I don’t have much energy to help much but I will try to do anything to help making my sister less stubborn or naughty. The thing is she doesn’t know how to make sentences as well so we don’t exactly know what does she wants most of the time. She can just cry and stress everyone out.",01Jul2020,1

365,"Recently, I was informed by my building managers that there was a potential bed bug problem in the building. I have had no issues, but I consented to an inspection which turned up nothing. Great!

About a week later, I asked about the status of the bed bug issue and they responded only with shrugs, I don't know, or I can't tell you that. I then requested new glue traps for silverfish control (little brown harmless bugs). I have had the traps since I moved in and they've started to dry out, so I assumed they were the building's responsibility to replace. 

Instead, the manager responded that glue traps were for bed bugs, and not for silverfish, and now they want to perform another inspection and fumigate my suite. They also asked that I sign a blank work order form for them to fill out later. Obviously I didn't do that. 

I feel like they are trying to scapegoat me for the potential bed bug issue, even though I have no evidence of bug issues and the previous inspection they performed turned up negative. So, I reached out to the upper management to complain and to point out how uncomfortable they made me by accusing me of having bed bugs and requesting me to sign a blank work order.

At least if I did, I'd have clear direction and skill to train with some sort of goal in mind, but I'm lost as hell while failing school; not a good sign for me.  


I mainly draw, but I can't really see myself doing that as a career (unless for some reason people wanted to buy my stuff which I mean I'm barely even good enough to sell my stuff or animation). Drawing is fun, I like it, but I only just recently started picking up my pen again to actually hone my skills more since I've been procrastinating a lot (honestly slightly proud of myself for this, I've been drawing basically every day these past few days). I've tried game development but that's sort of been a mix for me, I got farther than most probably do, but I still lack so many skills for it it's very overwhelming. The only lead I really have right now is I could confidently tell you I want to create something, art is cool and amazing, but for me (and probably a lot of you too) art is a very vague term. Music is art, I've tried it it's fun. Drawing is art, I try and do that, that's also fun. Video games are art, I've tried that, its fun. Writing is art, I've tried that, it's fun. Briefly tried an acting class in school, was meh.  


Do you see the pattern? The only thing I can tell you is that I'd like to create something or actually put my ideas into work, but I feel very lacking in skill and direction and passion(?) to know what to really do. I may also have an interest in psychology, though I'm not sure, it doesn't feel right as cool as some of the stuff about it is. I feel like art is something I need to do, but I have absolutely no idea what medium to express myself in, they're all very cool and amazing. I'm currently just drawing because it's my most well-honed skill and I mean I do get enjoyment out of it but I feel like the only reason I come back to it is that I am good at it.  


Maybe I'm just overly anxious and will pull through school as I always have, but If it doesn't work out I need at least some direction. What do you guys think? Am I just worrying too much? What do you recommend I should do about art?",01Jul2020,1
367,"These past 2 months I was in an unpaid internship process. Things were going good initially. Then in these two months, a lot of things happened in my personal life that was really unexpected and threw me off my feet. After that i have become so wary of myself. Every time I was given a work, my initial reaction was ""yeah i cant do this"". I was always a fast learner. But recently I noticed that when given a deadline,I started questioning myself very much. I'm not a good judge of myself anymore. I had always been critical,everyone is of their own work. But I don't know if I'm even doing anything right anymore. I get so scared sometimes that I'll fuck up really badly. One time I did make a mistake and I was so dumb i didn't even proofread my work and when questioned on it I only said kept saying sorry. 

I really need some advice on how to overcome this. This is not something that I want for myself. How do I become a better learner? Any and all advice is appreciated.",01Jul2020,1

The thing I am paranoid about is other people. When I pass somebody on the road and see them on there phone I get even more paranoid. The fact is people in my area drive stupid and are constantly texting while driving, cutting drivers off, and driving very slow.

369,"Hi,  


Hoping to get some advice from seasoned office workers and bosses about my situation

I'm feeling very burnt out by my mental health plus work/family/life in general and have decided I need a short break from work. Hopefully this will rekindle my passion for the work (I mostly enjoy my job).

I'm not sure whether I should tell my line manager/boss the real reasons needed for a break, or just state 'personal reasons'. 

We're generally a pretty open and honest team who work closely to the mental health field and I don't believe I would be judged negatively for being honest HOWEVER:

I am concerned about being pigeon-holed for my temporary circumstances, long after it has subsided. For example, not being given desirable responsibilities (I am fairly ambitious)

But, I'm also concerned about being unnecessarily private and potentially untrustworthy

I'm sure there's plenty of people who've gone through similar scenarios, both workers and superiors alike. Tell me about your experiences and what you think was the most desirable course of action",01Jul2020,1
370,"This is going to be long but can I please have some advice! Please don’t make any judgemental comments as I’m already hating myself and depressed..

I’m 25 and I’m in a “non-serious” relationship with a much older man. (He’s 48)

Our relationship isn’t serious, when I say this we both agreed there wasn’t a future but for now we are labeled as girlfriend/boyfriend.  We work together in the same place, our “relationship” isn’t the best... long story short we’ve been with each other for 8 months and I’ve fallen head over heels for him but I don’t think it is the same for him, he has a lot of issues (insecurity and jealousy) mainly because of my age and he’s scared Incase I’m going to leave. There’s pros and cons in the relationship and one of the cons is that he’s very two minded about me and our relationship. He keeps saying things like “You can find another boyfriend this weekend, I don’t want people thinking I’m trashy for dating you, I don’t want you advertising us on social media (even though everyone at work and families know about us), I don’t love you.... but only a few moments later he says he loves me.. he basically plays mind games with my head. I found out he got an escort back in December and was looking to get them for his Bali trip that was scheduled in May but that cancelled due to corona virus. I found this out due to me being on his laptop and his google account is linked on his phone, after I found that out in April and being very heart broken I continued to move on and sweep it in the past because he says we aren’t serious and he never did anything back in December (I know he’s lying) but anyways fast forward to the other weekend...

I went to the pub for drinks, by drinks I mean I had 10 schooners in 2 and a half hours. I have a problem with alcohol (I’m currently getting help because of this weekend) and I blacked out before I even got to my partners house.... by blacking out I mean I have ABSOLUTELY NO MEMORY of what happened after I left the pub...  I woke up at 3:30am with a bloody nose, bruised face and still drunk. I checked my phone and was like what the hell happened, I apparently cheated on my boyfriend with another work friend... we kissed and done other stuff (not intercourse) I absolutely have no idea what happened, I didn’t even know what happened and I seriously cannot remember at all. I felt so embarrassed, ashamed and guilty that I did that. The reason why I have a bloody nose is because my boyfriend walked in on his..  I feel so guilty, ashamed and hating myself after what happened, I could NEVER do this sober or in a million years.. but why did I do it black out drunk? I didn’t even find the work friend remotely attractive at all and never would I think I would of ever of gone there..

But my question is... how do I stop hating myself for cheating while black out drunk, I feel like a slut, like I exposed my body... I cannot even remember... I got the blood nose from my boyfriend throwing a coffee table and it hit my face (he didn’t mean to do it apparently) all I can remember and recall from the night was me looking in the mirror screaming with blood down my face...

Since this happened 3 weeks ago, me and my boyfriend have been alright and he’s been super nice to me and haven’t mentioned it really since it happened which is good but I don’t know why, I know I need to leave him... which I am and I’m seeking therapy as we speak. But I can’t stop thinking about what happened, it makes my stomach turn. What makes a human do that, am I a bad person??? 

The other work friend and my boyfriend aren’t talking, I’m not talking to the other work friend we’ve blocked each other on social media so we can both heal... he’s finding it really hard and feeling guilty because he remembers everything (he was drunk but not as drunk as me)",01Jul2020,1
371,"I've found many Hispanic people to be rude and bitter towards me for no reason, even when I am 100% friendly and kind towards them. I'm a straight white male in my early 20s, and I feel like they don't like me simply because I'm white.

They look at me like I'm ""not them"".

Also, they speak Spanish to me while I work and expect me to know it. I don't speak Spanish because I live in America which is an English speaking country, obviously. I say ""Sorry, I don't speak Spanish!"" and they quietly seem to judge me and try to flag somebody down who does. 

But sadly, these Hispanic people have come to LA and don't even know how to speak English. That's okay because I understand it's hard to learn...but what is not okay is treating me unkindly because I don't know Spanish...in an English speaking country. 

I give them their food (I work in customer service), smile, and thank them, and they don't even bother to thank me or say ""have a nice day"". They just blow me off as if I'm a lesser human being not worth their time. To them, it's their food and I'm just an object in their way. 

I'm not meaning to rant, because I have found many hispanic people to be super friendly and kind. But where I work, it's frustrating because these people just don't seem to have any patience or understanding that I'm not Spanish-speaking. 

I just need advice on how to handle this. Thanks!",01Jul2020,1

She yelled at me and threatened my job at my last shift after I messed up making one drink (I asked a coworker if I filled up the entire cup with ice to add to other ingredients in the drink. He said yes, so I did but there must have been miscommunication so there was way too much ice). She yelled that I should know better by now, even though I’m still quite new, and that I should have asked for help, which I did. Also repeatedly asked “can you read” in the same manner as “are you dumb” over and over. None of my coworkers like her because she does this to everyone if you make one small mistake.

Idk why I would do that even. I don't think like that, I wouldn't want to do that sober. I barely remember the events leading up to my arrest. I feel like a fool.

379,"Hello Reddit! I have a dilemma and it's very hard to find relevant information using Google so I would really appreciate some real human responses.

I am currently 24 y/o and I work as a Shift Manager at a fast food restaurant. The smiley one that may or may not be related to an old farmer. I have only been in the work force 3 year or so due to some personal stuff. I dropped out of high school due to it and got my GED when I was 21 and proceeded to get a job. They accepted me instantly and I started as a crew member. About 6 month go by and I am recommended to becoming a manager. I take that of course.

6 more months pass and I am promoted to ""People Manager"", which basically means I do scheduling for my staff. It's been maybe two more years and I am still in this position. My General Manager does like me &amp; she has recently stated she's going to become a training supervisor, leaving her position open. I can't really say why but I know for a fact I won't get her position so I am trying to find another job. 

This has turned out to be extremely difficult.

I make a very low salary of roughly 27,000-30,000 a year and in my position it's considered surprisingly good but I know I can't keep living like this. I am paying all my bills and necessities and trying to save as much as I possibly can(roughly 22k so far). I feel like I'm going absolutely nowhere and I am not even sure where I can start looking for a better job. I use Indeed regularly to search but I just can't find a job worthwhile that actually pays a decent salary with my experience.

I am contemplating going to college just to get some kind of degree &amp; get something decent paying. I don't even know what decent is considered. 40-50k a year would be a fantastic start. Going to college is the last thing I want to do but if I have to then I have to. I can't find anything interesting subject wise I would go to college for, which makes this a lot more difficult for me.

Sorry for all the rambling, I'm just trying to explain my mindset and my situation. I really need some kind of career. The only experience I have is basically 2 years of management. What can I do? What should I do?  I feel like 24 is so far into my life and I have made no progress towards a real career. Where can I even find one at without a college degree?

i've never really had a place that i called home. my mom would move us from house to house every other year for reasons i have yet to understand (and we're moving again next year lol but it won't matter much since i'm going to college)

obviously college isn't my entire life. it's only 4 years out of what's hopefully going to be a long, fulfilling life. but i don't know where to go.

part of me wants to go to a big city (not LA since i already live here and it can be really toxic), like new york, where it's guaranteed i'll have a crap ton of fun every day because in big cities there's always something new. but another part of me wants to be somewhere that feels like home, like a school that's more local and reminds me of how i grew up, sunny weather year-round, going to the beach...but i always find myself questioning why i want to stay, where i live in an emotionally abusive household or the fact that i hate hot, sunny weather and the beach and *valley girls* (which are the absolute worst).

i guess my question is, where do i belong? how do i find out where i belong? are there places that can give me sort of a mix of what i'm looking for? honestly any advice anyone has will be greatly appreciated.

388,"I have been babysitting a family for the summer. (I have babysat many families before this one and even helped with ""problematic"" children so I have experience).

The kids are very spoiled, at 4 and 7 they get whatever they want. Both have the latest iPhones and iPads, get weekly presents that cost hundreds of dollars.

They are very disrespectful and confrontational. Anytime they can't get what they want ( they ask me frequently to buy them new toys, Starbucks, make up etc) they start kicking, crying, refuse to listen. I have been kicked and slapped before. If we are outside or on the train and they become upset they start throwing their belongings while screaming.  Worse of all, the 8 year old screams frequently anytime she's upset (even for very little things such as her brother got a candy in school and she didn't). By scream I mean top of her lungs just constant screaming, sort of what you see in movies when someone gets kidnapped. 

For the first time yesterday I had enough and I asked the parents for advice. I was supposed to cook them dinner. The 8 yro asked me for potatoes. Usually she likes them however this time she said they were disgusting and refused to eat them. I tried some and they tasted the same as usual. Immediately she starts crying and saying she wants ice cream. I tell her she needs to eat dinner first. So she yells at me she will have corn. I prepare corn and once again she says it's disgusting and she just want ice cream. I tell her no. She starts screaming at me. And says she will have pasta with cheese. I make that, but she says that I mixed the cheese in the pasta already so now she's not going to eat it. I tell her I'm not cooking anymore because it's getting late, and she's not getting ice cream unless she at least tries the pasta.  She starts ignoring me while she keeps screaming and crying and throwing toys. It's late by now and I still need to bathe them and get them to bed. So I get the 4yro in the bathtub, but she refuses to go. When she sees I'm playing with her brother in the bathroom she becomes even more upset. She runs to her room, slams the door and keeps screaming and crying. 

I text the mom asking for advice, she says shes coming home anyway. So I get the brother to bed and start cleaning up the kitchen which admittedly is a mess after having to cook 4 different meals between her and the brother. I clean for the most part however I don't have time to wash the stove and tidy up the toys the girl threw before the mom gets back.

She messages me 10 min after I left, saying how her daughter is not picky, but I don't know how to cook for her (she never had problems with my food before). She says she is angry that I tried to force her daughter to eat something she didn't like and I should have just made it correctly. She then goes off at me for not cleaning the kitchen (I had apologized about that when she got home)

I know I'm not the only one to get exasperated with the kids because the swimming teacher that comes to their private pools to give the kids lessons also has commented at how these kids are very difficult, but the mom always defends them saying how they are just bored of the lesson.

Today she asks if I can go babysit even though she told me I had a free day at the beginning of the week. I'm very uncertain at what I should do. I will look for another job for sure, but I don't know what to do or how to act around them in the meantime.",01Jul2020,1

I was going to stay in the car but needed to use the bathroom and followed into the house behind them. My brother and sister went to the living room to check on the dog and I went into the bathroom to brush my hair. Keep in mind that the bathroom door was halfway closed and my siblings didn’t hear me enter the house or know I was there I guess, my bad for not saying anything. Suddenly my brother ran screaming to my sister that someone was in the house, and they both freaked out. I, not picking up on the fact that he had seen my shadow moving in the bathroom, ran down the hallway to my siblings, mortified that someone was in the house that wasn’t supposed to be. I guess me stomping loudly down the hallway out of sight didn’t comfort them and they both screamed and ran to the back patio. At this point I’m terrified someone could be attacking them or could appear around the corner at any second. Finally I run to the living room and they both see that it’s me. After we put our hearts back in our chests it was almost comical, but damn I’ve been on edge all day. It wasn’t fun hearing my brother and sister scream so legitimately in fear, and understandably so, if you had seen a shadow in your bathroom when nobody else was around then heard running from the hallway.

I’m in need of a strangers guidance

I am a man in my 20s who is in love with another man. We are both closeted. I never in a million years thought I would come out to anyone because I have an extremely homophobic family and am from a very very tiny town filled with homophobic people. 

This man doesn’t have intentions of coming out because of his job. A job where many aspects of the public eye see him and doing such can and more than likely will shadow him from his career. Hard to explain with the consideration of anonymity. 

I am bi. I have been with many girls and a few men. As much as I have tried to stop it, the thoughts and feelings for this man are impacting me on levels that can barely be imagined. 

I’m lost. I don’t know what to do. I’ve always wanted a heterosexual marriage, with kids, and a life that is “the norm”. But, this man came into my life and changed all of that. 

My mental health has been put through the ringer over the past 8 months of knowing him. I don’t want it to be this way, but love is so f****** stupid. 

Any advice for me? And please, I know this sounds stupid and possibly an insult to those who have life a million times worse than me. But I am just broken, lost, and needing guidance.",01Jul2020,1

For a while, I’ve wondered about my sexuality and our relationship and I don’t know what to do. Our relationship dynamic is going to be changing soon; we’re going to be long distance.

He’s my first serious relationship that I actively sought out. I find him attractive and the thought of leaving him makes me super sad at times, mainly when I’m alone, but when I’m talking to friends/family, the thought doesn’t bother me as much. Lately I find myself fantasizing about women more. I only usually get off to lesbian porn as well. We’ve had sex before and I enjoy it because I get to be intimate with him and it feels good for me, but I don’t enjoy making him finish by oral. I prefer just cuddling to kissing or sex, too. I know this might just sound like relationship issues, but I don’t feel comfortable telling him this because I know it will upset him. 

I enjoy being around him and the thought of not being with him makes me sad, but I find myself wondering what it would be like to be with a woman sometimes. I know things will be harder for us in a few months, as I won’t see him as often and we’ll both be surrounded by new people. I don’t know if this is an issue with my sexual identity or an issue with my relationship, or a mixture of both. I know this would upset him if he ever found out. I feel like such a bad person for having these thoughts. 

I worry that I’m just “bored” of our relationship and that if I do end things with him and explore my attraction to women, I’ll regret ending things with him. But I also don’t want to hold myself back, as we’re both still young. 

I don’t know where to turn or what to do, so some advice would be great please.",01Jul2020,1
397,"Brief context;

I’ve decided to change my job due to a toxic coworkers I’ve been working with for 4 years. Mostly I’ve been ignoring his rude behaviour and avoided interacting with him as the job requires very less communication. 

He has been the most weirdest and hateful person I’ve come across and if the job wasn’t as easy he wouldn’t have lasted here(it’s a night shift as a security guard). Anyways I really want to tell this guy off because in the beginning he tried to get fired and made homophobic comments,even though I’m not gay it really pissed me off that he assumed I’m gay. Destroyed the day shift guards food in the cabinet and tried to get the blame on me, he is a 40 year old mentally unstable person for doing that. I’ve tolerated it for 4 years and tried ignore it because at the time I needed this job,due to the easy nature of the job which suited my physical injury of the knee,but now I’m changing jobs just because of him because I can’t stand his face as he is very toxic to be around. No one else would work with him for a day, and I’ve tolerated him for 4 years.

I want to just tell him how much he was an asshole to me, I was only 20 when I started this job, physically handicapped and that he tried to get me fired. I want to tell him that he is a piece of shit and a crazy person. Should I just leave quietly or tell him off as I’m leaving the job?",01Jul2020,1
399,"throwaway account because i don’t know what to do. i don’t really know how this works. this is probably going to be very long, advice will be much appreciated, feel free to ask anymore questions.

Me: me, obviously (18F)
A: my boyfriend of 2 1/4 years (20M)
J: my friend (18M)

I met A when I was 16, we got into a relationship pretty quickly and things, for the most part, have been going pretty well. He’s really helped me with some major issues in my life, particularly my self esteem and BDD. He’s the only guy I’ve ever been with, sexually.

We’ve had some pretty big disagreements recently, there’s two main ones:
1) A believes he has a right to say the n word. We are both white. I’m not trying to justify this, but just to give some context: he doesn’t say it to black people or openly in public, but I know him and a group of all-white friends use it between themselves. He’s the type to sing it in songs, justify himself by saying “my black friends said I could”, and that he doesn’t believe a word should have power like that etc. I don’t consider him to be a racist person, but we’ve had arguments about this to the point where I’ve been in tears, and this nearly led to us breaking up about a month and a half ago.
2) He continually hangs out with this girl knowing it makes me uncomfortable. Again, I feel context is needed here: I haven’t attempted to ban A from being friends with any girls ever (I have complete and utter trust in him). I just have bad history with this one. My last boyfriend cheated on me with her (she knew we were dating) and her ex cheated on her with me (I stupidly believed him when he’d told me they’d broken up). She’s also physically assaulted me in the past, and it feels like she has a score to settle, so it seems like she’s trying to get close with A purely to get at me.

My other problem is that I go off to uni in a few months, and lately I’ve been feeling like I’ll regret going to uni and being in a relationship and feel like I’m missing out on things. I’m only 18 and I don’t think I want to spend the rest of my life with one person. I love A but lately it’s started to feel exhausting rather than exhilarating.

This is where J comes in.
I’ve known J about 2 years, but only properly for the last year or so. We’re in the same friend group, being the same age and at the same school. We’re also going to the same uni. I consider him to be one of my closest friends.

Recently J has started acting slightly weird around me. We get along really well when it’s just the two of us, and when we’re with friends, but whenever A is there he becomes very insular. 
About a week ago, me, J and two other friends of ours (not A) got high together, and we were relaxing in the park. I tend to become very “touchy-feely” when I smoke, and so J and I were lying back, his arms were around me (lockdown has eased where I live) and one of our other friends jokingly commented that we looked like a couple. He went a little weird after this. A couple minutes later I got up to go to the loo, and one of my friends who was there later told me he asked if I was always that affectionate when I get high.
He’s also been recently alluding to being upset about something, but won’t tell me. The most I’ve been able to find out is that it involves me and him, and that he’s scared to tell me because he thinks I won’t be his friend anymore.
In short, I think he has feelings for me. Unless I’m being totally narcissistic and self absorbed.

Now here’s my issue. I think I like J back. I can’t stop thinking about him, we get along really well and I just want to be with him all the time. However, I’m worried that I’m just getting bored of my current relationship and seeing J through rose coloured glasses because he’s something new. 

I’m scared to leave my current relationship because I’m worried I’ll be throwing 2+ years away for nothing. We’ve been talking about marriage recently, and A has said he wants to spend his life with me, but I would want some sort of ceremony to celebrate and he doesn’t believe in any “capitalist celebrations of feeling” as he says. I feel like there’s a lot of issues that we don’t agree on, and I’m scared to commit so much to someone at 18. At the same time, I feel like I might only be staying in the relationship because it’s safe and comfortable, which I don’t want to do. I’m also worried that I’m having an emotional breakdown and might completely regret ending the relationship later. Every time I think about ending it I break down in tears.

I’m also scared that I’m completely wrong about J, and I’m going to fuck up my life for nothing. Thoughts?",01Jul2020,1
400,Hi I’m 19 years old. My boyfriend and I recently broke up and he helped me out of a shit home situation when we first got together. I ended up having to move and fly back home to my mothers due to coronavirus and I could not afford my own place at the time we broke up. My mother has changed a lot and she is much worse. I was hoping when I moved here I could focus on my future and get some shit together so I can get my own place and be a real adult ya know? Well she is obsessed with this guy and everytime I ask her for help getting my licesne she interrupts me to talk about giving guys head. She leaves her house at 2 am to meet up with guys while her kids live here. She still treats me like a child and doesn’t show any efforts to help me get back on my feet. I feel like if I stay here I will end up being stuck here for a long time. Oh and I found meth in her house and she told me she had a party here and someone left it like what the hell?!? There is children in this house. Anywyas my ex boyfriend ( we are still very very close and best friends basically ) offered to buy me a plane ticket to move him with my best friend and her husband for a few months to get on my feet until I can get my own apartment. Because she offered and I talked to him about it. I’m scared this will be the wrong decision. My mom is gonna flip out on me if I tell her I’m leaving. And I’m scared of my best friends living situation and being a burden on her. I don’t want her to feel like I’m invading even tho she offered me the place. I know as soon as I move there I’m gonna start applying to jobs and saving all my money to buy a car and an apartment. But I’m also aware that takes time. I don’t want to end up where they want me to move out and my mom not letting me move back in. She is my best friend of 6 years tho and I know the environment will be better and I’ll be happier over there because I’ll be able to be my own person and make my own decisions . Sorry this is so long if anyone can give me some perspective that will help.,01Jul2020,1
401,"Due to all of the COVID-19 stuff going on, and a lot of admissions processes being screwed up, I was thinking about delaying my graduation in order to take classes at a nearby CC to fluff up my GPA as much as I can before applying.

The biggest positive would be the schools I was looking into really pay attention to undergraduate GPA. Thus, if I were to take the classes after graduating, they wouldn't care as it wouldn't factor into the GPA. I already looked into the courses I would take and how I could be productive during this time. To add to that, many of my fellow 2020 graduates are telling me that they're struggling in the job market, and let's say I did graduate in December. What would I do the remainder of the gap year?

On the flip side, I'm not sure if it's a bad move as I technically was supposed to graduate in the Spring and delayed it to fall by taking a quarter off. My parents are extremely concerned on that point alone. With the uncertainty of COVID-19, I'm also apprehensive of doing something where I may impact my ability to *ever* graduate. I did ask the registrar and they said the re-admission process is fairly straightforward. However, I guess my apprehension is more towards how my parents will react to me trying to do so.

404,"I was singing anaconda with my friend (neither of us are black) and I accidentally said the n word.

But no matter the circumstances, it is not right at all. I know that I'm absolutely at fault in this situation.

409,"I'm a bisexual man, though have never physically explored that side of myself, or told anyone I'm bi.

On the run-up to my wedding two years ago I was really struggling knowing I wouldn't get to explore being with men. On my stag do, a friend who has always had a thing for trans women in porn casually said ""I'm pansexual"". One of the reasons I never came out was because I was worried about how my friends would react, so to hear my friend casually admit this made me realise I could have been acting on my feelings for years and my friends would have been fine with it.

Later on I was sat with my friend and started joking around with him - saying stuff like ""we're all a bit pansexual"" and saying I'd give him a blowjob. I took the joke too far by jokingly pretending to reach for his dick and laughed, and also closed the door to the bedroom we were in so we were alone. I got a real rush of adrenaline saying this stuff to him. Nothing further happened, we rejoined the group in the kitchen and we laughed it off the next day.

Since then I've been racked with guilt - even though nothing happened, I feel like I cheated. I feel like everyone on my stag do will feel like my marriage is a sham and they all might think I'm secretly gay. Every time I make my wife laugh I get a big pang of guilt as I know she'd be really upset with what I did. I keep having mini anxiety attacks replaying the incident over and over in my head. We have a 4 month old daughter now so I think the lack of sleep is playing a big part, but I get ashamed of myself thinking what she would think when she's older and knew what I did.

I have thought about talking to my wife about it, but I think I should spare her the upset and just keep it to myself.

How can I overcome the guilt of what I did? I'm trying to focus on being a good husband and father but it feels like I've had a big cloud over me for the past two years and i can't shake it. I hate myself for what I did.

I (15) got called by my mom at 7:37 this morning to wake my brother (17th birthday yesterday) up for work. I had been knocking on his door for 1 minute, then i realized that the door was open. I went inside, greeted with the neglected dog he has, but never cares for. I kept telling him, he needed to get up to work. He got angry, telling me ""I am up"" even though he still was under the covers. The comments kept getting angrier. Stuff like, ""If you don't leave my room, i'll destroy you"" (doesn't quite translate well to english. Anyway) i probably did it when i answered back ""It's half eight in the morning. You're in your underwear. As if, you can even hit me."" He charged at me.The fight started. Bla bla bla.( there was very much contact. I think our goal was not to beat eachother up, Atleast not me. It was to immobilize eachother, so the other person couldn't get up.) It ended with me squeezing his head, so he couldn't get up, and him bleeding from some orifice in his face. (Most probably his nose. He's prone to get nosebleeds) i yell ""ARE YOU UP? ARE YOU? SAY YES! SAY YES AND I'LL STOP."" He never said yes. But he calmly said ""You should probably stop. You're getting blood on yourself."" (As if he wasn't losing the battle) I didn't realize it until now, that he was bleeding. I didn't see it. I smelled it, and felt it running down my arm. I stopped. He headed to the bathroom, washing himself. I myself went for the upstairs bathroom, washed my hands. Changed my shirt. And went outside with the dog. (I know my brother won't do it himself) I went inside. I saw my brother walking out of the bathroom. I went to apologize, and said ""look. I'm sorry. I'm willing, not to tell mom, if you do the same"". He turned to me and said ""Shut your fucking mouth"". I went to my room. I'm still here.

416,"I made a post regarding my situation on r/amitheasshole, and the consensus was generally mixed, so I feel as though there’s a better way to go about it. 

So recently I moved in with him and his mom, like, two days recent. To preface because there was some confusion, his mother is aware we are sexually active (even makes jokes, we’ve had the “talk”) but wants us in separate rooms to sleep in. She doesn’t care what goes on during the day or even at night; just for us to physically sleep separately, and we have and plan to respect it. 

Tonight we ended up doing the *deed*, and that being said, it didn’t satisfy me fully. This is an extremely rare occurrence for us, but it was much easier to solve when we lived separately, as whoever was frustrated went home, and no hurt feelings. We have a very strict boundary in our relationship regarding having the other person do anything sexually when they’re not in the mood, due to a previous relationship in which I was very, very frequently pressured/guilted. He understood and although there was some confusion/upset because I took longer than expected to *satisfy* myself and eventually giving up, it’s since been worked through.

The biggest issue was me asking him to leave to his room. I wouldn’t mind him being there if he was helping in any way, but I also would never want him to do anything after he’s expressed he’s done for the day. I thought I handled it correctly— I politely asked him to give me a few minutes of space before we cuddled so I would have a clear head, and told him what I was going to do. He seemed kind of hurt.

He's had a hard medical history and it's a true miracle that he made it until his 70s.

Here's the tricky thing: his entire farm (and I mean MASSIVE farm with a lot of territory) is not mentioned in his will. That means that by law it automatically will be passed to someone that we don't want it passed to. This person would probably sell the farm for a dime and we'd lose so much money and possibly a future for the rest of his family.

His health is still bad and we're honestly so scared that he won't be here by next month. How can my dad talk to him about passing the farm to someone else while he's sick as hell.

422," 

I have been working at my current job for just shy of 2 years. I was hired as an out of state lateral (7 years Military Police) at a university as a patrol officer. My FTO and intro into the civilian policing world was 3 months. 

Since being hired I was accused of making a student uncomfortable because I told him not to prop open the dorm doors, as they are entry controlled via key cards and he made a complainant. I then made a traffic stop on the same student for driving with no head lights and striking a curb, not realizing who was driving till after the stop. I was placed on administrative leave for almost 3 weeks and told 6 hours before my next shift I had to work. I was wrote up after be told not to worry about it for a driver wife yelling at me and tell her she need to leave after she began interfering with a traffic stop after her husband said I cut him off and he began tailgating in my patrol vehicle (told her this in a not so nice manner and tone, didn't cuss or get disrespectful thou). 

More recently I was suspended for placing a student in handcuffs after dispatch had told me the owner of the vehicle had a warrant during a traffic stop, come to find out after him saying he was the owner it was really his dad and he and his dad have the same names just reversed for First and Middle, after telling the student he had a warrant, apologizing letting him out of handcuffs and offer him on the spot to make a complainant, giving him my business card and badge number, he never did. My command found the video after 4 months and suspended me not for un-arresting but for not telling them about and not confirming the warrant. I referred to my FTO training for warrant confirmation and they said no excuse. My fault but then a week later they admit to a relative of mine within the department that they FTO did not train me properly nor did they after me telling them I didnt feel fully trained up.   
Earlier this week I witnessed a road rage incident where a car was tailgating and laying on the horn and I flashed my lights at the car. The car that was tailgating backed off then began to tailgate the care sounding the horn and the lead car brake checking them. I began to follow the car that was tailgating and it appeared that both vehicles were headed to the same parking lot to park in an apartment complex. I initiated a traffic stop on the tailgater to separate them and the tailgater on a verbal warning. The next day I came in the next shift,  and told my chief was upset that he did a traffic stop amidst all the chaos going on with policing, specifically stating he felt it was a frivavlas stop. Going back through our weekly logs I noticed that other officers have conducted stops throughout the month.   
I have been told for several months and by several officers in the department that my chief is trying to fire me and i should start looking elsewhere for employment and they believe I should contact an attorney for a hostile work environment, failure to train and discrimination as I am a vet and currently inthe reserves, (comments have been made in the past about my military training dates and my prior active service that are demeaning and that they are unwilling to train me because of my service)",01Jul2020,1

439,"I moved to Philly back in May and paid the girl who posted the craigslist ad my first month and deposit. It's a room in a house utilities included. She said upfront that she doesn't own the house but the owner gave her the power to handle it while she was in jail.

Two weeks later, owner shows up. Owner had just gotten out of jail (for drug related stuff) and was supposedly clean now so she wanted to be the one to collect our rent (in all, there are 5 of us living here, 2 of which are a couple, who were the ones who rented me the room in the first place). When the owner left the room, the girl I rented from said not to pay her anything because she won't pay any bills and that I should keep paying her. I have my move-in agreement in paper from the girl I saw day 1. I was told to never let the owner into the house myself.

Anyway, this weekend, everyone else was out. I was in my room and the owner pounded on my door. She told me to come out to the kitchen to talk. She had 4 older people who I'd never met before with her. Anyway, she asked why I didn't pay her the rent and told me she was kicking the girl and her partner out because they're liars and all that fun stuff. They eventually leave and I'm just confused as to what I'm supposed to do, when I get a call from the girl. She's pissed that ""I let her into the house"" and ""if anything's missing you're paying for it."" I didn't let her in.

Anyway, owner girl comes back Monday. It's just me and the girl from downstairs (not the one I rent from) home. Owner is changing the locks and bags up all the girl and her partner's stuff and puts it on the curb. Cops are called the second owner got here to sort this out. Owner successfully changed locks and the girl/partner are home before cops get there pounding on the door. Eventually they kick in the panel in the middle and unlock the door and beat the owner girl up. Cops FINALLY show up.

Anyway, cops were there for about an hour and basically told owner girl she can't kick anyone out without a legal order. Owner girl is entitled to the rent. She was told to go to landlord tenant court about it and the next time they get called here, someone's getting locked up. She's coming back today to collect rent.

So... I just need a place to live for a month really. I'm waiting for a personal legal matter to resolve itself (which it should by the end of July) and then I can get my own place. I don't know whether I should deal with the insanity here or find a place for a month.",01Jul2020,1

Recently, we went to Target and we were looking around and all of a sudden, my grandma just asks what color Apple Watch I’d want. I, very much confused, just said black and asked if she was dead sure she wanted to buy that for me. I have a working watch that I’ve had for a while and wear all the time. I can’t go anywhere without knowing the time (the last time I did it actually triggered a panic attack) so I never take it off. She said she was sure and that it was a Christmas present, and birthday present combined for the holidays she missed.

I’m grateful for it of course, but I really love my old watch. It’s a simple $15 digital Walmart watch, but I really like it and it’s simple enough for me. Plus, I can wear it in water so I don’t have to worry about taking it off when I shower and losing track of time. I’m not sure I’m able to do that with such an expensive Apple Watch and I’m not sure I’m willing to risk it. So, I just wanted to ask if it would be rude for me to wear both watches?

441," 

At  the end of january 2020 I (male, 19) got into a relationship with a  girl from my university course. Both of us were pretty broken, me  struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts and she with depression  and anorexia. It was supposed to be a friendship+ thing, but we soon  developed feelings for one another, or so I thought. I was deeply in  love with that girl, and she told me she was aswell, but she never had a  relationship before, due to her being scared of losing ""freedom"" in a  relationship.

It started out  pretty well and she soon met my flatmate, because we spent most of my  time at my place. They became really close friends while we were still  together, and I got scared of losing her, because it had happend to me  before, but when I told her about that, she reassured me that nothing  like that would happen.

Nevertheless,  my fear grew every day and paired with the depressive phase I had at  that moment, I started to hate myself more and more every day. I barely  ate, slept or drank, only waking up to drink alcoholic beverages or to  smoke cannabis, just to numb my feelings. At some point I couldn't take  it anymore and called a doctor, and the next week I was sent into a  psychiatry.

I was recovering and  actually feeling better and better every day. On may 19th I talked to my  ex for the last time via telephone. She told me that she couldn't do  this whole relationship thing and wanted to stop it. She still wanted to  be friends with me, because she stilled liked me as a person. I agreed  and we hung up.

The day I was  released I went back to my flat and did nothing, because I was still  feeling lost a little. My flatmate returned around 1 am and we talked  about everything, also about my ex girlfriend. During the conversation  he then told me, that they had slept together on the night of may 19th,  and that they had started a relationship, and as soon as I heard that  something in me broke.

Since then I haven't talked to this girl, but even though it is already july, it still bothers me so much.

Before I continue, unfortunately in the current conditions I'm in I think I won't be able to afford a psychologist... although I really want a  professional to help me go through this, but this option is not available.

OK, time for the actual post. Like many people I have a lot of issues, however, I didn't make this post to discuss them because I think they're boring. I think that I'm running out of excuses to be lazy and it's time I do something about it.

basically whenever something ""bad"" happens that could trigger my anxiety or rush unnecessary adrenaline in my blood I seem to spiral very quickly into depression and in order to ""lighten"" the ""bad feelings"" I have, I just waste HOURS on YouTube, Reddit, and pornhub. I THINK I'VE SEEN ONE TOO MANY YOUTUBE SKETCHES AND I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. lol sorry. anyway.

 This has reached the point that I've been using the internet to cope with my issues instead of building a more natural immunity against problems. Also don't get me started how shitty I feel the days after jerking off, I just fucking hate myself.

Now since quarantine started I've had a list of things I wanted to do, some forced by college and others are hobbies or skills I've been meaning to tackle. nonetheless I've been procrastinating so hard that I've literally done nothing in weeks except help out in the house (trying to show my dad that I still have my shit together) even though I've been falling behind in my own personal life very badly.

Cutting my current brain supply of dopamine or whatever the hell I've been addicted is going to fuck me up because this isn't the first time I tried to tackle this shit. Obviously previous attempts did not work out for the long term.

I really want to change my lifestyle, I seriously do it's so sad how much I enjoy being on pornhub, like it's so fucked up I don't get it :'/.

So this is where I need your help Reddit. Has anyone gone through what I'm going through? if so what have you done to stop yourself from simply opening pornhub on your browser or re-installing Reddit or browsing YouTube. any advice you have on this manner I'll probably put into serious consideration, I know I have a problem which is terrible coping mechanism, and I realize I have a minor addiction to porn.

I used to be an avid fan of many different shows and found joy in buying merchandise and participating in the communities and fan made content. Even after things got better the feeling of not having something, even though it is simple and rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things, to keep you excited, lingered around. 
But recently, I picked up a show I used to watch in middle school, so adding the nostalgia factor, it really made me excited. Not just the fact that I like the show, but the fact that I am able to feel ""like"" and ""excitement"" for something. 
And soon enough, I found someone in the community who also had the same excitement and love for the show. We also happened to have other similar interests and had the same humor. Everything seemed so nice. But I realized that the long depreviation I had from all these good feelings made me have unhealthy reactions. I'm scared of losing it. It's starting to seep into our friendship too. I overthink about everything. I jump to the worst conclusions, just because I'm insecure they simply just don't like me anymore.

451,"I (18F) just recently had a falling out with a close friend of mine (also 18F). We had been friends for four years prior. We had been planning to move out together so she could escape her 'abusive' stepmom (or so I believed). After months of hard work, spreadsheets, and planning, we were at the final steps of moving out. It was only then that I overheard her talking to another friend of mine about how they have plans to move out with someone other than me. Mind you, I was never told any of this and had no incentive to move out and pay rent other than the knowledge that I would be helping a close friend of mine.

As all of this was going on, I was also undergoing the process of being tested and diagnosed with tourettes. This was immensely stressful and a bad experience all around because I was unsure as to what was going on with me. Around this time, my friend had decided that they also suddenly had tourettes and would do weird jarring 'tics' anytime after she saw me tic. After a couple weeks of this, I had no reason to believe they weren't doing it on purpose and confronted her about it. It was making everyone in our courses think that I was faking my tourettes and was making everything even more miserable. After confronting her about it, she stopped talking to me and ignored me until the schoolyear was over.

It was only a couple days ago that I found out that she was spreading rumors that I was abusing my current boyfriend and that I was abusing her throughout our friendship. She started posting online about it, never fully confirming my name, but making it clear to all of our friends and classmates that she is accusing me of abuse. (This is particularly bad as they had just helped me out of a three year long actually abusive relationship in which I was emotionally and sexually abused and isolated from all of my friends and peers) My boyfriend then reached out to her as she had blocked me on all platforms, to ask her what form of abuse I had caused her. She refused to give a single example of anytime I had abused her, saying that it was too traumatic to talk through and that asking her to give examples is horrific as I had caused the worst years of her life.

I cannot think of a single time I had done anything that could be considered abusive. I believe that she is justifying being called out as abuse and as a way to somehow still be the 'victim' in this situation.

Or were they real? I find both genders attractive but I only see men in a more sexual way and can’t picture myself with a female partner. I’ve only had one parter and it was a boy. I’m so confused about myself and I don’t know what to say to my friends. I don’t think that they can accept the fact that I forced myself to believe I’m bi and it’s even hard for me to accept that myself. I don’t know how to tell them. Please I need help,01Jul2020,1
460,"So my friend, we’ll call him I, has been dating this girl for a little under a year, when near the end of the relationship, she reaches out to me as his friend and we hit it off as friends. Fast forward a month, and they break up and I try to remain friends with both. However, now she has started trying to initiate all night calls and going out to get coffee, neither of which I’m sure is a good idea due to my closeness with I. I don’t want to cut either person out of my life, but they are both pulling me in different directions and I am terrified of either outcome. It feels easier to cut out I’s ex because she has been making me uncomfortable, so what I’m asking is this: Is there a good way out, or am I stuck between a rock and a hard place here? As a follow up: Is ghosting alright if all of this makes me extremely uncomfortable?

Tldr: I’m friends with my friends ex and I don’t think it’s a good idea, but I don’t know if cutting them out makes me a bad person.

Please help me, I just want to enjoy my summer without so much drama before heading out",01Jul2020,1
461,"I’ve just found out that a coworker who’s just come back off furlough, has been going to illegal raves, parties, seeing friends etc all throughout lockdown. 

I’ve only worked one shift with him, in which I didn’t have to come close to him, but from Monday onwards, I’ll be having to work very closely with him as the store is very small. 

I live with my mum, and if either one of us gets sick enough to have to stay home from work, we are as good as homeless. We can’t afford to keep up with the rent if we take time off. 

Additionally, my boyfriend and sister both have serious underlying health issues. (who I both don’t live with, but take distanced walks with from time to time). I hadn’t seen my boyfriend for three months straight and only just started seeing him recently. I can’t risk exposing them to anything at all. 

The company has put a lot of money and training into coronavirus safety measures and he’s going to undo all of our hard work. 

The manager knows about what my coworker has been up to, can I request to work a different shift from him? We are short staffed so I imagine changing the shifts won’t be easy at all.

My girlfriend jus graduated after 5 years (!) of University that was really difficult, and since she basically hates everyone there she doesnt want to go to any of the private celebrations.

Does anyone have advice as to how to properly celebrate something big when you're alone? If you were in that situation, how would you celebrate? Get absolutely shitfaced drunk, or a spa day, or what? 

Celebrating together with me is nice but its not an option as I'm away on a long trip at the moment.

eventually, M brought up the BLM protests happening around the country, specifically the looting. i said that as non-Black people, it wasn't our place to tell them how to deal with fighting their own oppression, even if we didn't like it.

M replied by saying that Black people in America are not oppressed. we got into a pretty heated argument about it, and he eventually went inactive.

M has a Black friend, who i'll call R. R and M are pretty close, and they described their relationship as basically being brothers.

i decided to message R and tell him some of the things that M had said. he asked for screenshots, which i provided. i apologized for dumping everything on him so suddenly, and said i was sorry if it changed his outlook on me or on M. i just felt like it was valuable information for him to have, since it relates directly to him. i've also talked with R separately about some of the racial inequalities that have been happening for hundreds of years, specifically towards Black people throughout history. 

R read through the screenshots, and simply said ""i'm going to bed"" before leaving me on read.

should i have not told him about M's remarks? i feel like i hurt him and majorly fucked up something big. did i? is there anything i can do to fix it?",01Jul2020,1

474,"Context: I am a female who has been dating my boyfriend for 8 years, we were high school sweethearts. For the past 2 years, we have been on and off a few different times, mostly stemming from issues with his drinking and making risky and hurtful decisions. He has been depressed for as long as I have known him, and struggles with mood swings frequently which has taken a large role in creating our relationship issues.

 A few days ago a guy I know of added me on social media. He messaged me causally about something I posted, and then the conversation was very light, easy and causal so we continued talking since then. I am currently still trying to work things out with my boyfriend, therefore we have both been respectful of that and there has been no flirting. It has been nice just to talk to someone new and get advice and perspective from someone without them having preconceived opinions. We have a lot in common and I could see us being friends. 

The issue is that my boyfriend is very insecure and jealous, some may even call it possessive. He gets upset and angry when I add other guys on Snapchat or other social media, and doesn’t trust me at all even though I have remained faithful throughout our relationship. He claims that I am “just good at hiding things”. Normally I get frustrated with him for saying this, but now since I have been causally talking to this guy and not telling him, I feel selfish and guilty. I know in most relationships it is okay to talk to the opposite gender as long as you are loyal and honest. However, since my boyfriend overreacts and has struggled with being suicidal in the past, I fear that telling him would hurt him more than not. I haven’t been able to eat or sleep for the past few days because I normally don’t lie or hide anything from anyone, especially him. Am I doing the right thing? Am I being completely selfish?",01Jul2020,1

Ok hey im new. Hope im doing this right. (Posted this in friendship but i thought maybe this section is more appropriate.  

My (25F) best friend of about 7 years(26M) has a gf. They’ve been together for about 2 years. I knew gf before she and best friend got together. (They did not get together thru me.) Gf threw surprise party for best friend recently. I found out, on the day of, thru social media. Gf claimed it was a limit to how many people could be there. Some of the people there weren’t that close to my best friend. He considers me to be the only female best friend he has. I feel like gf doesn’t like me and did it on purpose even tho she says it was only because of the limit. 

Background info: i’ve always tried to be respectful of the relationship because i know people get jealous or suspicious. I used to always include her in convo if i talked to him on the phone and she was there. (A little annoying but i wanted to be nice. Over time I stopped tho.) I’ve disagreed w/ her about a post on social media in the past. It was polite and fairly trivial so i thought it was no big deal. (She was making fun of someone and i thought it was rude.) But maybe it was a big deal? Idk. Also she’s a teench bit controlling/manipulative w/ him.

478,"Hello there! This'll be a long one.

TL:DR - Difference in views led my grandma to accuse me of stuff I haven't done and won't do + told me she didn't care about my feelings since I didn't share her ideas of religion.

So, I need to give you a bit of backstory:

I am not religious but religion is something not important enough to bring up. I rarely get in to fights, even peaceful conversations based on religion and I never initiate them.

That said, I do have a set of strict principles, some of which ire -&gt; no tolerance for double standards and trashing others behind their backs. 

Story:

My grandma came for a sun-cream type of medicine for her skin. Then she brought up church and how this, that, and that shouldn't be able to go there because they don't go to church all the time. I asked her why was that a problem for her. I even told her I'm not trying to set her off, I was genuinely curious.

Then things escalated after she accused me of things I have never, ever done. Basically, she told me I'm the kind of person who'd refuse to get together with people who are religious and that I don't really have a moral code. After telling her that my ex was religious and I wasn't - we just didn't debate it - her response was ""I didn't know that"" but she still stood by her idea. She seemed like she wanted to see me as the worst evil because I wasn't sharing her views. 

After a few such questions and accusations towards me, I told her she was quite a hypocrite for telling me what kind of person I was (even if 80% of it was her idea based on me not being religious) all the while she was trashing everyone behind their back while agressively putting the idea of ""love and acceptance"" onto many. 

Then came her response ""Well, I don't care about your feelings and emotions"". I asked her to repeat it. She has a habit of constructing sentences really badly/awkwardly so I thought she did that too. Nope, she assured me she knew what she meant. 

I am really easily angered. I am not a patient person. But I was so saddened I just sat quietly. Before I could say a thing, my mother came home and I just went on my way. 

Now, I know Reddit loves the ""cut contact"" idea but I'm not sure that's a solution. It might be, but I'd be glad before I do something along those lines and possibly fuck up more relationships in the family than this one.",01Jul2020,1

481,"So I (M 18) have been talking with a girl on Snapchat, who lives sort of close to me in the US, about how we should meet up and have sex all day. While I have no problem paying her, I do have a problem with whether or not this is a good idea and if I would regret it.

First of all, I have never had sex, a blowjob, or anything, besides for kissing a few girls. While she knows I am a virgin and is okay with that, I am not sure I would be okay with the shame, embarrassment, regret, that may come with me losing my virginity to a prostitute. I don’t believe losing your virginity is a huge deal but it is memorable. I see this opportunity as a fun new experience that I would never forget and I think I might find it humorous down the road that I lost my virginity to a prostitute, but also maybe not.

Second, I’m worried about meeting with a stranger that I met on the Internet, let alone one that I’m gonna have sex with. We agreed to meet in a motel in Ohio so I’m not as worried about this meetup being a trap or something. I don’t drink or smoke so I’m not worried about being drugged and I would have my own food, water, and condoms that I would bring for myself. My main concern is what are the chances that something takes a turn for the worst and how bad would it be if I got caught?

Please let me know if you have any advice on my predicament. Any and all advice on what I should do is welcome and I will try and read through every reply. Thanks in advance.",01Jul2020,1

Then the pandemic hit and the appointment was postponed until further notice. 

I just received the paperwork for the screening in the mail and due to covid my partner is not allowed to come with me.

The only times I have been in this hospital was when we were losing our daughter, so the idea of having to be there on my own, wandering around trying to find my way, is extremely anxiety inducing. 

To top it all off there is a 5 hour wait in between my last 2 appointments, but also 3 hours of appointments before that, so I don't feel it's fair for me to ask my SO to wait in the car for me.

It should also be noted that I work in a bistro where an entree is about 30$ (not cheap) and that I work for my uncle who offered me the job.

486,"I moved from my hometown of Portland, Oregon to Washington, DC in November of 2018.

For some context, I originally moved for a guy I had been seeing for only 6 months. We had one of those fast, deep connections and I was emotionally invested. Long story short, I also wasn’t finding full time work in my field and DC had a strong job market, so when he mentioned moving here for his job, the conversation led to my move too. About 3 months after my 2500 mile journey, he told me he “just wasn’t feeling it” and I was left to my own vices. As if a breakup, new job and move wasn’t difficult enough, I ended up getting jumped by two men getting off the bus one evening who assaulted and robbed me, creating a cascading effect of credit card fraud and drained bank accounts. 

I am naturally a positive person. I always try to “look on the bright side of life” as Monty Python puts it. But my spirits were dampened most of 2019. I felt as if the universe was trying to tell me this wasn’t my path in some weird, spiritual way. 

I spent almost the entirety of 2019 just trying to manage my roller coaster of emotions and finances, make some friends and feel normal again. When 2020 rolled around, I told myself this would be a new year to reinvent myself and find happiness and gratitude for the things I’ve accomplished thus far. Then the pandemic hit, and you all know the rest.

Everyone kept telling me that a big move will come with its fair share of challenges, including feelings of loneliness and isolation, but now that the pandemic has ultimately shut down the city, finding a positive  mindset has become increasingly hard. The friends I’ve seemingly grown close to have become harder to reach (I know everyone has been handling this differently) but I often hear about them getting together in small gatherings at the park, FaceTime etc. without me. It seems as if many of them are focusing on their long term friends which I empathize with and understand.

I guess I thought after this long I would feel more connected to my environment, have a stronger sense of community and be less self conscious about my decision to move here. But even pre-pandemic, finding likeminded friends and kind, inclusive people in this city had been a challenge. 

I guess I am seeking advice from anyone who has moved away on their own and essentially started from scratch. What were/are your experiences, and how did you managed and cope with any stress or loneliness? Any kind words of encouragement are also appreciated.",01Jul2020,1

After that it got worse to where I shot the dog with a bb gun but hes not dead so the cops came took me to a pysch ward and after that it was ok until I hit and stomped the building managers face next to my apartment mostly because some asshole from Baltimore is just annoying me. But fast forward to something a little more recent I got looked at some hispanic punks (the ones you see in los angeles) they looked at me and i asked what's there problem and they said something like you what hood you're at? So I told him I dont give a fuck if this is ms hood you think you're tough because of a faggot ass clud called ms? Next thing i know i said something racist to piss him off and got knocked out. And after a couple mins some guys helped me and the security guard said this isnt right? And the other guy said just go home I'll walk you there. After that people just laugh even more at me hiding their laughs was more like it. So yea pretty much summed up the 4 years of harassment and embarrassment.

Even some platforms from my own country didn't provide me any income, and frankly, I don't think I do such a bad job, since I've gotten a few gigs in the past, which earned me around 500$ total.

494,"Hello! I’m 13, and my parents officially split when I was 9. My dad used to be a alcoholic, which caused their relationship to strain but after my dad saw me having a panic attack in school from not wanting to go home to them fighting, he immediately went to rehab and he had been sober ever since. Since then, he’s married to this nice girl who we are gonna call K. Recently, my dad has brought me a iPhone 11 as a graduation present. My mom became furious and claimed he should be buying clothes instead of phones. I agree but the problem is, my dad gives her money. She is never pleased. He just told her he wanted to congratulate me on graduating but my mom got very vocally with him over the phone. Today, he announced he wanted to take my friends on a trip to the mall for my birthday. Once again, my mom became furious. He sends her 350-450 dollars almost every 2 weeks for clothes and other things for me in general. My mom never thinks it’s enough. I feel anger towards her. I can’t have fun once in a while because she thinks everything is about clothes and shoes. For my birthday, him and K also wanted to get me a “surprise present.” We all know what it is, an Apple Watch. I always wanted one. I overhear them talking about it. Now my mom is threatening him and saying she’s gonna put him on childsupport. I am disgusted with my mom. I just want her to stop being rude to my father.

499,"Not long ago I got a new job, it's rather responsible, so before I start working on my own I have to spend 2 months with someone every shift.

I had a shift with this guy some time back, he was ridiculous and I had a good time with him. He seems as a nice person and loves his job. We had things and common and I spend my first shift with him laughing. 

He seems to like me since he said he coudn't wait for another shift with me, he also remember my name. I didn't think much of it, when he told me today. He also mentioned he has a wife and a daughter. He is about 50 years old.

The reason behind me posting this:

He has already been making sexual comments on women that passed by around the place we work at before. I just giggled when he says ""This mommy could use some D"" among other stuff like that.
Later, he told me he was accused of ""wanking to young girls"" when he worked at school. I felt something was wrong with him. He would tell me about watching women with skirts and trying to get to see more than he was supposed to. What shocked me the most was that he took his camera and started taking pictures of women/girls  he found attractive, zoomed it as much as possible (to the parts of the body that interest him the most), so then he  could use them as ""nutting tool"" as he calls it. 

Writing this I am not sure if he is doing anything illegal taking such pictures. I am not sure if I  am just being a dick posting this, because he is just a normal guy who has his ""needs and desires"" or if he is a actually someone able to perhaps rape someone and  if I could help prevent it.

506,"Tl;Dr gay friend doesn't know where to meet men, doesn't know about STDs, wants to sext anonymously. I don't know how to help. 

Yesterday my friend and I had a four hour long conversation about sex. All kinds of things came up. 

Culturally, he can't be gay. He feels like he'll be okay being in the closet for the sake of his family forever, but considering he's never even held a boys hand I think it's too soon to tell. I think when he meets anyone that he wants to share his time with, I think not being able to share that person with the rest of his life will be painful. 

He also has some opinions about women's sexuality compared to men. He thinks things like ""men just want to hook up"" and he can't distinguish the word relationship from sexual relationship, or romantic relationship. I feel like to some degree, most people at least know the person they're going to hook up with. 

He wants the experiences of sex without the relationship, for a couple of reasons, I think. One is family. The other is for the sake of convenience. 

And after talking about it, he's got some odd expectations. 

We talked about going to a club together (because neither of us has a clue about how gay men meet) and he thinks the first guy that comes up to him is going to look like Drake, will happen to not be drinking, and will take him back to his place right away and sit on his face. I am not embellishing. 

He's got some really high standards. 

I brought up a concern. He's afraid of contracting a disease from a butterfly brushing up against him, but he thinks he will go ass to mouth with a sexy stranger he's known for less than an hour? 

I think I might be the only person who has told him condoms are for more than just preventing unwanted pregnancy. He didn't know you could get a disease from a blow job or a rim job. He didn't know that it's really important to practice safe sex because of STDs. I thought he was joking when came across as surprised at that information. 

He also wants to engage in some kind of sexting relationship with someone but doesn't know where to go, how to do that anonymously.

Edit: he also thinks it's really important to not appear inexperienced because no one wants a virgin. That...doesn't make one bit of sense to me. He IS inexperienced. He's never done anything with a guy, also, is virginity is not as highly coveted in gay men as it is in women?",01Jul2020,1

508,"I've always had this issue, but the last year or two it has ramped up drastically and become difficult to live with. It used to be mostly just at nighttime - I'd need the TV on to sleep. Otherwise, I'd start thinking of things I was afraid of - mostly death - and then become more and more anxious. 

The last year or so, it has become worse and worse. At this point, even driving with music is sometimes too ""quiet"" and I need to have a podcast or something going. I can't cook food without TV on in the background. I can't sit at the dinner table without reading while I chew. At this point, my only truly silent times are when I shower.

514,"I think this is going to be really long. I am really stressed out and sad about my cat. I have been crying all morning because I don't know what I'm going to do. My cat is a year old and he is spraying/peeing everywhere. He also is anxious/depressed and losing fur. He is a black cat so it looks really bad. He is confined to my room since he pees on everything and I think that is why he is stressed. I will let him outside sometimes but not very often. He does like it I think. He hasn't been outside for more than an hour at a time, and I've always been right there with him. 

We looked up ways to get him to stop peeing. It said getting him fixed could fix the problem but you have to do it when they first start spraying. My dad said it was too expensive and I think we've waited too long now. He doesn't seem to get how much I care about him. He keeps joking atound and saying we could take him to the Humane Society or pit him outside. If my cat is gone I don't think I would even want to come back to my dads house. My cat is really the only reason I go over there. I love him just as much as any human. 

I think it is too late to get him to stop peeing. I've tried several things and I just don't think I'm going to get him to stop. And I think I'm going to have to put him outside. I will hardly ever get to see him. And I won't be able to snuggle with him or give him kisses. As soon as I get to my dads(which is every other day), I get on my bed and he jumps on me. I hold him and he loves kisses. He has such a strong personality that I love. I definitely have him spoiled, but I love him so much.

We don't live in the best area of town and if I let him out I'm afraid he will get hurt. There are big dogs and lots of other cats that aren't the nicest. What if he gets hurt or runs away? Our neighbors are very nice either so idk what they might do. I don't even know why I'm writing this. I just always pictured my life with my cat. I pictured me moving out of my parents house and it just being my cat and I living together alone. I pictured him being the only pet I will ever get. I will never get another one after him.

Sometimes I regret getting him because he could have gone to a better family. He wouldn't have been hurt as a baby(he accidentally got stepped on and we all thought he was going to die). I stayed up all night with him crying. He ending up being fine. We have been through so much together. But if had never gotten him he wouldn't be anxious. I just don't know what to do. I feel selfish for making him anxious just so I can have him inside. And he pees on everything. Idk what anyone will tell me besides just put him outside but I'm scared to lose him.",01Jul2020,1

516,"I just got a new position that I'm super excited about. It's technically a contract/part-time position, it's in the digital marketing field and fully remote. I interviewed last Thursday and got the offer on Monday of this week with a start date of next Monday. The issue is that I'm going to be a bridesmaid in my best friend's wedding on Saturday of the same week that I start, meaning the rehearsal is that Friday.

We're starting the onboarding process on Monday, but since it's part-time hours, I could probably work up until I have to go to the rehearsal that Friday but I'm just not sure how to bring this up/approach it. I'm getting my official contract and documents to sign today, would it be appropriate to bring it up in an email when I get the contract? I couldn't find an appropriate time to say anything when she was giving me the offer but I'm also not sure if it's right to wait until next week when we officially start working either since that seems like a last-minute notice. It seems like a casual work environment (the director of the company mentioned she's not a fan of 40 hour work weeks or 9-5 style working), so that might make this all easier, but I don't want her to feel like I'm taking advantage or anything this early on.

517,"I need advice on what to/what not to do. This started about 9 months ago before they started dating. The girl and I had confessed that we liked each other but the next day I kinda got cold feet and realised I didn't want to be in a relationship, I was only really physically attracted to her. 

So it got left there and a few months later she starts dating one of my friends, not one of my best friends but a friend within my circle. I'll admit at first I was kind of hurt but I got over it very soon after and didn't really care.

The issue starts a few weeks back where she started messaging me. It had nothing to do with me, more to do with her mental health. I might come across as a dick to most people but I generally care about people so I chatted with her for a few days and she seemed to feel better. Although, while talking to her I very slightly got the impression that she still liked me. She even admitted to me that she had told my friend (her boyfriend) of our previous chat where we said that we liked each other. Although, I had no idea why she would do this, like why would you tell your boyfriend that you had liked his friend for ages? This definitely explained why he was off with me for some reason while they were dating and she even admitted that she thought he never forgave me for it. 

As time went on I got a greater and greater impression that she liked me. Always nicking my stuff and aiming things towards me. If I ever said I wasn't going out to meet with my friends and her and her friends she would beg me to come. I think even my friend got a sense of it because it wasn't like she was really trying to hide it. She would still message me from time to time, although not explicitly saying anything.

Then one day she kind of hints about her mental health again to me, about how she feels lonely and sad. At first, I just told her to talk to her boyfriend about that but she refuses. I tell her just to let her feelings out and I'll see what I can do as we had in the past, and she admits that she ""wants me"" but not in a relationship, more like Friends with Benefits. I'll admit at the beginning I definitely got carried away but even from the beginning, I said that nothing would ever happen while she was dating my friend or anyone for that matter. I also said to her that she probably wants me because she feels like she's missing something from her relationship., so I told her to talk to her boyfriend about that, although she just carried on the conversation with me. As I said, at the beginning I got very carried away, I know this is no excuse but I had also been feeling quite lonely for a while and a girl saying that she wants you late at night when all the hormones are flowing, definitely got the better of me. We spoke kind of sexually with each other, although nothing serious. More like she wanted me in a sexual way but with no specifics. I made sure she knew that nothing would happen between us and constantly told her to talk with her boyfriend but she dismissed it all. 

The 2 sexual things that I said was that I wouldn't say no if she sent me nudes 'accidentally' and that I have wanked over her pictures. I also said that what we can do is just make a pact that if neither of us is dating anyone and we still felt the same way then we'll do it, but other than that nothing would happen, and she agreed to that. Other than that, some sexual things were implied, although not explicitly between the 2 of us. All the time making it clear that nothing was going to happen and that she really needed to just talk to her boyfriend about how she was feeling. 

The next day I definitely had a lot more sense and realised that I should just end this. At first, I said that she could still talk to me as long as everything was toned down but she said she didn't think that she could tone things down. I then said that we wouldn't have any contact in at least a week so she can talk things through with her boyfriend and see if she really had those feelings. I thought there were 2 possibilities, 1. That she was just missing something in the relationship that she thought I could fill or 2. She was trying to find a way out of her relationship. I thought by giving it a week I could see which one it was. She agreed to give it a week and I thought that finally, it was over. 

Not even an hour later she messages me again. Saying that she could never speak to me again and so I said ok just block me and I'll do the same but she said that wouldn't fix anything. She said that the guilt had hit her really hard, I was confused because we hadn't really done anything and agreed to not talk anymore. Now I realise she felt guilty because she had feelings for someone other than her boyfriend. She said she needed to tell him, I told her not to because she'd ruin our friendship, that was already shaky because of her. Also, we literally hadn't really done anything but again, thinking about it, she felt guilty about wanting me. I just said we can just act as if none of this ever happened and just move on, in a couple of weeks it'll just be something for us to laugh at. Then we just agreed to not speak to each other.

Again, I thought it was over, but no, I got a message from my friend and I was just like FUCK. He sent me a quote, which was ""Trust me I'd never want to step on 'friends name' toes or anything like that, I would really hate that."" Which to be honest, I thought it showed how I didn't want to do anything while they were in a relationship but apparently he didn't see it that way. I had a short conversation with him where I just tried to go along with what he was saying, constantly apologizing and trying my hardest not to argue, even though I knew she had twisted a lot of it to make it seem like it was all my fault. I just stopped messaging back as I knew we weren't getting anywhere and thought I'd give him a few days just to cool off, although he definitely is not one of those guys. 

I just feel like there is nothing I can do, I know what I did was a massive dick move but I know how much I tried to get to her to tone it down, know that it wasn't going to happen, and the number of times I told her to just talk to her boyfriend. But as I see now it seems like it was probably scenario 2 that I had put above, I was the one to take the fall for her. 

What do I do now? What can I do? Sorry for the long text, but I thought I needed to get the full story across. And for anyone wondering this was all over a 36 hour period. Thank you very much.",01Jul2020,1

521,"Pretty much as it says. I (32F) don't know what I was thinking but I let myself full on pee my bed during a little wank sesh. I was also on my period so diluted blood got everywhere as well.

I didn't know the correct way to deal with it so I sloshed on a lot of water and detergent and just ended up spreading the mess throughout the mattress to the point where it was leaking out the other side.

It's nearly a week later – I've been trying various products and trying to air it out during the day time. But every night when I snuggle down I can smell it. I've just bought some fancy new product but I think I might just need a new mattress.

My problem is that I live in a house share with three other people. At least one of them will remember that I replaced my mattress only a year ago. If I get a new one delivered they will ask questions. (One of them is frickin nosey.)

I can think of some convenient lies but the fact is I am so desperately mortified I don't feel like I can handle the situation. I have anxiety anyway and this is starting to stress me out to a ridiculous degree.

You can also smell the pee just going up the stairs. I feel like the smell is spreading. I don't know if anyone has noticed yet.

I was brought up that masturbation is an awful sin and dirty and gross. I know this sounds dramatic but I feel like I've had my comeuppance. The shame is huge. As you can tell by now, this is not just about the dirty mattress.

523,"God, i feel shitty about myself. I don’t know how to stop this feeling that I’m not enough, that i could’ve been enough but that I’m not.

We (MF30) were together 2 years, broke up 2 months ago. 

We had such a fun and fantastic relationship. Lots of ups and downs though. We were both immature, he had to learn to build better boundaries with people, and I had to learn to take responsibility for when I was wrong.

He really got into self-development. I’ve always been into it, but not as passionate about it as he was. Eventually he felt I wasn’t changing at the rate he was, and broke it off with me some months ago to “find himself”. He had some good points - I needed to learn to have less expectations and manage my insecurities on my own, rather than dump them on him. 

We kept talking, to maybe try again as we really loved each other, but he kept being more demanding about how much I should change and how fast (I guess he was tired by this point). I still slipped up and was insecure. He eventually got fed up, and said he wants his partner to be responsible for her own happiness and to be a propagator of happiness in general. It was an out of character statement to make, so i wondered if one of the people he became friends with through self-development courses was a girl like that.

Sure enough, I saw that he befriended and started liking this one girl’s stuff. She is very into self-love, improvement, being better, taking control of your own emotions and not expecting much of other people. Exactly the kind of stuff my ex always talked about. Her captions are all motivational and inspirational, and he has liked all of them. I’ve since unfollowed him, but just yesterday I checked her insta again.

He has liked every single selfie she has posted. Every single one. He never used social media too much before and definitely didn’t used to like too many pictures people posted. With her, it was all of them. The latest one she posted an hour before I saw it and he had already liked it. He wrote some encouraging messages under one of them. She started gushing about how he is making her see more about herself and how she’s discovering more awesome things. I’m assuming they’re in frequent contact and he is sharing all those self-discoveries with her that he felt he couldn’t share with me.

It just made me so sad. I don’t know if the relationship is platonic or not, but it seems like she is exactly who he needed me to be, and he found a quality in this girl I couldn’t provide. So he probably sees her as better.

I don’t know how to feel. How can I get out of this depressive state? Blocking them won’t help with the feelings I’m already experiencing that I’m inadequate. 

If anyone has some words of either encouragement or realness, I’d appreciate it.",01Jul2020,1
524,"Some backstory might be needed for this story. I have recently adopted a bunny and have been slowly introducing it to my two kittens. I've been monitoring their contact with each other. One of the kittens, A, figured out he could go behind the bunny's cage to lure at him without him noticing. I have been trying to discourage this behaviour.

Yesterday A did this again, however this time my brother was in the room. My brother is 21, quite a bit older than me, I'll refer to him as B. I was trying to get A out from behind the cage and B was trying to help. When we finally got him out, he ran into a boxfort thing I made. B tried to get him out so he could kick him out of my room. A bit my brother, which made my brother unreasonably angry. He shook the box as he yelled at the cat. Then pulled A out by his front paws as he hissed at B. He hit A a couple times and then held him really close to his body as he repeatedly yelled ""I am the boss here. Who do you think you are."" He then carried A downstairs and continued to physically punish him. B was stopped by my dad, who told him to never touch A again.

Now here's my internal conflict. I sat there and witnessed it all, I did not physically interfere out of fear. I told B to quit, but tried to do so in a gentle voice in fear of him lashing out at me. He did not stop and I still did not interfere. I feel like an asshole. A is fine now, he is skiddish towards B. A is not a violent cat, he is very kind and a little bit of a coward.

I think that, because I did not interfere and stopped the abuse, I am an asshole. A can't stand up for himself and needs another person to do so. But I also know I was afraid, I didn't want to get hurt too. I feel like letting a pet get abused because of my own cowardice makes me an asshole.

I really could use some advice on how to cope with this as well as how to prevent this in the future.",01Jul2020,1

how am i even supposed to deal with this;

well, tbh, to be completely honest, even rn, the worst i feel, in my heart, i still have this hope, the reason why im still going on normal and sane,  is that i think/hope its just in my head. 

i dont even know anymore;

well, the things i obsess over, i def have never seen in other people;

and that's another thing that i guess helps

kinda

like, the way my nose extends, there's no way i'd see it in at least one other person. and i've seen lots of people; even on the internet;

and also, the fact that like 9/10 people at least say that im attractive

and, i know, yall might be like, then whats the problem

honestly, the issue here is what i stated above

i could be perceived as ""unique"" looking, i dont even know

im not sure

but, honestly, like, i hope not. its my fear

and i dont even know why it is this way, but looks are like my number one priority (one of them forsure) in life, so if i dont feel good in terms of that, then everythings fucked

im 18 too btw

528,"
I’m 17, going to be going into my senior year, and I honestly have no clue what I’m doing when faced with college matter and what I’m going to do or where I’m going to do when I graduate. 

Right now I’m in the middle of my parents year and a half ongoing divorce that I’ve been dragged into and it has me really fucked up right now. 

I’m living with my dad after he guilt tripped me into lying to the lawyer that “it was my choice” after the judge gave the order for the parents to switch in and out of the house every other week. So one week I’m living with my dad in the same room in the basement of my older sisters house with 4 other people. I’m really shy and have people problems but I’m also very depressive and uncomfortable the entire time and can’t get anything done while also having to sleep in the same bed as my dad even after his lawyer and my counselor said he shouldn’t be doing that but he still does it anyways and just pushes me to lie for him.

 He talks non stop, acts like an entitled brat when we’re out and always wants me to watch movies with him, or when he wants to go out he’ll drag me with him and get pissed off if I don’t want to go, Is always being really loud even though I have problems with Noise, and overall just doesn’t give a shit about my wants or feelings and cares more about himself, yet whenever I say anything He gets offended and calls me ungrateful and complains how he’s the only one that has to deal with this shit, even while I often have to make up for his mistakes and I often get called up to get things for my older sister or watch her toddler out of nowhere at random times or even to randomly watch my cousins as I’m basically the family babysitter.

But yeah, dad has absolutely no respect for my privacy or space and often mom will dump off my little sister there too, so we’ll end up having 3 people in one room and me feeling incredibly uncomfortable and trapped with anxiety. Then every time we have to move in and out, dad brings a ton of stuff with him and I end up having to carry most of it. 

Then when We’re back at our own house for a week, I’m immediately the maid and mom. I’ve been taking care of my 9 year old sister since I was 8 when our own mom neglected to take care of her. But I also do a majority of the house chores and work, Cleaning, cooking, laundry, while dad claims all the credit and tells everyone he’s doing everything which really annoys me. 

Whenever I try to say something he’ll go off that I’m just like my mom, I only want to argue, That I want my little sister to end up with my mom and get raped and this and that,  even call me a bitch and the most ungrateful kid he’s ever seen and sometimes even attack my friends which really pisses me off at that point, and how he’s the one working and paying the bills and we don’t have to worry about anything. Meanwhile he refused to even acknowledge my existence when I was growing up and discouraged any of my own thoughts or feelings and belittled me and refuses to even try to raise my little sister right and chooses to bribe her so she won’t say anything bad to her mom, and about the work part, I can’t work. For one, the house work and taking care of my sister takes up a lot of my time, My schedule is very unreliable and the only vehicle I was supposed to get when I was 16, got sold by my mom and dad doesn’t trust me to use his car even though he’s home all 5 days of the week since he works on weekends. Both parents definitely can’t raise kids right, but in this whole thing dad’s the “lesser of the evils” so it’s really the only reason I’m putting up with his shit for the most part, so my little sister doesn’t end up with our nutcase mom. 

Anyways, onto the college stuff I’ve been leaning more towards going into something science or business related since I have the most experience in those things (from classes dad also pushed me into taking instead of ones I was actually interested in.) but dad wants me to go to the community college nearby so I can stay home for 2 more years And because it’s really cheap after he said he wanted to pay for my college, especially after mom took out all of the money that was in mine and my little sisters savings. 

But I have more of a feeling he only wants me to go to it “because it’s cheap” since he’s been boasting to everyone how he’s been taking care of us and is going to pay for my college and stuff. But even after looking into it, it doesn’t support the things I was wanting to go into at all or barely. It’s mainly focused around agriculture, nursing, and trade. But anytime I’ve mentioned anything other than it, dad’s gone off on me and gets all fucking pouty like some child and gives a passive aggressive attitude with the “well it’s your choice I guess and I can’t make your choices for you if you decide to make bad decisions by taking student loans you’ll never get rid of-“ and etc. I just can never tell when to trust his opinions because he Acts like such a know it all even when he has never even experienced any of those things. I’ve even talked about college to my counselor who went straight to a 4 year college on student loans and the way she put it, it isn’t as bad as it’s always made out to be. 

Bad thing is, I don’t understand how any of this works at all and I’m absolutely terrified also since mom barely graduated an 11 month course in 3 years and dad went to a trade school for 2 years and doesnt have any actual college experience. I’ve been considering going into the student loans route, but I’m just really stressed and scared I’m making terrible life decisions especially after dads kept going on about how terrible student loans are and I’ll never pay them off and really discouraging me from going towards that path. And I still want to stay relatively close to home so I can be there for my little sister since I can’t trust dad at all to raise her properly with his childish attitude and temper. If I could take her with me I definitely would, but I don’t even know how I’ll handle it all myself.

I have very little work experience and not much to show for, so I’m really worried about working, but I’ve still really wanted to since I turned 16 to get the experience But I wasn’t able to get my license until only a few months ago after mom stole my paperwork. Any plans I ever made to try to improve myself, gain experience, and build myself as a person just got flushed completely down the drain as soon as this divorce started. 

I like to think I’m responsible, Im very tight with money since dad and mom often borrowed money off me a lot that I saved up, my gpa at the moment is 3.49 mainly because of my depressive states in my freshman and sophomore year when I was too depressed to care. I don’t have much of a problem with grades though when I do try and score pretty high on testing, so I think i can at least try to raise it as much as I can in my last year, and when I’m on my own usually I can figure out things pretty good. My only real big problem is my bad social anxiety, a lot of self doubt,  and occasional depressive states. I want to get away as soon as I can, but I just don’t know if it’s the most logical or best benefiting option for me? Or maybe I’ve just grown to be too dependent on my dad because he’s always forced his opinions on me and tries to make my decisions for me? 

What should I do? Should I change my plans and go into the community college and transfer from there since it’ll be easier to stay at home and help raise my little sister and save up for 2 years until I can move out and just choose to deal with my emotionally and  verbally abusive immature father longer? Or plan to take out student loans for an actual college and try to manage on my own? 

Also, any advice or tips on college or self managing on my own in general will be greatly appreciated too, since I feel like an absolute idiot for being so uninformed about college matters and living on my own while it seems like everyone else I know already has it all figured out and I’m the only one lagging behind. 

Also Sorry if my grammar or punctuation is off. My sleep schedule has been a mess trying to avoid dad and also trying to get work done too and still haven’t slept the entire night just trying to figure out how I should write this out to try to get my point across and not be an absolute mess.",01Jul2020,1

532,"My(33M) wife(28F) and I moved into our home at the end of last August. It's an older neighborhood with an even older community. Most of our neighbors have lived there between 20 to 40 years. There have been some issues with some of them (my wife is Indian, and some of our older neighbors try, but are very obviously not comfortable that she's not Caucasian) But for the most part, it has been wonderful.

Then there's our direct neighbor. He's a real piece of work.

This is our very first home, and the day after we moved in he started to badger us to go in halfway on a new fence for the backyard. The fence is terrible and leans heavily into his backyard, but that's because he kept a canoe hitched onto it for God only knows how many years. Anyway, we JUST bought a house. Investing into a new fence is just not in the budget, but he keeps bringing it up. Little things like that keep coming up. Telling us we should mow our lawn, or our leaves need to be raked. He would ring our doorbell to tell us our leaves need to be raked. The guy took early retirement as a high school custodian, and is probably in his early sixties now, in case anyone is wondering.

But this isn't what I need advice on.

He makes my wife profoundly uncomfortable.

Without trying to sound like I'm bragging, my wife is very attractive. If I'm not around, he will make it a point to make his presence know to her. He doesn't come to our door when she's alone, but she can't go out into the backyard to work on our vegetable garden without him stepping into his backyard. In winter, if I'm at work, she can't shovel the driveway without him coming out and forcing his help on her. (This feels both insulting to her, and very creepy)

He low-key pervs on my wife just enough that she doesn't want to go outside if he is, and because he is obsessed with his lawn, he's always outside. We love to take a good hour long walk every day, but when we do, she insists we take the long way in or out of our neighborhood just so we don't pass his house.

The stress is climbing and she's at the point where she's honest-to-God looking at houses again because she doesn't feel safe in her own skin with the attention he shades her with.

To make one thing clear, he does not approach her (outside the snow shoveling, which she stopped doing because of him). When she goes out back, he steps out onto his deck and watches her. Everything he does is perfectly legal, and even if we prove the watching, he's legally in his right to step outside and sit on his deck.

Now, I don't want to move. I've never been more in love with an area of my city than I am where we live. It was an unexpected surprise to feel so at peace here. It's also the safest I've ever felt in my life, as I grew up in a high-crime area. But I also don't want my wife to have to live every day feeling caged in her house because of this creepy neighbor.

I need advice, what should we do? As her husband, what can I do to make her feel safe?",01Jul2020,1

537,"Hi. Just need an advice from y'all. I am male (gay), and I fell in love with my male bestfriend. It all started when I was in college years back (I'm currently 25) and I had a friend during my first year. It's rare for me to have a male friend (my friends ratio is 70:30 female:male). He was courting one of my friends and I used to be his wingman in their relationship. To be honest, I still don't have any romantic feelings for him and I think it only started after several months of being friends with him. We are always texting each other non stop like from morning til night then vice versa. I've never done that before. There are times that I will go to his house early in the morning so we can go to our morning class together. Sometimes his girlfriend is also there making me a thirdwheel in their relationship. And even after class I will be at his home until nighttime and he will walk me home after. His family is already used on having me in their house too often.

I know this is normal to some but for me it was special. I also realized back then that I've done a lot of ""first times"" with him. I also did things that I don't normally do. 

One scenario that I will never forget is when we were walking at the mall and I saw a shawarma stall, I blabbed to myself that I've never eaten anything like that before. Then the next time we passed on that stall, he stopped to buy 2 orders of shawarma which are for us to share. It's a total turn on for me maybe because I'm not used to be treated by anyone. 

Our friendship lasts for a few years until this turning point. He asked me to accompany him early in the morning as he needs to run an errand before going to class. When we were in the vehicle, we were seating right beside each other when for whatsoever reason I felt the urge of wrapping my arm around his waist while putting my chin on his shoulders. It was very awkward but that time I was just happy to be with him. He did not react to what I did in any way. Everything seems to be normal on that day. 

However the next day, he started to avoid me totally. He even sent me a message asking me to change my facebook password (we know each other's passwords). He customized his messenger making it seem that he will always be offline on my end but he did not block nor unfriend me. 

I was able to find a way to access one of his friends' facebook account and there I found out that he was really disgusted to what I did. I totally understand him on that. That's why I kept on messaging him asking to talk to me about the issue. I wanted to say sorry to him but he didn't budge. He even replied to me once saying to give him time and that's what I did. Our school lives continued without talking to each other for more than a year.

During our last year in college, I felt the need to resolve our issue once more at least before we graduate. I tried to message him several times until he replied to me to stop being overly dramatic. He told me that we are ""men"" and we need to act like one. He said that he does not want any drama so I need to stop bugging him. I no longer know what to do on that point. I thought if I give him the time that he needed, he will surely talk to me about the issue but I was wrong. I really wanted to save our friendship but I think that he does not feel the same way. So I gave up. We both graduated and went on our separate ways without talking about that issue. 

Years after, he finally allowed me to see him online in facebook. He even chatted to me casually. Of course I was happy because I can finally talk with him like we were doing before. But it no longer feels the same way as before. I don't know if it's just me but he seems to be like a different person. He's no longer the ""nice guy"" I used to know. He became someone like a womanizer of some sort. But then again, I think that we are no longer friends. We are just acquaintances or former classmates to be exact. I know this is actually better than being an enemy or a total stranger but if given the chance, I want to be friends with him again. The same as we were before. 

So my questions are: 
Is it right for me to rekindle our friendship? 
I actually still want to talk to him about what I did that caused our friendship to break. It feels like an issue that got hidden under the carpet. I need to know what I need to do to repent on my sins. 

Is it too late for us?

Sorry for the long post. Need your honest advice.

Thank you in advance.",01Jul2020,1

Most of the others seem to be more  busy with their lives or have other things to do though, as mostly it's  the two of us chatting and playing. She's a good friend and I'd like to  think she also thinks of me as a good friend, but I have a hard time  measuring how good our friendship really is, because the reason we hang  out more often could very well be just that, everyone else is busy.  However...

Almost as soon as we  started talking, she mentioned her job and her really shitty boss who  apparently treats employees badly and that she's on ""sick leave"". It  came up again briefly later, and a third time recently, and she said she  might have to go back to work soon but really doesn't want to, and that  the past few days have been rough mentally. She also said at some point  that money is kind of tight, and I guess she doesn't have a lot of  options, I don't really know the full situation.

543,"I live in a dormitory that houses hundreds of students from various schools. The building has twelve levels, students who go to the same school are placed in the same level. On each level, there is a common pantry with two fridges that the students can use. 

Ever since quarantine started, around the beginning of April, people started to notice some of their food going missing from the common fridge. At first, we ignored it, we did not mind sharing our food, and simply thought someone might have taken them by accident. However as time went by, more and more food went missing. Chocolates, fruits, and other snacks were stolen, even though they were clearly labeled. One of my juniors had enough and reported this to our resident mentor. She sent a message to our floor group chat, warning them that if it happens again, there will be serious consequences. The next day, the thief returned the snack that they took in the fridge. It even had a note saying, “Sorry, (Junior’s name),” on it. However, food continues to go missing. More and more people started reporting when their food went missing, hoping that an investigation would be conducted, but nothing came of it. Our resident mentor sent a few more warnings, but no action had actually taken place. 

One of the latest cases happened earlier today, I had bought six packets of Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups and stored them in the fridge. When I came home from school today, I opened the fridge to see that three of them had disappeared. I was quite upset by this as my local supermarket often ran out of stock, so I do not have many opportunities to enjoy them. I am planning to report this to our resident mentor during our role call, but I doubt anything will happen. I understand that my resident mentor might be a bit hesitant to take action, as most of the students that are living here are on a scholarship, getting caught stealing will most likely cause them to lose it. But so many things have gone missing and everyone is frustrated with the situation. What should I do?

Does anyone have any advice for what to look for or what I should be doing?",01Jul2020,1
545,"Okay so I know this is the third time I've posted here, but I need help. Again. 

So a little bit ago, my mom told me I need to go do the dishes and I told her that last night after I got my shower I was going to, and then by the time I thought about it I fell asleep in my room. So long story short we started yelling at each other and then my dad killed it saying that it was too early in the morning for it. So then I started crying when I sat down here. 

I guess what I'm saying is that this is one of many subjects I get angry at quickly and I always end up crying and most of the time the fights are because she thinks I'm a total liar when I say that I really was going to do the dishes I just remembered too late. What really pisses me off about that is that she's always said I'm a very trustworthy kid. So it hurts when she uses the ""you're a total liar"" tone.

Help? Anyone?

Btw, I'm the same 14 year old girl that's posted about her bitch mother before.",01Jul2020,1
546,"Bros, im heartbroken.
I just had the interview, it went 3h...

&gt;says he was really really happy to see that I applied myself again after the last terrible interview I had

&gt;first he asks me why I was fired

Told him my mistakes, he dragged it on for way too long
said ""I think it's a shame we had to talk so long about something that happened to long ago"" he looked ""impressed""

---

&gt;asks me what I did for the past year
tell him the whole story, about me realizing I needed to change, take responsibility
&gt;he pulls up my website, that I made with raw HTML/CSS/Js (https://feedbackplz.netlify.app)
&gt;says its stupid because i could have done that with WordPress etc.
tell him ""I wanted to learn the basics before using easy methods""
&gt;says that was a dumb idea

&gt;begins to tear me apart for picking the wrong word in my CV
In my resume, I basically wrote that i ""intensively taught myself web-dev""

he decided to focus on the grammar of that sentence and asked me questions about stuff I had no need to research in-depth, then I told him ""I didn't have any reason to look into word press or PHP until now""
&gt;says that if I had intensely researched web-dev and made a website, I would have done it with PHP and WordPress, and since I didn't do that, it means I have no idea what im doing and thus I should not have implied that I know what im doing

I think he's right with that, I should have picked the right words

---

he didn't know what Dunning–Kruger effect was, but basically
&gt;explained for 1h straight that im basically that person, because I was implying that I know my stuff because i ""accidentally"" said I know ""everything"" about web-dev

(i don't know everything and I fully know that, with ""everything"" I meant I have heard of most things and tools used in web-dev)
I should have picked better wording..


&gt;Explains to me that I don't need to be good at everything I do
&gt;says that he doesn't want to be the best at what he does because he's fine with being mediocre

say ""but I want to be the best at everything I do..""
 
&gt;looks at my hobbies on the resume and asks about them, to explain what he means
&gt;Says, ""let's take photography, when was the last photo you took""
tell him at the beginning of the year
&gt;says, ""See, what's stopping you from going out and taking photos, nothing. So it's not a hobby because you don't have passion for it, or else you would have gone out and made some photos""
&gt;says ""that's what I meant, if you had passion about web dev, you would have not wasted 7 months with just making a hard-coded HTML/CSS website

Exclaim that WordPress is easy and that I could have made a good site in no time. (very stupid to say that even if true)

&gt;tells me I don't get it and says the main thing is not that I can do any of it, it's fine if I have no idea about anything, but I should not have ""implied"" that I did. 

(at this point I don't even know if it really stated that or if he's making stuff up in his mind based on his experience, because im pretty sure I also said multiple times that im just starting to learn about web-dev)

---

&gt;tears me apart for having applied for an internship position
tell him, ""I don't think I deserved a job with the limited skills I currently have""
&gt; I should have done it anyways 

at the end, he tells me I will NEVER become a web developer because he knows that I don't have passion for it.
and he reinforced that by saying that he knows that for a fact and that I will never be anything.
maybe this is all just a big trick to get me to be an even better developer, because it's working.

---

at the door he says ""make a site and send it, or come again next year, up to you, I don't care""
should I remake his company website and send it to him as a ""flex"" (its pretty bad/old)

thanks, every reply means the world to me",01Jul2020,1

So in Spetember I'll be getting married. Putting aside all the Covid-19 related stuff (very small intimate wedding with family members only) I want advice on what I should be doing to be a really good husband. 

Living together and sharing a space with my now fiancee will be very new and different. Neither of us have lived with someone who isn't a relative, and it'll be our first time living in an apartment.  So what advice can you give me to being a really good husband during these times?",01Jul2020,1
548,"I want a kitten. There are cats in my family and I love them. It will be the first pet I’ve owned independently’, you know, as an adult. I prepared and I read online and I got the stuff together and someone got in touch to say, hey, I have a kitten for you, so I was like, okay. She was meant to join my family today.

I got so anxious about it I had to turn her down. The closer it got to her coming home I couldn’t sleep at night. I couldn’t eat. I felt sick at the thought of having her at home. Her first day here. Even silly things like having her bed out or her food bowl. It isn’t ‘right’. They don’t... fit. The thought of feeding her or changing her litter tray scared me because it was something new I would have to learn to do and add to my routine (even though I would obviously do it!)
I also have massive worries about not being able to just... be. I can’t go on reddit or chill out because she might get into trouble. Maybe she wouldn’t sleep at night. Maybe I would wake up and there would be a big mess everywhere. I felt as though I’d have to be watching her constantly and really on edge. Even if she’s with me.

For what it’s worth I was also like this when my younger brothers were born, on edge, never able to relax. It was awful. I hated going to my dad’s because it was different. We had to do things differently. It was noisy. I used to shut myself away from them in my bedroom where I felt safe. Now that they’re grown a bit (9, 3) it feels better. It took a good year or so each time for me to get used to it. But I recognise I had the same anxiety then as I do now. Why?

My family say it’s just the way I am. That I struggle to adapt to change, but I should just do it anyway because sometimes things will change and I won’t be able to stop it. I am disabled, btw. My school used to think I was autistic. I did wonder if this was a part of it and have wondered about it. But I don’t think I present in other ways. I just thought I’d throw that in there.

Now I’m just really sad. I don’t feel anxious any more, but I hate myself for feeling like this in the first place and can’t really articulate why. I regret saying no but at the same time I don’t. I don’t understand people who can just... get pets. My cousin has three cats. And she just... got them. And fed them. And loved them. I don’t understand how she can do it and not feel anxious about it, but I feel really anxious and scared. I hate myself for feeling this way and I wish I could just be normal. My family are talking about me right now. I can hear them. My cousin says I’m not right in the head

549,"I'm moving out of state and found the perfect apartment at $895. But it's about $100 past my ideal budget. I can afford it, but I don't want to set a precedent too high as I'm moving August 1st and have time to wait for new and hopefully cheaper apartments to hit the market.

Thing is, when it was first listed it was about $865 which is only a little lower but a bit more workable when it comes to future rent increases and utilities. This is according to the Zillow listing history. They then seemed to hike it up to $925 within two weeks, before bringing it back down to what it is now shortly after.

I contacted the property manager when it was $895 as it is now but after confirming that no utilities were covered I decided I didn't want to compromise my budget so soon. Now, it's been over a week and I contacted the manager again, noting that the property was still up and I could pay 2-3 months in advance if the landlord decreased the price $60, and also mentioning that I have an excellent credit score.

He confirmed what I already knew that the price had been reduced before, of course alluding to the decrease from $925, and that the landlord would not drop it lower ""at this time"". Considering that this was $865 originally, is there any chance that the landlord would lower the price again? And if not, will I regret passing it up?

I'll also mention that this is in a high-priced neighborhood with prices ranging from $1100-$1300 but from what I've seen 2-3 odd apartments at a time will be priced within my budget, but none quite with the living space of the $895 apartment.

TLDR: Perfect apartment $100 out of my budget. What should I do? Thanks in advance for any advice.",01Jul2020,1

I don’t have a good relationship with my parents. It’s abusive and I just want to escape them. They make me feel like I’m not good enough and I’m just a lazy bitch regardless of the fact that I do what I need to and keep to myself mostly. 

But I have psoriasis and it gets worse with stress and my parents are my main trigger. I even had to go back onto antidepressants. 
But anyway. My parents keep saying that it’s getting worse because I don’t bath properly and that isn’t the case because my hygiene is very important to me. 

But anyway my father says my mother must but me in the bath and scrub me. I’m 20 years old. I refused. My parents then go on and on about stripping me down and holding me down while they they wash me. I was truly terrified and I hate that they’d make me feel that way. I had several panic attacks. 

Now this led me to wanting to find a way to escape. So I tried to find a sugar daddy which I’m not proud of but I really was desperate to escape them. And I was scammed out of almost 2000 and now I’m broke and scared and I owe money to a 2 people and I just don’t know what do to.

552,"Hi! I need some grown-up advice! I'm 21 and in college, at home at my parents' house. My roommate Sarah and I live together in 2 bedroom, 3rd floor apartment in the coastal swampy south where our college is.

So, after we left our college apartment in the March, I guess it got infested with silverfish. Sarah moved back down there to do summer research and has been killing several a day, finding them in her bed, on the ceiling etc. She's also found live spiders in her bed, a few ginormous dead palmettos, and 2 live small roaches on the walls (maybe Germans? She couldn't say and the pics are bad). We are super clean and have no clutter, so the classic ""clean out your cardboard clutter boxes of magazines"" type advice is not helpful. We've never had a problem before with roaches or silverfish or any bugs, and she swears there's no tell-tale roach infestation signs like droppings etc. She has seen some silverfish babies though. Apartment management sent a pest control guy a week ago and it made no difference. He was there 5 minutes and did not spray, just sprinkled some powder. Sarah has been using Raid (but the organic essential oil one, I guess), peppermint and lavender essential oil, cedar blocks, and diatomaceous earth, all to little success so far. I'm very worried about her. She hasn't been sleeping well and last night she slept on campus illegally in the science building. She sends me stressed updates every time she kills something and has called me crying multiple times. Selfishly, I'm also worried about myself when I go down next week--I hate bugs and I don't want them in my bed, yuck. My father says to call an different exterminator service on our own, but I don't even know if that's legal. I can't find anything about it in the lease. 

So, can we call Orkin or whatever instead of this one dude our complex uses? Is that ever legal? What can I do to help Sarah calm down and feel better? What other ways can we use to keep the bugs out of the beds?",01Jul2020,1

554,"Please forgive any grammatical errors in advance, I am no writer and still pretty upset.

A little back story... my husband (31) has a friend (M 31) that he has known since they were young teenagers. A few years ago husband brings up that he and his friend used to hook up. I am totally cool with this, I'm glad he tells me. Eventually this leads to wanting a threesome with me, to which I am reluctant because this man is married (we went to his wedding husband was best man) but husband is always saying how they don't even like eachother, get along, or have anything in common. I guess that was about 6 or so years ago now. I wasn't very good at saying no, and was a total people pleaser. Anyway, a few months after he started bringing this up, he invited his friend over. This is maybe the 3rd time we've hung out. We're drinking, and listening to music, and eventually we do end up having a threesome. I DON'T remember how, and hardly remember it. I wake up feeling like absolute garbage. I don't say anything to husband because I got myself into this situation,  and I don't want to upset anyone.
This same situation happens again about 3 years later. 
I end up finally saying I don't feel comfortable with this and I hate how I feel after. I feel sick about it, and guilty. I tell husband I can't do this anymore. Husband is defending the act, I guess thinking it's not a big deal but I think it is. Continues to bring up the possibility of it happening again and defending the situation.  I keep saying no but I guess I'm not being stern enough. 

Husband and I get a hotel on the beach for a romantic night away from kids, he invites friend and I say I'd rather it just be us but since you don't get to see him often sure. Again, I am too nice. They both try and I actually stood up for myself and said no. 

Something like this happens again a year or so later. I say no but not without them trying first.

I am really against it at this point, and probably feeling very resentful towards them and the whole situation.  While also blaming myself and feeling immense guilt and disgust.  

Fast forward 3 years later. Husband has brought it up still a few times, I am still against it. Invites him over this past weekend , because he has a kid now and wants to play with my kids. 
We drink a few beers, and are hanging out watching funny videos and listening to music. He starts to rub my feet and I am making obvious ""please make this stop"" faces at husband . I don't think he noticed that's what I was doing,  I guess. I get up and husband asks me if I want to do this, I say no. I don't really remember much of anything else... husband says he starts rubbing my shoulders and kissing on my neck and puts his hands in my pants (I vaguely remember being shocked by this) and the next thing I remember we are all making out and I have gone down in him. I also remember getting up and leaving saying it was too late, but really because I guess I snapped back and I was feeling awful.

I woke up feeling so disgusted with myself,  and still feel that way. I am saddened my husband didn't stick up for me when I was in a serious state of vulnerability.  He keeps wanting to take about it saying things like ""what changed your mind"" I let him know I didn't want to, I don't know wtf happened and I felt like he took advantage of me. He got really quiet and wouldn't talk about it anymore, seemed annoyed I would say that.

So i guess i want to know, should i even be upset about this? I drank, and made poor decisions.  But i cant shake this feeling of being taken advantage of, and it's making me feel sick.

I wanted to help her but I think as a kid I made it more difficult especially due to my illness when I was 7 (quinces... for a year and a half... not good) anyway my mum and dad split and my dad encouraged me to go visit her every week. Which did not help my mental state. So I stopped talking to my mum for over 2 years and at 14 the next moment I saw her was in a hospital bed completely paralysed... so not fun. She got diagnosed with SLE and she had 10 years maximum 5 years minimum. Then started drinking again due to this. She doesn't live with us and lives on her own we tried to stop in and see her whenever we could but it became difficult due to work and college me and my brother were doing our best but she started buying vodka off the Internet... so she relapsed and we tried to talk to her but she denied it all... I need advice on what I can do. My mum has to be moved into a communal home (of course after COVID or the lock down calms) but I don't know how I can do this, she has social workers that I might be able to talk to about moving her for the betterment of her health.

Reasons why she needs to move:
1) she is physically killer herself. She neglects taking her medicine for lupus to drink. She's not in the right mindset to look after her body, her legs got infected so badly they were physically leaking puss, inflamed and her calves were the same size as her thighs her response ""well they are not as bad as they used to be"" she nearly refused to go in the ambulance it was so bad the ambulance crew looked shocked and worried trying to get us to convince her to get in the ambulance.
2) when we cleared out her bedroom there were over 36 large bar vodka bottles 30 of which were empty and another 6 were still full... and those were just the ones we could find. 
3) I bet throughout all this time you were like ""surley this is fake her liver and kidneys would be completely shot"" well they are she was in hospital just before lock down for kidney failure... how she is still alive scares me... 

I want to help her. I want to make her smile and be like her old self again. I need advice on what to do or what I can do. If anyone has any advice please I am desperate!

# Posted to r/offmychest under the title ""Is it possible to develop self-inflicted trauma (with PTSD or C-PTSD like symptoms) as a result of past (and present) choices?"" 

Just to be clear these were my choices and my mental state now and at that time should not have been and should not be an excuse. But I ask this question because I want to know if its possible to have developed self inflicted trauma. To say the least I have done some sh\*tty things. During my teenage years from age 14 onwards I went a bit off the rails to put it lightly. I'm putting these things so you can get a background.

Stopped really doing schoolwork and hid it from parents - lead to failing Y12 twice. Then went to college and had a lot of close calls with deadlines. Blew a whole load of savings whilst 16/17/18 buying stuff I didn't need (for clarification i'm 20 now) and a lot of that money was from my uncle and was supposed to go towards driving. Sometimes still do. And I have ghosted at least 1 person. I have avoided people if I don't know how to act and can be pretty cold and just don't stay in touch with people (like after college).

F\*\*\*\*d up a hand in with uni earlier this year (at the time was so worried I would fail was pulling an all nighter) which lead to plagiarism of some work my dad did. I cannot ethically continue with my degree even though we have been passed through automatically to second year. My dad still wants me to continue and is helping me to. I'm too scared to fess up and its been 6 months now. I want to drop out. I don't even enjoy it so why stay anyway. Also with driving lessons I have been so f\*\*\*\*g stupid because there were times I was too tired (last year) and I want to quit that too because I cannot be responsible. My eyes were literally closing sometimes. It's so messed up.

Edit: I just cringe thinking about it. I try to shove it away and not really think about things mostly. Sometimes I get into this flashback state and I feel like I have panic attacks. I just want a way out - especially with driving and uni. For reference I am living at home if that helps?",01Jul2020,1

567,"I don't want this to be too long, but I'm a 21F and I'm moving soon. I'm excited to be starting over without my parents, but I'm also nervous too. See, growing up I had a hard time with friendships. I had a best friend in 6th grade who was awful to me. Would put me down and tell people my business without my permission and would play victim when I got mad. We had a bad falling out it was an awful fight that almost got physical, it really impacted me. No joke I cried for a week

•7th grade, I made friends with a group of boys and I started dating one of the boys. One of my friends in the group started tormenting me. I moved to a different school and made friends with two other girls. I was the third wheel and I fell out with them when one of the girls let the other girl text me nasty things from her phone. Me and the other girl who texted me got in a fight because she accused me of telling a classmate about her crush (even though she was right next to me when it happened)

•8th grand, one of my friends moved, and another started hanging out with a group of girls who didn't like me. These girls hit my little sister with glass one summer, which led to me almost getting jumped lol. Anyways, my friend fb messaged me to be nasty and say she never liked me and she felt sorry for me and such. I cursed her out and I feel terrible now because she passed away last year. 

•9th grade I was friends with two girls, but they slowly started pushing me away and became closer with each other. I don't have ill feelings for them, but it still hurt 14 year old me. 

•10th grade and so on I had friends, but I never got close to anyone. 

•This is just the tip of the iceberg, I had a friend in 4th grade who was jealous of me and told my best friend who she was also friends with to not talk to me. My best friend also told me I was the ""annoying"" one in our class and in 5th grade my friend used to clown me around boys and said always made fun of me not having boobs (ironic since they're big now lol). 

Even my casual friends now that I made in high school, I'm scared to get close to them. The thought of getting close to anyone now freaks me out and it makes it hard for me to make friends. I always assume people will find me annoying or not want to hang out with me anymore, so that's why I don't want to become friends with anyone because I have this irrational fear they'll turn their back on me later or betray me. Which sucks because I so desperately want that best friend feeling again. That feeling of being able to call someone whenever I'm happy, sad, angry, heartbroken, etc. But I don't want to let my guard down and get hurt again. I'm not saying I'm perfect because I'm definitely not, but I never did anything like this to a friend of mine. Itsounds silly because I'm a grown up now and I don't want to be holding on to my childhood like that. And when I move, I want to make friends, but I honestly don't know how. I never realized how awkward I was until my coworker asked why I was so shy and reserved. I'm sorry if it's long, but can anyone give me some advice?",01Jul2020,1

Not gonna lie, I was instantly highly attracted to him (especially because he would be exactly how I describe my dream guy).  HOWEVER, I am and have been in a committed relationship with my boyfriend. We live together and have been dating for over 5 years.  I believe this “gym guy” is also in a committed relationship since I’ve seen him come to the gym with the same girl several times.  The only problem is that we run into each other a suspiciously high amount.  The town is small but not that small for us to run into each other as often as we do.  When we do run into each other we both tend to stare in disbelief but have never said a word to each other for 2-3 years.  I don’t believe he’s following me or that any of this is intentional but I also can’t help but to question if this is fate or something because of how attracted I am to him.. questioning this for 2 years has also made me question my current relationship.

572,"Background: I’ve been in college for 5 years and changed my major just as many times, partially due to recently diagnosed ADHD. I recently had to stop going to school for medical lab technology because it shut down for the summer due to the virus. I also lost my job because the small business I worked at closed permanently. Recently I got a great entry level job offer that is in another one of my fields of interest, graphic design. Unfortunately it’s only full time, so I can only do online classes, most of which my current major doesn’t support. 

However, I was originally going to school for graphic design my entire first year and was happy with that. But during the summer my parents sat me down and told me that they felt I was wasting my scholarship on it and should do something more “serious” and would make more money. I was very easily influenced by them at that age (18 then, 22 now) and I feel that the other part of changing my major so many times was that I was happy doing my original major and couldn’t settle on another because they didn’t make me happy. Every time I changed my major they made me feel guilty. 

I know that it might seem like an open and shut case, “you’re doing what they want and not what you want,” but I’m afraid that being offered this job is what’s making me want to change my mind this time. I don’t hate my current major and it felt like I made a good decision. But I’ve felt that way every single time I’ve changed my major. I’ve been able to completely justify my decision in my head and then it falls apart, so I’m scared that I’m going to do that again. But I also really don’t want to turn down this job offer.

The solutions I’ve come up with are:

1. Turn down the job and keep looking for part time work so I can keep going to school for med lab.
2. Take the job and take one online class for my current major and one for graphic design to see if I’d like to go back to doing graphic design full time. 
3. Take the job and completely switch to graphic design again, since everything for that major can be done online at my school.
4. Take the job and take time away from school to make a decision. 

I should also mention that I’m scared to take this job and have to quit in relatively short time if I do decide to keep my current major. They’re just not possible to do together. 

Which solution do you think is best? Is there one I’m not seeing? Thanks for your responses in advance.",01Jul2020,1
574,"I love him to bits and I want to spend the rest of my life with him but the more I think of all the things he has done to me (rape, gaslighting, throwing a dildo at me, kicking me, threathening to step on my kneecaps etc.) I dont know how im supposed to keep living in this relationship. Im scared if hes going to get worse if I stay. Everything he has done to me is apparently lies. All the things I remember are apparently not true.

I cant believe that I went from one abusive relationship to another. I used to date a pedophile who groomed me and now im apparently dating a guy who claims all the things he has done to me are not true. I cant have one reasonable conversation with him about our issues where he doesnt turn extremely defensive. He gave me an std (genital herpes) and now im scared that im never going to be able to find myself a man who will love me enough to want to spend the rest of our lives together. I want to commit and have a family.

The man im with is a wonderful guy but he has a temper and when he gets ""accused"" of doing something wrong he becomes a wild dog who has been cornered instead of being able to talk things through.

I would love to be able to have a mature conversation with him and id love it if we could spend more time together but he claims we spend too much time together. Basically we only hang out during the night when we sleep since hes busy playing games with his friends during the day.

Since I feel lonely in this relationship I used to have a lot of gaming buddies. Unfortunately my partner got extremely jealous about them and I ended up having to make the choice of leaving them. During that time my partner wanted all of my time continuously but now that I have barely any gaming friends and majority of the time im alone he wants to play with other people leaving me alone.

Is there a way for me to make him be the man I fell in love with again or how am I going to get the emotional strenght to leave?",01Jul2020,1
576,"Throwaway because I don't want this linked to my main account

I grew up in an extremely devout Catholic household from the UK with an older brother and older sister however I haven't been a believer for years. I've known if I was open about my lack of faith I would be kicked out of the house at 16 so I have never told anyone in my family about it. Not only that but my parents pushed me to get into med school, which I did, at the threat of being kicked out of the house and considering my parents income, I wouldn't be able to afford to go to university on my own. I also have a girlfriend who is from another country but in the UK studying on the same course I am and she may have to go back to her home country. That's where my life is currently.

I hate my course so much and everyday I get more and more angry at the course, my situation in life and the fact the even if I do finish the course, it's most likely going to be my career for the rest of my life. It's not that I'm bad at the subjects I just hate them and then I see other people doing the subjects I like and it just makes me even more mad.

I'm currently in 2nd year moving into the 3rd year and I've been with my girlfriend for the entirety of the two years, however I personally feel like I've known her for much longer than that, especially because we've spent almost everyday together on the same course. Honestly, she's the only reason why I've stuck it out this far. But now she might have to go back and it's killing me inside. Not only that but she grew up in a house similar to me but her family is Islamic and she's a non believer so I have spent the last two years hiding everything and avoiding being obvious outside for the both of us because we both know if we got caught we would be disowned by our families. 

I know I could drop out but I've already invested 2 years into it and if I leave I dunno what I would want to do and I'd also have nowhere to live as I know my parents would kick me out and I don't have enough friends to stay with myself. 

I don't want to lose my girlfriend because I'm extremely serious about her and I know she's just as serious about me. I just feel like everything is collapsing on top of me and I just feel like exploding and I have no idea what to do",01Jul2020,1
577," Hello reddit

Yesterday the flatmate of one of my best female friends told me that said friend was raped by another good friend in our friend group. She didn't go much into detail but it was very clear that it was not consentual. The flatmate asked me not to tell anyone that I know about this including my friend (the victim). I really do not know why she told me this because now I have to carry this burden myself and have no one to really talk to about this. What makes it even more difficult the bastard that raped my friend works at the same place as I do. Obviously he doesn't know that I know what he did but I can't promise that the next time I see him I won't punch him. I also want to help my friend with this but I guess I have to wait until she opens up to me about this incident.

I am in complete turmoil right now and hope this explains my situation enough. I would never ask reddit for advice regarding personal problems. But since I have no one to talk to this is my last resort...

I don't know what I hope to get out of this. I think just writing this down helped me already.. If someone has some advice on how I can improve my situation please share it with me. I am lost with this...",01Jul2020,1
578,"21M. I have failed my college course. I'm UK based and education is free. I started a college course this year and was expected to do very well. In January I got an offer to go to University for 2020/21. I was doing well in my course and had passed everything up until lockdown. My household locked down a couple of week's earlier than the whole country did due to a family member being ill. I was lazy at the start of lockdown and eventually missed deadlines. I managed to do a lot of work and almost caught up but ultimately missed the end of year deadline for work and only completed about half of the units I was supposed to. I don't want to make excuses to them but I have previous mental health struggles that my father (who now lives with his girlfriend 90 mins away) took me to the doctor and eventually a therapist for. These flared up during lockdown like they did for many others. 
Before lockdown I was at the gym 5 days a week, worked 4 days a week at a busy job and completed all of my college work on time and well. I really don't want to be the guy who uses mental health as an excuse and I don't know how much of me not doing work was due to laziness and how much was struggling adjusting to new life. 
Anyway I was expected to pass the course and move to university. My dad came out of retirement to help me and my brother with university and I feel so guilty for letting him down.
I don't know how to tell my mum (who I live with) and my dad (over the phone) and can't stop feeling nervous. I have some idea of what I will do next year to get to University I just need help telling them.",01Jul2020,1

581,"We go to a campground every weekend, sometimes week, and they keep insisting my sister and I go to friends houses all the time. 

We literally had a friend over a couple of days ago, and I went out with my friends for an entire day the other day. Not to mention, we both FaceTime our friends and play minecraft (or whatever stupid game we want) everyday anyway. So it’s not like we haven’t been social lately. But they’re acting like we it, and they’re still acting like it’s the end of the world that I stay in my room all day. (I stay in my room all day because I have no reason of coming out, and when I do, I just end up in some form of sadness, because they all fucking hate me and each other, anyway). 

They told us we can either go to a friends house, family members house or come to the campground for almost a week. If it were another time, I’d be okay with it, but right now I really don’t want to go anywhere. They don’t have any valid reasoning for why I shouldn’t stay home, other than “You need to be social. You’re 14, we’re the parents” etc. (Even though I’m nearly 15, of course they’ll say 14 when it’s that context, because they just want to give me the message that I have no power, whatever). 

I’m just sick of everything. I don’t understand why it is that I have to argue with my parents to just let me stay in my own house for a *day*. If I’m capable of babysitting someone else’s kid, I’m capable of taking care of myself, so why the fuck do they have to force me out, as if it’s good for me? It’s really not, I’m not doing anything different here then I would be at a friends or at the campground anyway.

During the proposal, i ask them what should we do for the video and they left me hanging without any respond for 2 weeks. During those 2 weeks, i create the script, storyboard and the proposal that i envisioned. After finishing it, i asked them again and tell them the rough outline of my proposal. They said it will take too much work, etc. But when i ask what they have in mind. They said they don't have any suggestion. I tell you these guys are fking stupid. Then i spam the group with 20 mins of suggestion (only i was talking at that time). N we agree to make a footage of us playing some games together on the next day.
 During that day, i had some other project/ thing to do. So, i tell them that i might be late 20- 30 mins . Sorry for late to inform you guys but we were a group of 3. After finishing my thing, i came on9 and setup a custom room for us. I called them and give the links on whatsapp. Person A picked up call and enter the room.

We've lately moved from a country to another country and ever since then I've been suffering so much. It's mostly my dad. He's been putting so much pressure on me.

I learnt to stfu and do that silently plus worry about my studies and my future (hopefully going to uni next year). How quickly messy the house can get stresses me out.

585,"Hey everyone, I hope this fits here. I really need some emotional support right now.

I'm 27, have been dealing with mostly anxiety. Despite all that, about 3 years ago, I managed to get a study place in the country of my dreams.

Now, as an international student, I am dependent on so many things; especially the university and the immigration office. I'm in a country which is notorious for its overcomplicated bureaucracy.

I submitted my thesis to the Examination Office about 1,5 months ago, hoping to get to do the defense before the summer break starts in mid July. Since I hadn't heard anything about the defense (my advisors said it takes about 2 months to grade the thesis), I decided to ask about it, only to find out that my advisor didn't receive the thesis from the Examination Office.

When I was younger, I always tried to do everything on my own. Now that I'm 27, I feel like I am at many people's mercy on so many aspects of my life. And in this case, the Examiner Office would probably be like, ""oohh yeah we forgot, oops haha. Then just graduate 6 months later, that's cool right?"" and I will have to bear all consequence. I've always known that this world isn't fair and there'll always be somebody who'd f00k you up, but I still can't help feeling really disappointed and angry that I have to bear the consequence of something that's not even my fault. And I know there's always this saying of, ""maybe it happened the way it's meant to be"" and the likes, which yeah might make it easier, but not always true.

It probably sounds childish, but I'm really, really feeling emotional. I'd really appreciate some advice.

I got used to being called ""ugly"" and to always be put as someone you didn't want to deal with. My actitude didn't help either, as I started behaving like an edgy manga character who hated everyone.

I'm almost 18 and fine now. I changed schools, I made friends, I had a couple boyfriends, broke some hearts (and other times others broke mine).

The thing now is that I'm struggling because I tend to obsess over any single boy I meet. I mean, it's like if they are quite decent looking, have great conversation and show a little interest I inmediatedly fall for them. The bad thing is that most of the times boys my age (17-18) are just looking for something casual and talk to me as well as other girls, so they don't actually pay full attention. I totally become mad when this happens, I start checking forums and videos on youtube about making them fall in love with me, I control the times i send my messages and I check everything with all my friends (as well as I sometimes talk to his friends seeking some information about what his thoughts are). Then, I would also repeat all of our physical interactions in my mind to see if there's the possibility he actually likes me and wants something serious. I just obsess. Fun part of this is that if another decent looking guy with great conversation appeared, I would totally start paying attention on the previous guy and focus on the new one (this happens almost all the time), but if not, my head just becomes filled with thoughts about him. Also, rational thinking doesn't help controlling my fellings, and I sometimes turn off my phone for the whole day because if not I would be checking it constantly (sometimes I delete whatsapp and instagram and then reinstal them, one time I was one month without this apps, until I met a new guy).

601,"Hey guys,

I will try to keep it as short as possible.

So, my best friend and I are extremely close, we have known each other for years. We constantly tell each other we are soulmates, we always look out for each other first, always doing everything together, texting good night/good morning every day, other people constantly say we are like a married couple. These past months under quarantine we both got worse at our own depressive moments, but when my best friend needed me, even at 3-4 am to call or text, I was always there. They cut a lot people off, but not me. We spoke almost daily. 

Last week I kind of got irrationally jelaous of my bff (because they decided to spend time with other friends instead of me, even though they haven’t called me in a week). I know it was toxic from me to get jealous. I am very insecure and constantly need to be reminded that I will not be abandoned. So I said some things in my anger such as “I knew you will leave me”, which I almost instantly regretted and apologised. My friend explained that they need some “me time” and not to have to constantly text me, later explained how they don’t want to talk with me right now, but assured me that nothing about our “level” of closeness will change. 

Since them we haven’t spoken on the phone, text only good morning/good night and some insignificant stuff, but nothing too personal. They get annoyed when I ask them “what’s up” or “how are you” saying that I can care, but must not ask. I am afraid my bff is growing distant and will eventually leave me. I show my support in every way possible, continue to remind them that if they need me, I am still one call away and will always be here. I am in a bad place right now and would like to know that my bff will be there for me too, but I know I cannot expect the same things that I give. I try and give them space, I know empty apologies are dumb so I try to show that I won’t get jealous again, but I feel like I am not doing enough to apologise. 

My other friends tell me that my bff acts like this because they know I will always be there and never abandon them, no matter how cold they act, and I should take a step back and take care of myself. But I know that’s not true as this time, I was the one that did something wrong (getting overly jealous and demanding)

613,"So here is the situation, my wife works in the medical field for an assisted living home and memory care unit. Almost every single day there are problems with management and sketchy things that happen. Hardly any of the staff stays very long because its run so poorly. My wife is only there still because she is under contract and still wants to break it every day and just quit.
 
So I have some questions. First, the most recent thing, all medical workers are allowed to recieve hazard pay, but she's already had a 2 day vacation planned and they decided if you have ANY days off, paid or unpaid from now until mid August you aren't eligible to receive any of the hazard pay.
 
However when I look it up it seems hazard pay is based of hours per day so is that even legal to do?

Secondly, they are understaffed. By state guidelines they technically aren't, but every day the 2 medical workers in the building can't complete all the tasks in time. But for night shift they have even more workers hired but far less to do, and by state guidelines are triple the minimum. They state the guidelines as to why they won't hire another worker for dayshift but still chose to do it for nightshift. 
 
Also she rarely gets a break to eat because of these time limits. There is no state requirement for a meal break but she works 8 hours and usually doesn't get one which can effect her and her work.
 
Is there someone she can talk to about unfair treatment in the workplace? It seems this place is just barely making it within legal bounds to stay out of trouble but is still mistreating workers (and patients but i won't go into that whole side of things here)
 
Any advice on what to do or who to go to would be extremely helpful.  Thank you!

621,"Hi everyone This is my first time posting so thank you for your patience. 

{TL;DR. Off again on again relationship/best friend For 3~years where neither partner has never had a new partner. And now that R (19) has one, told me I was their three year rebound, and that they didn't find me attractive and it’s all I can think about. I feel sick to my stomach just thinking about them. I need help forgetting about the two of them.}

I’m (18) and I have had this off again on again partner (19) (who for sake of this post I’ll call R) since freshman year. We started out as best friends for the first year, but really started to get close my latter half of sophomore year. After that we became practically inseparable. Everyone is always asking me about them, and I spent my (American) Thanksgiving Break with R's family at their request. 

R has a tendency to break things off for a few weeks, and then the next time I see them we’re together again (or at least sleeping together). I had always chalked this up to fear of commitment and intimacy, seeing as they also back out of other serious plans we had made. 

But now R broke up with me over quarantine and sent me a message out of the blue that they needed to get over me. A few weeks later we're on a call and now they’re with someone else, which had never happened before. They go on to tell me I’ve been a rebound for the last three years for a previous partner, that they didn’t think I was attractive, and that we’re just “best friends”. 

I thought I could handle it. I told R how happy I was for them, because I do actually care that they’re happy. I want them to be happy, because I know they deserve it. But now every time I let my mind wander all I can do is think about how R’s sleeping with someone else, that they never loved me, and that I was just a tool that R used for their comfort and threw me out once they found someone else. 

R also knows my Reddit account even though I wish they didn't. I doubt they'll see this, but if they do I'm sorry. This really isn't meant for you to see either. 

I just want to get over it. I want to stop thinking about R and their next Partner. I want to not feel sick to my stomach when I even begin to think about R. 

It’s R’s birthday soon. And I don’t know if I sold buy them the gift I planned on buying them. It’s only a water bottle. But still, would it be weird if I bought them one? I always buy them a gift for their birthday.

622,"Sooo I am a total dumbass and take full responsibility in the unfortunate events I've caused for myself..but I really just needed to say this somewhere because I've never gone to therapy and even though I always considered, I've never committed. Maybe someone here can advise me on where or how to move on from here?

I am a 22 y.o. male and I feel so hopeless right now. I've been in college for about 4 years. I tried transferring around 2018 Winter and was rejected because I was missing credits (literally 1). I was a Nat Science (AA) major going for CSI at Seattle U at the time and after being rejected, I kind of decided maybe I can take more classes to spend less when I actually transfer. I took a lot more healthcare related classes and was more interested in becoming a nurse. I thought that finishing the IGETC (school options +) wouldnt hurt either since I will have more opportunities. So now its basocally summer 2020 and I graduated with all the necessties for the nursing program application at my current school, and a Psych AA-T degree as well. 

Despite my achievements (not really..), I've never been more stuck because I am an idiot. I am currently debating again whether or not I should do CSI (crime scene investigation) or commit to nursing. Recently, registration processes for the next semester of nursing has been halted because of the pandemic. The nursing students who were doing their clinicals during the Spring semester are going to have to relearn what they missed out because they couldnt do their clinicals (at least for the school I was looking at). So if I wait for the next semester to apply, I'd be competing againdt even more students and there is very limited space already. 

Because of this, I've considered to go back to CSI and apply for Spring semester at a CSU (because I totally missed the deadlines). I looked into some other schools and wished I learned sooner there was a community college in San Fran that teaches it too. However, the rent would be a major pain in the ass and I really don't want to ask my family for help but definitely just don't even know if working a minimum wage job would be wnough either. But despite me finding some schools, I checked my email today and found out my Fafsa (federal aid) was never oficially submitted so even if I were to get in a school, I wouldn't really be able to afford it. I'd have to wait amother year before I can reapply. 

So what do I do..? I don't really know where to go from here. I've been so tired of school too and so much people have it worse than my situation but I am just so tired. I wanted to take a semester off since I had to wait for the transfer deadline but now it might be a year. I feel like because I got so unmotivated from the beginning of Spring and the quarantine situation.. I haven't really sought out an answer either. You can yell at me for being an idiot but I came here hoping someone could sorta lead me in a direction..",01Jul2020,1
623,"For the past few years i’ve been struggling with random bouts of hip pain and vomiting, they don’t correlate but they’re both things that I’ve been kind of shrugging off but i dont know if it could be more serious.

With my vomiting, for a few hours every couple months i’ll just throw up the whole time, it usually hits me in the middle of the night and is gone by 6-7 AM the next day, but sometimes it lasts the majority of the day and sometimes I only throw up 2 or 3 times and I can go back go sleep. The first two times I thought they were stomach bugs, but I felt like it was weird that I got them so often? And the last time I had it (a couple days ago) I hadnt really eaten much the couple days before because I lost my appetite due to some life circumstances/depression. 

My hip pain mostly happens after I exercise a decent amount, one time I did a cycle class and then ran a mile after and then my hip hurt the next day. My hips hurt after dance rehearsal sometimes, but every once in a while they’ll just hurt even if I hadn’t exercised (like today and yesterday).

625,"I'm moving out of my parent's house. I have some questions but I want to get the details out of the way first.

I'm 18M. White. I live in a moderately big town in the midwest. (State capital) My parents are offering to pay for my college at a college halfway across the state, but they are holding that over my head and have big expectations for me. I can't deal with their shit anymore and I'm pretty sure that they don't want me around anymore because I have a ""shitty personalitiy"".

I have a couple thousand in savings from retail/fast food jobs and some mangas I could pawn off (I REALLY don't want to pawn any off, but I will if I have to). I also have games and figures I could pawn (SNES, 3DS etc.) and I'm definitely okay with pawning those off but would prefer not to.

I live in a D1 midwest college town, so rent is pretty expensive. About $500/month about with roommates for most of the places I've checked. I still want to live in that town so that I can go to the community college on my own dime. I want to do graphic design shit, but if anyone has better suggestions with good rational, please drop them in comments.

1. Roommates

How do I go about getting roommates? I've asked around and I'm not sure if anyone I know needs any at the moment. Do I trust those websites or are they sketchy as fuck? Should I just ask around at my job? I have no legitimate idea how this works and I need help.

2. Phones

I have a shitty laptop that my old high school gave me, so I can access the internet provided I sit in a McDonald's somewhere. I don't want to keep the phone that my parents gave me because they pay for the data and shit. I'm thinking of getting a shitty burner flip phone, but who do I pay so that it can make calls and texts? Consumer cellular is like $25/month so I'm thinking I should go with that? Do I need a SIM card or anything?

3. Transportation

I could probably walk to a lot of places, but should I invest in a bike or bus pass? I don't have a car, but even if I bought a beater for like $1000, I'd still have to pay for insurance/gas/repairs so I think that's out of the question. If there's a way I could get an affordable car, please drop in comments

4. Income

I already work around 35hr/week but I'm okay with working anywhere from 40-60 hours. (I've done 40 before) The job I currently have pays $11.50/hr and is a town away from the community college. Should I keep it or look for a new job? I heard starbucks pays $15/hr starting and helps with insurance

5. Insurance

How do I pay for health insurance? I'm a moderately healthy 18 y/o male, so is it even worth it? Are there any programs to help me with shit like this?

6. Future

Is taking graphic design courses at a community college even a good idea? Should I just join the army? How do I go about getting a passive income?

627,"Throwaway for very obvious reasons.

I am still so embarrassed about something that happened when I was a kid, to the point where it still causes me terror now. I’ve never told anyone about this ever.

I was 5, and just started to go to summer day camp. There was a really cute counsellor who looked like one of the Backstreet Boys. I was a little girl who was desperate for affection. I grew up with parents who loved me but struggled with their emotional health: my mom was a bit removed, and my dad was overly controlling and sometimes emotionally/physically abusive (threw shit at me, spanked, pushed me around or even pretended to kidnap me for 5 min to teach me a lesson about wandering off).

All that to say, I was a sweet but emotionally unhealthy kid at day camp. 

So, we were on this city bus to a museum, and the camp counsellor started making jokes with the kids and the kids were joking back. I wanted to be super funny, and I desperately wanted to feel included. Out of the blue, I just blurted out the absolute weirdest thing: *I want to suck your hotdog*. (Wow I deleted and rewrote that a lot.) 

I remember thinking people would maybe laugh, but instead everyone went quiet. I kind of knew what it meant but I didn’t think it would be bad like that. The camp counsellor went, “excuse me? What did you say?” so I repeated it again with less enthusiasm, because it was slowly dawning on me how much of a fucking weirdo I was being.

The kids went wild laughing at me and the camp counsellors (who were really just kids themselves, like, teens) turned their backs and stopped talking to me for most of the trip.

I ended up leaving the camp the week after, crying home to never come back again.

All that to say, I can’t get rid of the intense humiliation I felt in that moment. It kind of crystallized in my mind and became a huge source of shame for me, even as an adult.

Anyone have intensely bizarre *what the FUCK, childhood me????* moments? How do you get over the shame? I’m too embarrassed to bring it up to my therapist.",01Jul2020,2

Now I am too confused whether to install Latest version that is nowadays **Windows 10 version** **2004.** Actually I have installed to one of my friend PC **Windows 10 version 1903.** He was annoyed about performance of it so he shifted back to **Windows 7.** I have researched too much about performance but still confused.

632,"I have every reason in the world to quit drinking, but I'm not sure I have the strength. I watched it ruin my parents marriage and their marriages after that. I was a bar tender for over a decade and watched peoples lives fall apart in front of my eyes. I've blacked out and said hurtful things to people I love, things I would never have said or even thought to say sober.  I've become violent and physical. It's hard to believe a person like that exists inside me, but ""she's"" there. But ""she"" only comes out when I black out. It's like I don't know who I am when it happens. And then I wake up with tremendous guilt and try to put the broken pieces of my life back together. I want to be a person that can have a couple drinks and just stop drinking, and sometimes I do. Those are the times I can convince myself that I can just have a few and be cool. I'll go for weeks or months without incident, but ""she"" always surfaces. The crap I don't deal with comes out. The death of my father, my hate for my mother, my resentment towards my husband.

You would think that would be enough to quit. It's enough to make me want to, but I have yet to follow though.

The last two time I drank, last night and three days ago, I fought with my husband. I don't remember any of it, but I became violent. I threw things, said horrible hateful things to him. Three days ago, I headbutt him in a fit a rage and last night I made him give me his wedding ring back and now it's no where to be found. Sober, I would NEVER act in such a way. I adore my husband. He's the most important thing in my life and honestly my reason for living. If he left me, I'm quite sure I would die from a broken heart. I know it sounds dramatic, but if you saw us together, you'd get it. Simply put, we are perfect for each other, he's my match and my best friend. And now here I am, ruining it, for what? Booze? Relaxing at the end of a long day? Genetic predisposition? - that's my favorite excuse.

I want to change. I've never said any of these things out loud before and I don't want to reach out to friends or family because they have no idea how bad I've let things get and I don't want to tell them. Just writing this and really admitting to myself for the first time that I don't think I'll ever be a person who can casually drink, I hope is going to start a real change in me. I have to stop.

633,"Starting off, I am a 22 y/o Male. My current job pays me about $900 bi-monthly. I have a rooming situation where I only pay $500 at the beginning of the month and $75 mid month for utilities. I have a phone bill that takes $110 at the beginning of the month. I still buy groceries and have no car to get around. Part of my debt is a car loan that was taken out with an ex of mine who crashed the car and insurance didnt cover it. I have no more room to take out another loan for a car. $16,000 of that debt is negligent spending on my credit card and about $8,000 is from the car loan. I need help, I've never asked for help before. Im much too stubborn for that and I dont know what to do. How can I get some relief from this debt while I try to straighten things out.",01Jul2020,1
634,"So, I'm really conflicted. I'm not sure whether I should change my last name or not.   
Here's a little backstory:  
My alcoholic dad has never once provided for the family in any way and on multiple occasions he has told his daughters that he doesn't love us and that we can f\*\*k ourselves, etc., etc. Basically, my ""dad"" is a POS.  
My mom filed for divorce a year ago and we are towards the end of the process. My mom has decided to change her last name, and my two siblings also want to change their last name. Since my siblings and I are all 20+ years old, we get to decide whether we want to change it or not.   
I feel like my mom is trying to pressure/guilt-trip me into changing it. She says that she wants the family to be consistent, and after I tell her that I need to think about it (b/c it's my identity and that's a lot to think about), she says stuff like ""well when you have kids, what are their last names going to be?"" and ""whenever you asked for stuff, I've never told you that I need to think about it.""

  
I'm hesitant to just go along with it for a couple of reasons:

1. Her maiden name sounds weird with my first name... Kristen McCracken (my mom's last name) or Kristen Deacon (my dad's last name)
2. I don't really want him to ""win"" per say
3. I don't want to just change my last name b/c everyone else is... I want this to be my decision

reasons why I kinda do want to change my name:

1. I don't really want to associate with his side of the family (this is the main incentive to change my name. There are others, I just can't think of them rn)  


I don't want to upset my mom/my siblings by not changing my last name, but idk what to do.

I appreciate any and all advice. Thank you!",01Jul2020,1

638,"To clarify, I’m not in any danger, the guy is a good guy but I’m just not comfortable. 

Context:
I’m 22 and I’ve been talking to this guy (28) I met over a dating app for a few weeks now, I came down to the city with a friend to visit, have a few drinks and shop, and decided to make plans with this guy to meet him and stay at his place until Saturday and he would drive me back home. I do not have a vehicle, and his place is fair distance from my friends (can’t walk and there’s no bus or anything of the sorts)
My friend said she would be okay with me coming back and staying another night and driving me home if something went wrong or I wasn’t comfortable.

My problem is, I’m not sure how to bring this up. He was already upset when I changed how long I’d be staying (original plan was Monday). He is a genuinely nice guy, it just seems like things are moving too fast and I’m not comfortable, he’s also looking for something I’m not (kids and family) which is a big thing to throw on someone you just met in person.

I understand my decision wasn’t very bright, and now I’m unsure how to get out without being rude. He asks a lot of questions, I’m worried if I say something wrong he’ll start asking if I like him really or what he did wrong, and I get anxious with my words and answering things.",01Jul2020,1
639,"Hello, this is a relationship type post but I try to avoid the relationship advice subs. 

I’m white and my girlfriend is black. We’re both mid 20’s. Many people classify my gf as progressive. Many may call her woke. She’s very outspoken and is pretty strong in her opinions, sometimes to a fault (hard headed). 

We’ve had some friction when it comes to race since we started dating. Some of which was due to my lack of understanding but Ive made a lot of progress and filled gaps and recognized a lot of my biases. 

However, sometimes I still feel like my girlfriend can go overboard. Idk how you all define racism since it seems like it’s been up for debate lately but if the races were flipped, my girlfriend would have left me a long time ago for things she says every other day. It’s wearing me down. 

It’s not that I necessarily feel offended by it, but it’s rather the hate that I see come out of her. It honestly disgusts me the way she views things sometimes. 

Often it will be justified anger and other times it feels like she’s the crab in the bucket. 

For instance a girl she knows is middle eastern and grew up in a very rural area in an extremely conservative state. Apparently this girl would make self deprecating jokes about herself, jokingly calling herself a terrorist or something. As someone who actually grew up in an area like this, I see this as her finding a way to turn something that could be used against her as a joke and a way to make friends. She sees it as her ‘cooning for these white people’. While it’s not really my place to debate the ethics of this situation, it almost seems like my SO would rather see this girl be as angry as she is. 

Another occurrence was when we found out my parents are Trump supporters. I didn’t see it coming and we both found out via Facebook when one of my parents said “Trump 2020”. This is obviously disappointing for both of us. My girlfriend understandably got particularly upset about this and said that it sucks but she’s the one that’s “stupid enough to keep doing this” (date white guys). This one stung a bit but I just let it go. 

There are other things that happen often. She will ‘jokingly’ bring race into a conversation where it’s not permitted. I understand a lot of things are about race and even more things are rooted in racism, etc. but it’s becoming exhausting. Some of this might stem from her poor mental health but fortunately I think she’ll be seeing a therapist soon. 

I love this girl a lot but this behavior makes me miserable at times and I’m not sure what to do.",01Jul2020,0

642,"Hi guys and gals. So, I need some advice, cause I messed up bad. I started off college with a lie that I had been in a long-term relationship before, and that I was a master of the art of love to my closest college friends. I should have shut up my mouth there and then, but then I involved a girl I knew from high school and told my close friends that she was the one I dated. I fucked up bad. Like, so fucking bad. I hate myself for including her in my lie and I probably will not forgive myself for doing that. I told everybody to keep it in the down low, and to tell no one, but I have reflected upon this entire thing and I realized that this is one narcissistic behavior.

Edit: I just finished my freshmen year of university. I go to an international school away from the US, but all of my closest friends are from the US. I used to also attend high school in a country not from the US, but not from the same country as my university.

644,"We have a complicated history, but I always wanted a relationship but I don’t think it’s going to happen. Background info, sorry it’s so long.

We’ve been talking for about two years, he’s 24 and I’m 19 as of now, we started messaging when I was a senior in high school. We hung out a lot that led to kissing, just kissing no sexual relationship. 3 months into this thing he told me he loved his ex girlfriend but he also loved me, I stopped talking to him and a week later we were back together. A day before my HS graduation he told me he started talking to his ex again but we could remain friends. I said no because I was hurt and he knew that. Did not speak all summer until Halloween of that same year, now a freshman in college, we hung out again and we slept together. This time it lasted until January of this year, he said he was still talking to his ex still, we had a long conversation, I said why wouldn’t you tell me this time around about her and if you really loved her then why would you sleep with me and say you love me. Stopped talking again. At this time none of my family knew it was down low.

Started talking again in March lasted until May, we talked about everything and I honestly thought we were going to last this time. I was wrong, I met up with him at 5 am, we usually got doughnuts, but this time he wanted to have sex, I said no especially since it was going to be in the car (first time we had sex it was in the car and it was a mess) and I said no. He kept insisting that we do it and started taking off my leggings and I kept saying no, he got mad and left. I messaged him later and he said never to contact him and unfriended me on Snapchat.  

Now June, we started talking again he says he loves me and wants to try harder this time. For me it’s different now, I don’t love him like I used too, it’s not like when we started hanging out with him, like I was in love with him and now I’m not so much. And plus I think he’s messaging other girls. I told my friend and she’s says, “girl you’re smart but why are you so dumb when it’s about him” I have no idea. I see the red flags but I can’t walk away, I have NO IDEA HOW or why. Should I ghost him, block him? Any advice?

647,"Hello all, looking for some advice here.

I am an **18M, 5'8"" sitting at 142lbs** currently. I have been dieting, by eating clean at a caloric deficit, and my goal for each day (advised by my personal trainer) is **1810 Calories**. My macros are **204g Carbs (45%), 158g Protein (35%), and 40g Fat (20%)**. I have been following this closely, with maybe a fluctuation of 50-100 calories above or below on certain days, but most days I am hitting the goals. 

On top of my diet, I have been doing bodyweight workouts (my trainer has not called them HITT, but I would like to believe they are) for 45 minutes every Tues/Thurs with my trainer on Zoom.

I started this about a month ago, when I was  140lbs, and seem to not be making any progress. **What am I doing wrong? Do I need to tell my trainer to change anything? Am I being impatient? How long before I should be concerned?** I feel like I should see some results by now, no matter how small, but instead I have put on 2lbs. Keep in mind, weight is not my concern (I could care less about the number), but rather I am trying to lose fat everywhere. especially my stomach, chest, and face - I know you cannot target fat, just FYI, was just making the statement. 

Not having made any progress has been really defeating; it has become tiring to eat relatively the same main meals every day, and I feel trapped. I am not looking to give up, but for my hard work to give me some sign that it's not a futile effort. I am losing motivation, and need to know if I should be changing something.

Please ask me questions! I really need all the help I can get, so give me all ur advice. **Don't hold back!**",01Jul2020,1
648,"I dont know how to start,but im still a teenager who just broke up after a 2 yr old relationship.The rellation was marvelous especially in his first yr.But , after that my gf moved to another highschool,where she found some new friends and a new mate who fcked this relationship(in my opinion,ofc).

The guy was very sticky with her,following her at everystep and trying to get her  although he knew that I am with her. That caused some problems so we broke up about twice and now one more time. Before i go on to my problem just think about a guy who is very sticky with ur partner and u cant talk with him because even if youre a chill guy, for some reason, he may know hes a \*\*\*\*\*\*\* so hes scared of you . My girlfriend knew it wasn't ok so she told me everything that was happening and on my advice she even moved away from him. 

The reason for the breakup was when the guy, once they went for a walk, kissed her. The only reason I decided to continue the relationship was that my girlfriend told me about the incident the same day and called me to talk (to break up under the pretext that she can't be forgiven for what she did) so I decided to give her the opportunity to forgive her so that we could start everything from the beginning, assuming my decision and all the repercussions that would appear on my reputation, including helping her get over it. 

 After another 3 days, he decided to break up with me under the pretext that he did something that cannot be forgiven and that we cannot continue like this even though I insist that even though what happened happened I am willing to try to take it from the beginning. He refused and said that we have to break up for my own good, but this time everything will be ok and we will remain best friends, so I accepted the breakup .

   
After another two days we saw each other again and had a good time, we talked we walked and ate something (morning) . In the afternoon I sent her a message asking her how her day went on .   
In the evening when I ran out I called her to stay for a story while I was returning home, it was quite late. I thought maybe she has something to do with it so I didn't send any more messages. Since it was already extremely late I decided to send her another message to ask her if everything is fine, I was quite anxious not to something happened to her . After a few minutes she sent me a message saying that everything is ok, after which I asked her if she wants us to talk a little . She said of course so I asked her how her day was and what she did, she told me that she went out with the guy I was talking about but she came home for about 3 hours. I told her that I hope she had a good time outside and I asked her what else she did after and how she feels .

 Although in my opinion at least I didn't say anything bad, trying to be as nice as possible, knowing that she may be a little hurt after the breakup, in response to what I wrote above she said to me: I am not obliged to tell anyone how I After this answer I asked her if I upset her in any way and she motivated me to call her after I saw that she did not answer the message and then I sent her another message. that there was a very long time between them and besides that I was just a little worried. For some reason here he closed my conversation, making me feel very bad that night .

 After the last mentioned event, I repeatedly tried to go for a walk with her / to talk, but every time she told me that she didn't know what she had in the program the next day so she couldn't promise me anything. 

 The situation mentioned above has been around for a month, although I tried to see her every day, each time she either walked with someone else or had something to do. So I decided not to try again, but after a very good relationship of 2 years , I feel extremely stupid and sad to see that she simply took me out of her life. I don't know what I should do in this context, I would really like to be friends with her. 

   
\*All I said above is the short story of the last few months as short as possible \*

Please try to give me some advice, tell me what to do, rn i am really anxious, depressed and sad, ik everything  will be good but i still  want my life and friend back+not to hurt her...

anyways, we have this project. and we're gonna have a video call to talk about it.

its prolly like 5 of us. but i dont know why, i feel extremely nervous.

i feel almost anxious;

i have no idea what im gonna say, or how im gonna act tbh;

i want to keep it formal still; but i think its gonna be a bit weird, cuz its only gonna be us, and they will be joking around and shit; tho i also dont want to force shit on me only cuz its innapropriate to others

653,"Hello reddit family, I need advice.

Backstory:

I [23F] live with my guardian(W) [65M] and his fiancé(S) [61F] for almost a year now. W is a hot-tempered man but usually he’s okay and jolly but lately he’s been showing symptoms of PTSD and always takes out his anger on S. 

Things escalates when he found out S went to Vegas with some guy 20 years ago. At that point of time, they weren’t even seeing each other seriously and as S told me, he remembered W told her to move on. But of course, W choose not to remember that part. This argument has been going on and off for more than a month now and the thing that got W really mad at S is because she doesn’t fight back. 

The story begins yesterday. After I left for my appointment, they had the argument again. W claimed that S is a “f$cking wh$re” and threatened to torture her with a pair of plier like they do in Africa and insisted that she took a lie detector test if she doesn’t reveal where the guy is so he can go kill him. Of course, S said nothing. (W was a big time player back in his days).

Later that afternoon, I took her out because W was being hostile to her, even after she tried to talk to him. We even found a receipt for a pair of pliers. I immediately got very protective of S and fear for her safety. We both know that W can be unreasonable at times but this does it.

When we got back, I found a loaded 10mm gun, hammer pulled back just lying on the table next to the couch. That gun was not there before we left. 

I immediately felt threatened and scared of what W would do to her and hid the gun, along with another gun lying around on the kitchen counter. In my head, I’m imagining that W would get mad again at her and just pull the trigger at us. Bear in mind, W has over 20 guns and rifles lying around in the house for “safety purposes”.

I took S out again to get dinner. S even got him a sandwich. When we got back, W went irate and insane, going on and on about where did she hid the gun. S doesn’t know where I hid the gun. I denied I hid the gun because I don’t want him to use it in his condition. 

He then took my blender and threatened to throw it to the ground. I was like, go ahead. He threw the blender at S. S immediately took the dog out and I locked myself in the bathroom and called 911 as he was threatening to kill us.

We took shelter in the neighbor’s house. The cops came but they couldn’t do anything about it because he just “threatened” us. And they couldn’t make him leave the house either (Legally, it is S’s house). W told the cops and us he’d be leaving early the next day. We packed some stuff and spent the night at the neighbor’s house. 

He didn’t know we went to the neighbor’s house. He called S multiple times and just verbally abuse her. 

And today, he’s still in the house and doesn’t seem like he’s leaving. He blames me for everything and apparently now I’m a “f$cking b$tch” for calling the cops on him. 

I am still scared of him and is thinking of getting a restraining order on him. He is mentally unstable and kept verbally abusing us. I don’t know what to do. I would appreciate any advices from you guys.

Thank you for reading despite English is not my first language.

TL;DR: 
Mentally unstable guy threatened to kill us. Cops can’t do anything. Need advice.",01Jul2020,1

655,"So the place I camp has a hatch of Mayflies every year. For those of you who don't know what those are, they're a kind of bug with no mouth, who basically land somewhere, stay for a day maybe 2, and then die. They exist purely to feed fishes and frogs and such and thousands hatch each year

My cousin came to me super disturbed yesterday because he said it just hit him how fucked up he used to treat them. He admitted that as late as last year he'd basically torture them. He'd burn them with barbeque lighters, ruin their wings, throw them at walls really hard, or rip their limbs off. He said he didn't really know why. When he was really little he even used to get excited for the hatch and ""befriend them"" which I can remember myself.

He told me that it basically just all hit him that what he did was disgusting and weird when one landed on him today. He ""couldn't believe he'd been such a monster"".

I'm very close to him. He's always had issues with anger repression and never had outlets. He's however, hasn't bursted out against a person since he was like 7, and even then that was uncharacteristic and rather small. He's a very kind, empathetic, and sensitive kid otherwise. He promised that he'd never even considered doing anything sadistic like that to anything other than those bugs, and would never do it the Mayflies ever again either. I can tell he feels genuine remorse  He's ""afraid of what it says about him as a person"".

He also has severe OCD and ADHD if that's important. However, I'm bad with people so I wouldn't know.

What should I tell him?",01Jul2020,1
656,"He is always trying to tell me about his personal issues and tbh I don't want to hear it. This man was always an adult when I was growing up and treated me AWFULLY for years and still does from time to time. Beat me up, blamed me every single time for being abused by our horrible mother or being in harms way, projected and still projects all his insecurities onto me, uses me as an emotional dumping ground, and is all around toxic person to be around. He has mental health issues and so do I and while I have some sympathy for him, he's a dick and I have NO interest in helping him or even talking to him.

How do I get him to stay away from me? He will suddenly start to talk to me about his issues or try to start a conversation after a fight or even try to 'bribe' me with nice things so I can stick around and cater to his needs of having to talk to somebody. He's a grown ass man who needs to understand that nobody owes him anything and that I don't want to talk to him ever again. If I attempt to communicate this, he will probably pick a fight with me and go on a personal insults rant. So how do I avoid him?",01Jul2020,1

659,"Trigger warning: Violence

So. A few days ago I (18F) picked a fight with my brother. I shouldn't have done it but things escalated to a physical level, and he ended up beating me up really badly and I was left with bruises on my body. Though we both were in bad moods and in the beginning the verbal fight was equal parts my fault and his, once he threw me to the ground and started hitting me I stopped fighting back and begged him to stop. My mom came home from her trip that night and we sat down at my request to discuss how she should punish him to ensure it wouldn't happen again. My brother hasn't been physical with me in a while but it has occured previously and mom never punishes him and instead schools me on how to avoid setting him off, so I felt this discussion was necessary because I am now walking with a limp and have a black eye so I really wanted to make sure he got a proper punishment. I suggested cutting off his tuition for a semester (he has money saved up) and/or making him live with my dad for the rest of the summer. My dad lives in California, we live in Nevada, but it's only like an hour drive. My mom ignored these requests, saying he is a member of the family and she will never kick him out, and instead decided to send him to a therapist. I agree that this was a good measure to take but he hadn't even apologized at that point and I really thought as a woman, she would be on my side and understand how powerless I had felt getting beaten and just kinda idk help me out and show him he'll face repercussions so he doesn't ever do it again.

Anyways when she told me that's all she was going to do, I basically saw red and smashed one of her picture frames of me on the floor. She then told me I had to leave her house and put all my stuff outside. I saw this as an outrageous double standard and refused to leave, so she tried to drag me out and hit me in the face. She told me my depression makes me pathetic and this is why nobody cares about me and that if I tried to go to the police about my brother she would lie and testify against me. Some other awful stuff too. Then I broke the TV. My mom and brother have anger issues that escalate to physical levels but I have never once touched them, even though I have some issues myself.

Literally I wish I could say it was the worst night of my life but my depression has brought me to some pretty dark places before, so what I will say is this: I felt more unloved in those moments than ever before. A couple days later I am still living with my mom, just avoiding her. I am deeply depressed. My brother witnessed our fight, apologized to me, and went to my dad's on his own accord. I cleaned up all of the glass from the picture frame and have ordered a new TV with my own money but I really really don't want to apologize to her until she apologizes to me. Just the thought of the things she said to me makes me sick. But I don't want to live my life hating my mother so how can I open up a productive dialogue with her and what steps can I take in my own mind to be able to let this go?",01Jul2020,1

665,"Title explains it all but I'll give more informations for the sake of comprehension.

I bought yesterday a new phone from a website so I could pay it in four times instead in one go like we're forced to in shops. The website itself is very safe and famous and provides all kind of phones and stuff related to internet ect. The problem is that I just discovered the society in charge of the delivery are one with a BAD reputation. Like a real real bad one. If you look on internet for reviews about them, you will only see bad notes and even more bad reviews. Package are either not delivered, in a bad shape, stolen ect.. As for the delivers themselves, they are described as unserious, bad mannered and other similar adjectives.

I know that, of course, it doesn't mean MY delivery will surely go wrong. But seeing all of these comments made me really anxious about the whole thing. If I had ordered a cheap object, I wouldn't be too stressed about it, but we're talking here about an object worth a lot of money. I am afraid my package won't be delivered, or lost or even worst : stolen. 

The website mentions the package could be here in between the 2/3 of July so either tomorrow or the day afterwards. It's not a lot of time to wait and I can observe where my package is on their website, but I really don't know how to feel more hopeful about this situation and not drive myself nuts in the process. I know there's worst things in life but money is a ""big deal"" for me as I am far from being rich and that I have been waiting for years to get a new phone. So the idea of not being in control of this situation and having to passively wait until it's here is scary.

Does anyone know how I could overcome this ""fear""/anxiety ? Did any of you had a great experience with a delivery society that had a bad reputation but were actually competent ?",01Jul2020,1
666,"So I, once again, have unintentionally belittled my husband. 

I told him that my full paycheck pays for everything. He took it as he pays for nothing and doesn't pull his weight. 

We generally have a good relationship. But I make a lot of mistakes and I feel like I'm pushing him away. 

He won't accept my apologies or explanations, unless I tell him what I really meant. He thinks that I'm tearing him down. I don't mean to say things the way I do, they just don't ever come out right.

Please help, offer advice that I might be able to use to help him understand that he's the one who pays all the bills with his money, I'm just the one who has to manage the bills. We do not have a joint account. He pays a lot in child support but has a side job that covers some of the lost money. 

I'm not against him in any way. I just wanted to explain that if he got laid off, my whole months paycheck pays for pretty much all we have, as an example of how much we spend.

670,"So just a little backstory. My husband and my relationship has been rocky for a while now. Pretty sure he’s a narcissist, he is an alcoholic, smokes weed all day every day, is verbally abusive and just recently he has started to push me around. I’ve stuck around because we have two kids and the man I fell in love with was a sweet loving man and I have been imploring him to talk to a counselor, try to break his addictions, try emdr treatment, anything to help him get better. He has refused everything. For a while now he has said he wants to try magic mushrooms which I am against and when he was talking about doing it he said he would do it out of the house with a friend. I was still against it but at least he wasn’t going to be in the house. Last night after the kids were in bed and I was in the living room, he came out and said that he just took a microdose of mushrooms. I lost it and was so furious with him for doing it in the house for the first time with me and the kids. He then went on to say he was kidding and doesn’t have any yet but wanted to see how I’d react and then he went on to say instead of doing one trip he wants to microdose everyday. I’m not comfortable with him doing that in the house around me and the kids. This may be my breaking point. Idk what to do at this point.

671,"I have been depressed my whole life. My dad didn't allow me anything, beat me regularly. I was depressed, hopeless, so I attempted to take my own life - landed in the hospital in urgent care and came back home 1,5 months later. I was 19 years old at that time and still lived with my parents so I had to go back home after being hospitalized, hoping that my parents learnt how miserable I was and that my dad would stop the abuse. One night, about 2 weeks after being out of hospital, my drunk dad almost beat me to death and I had to be hospitalized again. After that I spent 3 months at a mental health facility until I could live on my own and found a small appartment.

Even though I have done a lot of therapy in the past and took breaks, I am still very damaged. I am now 23 years old, am back to studying and have a job that I love. I do not know what love or family is though - my grandpa also beat me till I peed my pants when I was a child. I do not trust anyone, I cannot form meaningful relationships. I feel very lonely, I've built my life right now all by myself and am independent but I have no one to talk to and find myself very misearable constantly. I try to not show anything, come across professional at work, act like the past doesn't hurt me anymore when I visit my mother and have to see my dad. I cannot trust my brothers, I just see how they never helped me along the way, I just feel anger thinking about how privileged they grew up compared to me.


I don't think anyone that knows me realizes how hard my life is, how hard it is to live with my thoughts. Ontop of all the trauma I have experienced, depression, anxiety I have a lot of health issues - I have 2 autoimmune diseases (one being a skin disease that really shows alot) and PCOS. If it's not my past that holds me back from forming friendships and relationships, it's my appearance - all my negative emotions show through my skin, it's covering 90% of my body right now. I find myself eating a lot due to stress and being overwhelmed emotionally with everyday life and I have gotten overweight because of this. I feel social anxiety build up the second I leave the house.

I do not feel capable of love and don't think I will ever be able to trust people. Apart from being flawed mentally I think noone will find me attractive with a disease covering my body anyway.


I do not have friends, I pushed everyone away trying to be close to me. I tell myself that I am better off alone and don't need anyone, ""I am introverted and I enjoy time by myself anyway"" I tell myself. But I am just so freaking lonely, I feel empty. I cannot even watch Netflix series without obsessing over the characters and getting really involved in everything, turning those fictional characters into my friends in my head..

so i feel like i dont have anything. i feel like that ill be homeless because i dont have any house. yes we have a roof to live with my mom today. but in the next few years pretty sure they will kick us out. the house that we live in today is a house of may auntie. she's a sister of my father who passed away in 2011. you might ask. how can i tell that they gonna kick us here. if i live here for so long. the first year. all are good. we got along. from time to time even doe we dont have any. we try to cook special food for them. just to show how thankful we are. but the husband just came back. the husband of my auntie. whos very rude. he came back after a few years because my auntie kick him out. he cheated. and got a son in other women. now there in good tears right now. btw the guy kick her own daughter. because my cousin got pregnant. and before my sister goes. she tell us. that her father told to her face that.. if i. i can kick u out here. i can kick them too. because they dont own this house and land. so thats why im so affaid.

678,"So i need you guys opinion. I’ve been with my bf for about a year now. Whenever we started dating, he surprised me with Gucci slides because he thought I would like them.  I really did like them but was a little shocked That he gave me such pricey shoes since we didn’t know each other that long (maybe about a month and a half).
I would describe my boyfriend as being someone who is quite generous but I’ve had to convince him not to buy certain things for me since he doesn’t have a job right now. He’s a student and is wrapping up his last year in college. Of course I don’t want him to get me expensive things and I’ve bought it up to him on several occasions but he insists, his love language is gift giving lol. I really feel bad sometimes and will ask him to return the gifts but he refuses. and the gifts that I’m talking about aren’t super expensive (for example, he got me a pair of shoes for over $130) but this is definitely too much for someone who is still in college without a job. 
On top of this, my boyfriend would sometimes come to my house with flowers (maybe once a week or every other week)  he’s given me several edible arrangements. Like I said, I’m always grateful but it still makes me feel guilty. 
So this morning, I was talking to my mom (I live with my parents) and she said that my dad sent her an article about people buying gifts as a way to manipulate them. She said that he didn’t mention my boyfriends name but she knew what he was insinuating. I know my parents like my bf a lot so I’m kind of surprised that my dad would make that insinuation. 
My dad has never been the type to get my mom random gifts or flowers, and my mom has to act like she doesn’t even want those things just to make him feel better. My mom has made so many comments about how my dad doesn’t do much for her and how selfish he is. I’m not saying that buying your partner gifts validates your relationship but I just don’t see why sees my bf getting gifts for me as a negative thing. Maybe it makes my dad feel uncomfortable? Idk. But it’s definitely made me take a step back.. I don’t think my boyfriend is being manipulative. He’s never held anything over my head or anything like that. What do you guys think?

689,"  I don’t mean to sound SJW (frankly I’m avidly against that mentality that all men are bad), but it’s been something that’s bothered me for years despite how small it seems. In school, sitting next to my male classmates makes me really anxious and sick inside, and not in the “I have feelings for this person” kind of way.
  I’ve always recoiled at seeing male genitalia and have been thoroughly uncomfortable with a male person being flirty to me or just even just talking to me.
(Like a waiter in a restaurant or my classmate asking a question) Though, I can only recall one instance, maybe two that a guy has actually hurt me or slightly traumatized me in any way.

I'm never really nervous about these types of things, but for some reason, it's kinda making me nervous. 

The whole idea of going there, and just straight up being rejected, after all this waiting and preparation, is quite nerve-racking for me.

694,"So I am currently almost 21 years old and me and my girl bestfriend have known eachother since we were 17 years old or senior year of highschool. Me and her have been through a lot together and I have always been there for her even during the times when her ex boyfriend was abusive to her a while back. I helped her with it. Anyways we have always remained close and ever since quarantine we have not stopped talking or spending time together for really any reason, like me and her tell eachother everything and spend a lot of time together, facetime eachother everyday, we even send eachother tiktoks through dm continuously. However lately Ive began to notice that she has been acting slightly different around me in the sense that she always tries to play fight with me, she’ll like touch my face and hugs me more often. This is strange though because she had been involved with a guy for a few months now but their thing wasnt that serious and is kinda ending, but now at the same time she was also speaking to a guy with the same first name as me, which is kinda strange. However he is much older and probably wont lead to anything. I always get mixed signals from her though, years ago when we were more recent friends I told her I liked her and she didnt reciprocate the feelings but I honestly just never brought it back up. Yet whenever we are around eachother now she’ll make a sly comment or almost flirty comment about how she knows Im jealous. Just last night she sent me a booty pic of her in a bikini with a bruise because she fell off a tube when we were on my boat yesterday. She facetimed me later that evening and I had asked about the bruise and she joked that she knew I liked to stare at her ass. I really dont get her sometimes and I feel like she is just afraid of something long term. She will do things like that and then say something about how she looks at me in a platonic way it is so weird. I never bring up my feelings for her or anything anyways, I dont even think she knows I still have feelings or cares that much. Yet she asks to spend every waking moment with her and gets upset when I cant see her or do something with her. And I know that she can never have a normal relationship with anyone else because she has serious health problems and I dont think most people would want to deal with that nowadays.

696,"My 16-year old sister just posted her new relationship to Facebook. So being the nosy sister that I am, I went to his Facebook to check it out. My dad mentioned that he was older and they did not approve but he said the guy was 19, which I found a bit cringey. However after looking at his Facebook, the guy is 23. He’s the same age as my other sister!

Needless to say, I’m disgusted and I’m not sure what I should do about this. I called my dad to tell him that the guy is 23 and he’s assured me that they’re not dating while she’s under his roof and he’s hoping she’s just acting out and saying she’s dating this guy for attention. From my understanding their relationship isn’t sexual as of yet and is a long distance relationship.

I’m 12 years older than my sister, so we’re not very close. I know she’s at the age where if I tell her to be cautious with this adult who thinks it’s appropriate to date a literal child, she’ll just brush it aside and do the opposite. 

Is there anything else I can do about this? I’d like to talk to my sister about it but in a way that wouldn’t seem like I’m lecturing her cuz then she likely won’t listen to me. I’m very concerned and I want to make sure I’ve done everything in my power to make my sister aware of the dangers of dating an adult while she is still legally a child.

I was doing so well too. Hadn't hurt myself for the last six months. I had a history of self harming after my mom died when I was young, but over the years I've stopped. Most of the scars are so faded you really wouldn't be able to notice them if you met me.

My abusive ex boyfriend sexually assaulted me last year. And I broke up with him the next day. I completely fell apart after it happened and was really depressed but I didn't self harm. I went to therapy and worked through the PTSD symptoms. Now I really thought I was over the nightmares and the worst of the anxiety attacks. I haven't needed therapy in at least 3 months. I was pretty happy and I thought I was almost recovered. 

But today I woke up with a nightmare about my ex and I felt like crying but I couldn't cry. I dreamt that I didn't leave him and he was still hurting me. I did the exercise my therapist taught me and that helped me get up and start the day. I really tried to look after myself today. I thought I doing well.

I can’t ever talk to him about feelings and stuff, cause he doesn’t like it, which is totally understandable, but I wish I could pick his brain a little just to understand him more. 

Anyway, last post, I wanted to know if I should tell him my feelings or not, considering we had a pretty interesting convo about gay stuff, and I had lent him a toy. Your advice was to wait until he brings the subject up again, then question him a little about it. So I’ve been waiting for that day, and I think I missed it. 

Last night, around 12, he shot me a text. It wasn’t anything special, but it was obviously an “are you awake” type thing. But I wasn’t, so I missed it, and now I just wanna cry? 

Idk... I really wish I didn’t feel this way about him, not because I wish I didn’t like him, but because that way I wouldn’t have to feel so sad over what was probably nothing, let’s be honest here.

701,"(Following text is copied from a post I made on r/AmITheAsshole)

Sometime last month, a guy messaged me on my main account on reddit after he saw a question I had posted on r/askreddit basically asking for advice.

The message was just a ""hi, I have some advice for you"" so I messaged back, and he gave me the advice and I thanked him for it. 

After that, he kept asking me a bunch of questions, which I was in no mood to answer so I kept the replies short and crisp. Either or a yes or a no, or a 1-3 word answer. For eg: He asked me my hobbies, I said 'researching serial killers' and left it at that. I thought he would get the hint and leave me alone, so I went to sleep. 

Next morning, i wake up to 13 messages from him, all along the lines of: ""why aren't you answering me?"" Or ""did I do something wrong?"" 

I informed him that I had a healthy sleep schedule, and went offline. When I came back online, another 7 messages. The first was ""oh, ok I didn't realize"" then (ten minutes later) ""how are you"" and an hour after that, the phrase, ""ok, I'll leave you alone"" split into individual words in different messages. I didn't respond to these messages. 

Then, early in the morning (around 1 am) the next day, he messages ""killing wasn't their choice, they were just listening to their voice""

I happened to be awake studying, so I respond ""what the fuck?"" And he replies ""nothing, just trying to think like them"". I knew that by 'them', he meant killers, since I had already told him I was interested in true crime and serial killers, but I thought he was just trying to be edgy (which I suppose he was), so I respond with 'ok'. 

Then came the day before my bday. I was up late since all my friends were wishing me. As soon as it was 12 am, he sends me a link. I open it, and it's a birthday poster made up of all my favourite bands, and lyrics from a song I said I identify with. 

The problem? I had never told him any of this. He had been going through my post/comment history every day to gather all this information on me. I know this isn't illegal or anything, but it creeped me tf out to the point I made this throwaway to answer askreddit questions and all, because I do NOT want him knowing more stuff about me.

However, I thought maybe I'm just being silly. I mean, it's not really hurting me. So, i decided to post on here and ask: AITA?

The post was removed before too many people could answer, so I never really got any advice on how to handle the situation. Is there anything I can do about it? I can't report him since he never said anything explicitly against reddit's rules.",01Jul2020,1

Depression has been at an all time high. Got into great shape last year and since moving for school have put on 30 pounds of pure fat. Disappointed in myself, can’t find motivation to lose it. I hide in my room and order takeout (often times after not eating all day and I order 2 dinners worth of food) and am ashamed to see my roommates because I’m a) always high now and b) way fatter. And I live with 2 very attractive girls. Awful for my confidence. I also can’t shake my addiction to weed. I know “you can’t physically get addicted” but I’m very dependent on it. When I got in shape last summer, I would get high and go for long runs. I’m justifying continuing to smoke (dabs too btw, not even just flower) by saying to myself that I’m gonna need it if I want to start running again.

711,"With everything going on lately, something I thought and somewhat still believe to be a good thing was having more time to spend online with friends to chat and game all that jazz. But for me, when it comes to friends, I'm quite private, or maybe it's normal, I'm not sure. Anyways I tend to keep my friends separated, and if they do meet, it's usually after years. I have some ideas about why I do this but also not sure. So that being said, I decided since I want to play more games with friends. That I should get one of my closest female friend ( I'll call her Jane, not her real name ) and one of my closest male friend along with his group of friends but mostly him and one of his friends (I'll call my friend David and his friend Alex, not their real names). So I got Jane to meet David and Alex. It went well. I thought great we're all going to have a great time with all the chaos going on currently. So at first, we played a bit not every day but still some. I was happy with that. But then Jane and Alex started playing this one game which I was perfectly fine with. But with her spending all her time on it, I just felt like I couldn't have my time with her or them. I thought I was overacting more so when I went to David expressing that I felt that Jane didn't want to spend time with me anymore and it seemed she'd rather spend time with Alex. now I understand a stranger would hear this and go oh Jane and Alex are flirting or something. I can't be 100% on that, but both have their partners. After talking with David, I thought, ok, I'm just overacting. My anxiety is messing with my head; everything is fine. But small things were chipping away at me. Like how we'd all be in a call, they'd be playing their game again was perfectly fine I was waiting around for when they finished so we could all play something together.  
Though when we got on the game, Jane was mostly talking to Alex.  communicating to them about the game. They were asking each other if they wanted this or that. They'd both go off on adventures or some crap. Still, I thought I'm overthinking all this. I tried to overcome it by trying to force myself to be included, which backfired I ended up being like a third wheel. Some more time goes by, and from what I knew, Jane and Alex had been messaging quite a bit but hardly talking to me. I shouldn't get mad about them messaging, but considering I've known her eight years and there have been times where we hadn't talked in months cause she went away, but I always tried to welcome her back with open arms. Claiming me as her best friend even getting jealous that I made another close female friend while she was away. Thinking that I'd replace her, which I never did, I just have room for multiple close people. So it annoyed me I've known her for all these years. I haven't had any quality time with her in a while. I'm not trying to blame anyone for lack of that. Her knowing Alex for that short of time and them playing that game. But yesterday was the last straw, so David had messaged me saying to get online that us four were going to play a game. I get on, and I'm told oh Alex is doing something they'll be back soon. David is playing his own game, and after a while of waiting, Jane invites me to a game we play maybe 5 - 10 minutes of it. Alex comes back, and Jane goes to me. I'm going to get off and play the other game we'll play this or something else after. Me not wanting to be controlling or anything I said yea, that's fine. So Alex and Jane get on to their game and play for hours and hours.  
Then eventually Jane tells the call that she's going to bed. Alex and some others say something, and Jane says she'll play one more match. Me being upset and pissed, I just left without saying anything. Jane later messaged me, saying how she's sorry for not playing anything that it's her fault. I told her it's fine, but she says she feels bad. I was annoyed and didn't respond. I just want to know is it ok that I'm hurt, angry, upset all of that towards her. But it honestly pisses me off that lately for me to spend any time with her or to know she's around is David telling me she's online or something, I'm almost always the last one to be invited to the call. All this happening is bringing up hurtful memories. I don't like to compare people, but I've had people ditch me before after knowing them for years for someone they only met two weeks prior. I just don't want to feel like I'm a third wheel/she's kind to me as if I'm charity or only damage control. I want to feel included and not sure what I should do about all this. I'm asking for any thoughts or advice on this.",01Jul2020,1

I’m in a dilemma. The career I want to go into is somewhat limited where I live, with two places that offer it. One is a local business, one is a huge multinational business. I want to work for the huge business because it’s training it very well regarded, progression, good social side I’ve Heard, etc. I’d like to travel for work in the future, and I know this is an option here as I k ow people who have. 

I’ve interviewed at both. I received an offer from the local business last Friday, which is great. My second interview, which is the final interview, at the huge one is on Tuesday. From what I’ve heard, the second interview here is pretty much to see if you’re likeable, career goals, etc, so I should be good here.

I asked the loca business to give me time to consider their offer, but I very much doubt i can get away with not confirming for almost 2 weeks that I’d need to to have the options. 

Does anyone know of a way I can delay the local businesses offer so I can decide based on how my other interview goes? I feel maybe trying to negotiate salary might be an option, but given the current economic climate, I’m afraid they might just rescind the offer if I try negotiate too much.

She moved here from another state with her boyfriend, so she doesn’t know many people, and her and her boyfriend broke up this past February, and that’s when things got bad. She originally believed that her ex boyfriend, his best friend, and her neighbor were involved. She now has suspicions that I am involved, and my best friend, who is her roommate. I am mostly looking for advice for my best friend, who is her roommate, because she has two more months on the lease but said once she had suspicions that she was involved it got really weird. She will wake her up in the middle of the night talking about her wild theories, and will go a day or two without answering or unlocking the door (she did not give her a key) so she cannot come hone. She believes that she is a 100% right, and refuses to seek help. She believes the basis of the stalking is to make porn videos of her, which she will watch porn videos trying to see if they look like her for hours. She has taken apart printers, glasses, door bells, pillows, couches, etc trying to find cameras and voice recorders. When the lease is up she does not have income so she will not be able to sign a lease for a place, so we don’t know what to do. She does not have family we can contact and we are her only friends in this state.",01Jul2020,2
719,"Ever since the start of January, my parents have had a terrible relationship. Their relationship, to be honest, was never ideal, but it crossed the threshold and became sour and difficult at the start of this year.

My dad has a lot of personal problems. Whenever my mom tells him that he needs to do the dishes or vacuum because it's his turn to do it, he always denies responsibility and says that he is busy, even though all he wants to do is watch TV. He also stays up really late at night, and I don't even know why he does that. Everyone else normally is in bed by 10 or at the latest 11, though my dad stays up until 1, and he is just on his laptop or on his phone in the bedroom where my parents sleep. This really distracts my mom, and she often says that she can't get enough sleep at night.

Apart from that, my dad shows signs of cheating. Whenever we go out, he often stares at other women, and pays great attention to their clothing and even their legs. My mom is aware of this, and she is pretty frustrated about this. And at home, my dad spends several hours during the weekend just looking at pictures of models or female yoga teachers online. I don't even know what he wants to accomplish by doing that. 

At church, my dad always spent a lot of time with the women. He gets really close to them, and he talks with them and never talks to the men at church. He also hugs all of them really affectionately, and he also stares at teen girls at church. He doesn't even handshake the men or try to socialize with them. 

And then my dad is really chubby. He eats a lot of snacks and unhealthy food. When my mom cooks something like bacon for breakfast, my dad eats pretty much all of it. Yet when she makes brussel sprouts or grills asparagus, my dad doesn't eat it at all. Every day he eats 2 or 3 bags of chips, several cookies, many pieces of chocolate (and he just throws the wrappers on the couch or leaves them on the table). He drinks soda and chocolate milk straight from the container and he often burps when he drinks them, and he just burps straight into the container. I literally have to take red duct tape and tape a ""X"" on the bottles that he drinks from. A couple weeks ago, my mom injured her dominant wrist, so she couldn't cook for 3 or 4 days. She just told us to heat any leftovers we could find or make something like a sandwich or salad for ourselves. That's what my siblings and I did, but my dad ordered fast food every day. I saw on one his receipts that he ordered large waffle fries, a milkshake, a large soda, 2 sandwiches, and 12 chicken nuggets from Chick Fil-A all for himself.

My dad does nothing around the house. And he is really mean to me, my siblings, and even my mom. My dad sometimes just comes in my room, lies on my bed, with his hands stained by Cheeto dust or whatever, and asks me stupid questions like if I have a crush on anyone at school or what I want to be when I grow up. After he leaves my bed, he creates a huge imprint of his sweat, and there's usually snack crumbs on my bed. I've tried talking to my mom about this, and she's confronted my dad about this and told him that his behavior is unacceptable and inconsiderate, but he just yells at her to shut up and to mind her own business.

My dad's behavior absolutely makes me uncomfortable. My mom needs to divorce my dad to make everyone happy. I can't believe that she would still love such a creepy, overweight, rude person who is probably cheating on her.",01Jul2020,1

They had asked for an update on the contracts. After updating them, I was asked if I applied for the a manager position. I had told them I had, which they sounded excited for. But after some more discussion brought up the concern that I am planning to move in a year or so. I told my boss that despite this I wouldnt just take six months sick time then leave them to find a new manager. I would actually help unlike the old manager.

I filled in as manager for months with little to no warning. I managed through a showcase and then a pandemic. I understand she might have some frustration but a year is a long time. I was given five days to learn this managing position and I did it. And I've done great.

725,"To be honest I have no idea what I want to do with my life. My grades weren’t good enough to work with animals and ever since then I’ve turned my attention to kids. I love kids, I love the freedom that comes with playing and interacting with them. For me, applying to a nursery and kindergartens is a way for me to find out if I actually like working with them though. 

The two positions I want to work as in the future is one of these nurses who comes to check up on new borns and follow them through their childhood to make sure they’re healthy. The other one is a social worker. The idea with the last one is that maybe I can at least help kids that are being mistreated in their homes or need help in a different regard. I just want to make a difference.

Is there something I should and shouldn’t include in my CV? I plan on walking into the places and handing in my CV in person. I just finished school and I’m broke, I got no income at all. It’s really important that these turn out perfect so I can at least get a part time job.

I just keep reinventing in my mind my past when I was 20-25 and I ""pretend"" that I was insanely gorgeous and cool, so I keep telling myself that I should go back and be that person again, starting again those sports and hobbies, etc. 

I don't know... my new interests are different things, but they are messy and I have no confidence. Also I am already 37 and chances of being cool now that I have lost the ""up and coming"" age is kinda impossible. 

The point is that in reality I am not sure at all I still like the old things, maybe not at all. But for some crazy reason I have re-written my story and imagine myself back then as being the picture of awesome and I try to recapture that... even if the real past was much more ordinary and not special at all.

I am also afraid that I have chosen/discovered new hobbies because I am weak and go for weaker things or things were I am a beginner just to escape the pressure of performance if I were to do things more familiar to me. 

The root of all this mess is that at 25 I quit brusquely everything I was about because I felt I was not successful or going anywhere, so I embarked in a wrong path in life that I tried to force on myself and then after 5 years I quit mercifully that but it took other 5 years to rebuild my life.

735,"This is quite a long one, so bear with me. 

This is childish bullshit, so i’m sorry for that in advance but here we go: Me and my friends friendship is strained because of his girlfriend, more specifically, her and her friends. I used to be in a GC for a long, long time. And quite recently (one or two months ago), we added these two girls, A and B. Now my friend met A through this GC and ended up dating her. At first, I was 100% fine with it, happy for him even, they were nice enough.

And then it all went to shit.

This GC split in two, because of these two girls rallying every other girl in the GC, (and a couple guys too), for a sort of ‘sexism movement’. This all kicked off because of a sexist joke I made, (which is commonplace), B shat herself from this. And so A and B and 5 others spent around a full hour lambasting me for being a sexist, racist and all other bullshit, before splitting the GC in two. Now they’re in another one, which is just that GC without me in it.

As you can imagine I was pretty pissed off, I received very little help from my buds throughout all this, each of which are in this other GC. I was only informed of this GC a couple hours after when one of my mates, who had had this happen to him, told me about it. 
I don’t like A, B and a whole lot of other people because of this. My friendship is strained as a result, because A and my friend are very much in love, and my friend’s excuse for not saying a word was: ‘I don’t want to get involved with your petty arguments.’ It was admittedly quite petty, but i’m still pissed about it, especially considering B ended up shelving for sympathy later on, which just about everyone fell for.

Since then we no longer work side by side so we don’t really keep in communication however when he passes he asks me how it’s going and I reply how it’s slowed down due the demand of having 2 young kids. 

Anyway around 2 weeks ago he comes over and tells me how he’s started to write it and he plans on finishing it as he enters retirement (he’s currently close to retirement anytime between now and when he decides to tell HR he wants to leave). This obviously set me back and I didn’t really know how to react.

When we was speaking about the scenes I also explained to him how the opening scene was taking place and the basic story line, is there anything I can do as I plan to finish this over the course or 12-18 months as I want it as close to perfect as possible. Am not really sure we’re am going with it so far as it’s just to share with friends and family at first and if they like it I will more than likely try to take it further as close family I’ve mentioned it to seem to believe it has serious potential (my sister even went as far as to buy me numerous writing books to finish it) any advice is appreciated and thanks in advance.",01Jul2020,1

Im 26, my husband is 37. I’ve been in my SS’s life since he was 3 or 4. So as long as he can remember Ive been there. His dad’s in prison for DUI but will be home in December so was gone a year. Mom and Dad had a rough breakup with a custody battle now we’re all civil and they spend more time at my house than moms by choice and we’re all okay with it. 

He’s always been quick to ask me questions or have discussions with me about things a parent would but without me obviously being his mother or father. For example weed talks, getting in a car with a friend after drinking etc. Preparing him for the future. But I always keep a boundary between “friend” and parent. 

Well, since this quarantine started, he’s spent somewhere from 600 to 800$ from (3) different cards of mine. Sooo. I ask him for his passcode on my iPhone I confiscated so I could find all the “gamers” (grown men who ask for “donations” live streaming) that he’s spent money to and take my card info off those services.

Went to safari web browser and found the total mind blowing VERY specifically searched step mom porn. He was trying to find girls videos his age (12) too so I knew I had to have a discussion with him about THAT so he didn’t stumble on something bad and the feds come get him, me, or mom. 

I woke him up to pee in the morning and when he was done I asked him to come to my room. 

I said “it’s okay to watch porn it’s normal for your age to be curious but you can’t look up girls your own age” and he denied any porn and ran away crying.

An hour later he came to me ready to talk and I explained why he can’t look up girls his own se and he understood and was no longer crying or embarrassed. I could tell

Now I’m sure he knows I know that I know what category he enjoys and that I know he knows I know. 

(It was over a year he’s been into this genre) 

I didn’t even mention the stepmom part. I never will either. I asked his mom and dad to never either. Perhaps he’ll think I didn’t see it. 

Im still flabbergasted as this happened last night.

I’m sad to think he’s so big and now I don’t feel comfortable in a sports bra and pants. (I breastfeed his half sister and did his half brother as well). We had a movie night less than idk 6 mos ago where he crashed in my room &amp; One of the videos I found last night was called “ bed sharing with my stepmom” it’s so sad to me the little dude I helped bring up is now a young man and that this happened but I’m still going to treat him the same and not shame him.

So I think I fell in love with my manager. Why do I think so, because I care about her, when I talk with her my pulse elevates, sound of her voice makes me more aware and I also think of her when I'm with other women. Nothing also gets me harder than thinking about having her in my arms. She's only 5 years older than me, which is fine. We have quite a few things in common with each other. i.e. we like the same music, we dress kinda similarly as well, have the same kind of twisted sense of humor. We both like working out in the gym (she has an amazing ass as well, barbells squats will do that to you) and we have good chemistry when talking with each other about stuff or comparing each others callouses on our hands, lol. Not to mention that we nail every project we work together on. I know she has a boyfriend, but it's nothing serious, since they don't live together.  


I noticed that is different around me, when comparing to other men in the office. She avoids eye contact with me, nervously fidgets with her hair or laughs at my shitty remarks. But also, often times ignores me completely and intentionally goes out of her way to not answer me or stand away from me, while that wasn't the case a year ago, when I was out of shape and during that time my physique changed drastically.  


I just don't know, I'm not great at reading women at all, but there's definitely some tension between us, just can't figure out if it's mutual or not. Don't want to be fired anyway, if I do build up the courage and confess to her. Haha",01Jul2020,1

We are planning to get married and we wanted our families to meet.

My father is an alcoholic.. last week he suffered cardiac arrest from drinking and has been trying to stay sober more often (drinking at night vs the whole day).

My boyfriend knows he's an alcoholic, and has been asking if it's possible for my dad to stay sober when meeting his parents (who don't know about his alcoholism but are typical South Asian judgmental parents). 

My dad knew today was coming and how important it was. He was doing fine.. until he chose to drink at 2AM today.

I couldn't control my emotions.. so I'm bawling my eyes out because it's just too much stress. There is no choice but to take him.. it's just not a good sign if he's not there were they're expecting him. My boyfriend would be heart broken.

He promised he wouldn't drink for the rest of the day.. with everyone asking him to chug water, sleep it off more, etc

I honestly have no idea what to do if he doesn't sober up. Should I just lie to my bf and tell him that he got a medical emergency?? Should I just change the date?? I don't even know..

The reason why is so important is because my dad said he would be around when my boyfriend came to visit for the first time.. and then chose to tape a picture of himself and then left the house (the picture so that my bf knew what he would look like lol..)

744,"I currently work for a department in a hospital that is poorly managed. The whole hospital knows how my two managers can be. They're absolute snakes in the grass and will screw you over any chance you get, play favorites, and even if you don't get punished in the workplace they'll make your life a living hell. A policy at the hospital is you have to work in your home department for a year before you can transfer departments. My one year will be August 5th of this year. I applied for new position and a new department, I interviewed for it and they offered me the job - I accepted. My potential new manager went to my current manager and explained that they were going to hire me. My current manager stated, ""her (mine) application should've never landed on your (new managers) desk because her one year isn't up."" So basically my new manager(s) said they'd wait until my one year is up and then have me transfer to their department. Human resources has already told me yes as well.

My current manager hasn't said anything to me which I think is odd. She hasn't mentioned it to me, hasn't insinuated it to me or anything. I would expect her to do so by now but I feel like she's secretly pissed that human resources and my potential new managers pulled my application. 

Due to that fact, I've been flying under the radar. Basically, I'm not trying to rock the boat and make my manager mad or give her a reason to not let me transfer departments. This Thursday (tomorrow), I need to call in because my dad is in liver failure and needs to go to a dialysis treatment. He lives 3 hours away from me. Usually my aunt deals with all of this and I'm the backup plan. My father is a severe alcoholic and if I don't take him to dialysis he'll end up being taken to an ER and he's been known to get combative with hospital staff since they'll try to detox the alcohol out of his system. I basically just want to get him to his treatment so myself or my aunt won't have to deal with him - it sound awful I know, but my dad is an aggressive woman beater who has no regards for anything but himself. I'm his first born daughter and next of kin in any situation. 

I was going to go to my manager today and explain the situation and ask if it was okay if I call in tomorrow. I've already talked to my other coworkers and they said they'd be cool with covering my shifts.

My concern is, what if this call in effects me moving to that new position? I fear that my manager may use this as way to hold me back from that new job opportunity. She's been known to get people written up and at a level 1 violation where that makes them not able to transfer departments. But at the same time, I've only ever called in once before and that was back in October 2019 and I don't have any previous write ups or violations. 

TL;DR: I'm moving to a new position in August but before then I must work in my home department for a year which will be August 5th. I need to take my alcoholic, in liver failure father to a dialysis treatment tomorrow and planned on calling in and let my manager know today. Yet, I'm scared she may use this call in to punish me and not allow me to transfer departments.",01Jul2020,1

I think I fell asleep because I woke up to the door creaking and assumed it was my bf because he brought me to that room. He started having sex with me which I didn’t care. I barely had my eyes open which didn’t matter because i couldn’t see, it was dark other than a crack in the door with light from the hallway coming through. When he was done, he stopped and I kind opened my eyes wider and I think I saw his friend. By the time I could fully get up, he was gone. Idk if my eyes were deceiving me or I had too much to drink. I don’t know if I want to ask my bf about it because if it was him, he’ll ask why did I think it was his friend and if it wasn’t him, that’ll mean I was raped and I don’t know if I can accept that. I’m just really confused and have been trying to replay it all in my head and the same thing keeps coming up.",01Jul2020,1

748,"So I (18M) come from a white, staunchly Republican family, despite living in CA. For most of my life, I've been a republican myself, but as of recent, the flagrant injustices and issues with my country and our leaders have caused me to shift slightly to the left. I wouldn't consider myself a political junkie or expert at all, but I try to have conversations with my family, my dad in particular, as he is the most politically active person in our family. He DETESTS liberals to the point where he even hates the color blue (im being hyperbolic , but you get the idea). The discussions with my father usually end up in any/all of my political opinions being dismantled and discredited, as he is incredibly intelligent And spends 90% of his day following the news and politics since his job allows him to. As you can imagine this causes a lot of cognitive dissonance. I know that deep down, there are serious problems with our country that I'm just not educated enough about to combat my father's intellect, but that's not all. I've had multiple family members say they'd disown me or my sister if we became liberal. So, I've always tried to keep my views fairly ambiguous and just say I'm a centrist whenever somebody asks. It just sucks feeling like I'm forced to subscribe to a political ideology I don't agree with at all and if I try to dissent, i risk sacrificing my relationship with my family who I love and rely on for financial support. In summation, I feel like a charlatan because I act one way around my liberal friends and another around my conservative family and I hate living like this but I feel like I have no choice.",01Jul2020,1
749,"I have a friend who comes over alot because my mom has horrible planning and doesn't confirm with me in advance. Anyways hes a good friend but just doesnt know how to treat my stuff properly. If he sees something he feels the right to mess with it and i end up finding something wrong about. Hes also very reckless with my electronics. Constantly dropd my headphones. Slams mouse and just basically stabs my drawing tablet with the stylus. Im getting an expensive drawing tablet soon and thanks to my mom once again inviting him over without my agreement, i fear he'll do something reckless again, destroying the tablet. Hes also self centered and whrn i was trying to draw kept telling me to download blender so that he can try it out. And when i was trying to stress test it to see how well it ran he kept insisting he do it because ""he knows what hes doing"" and constantly kept taking the mouse from me or controlling the pc with the tablet. He also kept yanking out the aux cord as a joke. So what is the best way to confront this type of behavior. Telling him to stop simply wont cut it...

750,"Alright so, a couple days ago I was in the pool which I go to on a routine, everyday around in the morning, that day I decided to go around 3pm instead of in the morning, I’m chilling on the sofas around the pool when a group of girls pass by, some of them look at me I also look at them. Over time they go to the pool I go to the spa, then when I’m done with the spa I go to the pool.

Once I go to the pool I start swimming and everything, some of the girls in the pool group started looking at me and talking, later on they were saying “Just go up to him” and a girl says “Just say he’s cute” so at that moment they were making it obvious as fuck it was me, I mean they were looking at me, laughing while looking at me saying go up to him while looking at me. So I knew...

Time passes by and one of the girls goes to the sofa, so another girl from the group comes up to me and says; “Hey my friend over there thinks your cute” I introduce and manage to get her number + snap.

Anyways, days have passed and we are talking normally and everything. Now here’s the problem.

We’ve been talking normally and yesterday I wanted to text her in a humorous/flirty way, so I did, everyday I would say Good night with a heart next to it. So to be funny and flirty I said yesterday when I told her Good night with the heart, she said it back and I said; “Where’s the heart doe🥴😂” she says; “Bahahaha, we barely know each other lmao I only thought you were cute soooo” At that point I was a bit triggered so I said; “I mean it’s just an emoji 🤷‍♂️” and also said; “Isn’t that how it all starts? You think I’m cute we get to know each other and what happens happens🥴😂” she says; “um kk” So at that point is that might’ve set the mood down, so I say; “I feel like I ruined the convo what I’m trying to say is that the heart was just an emoji, you said I’m cute so I’m trying to get to know you, if we get to know each other and you don’t like me then ok and if you do then also ok but like don’t get weirded out or sum, I was just tryna be funny with the where’s the heart thing” and I also said Good night without a heart.

So, my question, do you think she is playing hard to get? Did i go overboard with what I texted or is she just being dramatic of it? Thanks",01Jul2020,1

753,"Please take your time to read this, it may be a long post. I just want to outline everything that's happened because, I need help, urgently. I'm not very good at writing so please excuse that. Sorry if the post isn't very clear, I'm willing to answer any question related to it, if it means you can help me.

I have severe anxiety, depression and probably some more mental illnesses that haven't been diagnosed. (My parents only know about the anxiety)

I'm 15. Almost finished with high school. I've missed a lot of time off school because of it, every time, my parents have threatened to kick me out, shouted at me endlessly, called me helpless, even a few times, I was hit ""because you're my daughter and I'm allowed to, go ahead and phone the police or childline, I don't care."" 

The school doesn't care at all. The school is open for one day in 2 weeks, and there are more things than I can count that are causing me HUGE amounts of anxiety related to it. No one cares. 

I've done literally no online schooling because I find it too stressful, I'm too anxious to ask for help, and I'm just completely lost with it in general. I told my parents that, and guess what, they don't care and nothing I do is good enough, and it just ends up with me getting shouted at. I don't shout, unless they do it first, otherwise, they won't listen. Talking softly is pointless to them.

Anyway, my parents WILL NOT take me seriously at all, nothing about me is good and I have no achievements or anything that they can be proud of me for. Every time they try to talk about me about my anxiety, they're just shouting at me, not understanding of me, they don't even treat me like I'm human for gods sake.  I can't reply to their stupid shouting rants without bursting into tears and running away (which they make fun of me for) I've asked them to stop shouting and to talk nicely to me, otherwise I don't want to talk to them, and guess what? they made fun of me for that too.

They make me feel like I'm a massive joke to be honest, that no one will ever take me seriously, that I can't do anything without failure, that I'm not being worth listened to, and because I'm young, my problems mean nothing.

Today, my mom told me i had to go back to school for one day in 2 weeks. The idea of that makes me want to fucking die. My anxiety is so bad at this point that I'm hopeless. 

I told her I didn't want to go, and that started another round of shouting and insulting. That I'm a joke. That it's not as bad as I make it out to be. That they wish I didn't live with them. That they're perfect and everything is my fault.

754,"I'm really really hurting. Two years ago my father committed suicide and we had to renounce inheritance and also we were to shocked to go to his place, we had to give up everything or ruin our life by taking up his overdue taxes (trust me it was a common decision with family members, absolutely necessary). The point is that he had in his home all our childhood pictures, because he made them. Now they are all lost except a couple that my mother has in her nursing home. 

I also threw away a few years ago in an impulse my 3 favourite childhood soft toys, and I am now desperate with regret.

I also donated a hockey stick to the local ice rink that was given to me by my father when I was a child with the idea that they would store it forever since is from a national team, but when I went today to retrieve it (they said ok) I found out they had lost it or someone took it or whatever. Is gone, and I feel like a monster for giving it up to them in the first place.

I also consented 5 years ago to have my upper wisdom teeth pulled even if I wanted truly to try and save them (cavities), the dentist would have accepted but she looked so disappointed in me that I gave in and let her pull them. I want them back, I can't tell you how uncomfortable I feel without them and I did it so just to please her and I hate myself for that. She was my sister's dentist and I went to her just to be closer to my sister.

In short, I have nothing. I feel horrible. Is true that I have a bad past because of abusive family, but I wanted the comfort of my childhood toys, that hockey stick as a precious gift from my father, my body integrity with my wisdom teeth, my life story in childhood with those pictures.

756,"Hello, everyone. I'm writing this to discuss something that my boyfriend is doing that is a little alarming to me. Me and my boyfriend are both in our 20s, and we have been dating for a month and a half, but I have known him for two months now. Everything between us has been going great for the most part. We both agreed fairly early on that we wanted to be in a long-term relationship. We were talking about getting a place to live together someday on a fairly regular basis too. He started getting more serious about it in the last few weeks though, so he started looking at places and I did too a little bit, but I kept my mouth shut about feeling like things were moving too fast because I figured it was harmless to take a look at what was around the area. 

*But then,* he showed me that he's actually got a substantial amount of money put away for buying a place in full, and he said that he wants to move out of his family member's house as soon as he can. He wants me to come along too since it's where I grew up and where my family is, which happens to be in the metropolitan area of where we both live now. It just feels like a whole lot at once, and I'm not really sure what to do. I don't want to ruin our relationship by telling him that I'm not comfortable moving in with him yet. I just don't have a good enough gauge on who he is as a person to know if saying something like that to him would make him mad, or if he'd understand.

I also want to get out of my current living situation because I just came out of a several-year-long abusive live-in relationship to living with family again. I miss the autonomy and freedom that I had and also my own living space, but it feels so soon... I really need some advice about what I should do. I feel like I could be very comfortable living with him if it had to happen, maybe I'm looking a gift horse in the mouth a little bit, but I'm just nervous about it. I'd also like advice on what to say if I decide that it is too much too fast for me. Thank you.",01Jul2020,1

Have many complaints and solid reasons to feel taken advantage of, Getting paid 10.75 after 6 years..didn’t even give me my 25 cent yearly raise this time around. (My fault cuz I won’t even ask) 

Took 2 years to realize speaking to management about anything would be useless.
Before I was the only worker(the 2 other guys got fired 3 years later then should have. 

They technically worked with me but tbh I did everything..then watched them both receive better raises them me...

At one point I was promised gas payment for travel to be a helper from one warehouse to another.. after about a year and a half of doing so(&amp; owing 200 in tolls)..co worker also becomes a helper, immediately receives a gas log for the week.

 I tell management I’ve yet to receive a gas log..he tells me it’s my fault And I should have told him, then only give me a gas log for the previous week.....

I didn’t fight so I guess that’s on me.

Now I’m working 30 mins away from my house in a new location same company. The manager here actually does his job... so it’s very clear I was played into doing the managers job for my first 5 years 7 days a week, until they cut hours .

I have 3 kids ,2 of them are below the age of 2.(only reason haven’t quit yet). But now I’ve saved a little bit of money with my second from home job and feel I could take a home vacation with out going homeless.(Live with parents so rent isn’t crazy)

About April time a girl (30f) I’m fairly friendly from our younger years at school and growing up, replied to an insta story of mine (27m) and we got chatting. Turned 
 out she has broken up with her long term boyfriend at the start of the year. Anyway after chatting for a week or so we met for a walk once corona had eased a bit and have now been hanging out regularly ever since.

She was pretty upfront about not wanting anything serious and I was cool with that. Turns out I have fallen pretty hard for her, I let her know that and that I would like to stop things if it’s just going to be fun and not going anywhere and I don’t see the point of putting myself through anything negative.  

We called it off and she ended up texting me a few time’s after that saying she wants to see me etc etc and like a weak, weak man I obliged. 

So fast forward a few weeks from that it’s now at the point where I really, really like her and she’s still more or less convinced it’s too soon for her but still wants to see me on the regular, asks me to stay at hers and pretty much all the shit that goes along with having a girlfriend without the actual commitment.

The first time it happened, we were watching tv and she got a stomach ache. She laid on me and it quickly turned into what felt like an intimate exchange. I think platonic displays of affection should be normalized, such as cuddling, but this didn’t feel right. She kept asking if I was gay, she must’ve done so about 5-6 times. I gave her my honest answer, I don’t care about gender, as long as their a decent person. It also felt like she was getting really close to kissing me, our faces would get closer and closer to one another and I could see something in her eyes I’ve never seen. Each time we got too close for comfort though, I moved my head away into her shoulder or to look at the tv. We were petting each other, at one point she rubbed her hand down my side which despite it having intention or not, definitely made my mind sink. 

My mind was blurry through the whole thing, however when I regained my senses I felt super guilty. I felt bad that I’d even let it happen, that I’d feel good when it happened, that I’d ruin her relationship with her boyfriend. At this point I wasn’t sure whether or not this was normal, so the fact that I might’ve been over-sexualizing it also made me feel terrible. I had a mental breakdown right there and then, but I couldn’t tell her what was wrong because if she didn’t think anything of it then she’d be mad and we’d lose our friendship I hold so dearly. I couldn’t sleep that night. This exchange was never brought up again.

About a month later, most recently, it happened again. This time we were at her house where there’s only one bed. We are not above sharing beds, this usually isn’t an issue for us. Though the tv was on my side, which caused her to lay on me in order to get a good view. About ten minutes later she was practically on top of me, not really focusing on the tv, but rather me. Her face was in my neck, which like my side whether or not it had intention, it’s a problem area for me personally. At one point I was being an annoying prick like I usually am and she bit my neck lightly. Our faces got close once again until her cheek was on mine. It remained like that for about ten minutes.

This time felt much more real than the last, and I’m pretty sure this isn’t normal. Even though technically nothing has happened I feel like she’s cheating on her boyfriend with me and I feel incredibly guilty about it. I could push her off of me and call her out but once again I wouldn’t want to ruin our friendship. Also the horrible truth is that I’d be lying if I said I didn’t like it. Romance is not a part of my life, but as a human I do experience the same longing for connection as everyone else. I hate that this is what it’s come to. I want it to stop.

What’s worse is that she might not remember doing these things. She’s been through a lot in her life and is prone to “blackout” sometimes. It usually happens when she’s angry, she’ll get so into her own head that she isn’t aware of the situation she’s in and doesn’t remember a thing about it. I’ve only considered it to happen in great feelings of negative emotion, but it could also be happening when she’s tired. This makes the situation a whole lot worse if she is blacking out because I don’t want to take advantage of her. Even if she’s not blacking out I don’t want to take advantage of her.

I know that this is also on her for doing these things, she’s not void of blame. But I’m the one letting it happen and not doing anything about it other than enjoying it like a pervert.

So two questions really:
1. I know that I’m a terrible person, but is this situation actually happening or is it all in my head?
2. How do I make myself stop?",01Jul2020,1
781,"Hi I am a girl(16) and this probably isn't a big deal but I would still like advice on it. So my parents are divorced and they are both having seperate 4th of July parties. At first I chose to go to my dads because it seemed I would have a better time. But I came to his house today to just be informed that one of my cousins (Male, 15) (Not really related step-brothers cousin) said that 'I asked him to cuddle' (which is so weird) at the previous birthday party we had. I don't remember ever doing this. I honestly don't think I ever did this. But now it makes me feel uncomfortable around parents because no one believes me because it ""isn't out of my character"". I ask my female cousins to cuddle or my aunts but I never ask boys because because I am straight. I only cuddle a boy if I am in a relationship with him. Back to the main point I feel uncomfortable because I feel when I am around his parents they are going to think differently of me, or I will be judged and looked at. I don't feel comfortable going to my dad's 4th of July party at this moment. I think I will feel more comfortable at my moms even though there won't be much to do. What should I do?",01Jul2020,1

783,"



I have this one friend Malori 28F she dates a lot of different people and usually has a new relationship every month. I met Brandon 25M and Audrey 26F a year ago also. Brandon and Malori had hooked up, but he was kind of a fuckboy and led girls on. She said he was manipulative, but because he wasn't outright abusive, I didn't stop being around him, but I never hung out with him on one.

Audrey and Brandon started dating 
I would go over to his house and watch tv or drink on weekends because I was good friends with Audrey before they dated. Malori was upset that Audrey chooses Brandon. Even though Audrey was texting and talking to Malori to hang out while she was dating Brandon trying to be an excellent friend to Malori, she was still furious. She would see on snap she was hanging out with Brandon instead of her, and this made her sulk for weeks.

Audrey and Brandon broke up because he was creepy. I told Malori about this, trying to her Audrey and me to hang out. She went off on me saying I betrayed her and that im a bitch for choosing the Brandon side. She said she never wants to hang out with me anymore because she told me he sucked. I told her I never hang out with him one on one and I was just trying to chill with my friend group(cause usually more people would be there)

She told me im an awful friend for picking his side, and I got on the phone and screamed at her. I told her this is not my fault and to go fuck herself because I didn't date him or have anything to do with there relationship; also, she never dated him officially. Also, while this was going on, I texted her while they were dating if she was okay. I told her this is why no one likes her with this pity party bullshit. Am, I awful for screaming at my friend?


Tl;dr: My friend Malori hooked up with a guy named Brandon from my friend group. He was a fuckboy then started dating a mutual friend Audrey. I hung out with both of them but still texted Malori but she was upset they were dating. They broke up. I told Malori, and she went off on me saying I was a lousy friend for picking his side. I yelled at her on the phone.",01Jul2020,1
784,"31M/Canada

- High functioning ADHD
- Extremely extroverted and motivated.
- I have been one of the top salesman in Canada for almost a decade for my brand.
- Constant inner dialog to compete, one up, compare and be combative to anyone I feel possesses critical thinking skills or implied intelligence.
- Constant fear of missing out and fear of being successful/having more responsibility/maintaining trajectory.
- Recently aware/self-diagnosed myself as suffering from grandiose and vulnerable narcissism, likely since my 20's.

Current reality: Being massively aware of my ego and narcissism, being utterly disgusted with it and trying to deconstruct it.

My conclusion is that it's likely the result of childhood trauma, family dynamic inadequacies, cardiovascular stimulant medication for ADHD at a young age, our capitalistic consumer society and this specific industry; fostering that mindset for gain. But, the moment we are aware of something negative in our lives, truly aware, every inaction to repair it, is pure neglect, and I refuse to neglect my mental health anymore. So while these attributes to my personality might not be 100% my fault, they are 100% my responsibility to heal.

I burned out, from all of it, from competing, from trying to one up, from dressing well, from trying to impress anyone what so ever, I don't even care about cars anymore... This lead me down the path of mental health, self-sustainability, growing my own food, giving back to my community, learning real skills with my hands and expanding my knowledge on earthly things. Pretty much the complete opposite of what I've been doing in my life. To define an identity for myself that ISN'T a creation of whom I think people want me to be, or that best positions myself for monetary gain.

I want to change my life, and I don't care about the money anymore. One thing I discovered through all this self discovery lately, is that love, light, happiness and community, don't cost a damn thing. Money takes certain stresses away yes, but those things truly don't cost anything. And not being motivated by money, but instead a sense of purpose, a sense of pride and accomplishment; is what I want to fill my proverbial wallet with.

I started growing microgreens, which lead to growing Cannabis, which lead me into being interested in Botany/Plant Biology. Genetics, breeding, photosynthesis, mycology, horticulture and many many other topics. I'm obsessed.

I want to go to University, I want to get the absolute highest level of education I can attain before I'm 40, to be credible not because of my ability to convince you I am, but because of actual effort, experience and follow through; things I've selectively manufactured my whole life.

Congrats, you made it through a manic dump of an ADHD persons thoughts, there was no beginning, middle or end and I haven't even posed a question.

I think I'm wondering if It's worth jumping head first into something completely different but wildly exciting based off the fact that I feel like my highly competitive job has affected my mental health and exacerbated underlying neurotic issues that are otherwise at bay when I'm in a loving, nurturing environment.

I should probably see a therapist I know, but my ego prevents me as I'm hyper aware of all the cause and affect in my life and feel like I'd just be analyzing a therapist analyzing me, uninterested in taking stimulant drugs, I feel like a machine on them, but empty and dead.

787,"So let me give a bit of backstory about myself. I am in my final year of graduation in one of the STEM fields. I am quite dedicated guy when it comes to subjects taught in college or anything in general. So, my GPA has always been between 7.6 to 8. I also have the ability of seeing ""the big-picture"" and using a knowledge of one field into another field, and simplify that to an extent that any layman can understand. I am also quick to grasp any stuff that is being taught to me.(or thats what my teachers say). Whenever i learn about a topic, i have an habit of digging deep into what current stuff is being researched in that field and so on.
But the problem lies that all this efforts doesnt carry meaning. This has lead to disillusionment of my Interests. I am doing this stuff just because i dont have anything useful or interesting to do. A sort of time-pass if you say so. 

I get bored easily and it is accelerated by thr fact that noone shares an enthusiasm to learn new stuff like me. Noone puts up a competition against me. Sure there are high scoring people in my class. But excluding a few, every one studies one night before the exam. I think thats the most disrespectful behaviour one can do when achieving knowledge. Tese people just want to graduate and get jobs but not knowledge. As for me, i dont know even why I am here. Atleast they have their priorities clear. I never thought what i would do in future. And i still dont know where i will end up, wherever i will be , i am sure to give it all, cause even then, i will have no meaning to do that thing, even though i have to do it, so why not be the best at it, right?
This has lead to people thinking me as a genius when i hardly try my best, i just do ut because i have nothing else to do. I get quite irritated when they think i am smarter than them.
That is what i think about everything. I dont have interests, not because i haven't tried even once. But i have tried in every field but couldn't find that X factor that would motivate me to do more . 

I just want to find that one thing that i will be interested in , to which i can dedicate my life to. And even if i find that thing, i am now scared that i will still be disillusioned and resentful to that stuff.

I just cannot find that one little thing. What should i do?",01Jul2020,1

He is being faced with numerous issues now such as smelling of beer, police harassment (drinking in his car &amp; sleeping in his car, etc.)

794,"I was informed yesterday that my sibling is having 4 people here in the house this weekend. I was told they’ll mostly stick to the main room and the main bathroom. The main room is sizable but not big enough for 5 people to keep 6 feet of distance at all times, especially since they’ll probably be staying for a long while. I do not know if they’ll be wearing masks. This plan was approved by my folks.

I don’t think having people over for a recreational reason, especially so many all at once and in the house, is responsible given the pandemic. We are not a healthy family and are all-around high risk due to a combination of obesity, asthma, diabetes, heart problems, and old age. 

No one has had any friends over and suddenly it’s ok to have so many people over all at once and in the house? I am very troubled by this. I’ve put my irl social life on hold for my family’s sake and I don’t understand why others haven’t. 

Side note: my sibling has a coworker who is currently suspected of having the virus. Allegedly they’ll get test results before the weekend but I just feel that that’s increased risk for their friends.

795,"I’m planning a trip to Japan. It’s going to be 6-7 or us attending. My best friend, who’s practically my older brother, wants to invite someone who he “mentors.”

This guy is not a nice guy. He’s a bully and a kissup. He’s manipulative and a liar. He constantly had to be the center of attention and everyone has to do what he wants or we do nothing. 

Japan is vastly different than America, definitely different that NY. It’s reasonable for the Japanese to assume that if you’re going to visit their nation, you’ll do you best to adhere to social norms and customs. He won’t, he’ll go out of his way not to. Whenever we do anything with him, he always has to bring attention to himself and scorn towards us. 

He’ll make sure to do so when he’s there. He’s already said out loud that he’ll fuck with us the entire trip because “if you’re going to drag him along, he’s gonna have to have fun somehow.”

That fun has already gotten one of us arrested. Imagine in Japan when the police arrest us for bullshit he did. I mean, this asshole planted something on a friend while in a store once, and promptly got stopped by security and police were called. This piece of shit did that. My older brother just looks past that. 

He want to invite this guy with us. I’ve been talking to my other friends about the situation, and we all have the same thoughts. The only issue is how to address it with him. He’s unfortunately easily offended especially when it comes to his friends.

796,"I live in a mobile home park and a few weeks ago our family dug into the area in front of our home for a plant. Some time after 2 guys came around the area to solve an electrical issue with lights in the park and came to our house. The park owner told us we may be charged as we did not have authorization to dig and plant. They dug around the tree and repaired the damage and took an hour, maybe 2 at most. She gave us an invoice later for over two thousand dollars and said it was determined our digging caused the damage. The invoice stated over 8 hours of work for each technician. Now I understand they have to access the electrical problem and narrow it down to our house through testing but they finished at our house by 11 AM and were not onsite for anywhere close to 8 hours.  When I addressed this concern, the park manager said they do not control what the vendor charges. She said this will be automatically charged with the space rent next month. 

In all honesty, it is likely we caused the damage. I may be biased as this is a large sum of money for us but after reading the rules we are suppose to get approval to dig ""more than a few inches below the surface of the ground."" We did not. It doesn't state we would have to pay for the repairs. I feel like we pay a large amount of money for space rent already and some of it should go to utility maintenance. Again, maybe I'm biased as the invoice was more than our space rent. What should I do here? Is it fair for me to just pay it? Can I fight this in some way? Any advice is appreciated.",01Jul2020,1

The first two times he tried to hide but the last time he just walked inside his screen porch and then turned around and looked at my dad with his hands on hips. 

He probably didn’t know I was home right now when he went out and did this, but it’s unnerving because he was hiding behind the side of the truck where the houses with children wouldn’t be able to see him. He was covering his junk with one hand but he was looking around all nervous. I don’t know if my mind is blowing it out of proportion, but this is weird either way.

I don’t know if he’s an exhibitionist or if something more is going on, but it’s not acceptable when there’s minors (within eyesight) in the neighborhood and I feel like I should be able to feel safe being in my house. He can go do that in his private backyard, but not next to the public road. 

My family has been talking about calling the non emergency line, but I’m afraid he will know it’s us whos called the police on him. Clearly something is a little off if he thinks this is acceptable behavior and I don’t know how he will react because he knows my dad has seen him now multiple times. What would you guys do in this situation?",01Jul2020,1
812,"two girls have been best friends for 3 years. one is J one is L. J has been a loyal friend to L even when L doesn’t reciprocate half of the energy in the relationship that J does and J is way to good to have a shitty friend like L. Even though L treated J like shit and was the most selfish pos that the world has ever seen, J still continued to save her from her “destructive home” when she would go to pick her up from her house late at night and welcome her to her own home so she could get away from her family on multiple occasions. J’s family treated L like family and J’s mom even went over to L’s house with J one time to check up and L and her siblings after an incident with her mother. J used to have a hard time making friends so she was grateful to finally find a “good” friend like L, and L took advantage of this. Now, J doesn’t have trouble making friends and has multiple friend groups, and L didn’t like that. So she decided to pull a shit story out of her ass about how J is a bad friend and only cared about herself the whole time and how she’s completely done with her. What she fails to realize is that J is the only person she has left other than her boyfriend who is afraid to stand up to a psycho like her but even the boyfriends own cousin apologized to J for L’s insane accusations. J has other friends now, and she doesn’t need nor has she ever needed L. It’s L’s loss and she’s too stubborn to see that but J is fine and she’s happy she doesn’t have L and her dead weight holding her back anymore. L also fails to realize that the person that treated her like her own kid, J’s mom is getting all of J’s texts and sees you calling her every name in the book and making wildly insane accusations and she is planning on taking further actions if you don’t leave her alone. So I hope you know this is for the better for her and she has moved on and you need to stop being so obsessed with her and move on as well. you will realize you lost the best person (the only person) who truly cared about you and your pathetic problems. xoxo",01Jul2020,1
813,"So I have this friend and absolutely EVERYTHING has to be about her and centre around her life. She's a family friend so she's really hard to avoid. She constantly says very passive aggressive things and will give back handed compliments too. You cannot have a conversation with her, it's genuinely just her talking at you about how great her life is and how she's going through this and that. She treats our 'friendship' or whatever it is like a competition. I honestly have lost respect or anything like that for her. She even found out I have a therapist (which I keep very private) then starts telling people about it as if it's her business. 

I don't know how petty this all sounds but it's starting to really effect me. Every single time I see her I end up feeling worse. I don't understand why she has to treat every single thing like it's a competition. How can I be around her and keep calm?",01Jul2020,1

Age 19, Male. Nationality: Indian

Doing Btech IT in a 2nd-grade college(nor best neither worst)

So, To begin with, I am feeling suffocated, I used to give myself hope but now it's not getting worthless.

I am not good at ANYTHING, like legit not a single freaking THING.

oh, wai- *""You should try to find something you're good at...lol...EZ...solved"".*

I've tried countless times, I've introspected myself countless times...but I can't find anything that I good at. 

1) When I was in school...I wanted to be the smartest out of my friend circle, I sucked at studying...I would give up easily after 15 Minutes of reading...Ultimately...I lost the dream of becoming the smartest one, fair enough...I didn't work hard and I didn't like to study.

2) I really loved gaming and had a serious plan of making money out of it but I had to be good at it, I started playing games (FPS, action, sports, etc) but no luck here either, I SUCKED. I loved playing games but It was pretty worthless because even after putting many hours into it, I wasn't able to improve and If I wasn't getting better I wouldn't be able to make money off it.

3) I was like...dang man...What should I do...So, an idea popped up...oh hey ""YOUTBERER, I WILL BE A YOUTUBER"". I recorded myself multiple times...my videos were in a ""less funny, more cringe"" category and I didn't have a camera face( I am ugly ;-; tbh...I told I will write everything about me).

&amp;#x200B;

4)At this moment I was like *""Of course...If I suck at studying, video games, making videos, art, music, etc...There is still one thing left: PROGRAMMING""*

I started programming in college...I again wasn't good enough as all my classmates were way better than me in terms of applying logic **(programming requires only one thing that is logic)** ...but this time I refused to give up and went ahead learned everything but in the end, even thou I learned everything every word, solved many programs...My logic didn't build up.

817,"to cut a long story short, mine and my sisters mom passed away about a year ago. My sister moved out about 6 years ago but had a difficult relationship with our mom. 
I still lived at home with our mom until she died and tried my best to keep things good between our mom and my sister but they’re both strong characters, and my sister tends to ignore things and hope they’ll go away. 

I’ve since started clearing out the house and make things more comfortable for myself as it’s difficult to live here; a constant reminder, it’s not ‘our’ house - but my sister doesn’t want anything touched - almost like a shrine to our mom. 
I haven’t thrown anything away yet aside from some stuff which has gone to goodwill but only stuff I knew my mom wanted to throw out. 

I told my sister that I want to move out of the house but shes not ready to sell and wants to rent it, but I want to sell my half and start my own life with my partner so I’ve left it for now until she’s ready which could be years yet. 

Aside from this, I’ll sometimes message her and tell her things or ask advice and she’ll ignore my messages or make accusations that mom loved me more or that my partner is a gold digger (she isn’t. My partner has never once asked for money). 

We’ve had a few small arguments and one big one the other day, but I’m losing trust in her now because of her judgements, and whatever she wants, she gets.  In my opinion, she’s not dealing with the death at all - just ignoring it and hoping it’ll go away. 

Am I being unfair by wanting to move on with my life?  Should I put everything back in the house the way it was to please my sister even though she refuses to step foot in the house? 
Or should I go with what she wants and rent the house out and waste money renting another place with my partner? 

I don’t want to fall out with my sister but she’s either not seeing how this is all affecting me or choosing to ignore it.",01Jul2020,1
819,"Hi everyone,

I am currently very confused with my life, and my head is filled with unknown and loneliness. For some reason, I decide to ignore the fact that I live with my family, have supportive friends, and keep a stable job. It is a situation where I recognize all my feelings, but have such a hard time actually applying action into my life. I ask everyone around me for advice and help, just to mask the fact that I know I have no ability to help myself. I am only 18 years old, and all I hear is, ""You are so young, enjoy your young life!"", and however true that is, I can't seem to grasp it. I have unbelievable amounts of these waves of sadness, and sometimes, I only keep myself distracted and busy so I am away from my thoughts for long as possible. 

My father is an alcoholic, not recovering, because he is very up and down when it comes to relapsing, as well as going to rehab. I only see him about 3 times a year, but the kicker was that he moved out about 4 years ago, not being there for me at all throughout my high school years. Now that I am moving onto college, he won't be there as well, because he just recently moved into rehab for a full year. Not only that, but he got a second DUI, losing his license for a few years. 

The reason why I am bringing up my father is that he left a lot of, ""Children of Alcoholic"" traits within me. For example,

\-Approval Seeking

\-Fear of Abandonment

\-Guess at what normal behavior is

\-Have difficulty with intimate relationships

\-Extremely loyal, even in the face of evidence that the loyalty is undeserved 

My father is far gone in my life, but these traits are affecting my personal life as of now. Probably to the point where I can get into depressive episodes. The biggest thing for me right now is my issues with love.

Every time I meet a guy and get to know them, I see romantic aspects in them. After we talk more, I fall in love pretty quickly. The kicker is, they do one thing that makes me question this romanticized view of them I have, and then that makes me question the relationship we have. In the end, I self-sabotage and stop talking to them. Things like a big nose, weird hair, or an unattractive clothing style can completely shift my view on them. The general problem is, I daydream so much, and think about them constantly in this perfect way, and then when they do something human, I come to believe they are not good for me. In hindsight, when I think about it, I probably have lost many good matches due to my way of thinking.

My mother always tells me that, ""He's out there and will find his way to you"", yet, I feel so desperate to already find him, even at my age. After doing some research, I realized that if you look for love, it won't find it's way to you, because 99% of the time it comes naturally. My father's leaving had me mature very quickly, because I had to become my own individual. With no paternal guide in my life, I had to do it in my own way. 

Every time I have encountered a sort of relationship with a guy, all that happens is that it lasts for a few weeks or a few months, they confuse the hell out of me, and I have to leave. I have never experienced someone who is truly loyal and honest with not only me, but themselves. These guys are so confused themselves, that they treat you as if they are dating you and want you, but in the end, only want you in a lustful way. 

I am talking to this guy currently, and I will call him Mike. Mike and I have hung out about 4 times, and I am already encapsulated by him. 2 out of the 4 times, we have had sexual relations. After about a month of talking, he only texts me when he wants to hangout. For example, we hung out on a Friday, and I texted him that Sunday asking to see if he was free on Wednesday. He said he'd let me know on Monday, he never let me know. I texted him on Tuesday, he said he'd let me know. On that Wednesday, he didn't text me until around 5:30 pm, saying it was a ""No Go"". He then did not contact me for a few days, and then one day out of nowhere, he asked if I was free on some day. To generalize it, he only contacts me when he wants to hangout, and never outside of that. He's not a big social media or phone person, and I completely respect that, but sending a text takes 1 second. Even if it's just, ""I'm sorry, I can't talk today"". I would respect that because it doesn't leave me in this haze, unbeknownst to how he is feeling or doing. I'm not asking for texting every day, or making sure to respond to me a second after I respond, I am just asking for some contact, especially if I share my life and body with you. 

It is sad that nowadays, we have to rely on technology to communicate, but this is all I get out of Mike. It makes me sad even to type out this story, because I shouldn't be so obsessed and on top of him. I am not, in reality, I do not text or call him constantly, because I respect the fact that we just met and he has personal space. It is just a little unfair that I am left hanging all the time. 

The whole idea of my post is that I cannot deal with my impatience anymore. I don't want this sadness to overcome me. I have so much to look forward to in my near future, because college is a big step. Why can't I make my goals about me? I don't want to force myself to be happy, I want to be naturally happy. I am tired of looking at articles called, ""10 ways to be happier"". Guys should not fill the spot of emptiness that my father left me, I should fill that spot. 

I have no explanation towards why I have these thoughts and feelings, and feel as if there is no way to fix them. I don't prioritize myself, I put others feelings before mine, because I have a nurturing nature, and I believe everyone should be happy. The problem is, I have no way of finding my own happiness.",01Jul2020,1
820,"So for context: we are both sixteen, we’ve dated on and off for two years. At the moment we’ve been together for four months.

A frequent thing that irritates me/leads to arguements is how often he goes away.
His family own a house on an island at the other end of our country (about a three hour drive away from where we live)
They frequently visit this house(nearly every school break, some long weekends), usually for a few days but it can be up to two weeks. Basically the reason this irritates me is when he goes, it’s a “drop everything and go” situation, often at short notice (think: a day in advance) This leads to dates being cancelled, him not being at group plans, parties etc.  He’s always very apologetic but I think he could stay home if he really wanted to. His older brother is 18 and neither of them LOVE going to this holiday home (so he says) but he hasn’t even tried asking if him and his brother can stay home while their parents visit it.

At the moment, I’ve barely seen him in the last few weeks due to lockdown. We had a proper day trip just the two of us, a group beach trip, and a party  planned, none of which he is now going to as he is going away.

Of course, it isn’t possible for me to go with him or for him to stay at my house as we are both teenagers and neither set of parents would allow it.( to be honest I wouldn’t want to spend a week with his family either, I just don’t really know them)

Basically I feel like he places his family at a much higher importance than me and his friends, as he will cancel friends with us to accommodate their plans, but not vice versa, and it just frustrates me and drives a wedge between us I feel.

TL:DR I (16F) have a boyfriend (16M) who often goes away to his family holiday home at short notice, leading to plans getting cancelled. His parents obviously have the most say in if he goes or not but I think he could persuade them to let him and his brother (18M) stay home if they really wanted to.

840,"TLDR; My brother is abusing his girlfriend, I'm about to have a baby and I don't know whether to tell my already-depressed parents because it will ruin our family at a time when we should be celebrating.  

Long version below:

Throwaway account, I hope this is appropriate for this sub.  I'm really torn up about what to do, would love any advice.

About a month ago I found out my brother is getting into physical fights with his girlfriend.  She contacted some of our mutual friends in a panic saying he had hit her in the face and asking for help.

They are in Europe and I am in the US and it's hard for me to get in touch with him under normal circumstances because of the time difference and because he usually takes about 3 days to respond to an email anyway.  I had no way to contact her but contacted my brother, who said everything was fine.  I asked many times to talk to her directly and he said she didn't want to.  I threatened to call the police and he flipped out, saying it would put both their Visas in jeopardy.  He never denied that he hit her, so I assume that part is true.

After a couple weeks I finally got him to talk to me on the phone.  The conversation started out with him sounding sad and saying things were ""up and down,"" as if things were going to be framed as a hard time he was going through.  When it became apparent that was not my viewpoint he got furiously angry.   He offered a very flimsy account of how they had ""shoved each other"" and that gf was exaggerating.  I told him I thought I needed to tell our parents, he screamed at me that I would be doing them harm.  His main angle on all of it is that it's private and nobody's business but his and his gif. I eventually told him I wasn't going to debate if it was ok for him to abuse his girlfriend and hung up on him.  He texted me over and over running through a range of emotions from reasonable (offering his gf's email so I could contact her directly) to furious (telling me I had permanently broken his trust in me) to exhausted (""go ahead and tell mom and dad I don't care"")  Later he emailed me a very emotional apology for behaving so badly.  I wrote back thanking him for apologizing and saying how much I cared about him but couldn't take ""it's fine"" for an answer when violence was involved.  I asked that we keep talking to try to figure out what to do.  At the same time I emailed his gf saying if she wanted to she could contact me but I understood if she didn't want to.  It's been over a week with no response from either of them.

The main complicating factor right now is that I'm due to have a baby in 2 months.  This will be my parents first and probably only grandchild, and I'm old so they've been waiting for this for a long time.  We live across the country from each other and they are already having a hard time being trapped inside from quarantine and being unable to visit me for my whole pregnancy.  They want to come visit when the baby is born, which is risky but something I want to figure out for their sake.  My mother has mentioned to me that she's been depressed, and I'm sure my dad is too although he wouldn't say it.

I am going insane trying to figure out what to do, I'm so stressed out already just from everything going on in the world and the baby coming.  I want to tell my parents but I'm horrified to put this on them when they are already sad and at a time when family is so at the forefront of our lives.  I feel like this is ruining this once-in-a-lifetime moment of happiness and I don't want that to happen to them.  But I also think they'll inevitably want to Skype with my brother and the baby when it's born, which of course I don't want to do and need a pretty damn good reason not to.  I don't want to have to reveal this situation suddenly in the moment when the baby is here and we are supposed to be celebrating.

I'm also worried about what will happen in general when I tell them.  My dad will undoubtedly want to call the police, which several domestic abuse chatlines have told me is a bad idea unless the victim has approved.  My mom will be utterly heartbroken and blame herself.  I just want them to be able to be happy and excited about the baby as much as is possible under already difficult conditions.",01Jul2020,1
841,"I just graduated with my Associates in Science and it's time for me to move. Currently, I live in the upstairs apartment of my grandfathers home. He is a disabled veteran and allowed me to stay for free while I finished college. It's now time for me to fly the coop.

Several years back, I was hospitalized over a domestic violence incident. My mom's boyfriend got drunk and broke my cheekbone, and because of that, I lost my full time job and had to put my life on hold and dedicate nearly a year to daily outpatient mental health rehab for PTSD and trauma victims. My credit is very low because of the bills from this, and my mother has stayed with this man and thwarted my attempts at receiving any kind of support from lawyers (she chose to stay with the bf). 

I have a cat and a dog, both are on my pet insurance. I will not part with them, they provide much needed therapy for me. 

I am currently receiving unemployment from a previous job and have the money to put down, and when I am able to Uber again I am easily able to make 200+ a night. My car is exceptional on gas and very reliable, so I dont have much of a net loss by doing this when i include the discounts i get for my phone plan and other things by driving for Uber. 

I'm nervous. I've never done this before and my anxiety makes me feel like I'm under a lot of pressure to move quickly, as my grandfather asks me about it frequently. 

I also live in central New York, so being able to afford living on my own here while covering my current car payments and full coverage insurance isn't really a viable option. I have reliable friends that will room with me, but I dont know how all this works. I considered moving back near Pittsburgh where I'm from as rent is considerably cheaper, but then there is the added factor of how to move all of my things there.",01Jul2020,1

I haven't played in a few years, I played from 2nd grade to 8th grade so from when I was 8-14, roughly. 

I quit before highschool because I kind of just lost interest. But recently me and one of my buddies I used to play with/against in our local league has been playing some catch and doing some hitting by pitching to each other and I really want to get back into it again. 

When we were in those age brackets, we had some choice what we wanted to do, but we had to be a jack of all trades. That means you had to hit and field. I usually tended towards shortstop and pitcher. I was an alright batter, neither good or bad, like literally probably a .250. Really what I want to get back into mainly is the pitching as that's what I enjoyed the most. The issue is I'm super out of practice so I'm very wild and inconsistent with my throws and pretty much my only pitches right now are ""fastball"" and ""fasterball"". 

I really want to join like an 18+ league or like an adult league but I don't feel I'm close to ready to being able to pull my weight on a team, but I also feel like if I joined a team the experience I'd get would get me to where I need to be. 

I don't have money for special pitching training or clinics so I'm not really sure what to do. 

I guess what I need advice for is what can I do to improve my pitching to get me comfortable enough to play in a league or even be comfortable trying out for that matter. My friend is willing to catch for me but he isn't a coach or anything and he hated pitching so he can't really give me advice.",01Jul2020,1
844,"I have 3 younger siblings, 16f, 14m, and 11m. Me and my sister cuss around other people, but I have never felt comfortable doing it around my siblings and neither has my sister. My brother though is just discovering that he can say these words, but thinks it's okay to direct them at us. He's called me a whore before, called my sister a slut, and calls my 11 year old brother a pussy, and flips us off all the time. I absolutely am not okay with this, but my parents don't even know it happens. If he was only cussing around me and my sister and not calling us whores/sluts, I would be fine with it. But doing that and also cussing around our little brother is just too much.

Long story short we took a trip to our grandparents without our parents, he cussed the whole car ride even though I asked him not to, and today was the breaking point. He called our little brother a pussy again so I got in his face and told him to say it again, he said he didn't want to, I said it's because someone was actually threatening him this time, and he said he would beat the hell out of me, so I smacked his face with my open palm, and he started swinging at my head with his fists. I typed out a text to our parents describing exactly what happened, and he was begging me not to send it because he's already grounded from his phone because of other shit he's done.

I know I probably shouldn't have hit him, but nobody else was standing up to him and the threat to tell our parents wasn't working anymore. I also know this is petty stuff to argue over, but I'm tired of him thinking he's a big strong man who can do whatever he wants. 

Basically I just need help with deciding what to do. I've already said I wouldn't hesitate to send the text this week if he did something like that again. Should I actually tell my parents or should I just keep holding threats over his head? I'm considering telling them already because I didn't even leave a mark on him, but he left a knot on my forehead. I'm kinda worried that because I got into a physical fight with him that they'll try taking my phone/car/whatever, because they still hold that over my head.",01Jul2020,1

846,"Sorry for the long post! Please read thoroughly and help me! Throw away account for obvious reasons. 

I truly have no idea why she would tell me this because she is causally dating my boyfriends brother. Anyways, last night she came over and we had a few drinks and were shooting the shit about everything. She went radio silent after awhile and stared off into space. Naturally, I asked her what was on her mind and if she was okay. She became visibly upset and asked me to promise not to tell anyone what she was about to tell me and asked me to not be upset with her. I of course said yes and that I wouldn't be upset. However, I was not expecting her to make this completely unnecessary and random confession. She said ""Jimmy told me he would fuck you in a heartbeat if he ever had the opportunity"". To say I was sick to my stomach would be an understatement to say the least. 

She kept saying she was sorry and told me to forget she ever said anything. At this point I asked her why she felt the need to tell me such things, as I truly could have gone without knowing. She said she told me because she was upset that he confessed to wanting to fuck her bestfriend and that I had the right to know.

Here is where this fucks me up.. I literally tell my boyfriend everything and the idea of not telling him this sits really uncomfortably on my chest. Especially where his brother is here quite often and we always have plans with him. He's literally always around. I am going to have a very hard time sitting face to face with him after this due to the fact that in my opinion, if you confess this to a woman that you are seeing, to me that means that you think about it often enough to bring it up in conversation. However, I also dont want to completely betray my friends trust and potentially destroy my boyfriends relationship with his brother either, which I am pretty sure it will. I have a tell all face and my boyfriend can immediately identify my uncomfortability and uneasiness so if I do not tell him, my face will give me away. 

I'm aware that these things are bound to happen sometimes and most of the time it's simply uncontrollable. I can understand that. My biggest issue is the fact that he told her, which causes so much unnecessary tension, when he simply could have kept this to himself and everything would have been cordial. In the beginning of my relationship he did make some uncalled for advances and comments; such as showing up randomly knowing I was home alone or asking me to come hang out and smoke with him while his brother watched the kids but it was never over the top and it has pretty much stopped within the past 2 years. Now he simply stares at me, tries to make me laugh, finds ways to engage me in random conversations after everyone else has left the room (which is almost always him talking about his love life), etc. 

Please take into account that there is a massive possibility that my friend will twist the story around and lie to save her ass if I do speak out. She has a history of doing so, though not with me. However, she can be extremely manipulative and there is a good chance that this could come back with an extremely negative impact on me personally if I do speak out.

This puts me in a horrible position to say the least and I desperately need some advice here.",01Jul2020,1

849,"While walking my ( Age 23) dog with my headphones in through the nearby park, I passed 3 kids (probably no more than 10/11 years of age based off their height and that they were playing in the ""little kids"" area) to my knowledge, no parents around so perhaps they live locally?

The commentary I was listening to ended and with it, I was able to hear my surroundings: These kids were yelling at me and yelling obscenities at me to boot, how I was gay, stupid, abuse at my dog, etc. I thought about how to respond to this; I hadn't taken my headphones out out made eye contact with them, perhaps it was best just to walk away and pretend I didn't hear them when in reality, I could hear the little shits every words. Instinctively I looked back before leaving the park and discovered 2 of the 3 kids had left the play area and were heading towards me; they stopped when I looked back at them; grinning like some kind of cartoon. 

Inside I was furious; what were they planning to do had I not caught them in the act? I wanted to pick up the little shits by the scruff of their necks and slam them like a basket ball into the dirty stream nearby. But aside from that not being legal and admittedly pretty drastic, it would be hard to argue that as ""self defense"" to verbal abuse from children... 

Part of me wanted to tell them to fuck off or at least give them the finger, but I thought better of it and moved on. Thing is, as I walked on I gave it more thought; I had let them treat me that way, I can't let them do this again because what if it escalates again? I thought about how i'd approach this potential situation in future and currently my plan is as follows:

Should these kids give me shit again, I will not pretend to miss hear them, I will instead walk towards them in a calm yet intimidating manor and ask ""what did you say? I don't think I heard you, can you repeat what you said?"" They're kids, so there's a good chance they'll back down to someone twice their size. And if they do, that will be the end of it; i'll reply ""thought not!"" and move on with my day.

If they don't...here's why i'm asking:

I will GRAB a kid by the arm and demand he tells me where he lives, any attempt to speak over me will result in me demanding louder. He (at least the plan is) takes me to his house, I knock on the door and try to have a calm discussion with his parents: explain why i'm here, why this is an issue and ""remind"" their parents that while I might have not escalated to violence, someone else might not be so forgiving.

The largest issue I can see here is misunderstanding: the kid will probably demand that I let go and that can look bad without context and there's also the problem of ""maybe his home is shit?"" as in maybe his parents won't care? There are a lot of (for lack of a better word) CHAVS here...

I'm not sure what the best course of action is: I don't want to do anything to drastic, but I can't let them get away with treating myself and others like this in future. What should I do?",01Jul2020,1

852,"Hello! I need some advice. I am currently going into my sophomore year at a private institution, pre law. I am in a 2+ year relationship with a man I love. We live together in an apartment with our little puppy. 
Basically, my entire family is obsessed with the fact that I am pre law. They love that I will be successful and rich, and have a better life than they did. I don’t want to be a lawyer. My dream is to be a wedding planner. 
For our anniversary a bit ago, we took a vacation to a city about 4 hours from us. We fell in love with it and decided we want to live there. I want to drop out of my fancy-lawyer school and go to a state school online and study Hospitality and Event Management, while getting a wedding planning certificate on the side. During my schooling, I’d like to intern for a wedding planning company to gain some experience. My boyfriend is a welder and he is in online school right now for his bachelors. He is Pre-Med and will eventually go into pharmacy. We found a house we adore, and are in touch with real estate agents right now. We’ve thought about everything, especially financially. This is really the life we want, so desperately. Unfortunately, my family will disapprove greatly. 
My question is, is it worth it to live a life I’m not really happy with just to please them? Or should I go and follow my dreams? I can’t guarantee that they will still want to be part of our lives. I’m so torn. I’m looking for an outside opinion, advice, similar experiences... Anything!! Thank you.",01Jul2020,1
853,"Hey reddit, sorry the title is vague and the format might be weird; I started typing on my laptop and switched to mobile. Buckle your seatbelts because this is a doozy and my family is a clusterfuck.


So I (f22) have been renting my room from my mother(53) since I graduated high school. The original deal was ""if you're not going to college you have to pay rent."" Which at the time was set at $150 per month- super reasonable. When I turned 20 and finally was offered a fulltime position at my job (minimum wage still) she doubled it. At the time we had some financial issues so I considered it to be okay since I could afford it and I'd be helping out. 

I'd been wanting to move out since then and things at my house just keep getting worse but what's keeping me here is not having a license or a car. I was pretty much told to get a job and keep one since I was 16 and ive been pretty much paying for my needs since then.  so between that and school, getting my license has stayed on the back burner I’ve tried to make appointments but my state is always booked, and I cant afford tot ake a day off of work to possibly be able to take a drivers test (I've already done it twice and was sent home both times because they had accepted as many cars as they could for the day).  


 I saw that working minimum wage my whole life wasn't going to work if I ever wanted to become independent. So fall 2019 I started college fulltime, expecting I wouldn't have to pay rent (per my my mother’s words) and could save up to get a car and ideally an apartment. But upon telling my mother about this she said ""you waited too long to go to college so now you have to pay rent regardless."" It was a financial blow, I was already working OT every week to be able to afford college and the rideshares/users (there aren't any bus routes near me going that direction). 

But she convinced me that she was right and I decided to continue with school and just take out a loan. Everything was going OK but since COVID she's been absolutely insane (I really don't know what other word to use here). Her and my dad have been divorced since i was really little but have had hot and cold interactions recently. There was a situation where he ended up moving in with us for a while and my mother kicked him out several times. It never really bothered me because thats their drama, not mine. He’s been renovating her house for free this whole time and anytime she has a bad day she screams at him about how everything is wrong and she hates it and will hire someone else to finish it. She also yells at me and my siblings (f17 and m19) for stuff like relaxing on our days off from work and says stuff like “I just want to move to a cabin in the woods by myself and not have to deal with all of this.”  

 
Some small things that set her off include walking around while she’s sleeping, not keeping my room clean (I'm 22 and pay to live here, should she even be able to tell me that? It’s not like it’s a pigsty, I just don’t keep things tidy all the time), playing video games, coming home past 11pm, not cleaning dishes before eating, doing chores but not the way she wants them done, anybody sleeping on her precious couch and getting annoyed at guests she invited over for the weekend when they are in the living room. 

 
It just keeps snowballing day after day, so I've been avoiding her. She even called and told me it was my responsibility to make sure my dad takes his Prozac (it’s not. Hes fully functioning and is a grown man -he can keep track of his own meds and deal with the consequences if he chooses not to). But since my room is being redone (not my wish or choice, I’d like to add. But whatever it’s her house she can decide how it’s decorated), I have to sleep on the floor or in my sisters room is she’s not home.  Last night my sister was too loud coming into the house with her two friends and she basically told them to leave and then locked both of the doors and went to sleep. But she literally locked my sister out. She was in pajamas and just saying goodbye to friends, she didn’t have a key and everyone was a sleep (including me, she told me this once she woke me up and I let her in). This morning after my mom left I was talking to my sister and dad about it and my dad shared with me that my mother was planning on raising my rent to $700; more than double what I pay now, all because I told her I can keep my room as clean as I like because it isn't damaging the house or the room and it’s none of her business since I pay to live in that room (paraphrasing). So now I'm freaking out because I know I can’t afford it, my job doesn’t have any OT available and tbh I’m sick of working myself to death and having to deal with the chaos.  
 

I’m looking into an apartment near my work for now so I can just walk there- or possibly getting a place with my brother or my boyfriend- but I’m just really at a loss. I have so many questions and need advice on a personal and possibly legal level. I can add more information as needed but I feel for now I’ve written all I can without feeling overwhelmed. Thank you in advance for any advice.

855,"First of all, I've known this girl for about 5 years because she's my sister's good friend. She's very attractive but I never put too much thought if she likes me or not. She's few months older than me and we are both 21 years old, my sister's 23. We never hung out too much before until one time few days ago that I actually started to think that she likes me. She comes over to my sister to hang out with her and says hi to me in my room. We have a nice chat while my sister was there and when my sister goes to bathroom to get ready while I make coffee for all of us. She moves to the sofa where I was sitting exactly and keeps looking extremely happy at me and staring at me. I finish making coffee and sit right next to her and she immediately starts asking me questions about my personal life, about my job, what I'm doing right now, etc. We talk for about 10 minutes and I'm starting to pick up signs that she's really into me, she's playing with her hair like crazy, watching me in the eyes while I talk and I catch her staring at me few times. Tone of her voice keeps constantly changing and she seems very fidgety. Now alarm bell starts ringing in my head, bcs I can usually tell that a girl likes me, but she's very weird and very flirty type of person and about 2 years ago we were coming home with a few friends from a party and she grabbed my hand because she said she was tired and cold and we walked for about 10 minutes like that. Now here's the situation after my sister comes back into the room. 3 of us talk about parents and social media stuff and I constantly see her looking at me while I talk and I'm looking at the TV not at her, as she's sitting right next to me, I can feel her look constantly on me while we laugh and talk. She looks at my sister and right at me everytime she starts laughing. I say this stupid joke that I didn't even think was a joke or funny in any way, she looks at me for 2-3 seconds without a reaction, and when I turn to look at her, she makes this very short and weird giggle and starts laughing at my joke. Now what's troubling me is that I have a really strong feeling she likes me, and I can usually tell if a girl likes me, but she's my sister's friend and I don't know if she's being super nice, but all the signs are telling me she likes me. Now, the moment I'm about to exit the apartment to go over to my friend, she asks me this really weird question about my socks and why do I wear white socks with black sneakers. I say to her that I never wear black socks because I don't like them. She just keeps staring at me and I say hi to my sister and her as I exit the apartment. First of all this was first time two of us hanged out together alone so I'm really confused and any help would be appreciated. I ran into her today at the gate entrance at the beach as she was exiting with her friends and I was entering the beach. She saw me first and called me by this nickname that no one ever calls me, she looked super excited to see me and she hugs me and we kiss each other and we say hi to each other, she asks me what's my sister doing and I reply fast because I was on the entrance and we just say bye to each other, it was like 15 seconds conversation. Now I don't know how to approach this situation or when I'm gonna see her again, I know her name on Instagram and I guess I can send a request but I don't know if it's smart because I'd like to first ask her out and have some alone time together then do that.

862,"So, every year my husband’s family has a huge 4th of July party. All the family and friends are there and we are talking like 20-30 people. My husband is typically reasonable unless it involves his family. He typically wears a mask out and makes sure our kids also wear them when out. When I found out the party was still happening I was shocked. His aunt is diabetic and has health issues and his grandma is getting pretty old and has many health problems including breathing issues. I myself have lung issues and have not been in great health the last year or 2. I told my husband how scared I am and he said he still wants to go regardless. I’ve begged and told him how I feel several times but he won’t budge. He is always like this with his family. He also always thinks I am attacking them when things like this come up. He is so quick to defend them, even when unnecessary. I feel like I don’t get the same sort of respect and aid from him. I feel like he always chooses them over me. I am going to offer some compromises but that’s never really worked before so I don’t expect it to now. What should I do? I am for sure not going but I still don’t want to be put at risk by him and the kids going. I absolutely do not want my kids to go either but I am sure he won’t stand for that. I have no clue how to keep myself  and my family safe. I’m also really worried for my husbands aunt and his grandmother. How do I make him realize a party isn’t worth all the complications it could possibly cause? Also, am I over reaction or being unreasonable?

The compromise I have already suggested is going over the night before, do some fireworks and I will help them get things together for the party. The other suggestions I thought of is I could go stay with my grandpa for a week or 2 to be safe. But, that isn’t a good solution because there would be no one to keep our kids while my husband works. The other suggestion is for me and the kids to not go and him go to the party and then stay with his family for a week or 2 after. I know he will hate the last 2 ideas though and say I am being crazy. Also, they house the party is at is a small house that can’t fit 20-30 people so people will be in close proximity both inside and outside on the patio. People can spread out in their large yard but there will be people all over the place so social distancing won’t be possible most of the time and they wouldn’t follow that guideline anyways.

Jason: “PS5 exclusives are bad, the ps4 has bad loading times, and playstations game pass sucks, plus I have 30+ friends who play XBOX why would I switch for 2 on PS5?”

This aggregates next because all of criticisms except the last are from Drew Goodens new video. Jason has never once talked about Game Pass and now he does. Jason thinks the PS5 will be just like the ps4 and have all the same flaws, but to me this is dumb. It would be like refusing to buy the XBOX 1 because the 360’s design interface was lame to you. Every console gen improves, so it’s ridiculous to expect consoles to have the same exact flaws as last gen.

Jason has never really used a PS4, he has used an XBOX 1 for a long time. I Have has and used both heavily, I feel like I’m more experienced to talk about consoles but once again no matter what I say he refuses it and says to just get an XBOX.

Lastly the part about having more friends on XBOX upsets me. I know he plays with other people but it is dramatically less than how much he plays with us. He has a few people that he plays smite with, and that’s legit the only people I have ever seen him in a party with. For the 30+ Xbox friends he has and wants to stay for, I don’t understand why I’ve never seen them in a party. 


I like Jason as a friend, but his reasons are very dumb to me. The only positive thing he has said is he might consider it after the PS5 has been out for a while to see if he wants it, but I know he will just get the XBOX. I really don’t see him waiting months for a PS5, I think it was just an excuse to get me to stop talking. 

Other people in the friend group I play with haven’t made a comment, so I don’t know what they are getting. 

How do I get him to reconsider?",01Jul2020,1

868,"My car broke down 3 days ago. After some research I found that there's a recall on it but I never received a notice about it.
We spent the last few days ""fixing"" what we thought the issue was before we learned about the recall. I've spent quite a bit of time and money on what we thought the issue was and I also had to miss work since it's hard to get around without a car in this city. 

Would the manufacturer be responsible for reimbursement on what I've spent? I need my car back asap so my brother offered to fix it himself but if he does, would I get reimbursed for the parts I purchased? Would it be best to just take it into the dealership for them to fix? Even if it takes them a few weeks?

869,"My boyfriend has a best friend who is gay, and who has admitted in a drunken moment, that he is in love with my boyfriend and hates me for being with him. My boyfriend is entirely straight and turned him down in a nice way. However, they go very way back and my bf didn't want to lose him as a friend, so they still see each other regularly. His friend came to stay with my bf for a few days and my bf wanted me to join them for dinner and drinks, so we could get more familiar with each other.  


His friend is a nice guy, and he is nice to me in spite of his feelings for my boyfriend. However it's very clear to me, when we're all together, that the feelings truly are there and I find myself becoming very unsure of how to act and react. For instance to the fact that my boyfriend is his background on his phone or that he tries to interrupt me often to get my boyfriends attention and flirts with him quite obviously. 

It also leads to me being less affectionate around my boyfriend, because I don't want to hurt his friends feelings or seem as if I'm marking my territory in a bitchy way. If this was a girl I would have talked to my boyfriend about boundaries and my feelings, but I'm finding it difficult to do so. I know my boyfriend has absolutely no romantic interest in his friend, however I feel like the whole situation crosses my personal boundaries a bit - how do I best talk to my boyfriend about it, or act when his friend is around?

870,"I have this friend who is like a father figure to me. He always has had a rational head on his shoulders until about a few months ago. 

It started with a few conspiracy theories and whatnot, but I didn’t mind because I like a conspiracy theory as much as the next person. 

But it’s gone way too far. He now believes all of these crazy theories, like everything he is saying makes no sense at all. He doesn’t believe in the coronavirus, he truly believes that celebrities are eating the skin off children to remain youthful, and so on so on. He lives his existence off them. He’s even quit his job. 

His wife has left him because of this and he doesn’t seem to mind. He says, “she just doesn’t get it. She doesn’t see the truth. She won’t see it.” He thinks I’m like him, and will see the “truth” in a few weeks when he teaches me it all. 

He sometimes sleeps in the forrest and he’s connecting with people online who are equally as crazy. It’s like they’re bouncing off one another, and refusing to spend money and only using trading as it is “the only way forward” because of the whole “radiation poisoning”. 

He keeps telling me that I’m “so close to knowing the truth”, and saying “Can I trust you?” And I feel awful for making this post just in case he sees it, because i know he’ll walk out my life. 

He looks physically unwell too. He’s lost around 30lbs and very skinny now. 

Can somebody please help me? I can’t sleep because of this. I hurt for him.

(p.s. he keeps giving me salt and other things).",01Jul2020,1
871,"I went through a mcdonalds drive thru with a couple friends. When we got to the pick-up window, the lady at the window let us know that our order wasn't ready and asked us to pull up to the left of the vehicle parked ahead of us (there was a gate there so obviously she meant ""to the right""). The guy in the driver seat said to her ""nah, I'm gonna pull up to the right, not the left!"" and waited for a laugh but never got one and then he pulled up to the spot to wait... while we were pulling into the spot, he says ""I guess she's not in a good mood today...."" and the person in the back seat says ""Yeah, she was so rude! You're supposed to smile and be friendly to customers!""

(The driver often makes cringey comments or sarcastic jokes with the expectation of food service workers to laugh, which I've never called him out on before)

Watching the way it played out felt similar to seeing a man tell a woman to smile and when she doesn't, he calls her a bitch. (( Not saying this situation was equally as bad, just felt *similar* ))

I spoke up and said ""the minimum wage worker doesn't owe you a specific reaction, she's just working and she's busy. If anything, he was rude for feeling entitled to a specific reaction to his comment.""

Both of them got defensive that I called them out on their sense of entitlement and told me I'm wrong and that I'm being a bitch.

874,"I'll preface this with saying I really don't want to, but I've been weighing up my options for months now and I'm at my wit's end. We've been best friends since we were kids, over a decade now, but in the past few years our relationship has turned into something incredibly strange that I know isn't normal but I persist with anyway.

 I'll try and cut to the core of the problem as best I can, but it's complicated. We've always been ""best friends"" in the typical sense, but in the past couple of years he's started periodically ghosting me, I've brought it up and he'll shrug it off with some throwaway statement like ""I'm just fucked"", which he refuses to elaborate on no matter how much I pry, I know he's depressed, we both are, but I'm recovering slowly but surely whereas he doesn't seem to be, his moods might improve, but he doesn't seem to be making any actual progress, that being said, even if he were I wouldn't know because he refuses to tell me anything of significance about his life.

 He keeps telling me about his unrealistic plans instead of shit that currently needs addressing, it's like he doesn't want to move on from smoking pot and talking shit but pretends he does. I've tried to tell him I can't handle him periodically ghosting me but it seems to have no effect.

 The main problem is, when we get talking he can make me laugh like no one else in the world, but only if we're talking about video games or complaining about shit, the latter I'm trying to put behind me, whereas he doesn't seem to be; also I have literally one other friend besides him, so if I cut contact with him, I'm risking basically complete emotional/mental solitude, but if I don't I'll only get drip fed what I need to stay sane and feel not so alone.

 Not to mention we've diverted significantly politically lately, he's always been and still is pretty left wing, whereas I've done a complete 180 politically, which makes for some pretty awkward conversation occasionally, especially since he doesn't seem to be able to handle a lengthy rational argument/discussion...  Should I keep prying and try to get to the root of the problem, or just say fuck it? I don't want to throw something away when I might regret it.",01Jul2020,1

877,"Last summer, I started really liking a guy and I told my friend about it. One day, I was telling her something that he had told me and she basically told me she thought he was full of sh*t. I got ticked off at her and blocked her for two days, after I realized how silly I wAs being I texted her, apologized for being immature and we moved on from the situation. A few days later, I told her that he did lie and she said something to the effect of “I told you so.. Im smart and know how to read people.” Lol
We continued our regular conversations after this. A few weeks later, she never spoke again. I didn’t want to think it was because of what happened because we were back to normal after I apologized but now I see that was probably the reason she never reached out to me again. I figured she thought it over and realized she couldn’t be friends with me anymore because of this. I completely understand and take responsibility for acting the way that I did, I admitted to being wrong even before finding out that he lied to me. I thought she would actually forgive me but apparently not. What I did was immature. 
One thing that’s not sitting right with me about this whole situation is that she remains very close to all of her other friends who have done WAY worse than me. 

My friend is a lesbian who has dated two straight girls and both of the relationships were emotionally exhausting. Both girls tried to keep Ashley a secret from their friends and family and both of these relationships lasted over a year. I was the person that Ashley mostly vented to about these situations and it was not pretty. One girl had a boyfriend the entire time and would not let Ashley date anyone and the other girl left Ashley for the ex that she swore she’d never get back with. Both of these situations were devastating for Ashley and I was ALWAYS there to help her push through. Each time she would get back with these girls, I didn’t say much and just told her to do whatever makes her happy. I never judged her or belittled her about the situations. Ashley, on the other hand, doesn’t do this. Every time any of her friends who dates guys has any type of drama, she runs to me and tells me how DUMB they are and how stupid straight women can be over men.
I get that Ashley wants the best for her friends but the way she judges their situations rubbed me the wrong way because I feel like she did the same thing to me with her other friends. She is very judgy when it comes to her other friends relationships with their boyfriends. Ever time something goes wrong in their relationships, she’ll tell me how dumb they are and how she’d never do what they do. And then goes on a long rant about straight women are dumb over guys. While I can agree, I don’t like how she made it seem like heterosexual relationships are the worse when she goes through the same things in her relationship with women.
Since we haven’t been talking, I noticed that she is back close to her ex. The ex who made her stop talking to other girls when she had a boyfriend herself, the ex who lied to her, emotionally and verbally abused her, on top of other things. They are literally like two peas in a pod now. She also remained close to her other best friend who told her verbatim that she could not be friends with someone who was gay and that she prays that she’ll get “delivered” and become straight.
I’m not understanding how she can be friends with them, but push me to the side. I could see if she told me why she could no longer be friends with me but she flat out ghosted me. I reached out to her just to say hello last month and that’s it. Afterwards, she posted about how she’d never be friends with someone again after they stopped being friends. 
Aside from that one incident, I’ve been nothing but a good friend. I know I made a mistake but I was hoping she’d be willing to forgive me like she has forgiven all of her other friends. 
Am I wrong for thinking this way?

Tl;dl: My best friend of nearly 10 years ghosted me. i admitted that I acted out of character for blocking her but I cant believe she just ghosted me without any explanation.

Edit: I wished her happy birthday on FB a few months ago and she never responded (which i didn’t expect her to) but i follow her on twitter and maybe an hour after I told her happy birthday, she tweet “don’t wish me happy birthday because I’m not telling you happy birthday on yours”.",01Jul2020,1

I feel like I do not have a real purpose anymore and that I am just wasting my time.

It sounds really crazy in my head and I am sure my parents would find it crazy as well, but I feel like I have a gut feeling to do it. I have been saving up since the fourth grade, so it is not a financially irresponsible thing to do, and I feel better about spending money on something like this rather than clothes or anything else.

883,"So before anyone dismisses me after reading the title, I just want some validation or someone to just be like “man it’s not that deep move on”...so I was dating a girl for the last about month and a half (I’m also 21), things were great, however I thought it was weird she was always talking sexual to me, and always talking about having sex. But I thought she was into me. We had hung out a lot, and this past weekend she invited me to her apartment to hang out. She had talked to me (before we hung out) about having sex and I told her I’d feel more comfortable if we both were to get tested first. And that was the first thing she did was schedule an appointment, I (unfortunately) was too busy to schedule one so I told her we wouldn’t have sex this past weekend. 

I made that clear and she understood. So Saturday rolls around, and I go up to her apartment (which is about an hour and a half from my house) and we hung out around the city she lives in and went out to dinner. Things were kinda great, we were “bonding” and learning about each other. That night she wanted to buy some alcohol, and I agreed, BUT I told her I didn’t want to get drunk, and she seemed to have respected that. Later that night we were watching a movie and we pulled out our drinks, they were heavy in alcohol content. I was taking sips, because I didn’t want to drink a lot and get drunk. She kept telling me to “drink more” “drink more” and I said “cmon no I don’t wanna get fucked up”...but she kept pushing me to drink and drink and next thing you know I was pretty drunk, not black out drunk tho. 

Then after she kept telling me to drink, she told me to follow her, and I stood up and the room was spinning, I could barely walk with out stumbling. Next thing I remember we are in the shower naked, I kind of remember being in the shower and swaying around and knocking the shampoo bottles over, that’s how tipsy/drunk I was. Then next thing I can remember we are in her room, and she is telling me to take off my clothes and then I can vaguely remember having sex. The next morning I woke up and was still naked and said in a kind of jokingly way “did we have sex?” And she was like “yes” and I said back “oh my god...you raped me” not that sexual assault is funny, it isn’t. 

I just felt extremely uncomfortable because I did not want to have sex. I had only known the girl for about a month and a half to two months. Then today (2 days after) she texts me and says she doesn’t see this working and basically cutting me off. Idk, I definitely feel I was taken advantage of, especially since I told her I did not want to have sex. Maybe I’m just over thinking this and over reacting bc adults have one night stands or fuck all the time. If anyone has read this to the end, all I wanna know is if I am validated in what I’m thinking or if I am just over reacting. 

I am not trying to be dramatic but this has been really bothering me since this has happened a few days ago.",01Jul2020,1

I'm 24(M), and I feel like I'm in a terrible spot in my life right now and am unsure what to do and who to turn to. I'll start with some background on my family. My parents and all of my family are extremely conservative christians and this is the way I was raised as well. I have an older brother who is 26 and is pretty much the perfect child.

Throughout high school, everything came very easy to me and I was able to get 4.0 every year putting in the absolute minimum effort possible. I hated school and would rather spend my time playing video games or hanging out with my few friends. My parents would always tell me I needed to learn better study habits because college and work life would be harder etc and I couldn't skate by on just my natural ability all the time. I knew this was true, but being as stubborn as I am, I didn't really care. College comes around and again I'm doing the bare minimum. I still get pretty good grades the first year and a half but I'm hating every minute of it. I didn't have a clue what career I wanted to pursue (still don't) and it just felt like I was wasting time and my parents money. I ended up quitting to my parents dismay towards the end of my second year. 

More background on my family. my father makes good money for himself and my mother doesn't work. The agreement was that I could stay with them until I finished college and found a job to support myself. My brother was not as naturally good as school as I was, however he studied for hours and hours daily and got good grades as well. He graduated from 4year college and is now pursuing medical school as well. He was the type that never got into any trouble ever and seemed to never do anything wrong. I was a good kid, however, my friends were a little different than the types of kids my parents would like I guess.

When I finally moved out of my parents house I was 18 and living with a friend of mine in a house we were renting out of. Throughout high school, I never did any drugs and very rarely drank, but my friends all did, I was usually the sober driving and caretaker. My family is very much against anything including weed. My roommate was a big stoner and I had no problem with it but just never ended up trying it until later. I tried and liked it and pretty much became one too.

For work, I was in car sales (still am) which I actually do a pretty good job at and make a decent amount of money. The problem I have is that I am absolutely terrible at managing my money and for some reason refuse to follow budgets I've made even when I know better. I've since gotten myself into quite a bit of debt and my credit is abysmal and have no savings at all. 

Now comes my problem on what to do and who to turn to. I'm in more debt than I'm making money to pay, I live by myself now in an apartment I rent. Over the years my parents have always asked how I'm doing and if I need help. I've always said no every time for a few reasons. One being im just plain stubborn and I feel like accepting help from them is admitting that they were right and I can't do life on my own. Another reason being that I was and still am deathly afraid of what their reaction will be if they find out just what kind of life I live. The last reason being that I feel guilty because I don't feel like I deserve help from them when it's my own mistakes and bad decisions that put me here in the first place.

I don't know how to talk to my parents and tell them that even though I always have told them everything is fine, It's not fine and I'm hating my job, have no money, and that I sleep around, smoke weed/do lsd/shrooms, am not into religion at all and actually despise what religions are, and that I don't agree with a lot of the things they believe. Everytime I see them, I have to play a different character other than myself and act like I'm my brother basically who does no wrong. I just can't even fathom what their reaction would be if they found these things out, but the weight of it all is tough.

On top of it all, I don't have any close friends other than a couple who I hardly even see now because I work almost 10 hours 6 days a week. I just feel lost and want a change in my life and don't know what to do. I want a job that I love, but don't what, I want to get out of my debt, but I barely make enough to pay for my basic bills. And I feel like an outsider from my family because I don't share the same views as them and try to pretend that I still do.

At this point, I work all day, go home extremely tired, have a few hours to make food or maybe spend a little time on my favorite hobby (gaming) just to wake up and do it again the next day. I feel like my time is running out though because soon if I'm not paying the debt, I won't be able to keep my apartment and my car and I just don't know what I'll do.

TLDR:

I feel like a failure because my family would strongly disapprove with who I am now and what I believe/what I do. I don't have any friends because I spend all my time working. I am in too much debt for me to currently handle. 

I don't know what I want to do with my life but I feel like if I continue on the same path it's just going to get worse and something needs to change.",01Jul2020,1
890,"I started a job as a teller at a bank maybe a month ago. During my interview I was told I'm to wear a skirt, and heels. They said the heels need to be a mininum of 3 inches, and the skirt needs to he knee level. I thought that was incredibly wierd, and I've always been sort of a tomboy, but I really needed the job, and noticed all eh other ladies were wearing  it, so figured I'd get use to it. Well I'm not. About half way through the day, my feet are screaming. I've never liked to show my legs either. What makes matters worse is I'm asked to make new cards for people several times a day, so I have to squat down to the machine on the floor, in front of customers, and I feel so vulnerable. I have a feeling if I talk to my boss about this, then it's not gonna go so well. I'm so grateful to have this job, as  I was unemployed for a while, but I dont know if this is worth it.",01Jul2020,1

892,"I have always had a problem being unproductive-I struggle to stay still and like to have a project to work on, even in spare time. However my exams have been cancelled due to COVID and I’ve not been doing anything that will produce results in the short term (started next years syllabus, etc and taken some online uni courses) but have been feeling really down lately about not making any progress. I saw on social media some other girls from my year have won a competition to do with designing a solution to a world issue and have won a trip to Silicon Valley, and I have been feeling even worse about myself since.

How can I stop this, and learn to relax?",01Jul2020,1
893,"Throwaway due to not knowing if my friend uses reddit. Long post, I apologize. 

So my (27F) friend (29F) has always had a massive drinking problem. We will call her Jane. Jane has really bad diabetes and whenever she is around, I have to babysit her and check her sugars for her constantly due to her negligence because of alcohol. This has been going on since I was 13 years old. We grew up together and I have always had her back through everything because I watched the amount of abuse she endured growing up due to a negligent and abusive alcoholic ""mother"". Basically she would pimp her daughter out for drug and alcohol money; which then turned into my friend doing this on her own because she too developed a taste for alcohol. Cant say I blame her but anyways, this has become more and more hard to do because of her recent actions. 

She now expects these things from me because I have been doing it for so long. I dont condone her behavior but I dont tell her it's a bad idea either because she is becoming increasingly more disrespectful and violent as the years progress. She has successfully destroyed several of my relationships because I have become what I can only describe as a caregiver for her and it leaves me with no time of my own to focus on a steady relationship. I realize this is my fault because I never said no but I almost feel like it's my job at this point because I have never known it to be any different. However, 3 years ago I got extremely lucky and met a man who fell in love with me because of how ""caring"" and ""selfless"" I was. He is one of the best things that could have ever possibly happened to me and I am overwhelmingly happy. 

This is where things took a turn for the worst. Jane started showing signs of jealousy at my new found love and started doing things that in my opinion were a desperate attempt to ruin my relationship so I could be all about her again. Over the past year I have allowed her to come over several times and she always shows up with her whiskey and 30 rack in tow. I dont know where she gets it because she has never worked a day in her life but I never question her. At first she was super touchy feely with my boyfriend and commenting on how handsome and funny he is. That soon turned into her attempting to dance off of him whenever he was around, wearing skimpy see through clothing, and trying to get him alone. I practically begged her to stop and she did, I thought. The next 2 or 3 times she came over she was super respectful.

However, jump to a week ago. She invited herself to my place, which usually I do not have a problem with. This time she showed up with her 2 small children so I knew it was going to be a bad night (she doesnt take care of them and pawns them off on me; and they literally have zero respect or discipline). She kept making comments to my boyfriend and at one point told him that he should go buy a vehicle and travel the world, which is something he does in fact long to do. He said he would never leave me behind and due to my career and schooling, I simply cannot up and go at this time. She seriously looked at him and said ""Well I will be here when you get back. It's not like you'll be gone forever."" And gave him her 'seductive smile', as she calls it. I have seen the look enough to know what her intentions were at that point. I asked my boyfriend to go inside so I could talk to her and she lost it. She started saying things like ""What? He cant even be fucking friends with me? Are you really that controlling? Talk about insecure!"" I ignored it because she as well as I knew where her intentions lie at this point. At this point my boyfriend is refusing to go inside because she is in my face screaming at me about how pathetic I am. He then raised his voice at her and told her that she either calm down or she is to leave immediately. She then started the water works.. literally bawling her eyes out saying she was sorry and that she didnt mean it, etc.. 

I actually believed her.. until yesterday when she showed up and told me to go inside so she could have a chat with my boyfriend. I trust him, but not her. So I did go inside but I stayed beside the door to listen in. She kept asking him if he hated her and if there was anything she could do to make it up to him. She was inching her way toward him the entire time and even though he was backing away slowly, she still managed to loop her finger in one of his shirt buttons and somehow managed to corner him on the backside of my porch where she simply laid her head on his shoulder and was rubbing his chest. He broke free, despite her attempts to prevent it. He told her to leave immediately and to not come back until he talked things over with me. 

Now I am faced with a decision, obviously. He does not feel comfortable around her, understandably so and he also does not want her back at my house. As much as it hurts me to do so, I have to cut her out of my life for obvious reasons. I simply dont know how to go about this because she is in fact suicidal and has been hospitalized multiple times due to suicide attempts. This may set her off the edge. I'm trying not to focus on that because I need to move on with my life. I am so ready to live a normal, stress and drama free lifestyle with the love of my life and I simply cannot do that with her around. How do I go about this?",01Jul2020,1

899,"about 8 or so months ago I went to a friend's house. there were 6 of us there. all bar one drank a lot and smoked a lot of weed. me and the sober person were lying down together talking and I pressured them into giving me a hand job. and tried to pressure them to go further. 

in my mind at the time, I didn't notice anything awry. sure, I was being foreward but to me it didn't feel any more that I usually am. everything seemed fine. I think I remember telling them to tell me if they were uncomfortable and I'd stop but I've come to doubt that. 

I thought I did everything by the book. I'd like to think if I was in that situation but sober I mightve picked up on the non verbal/ non explicit expressions of denial but I'm terrified I wouldn't. 

I would never knowingly do that to someone. ruin someone's life. subject them to that. but I did it.

At first I got along great with this neighbor, he was great a little chatty but that was fine. Then I broke my leg and my brother came to stay with me for a bit till I can walk again. 

The neighbor then made a full 180, he wouldn't talk to me anymore, and he started yelling at everyone and anyone who would walk past the building.

Recently he complained to his landlord that the cigarette butts in front of the building were getting ridiculous, after our ashtray out front mysteriously disappeared. Then he blamed me and my brother. My brother is only 16, he has anxiety and deals with anger issues. My brother smokes but not much.

My neighbor recently started flipping my brother and I the middle finger. Only after his landlord came over and blamed me and my brother for the cigarette butts. The neighbor also mocks my brother anytime he says anything. My brother has a speech impediment, and the neighbor mocks him for it. 

The neighbor also gets upset when I close the window when he smokes weed. Side note, I'm allergic to weed smoke. This neighbor just sits on the front steps all day and smokes and rants to anyone who lives here.

So please give me some advice reddit. I don't know what to do. I feel harassed but my mom said that this isn't harassment. She also said I can't do anything about it. I can't call the building manager because they can't do anything. So please I need help. I just don't know what to do.",01Jul2020,1

920,"This is going to be a long one, and I'm awful at TLDR's, and never really tried Reddit before. It's getting lonely up in quarantine so... here we are. Myself, (16F) is trying to tackle life head on. Good idea? Probably not, but I'm not known for particularly good decisions. 

For context, I've been dual enrolled since freshmen year of high school, meaning I started college at age 15, and will be graduating high school this summer (2020). If I keep going through school, I'll have my associates Spring of 2021. I currently have a job and am taking two classes through the summer right now. A couple of years ago I had been hospitalized multiple times for clinical depression and anxiety. We've come far, but I know I'm going to live with those two for the rest of my life. It's more about pain management.

The struggle: I started having more breakdowns recently, my lowest point being dropping a gallon of juice on the floor and crying trying to clean it up (wasn't a good day, but can definitely laugh at how ridiculous I looked). That's started to happen more frequently (not the juice, the crying), and the other day I had to leave work early from the severity of the panic attack. My major stressors are starting to get in the way of me living, and I'm afraid of the consequences of my actions because they now start to impact my life path. 

The stressors: Career paths, current employment, and personal development.

I'm trying to decide what I want to dedicate the rest of my life to (career-wise). I'm scared, and I don't think I'm ready to make that decision, but I can't afford to be a deer in the headlights. I've always loved languages, and art, and select sciences (geology, earth sciences in general, astronomy, etc), but I struggle with putting them together. Do I double major and work two jobs? Do I work one job in one field and make a hobby of the other? Do I work one job now and make another my retirement plan? Do I double major anyway? Do I take more electives to make time for things to explore? I'm technically already a Sophomore in college so these decisions are gradually getting more pressure put on them.

On to current employment, I do not work enough hours in the week to make the amount of money I want to reach certain goals. I've been averaging 12 hours a week (I know it's technically really great for someone my age, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to work, but I want to work more), and it takes about 30-45 minutes to get to work (I only have my permit but can get my licence in a few months) I feel burdenous with people giving me a ride to work because of the gas money. I'm trying to save for a motorcycle and an iPad Pro as of the current moment. I know it sounds silly, but the motorcycle is my best transport option (plus they're hella fun to ride) because I don't have to cart an adult/licensed person around, and the iPad I'm trying to use as a laptop/school notebook/artistry stuff. I tried out a friends apple pencil and really love the feel (I have carpel tunnel and also don't eat as well as I should so the heavy pencil helps with my very shaky hands which sometimes hinder me from taking notes in the first place.) 

As for personal development, I'm sure every 16 year old has this crisis. However, I'm constantly around people that are matured into their adult life. I took classes on campus (hopefully still will), and my older sister's friends also became my own (they're all married/engaged/living independently, between ages 20-28). As a result of being around people already moved through this stage of life, I feel like I'm doing something wrong. I feel like I should do/be better than I am. I also really hate the fact that I'm so intolerant of social interaction. I'm quickly exhausted and always need a break from people, but get easily lonely. I'm not sure how to remedy this, or even if it needs remedying. I've always been happy alone, but since growing more, other people my age pointed it out. I never knew how strange this was until someone else made it a point to tell me, essentially. Anyway, am I strange or weird, or wrong because of this? I just want to spend most of my days with my cat, my plants, and my tea, but I feel strange for being not normal.

One is my bestfriend of 8 years and then her cousin and the cousins boyfriend. Rent is stupidly cheap, and we are getting an amazing deal because it is their grandmas house we are renting out. Just wanting some advice for moving out, living on my own. and living with roommates. I’m a little nervous, but ready to take this next step. Thanks!",01Jul2020,1
922,"I (24f) have 2 kids (6f, 1m) with my fiancé (25m) and we moved half an hour away from my hometown for a bigger house. My narcissistic mother cried about me taking away her grandchildren and tried to convince me not to move, and when I did she started turning my siblings against me, telling them they can't see their niece and nephew cause I took them so far away.
Slight backstory: my relationship with my parents has been terrible since I was young. They hated each other and took it out on their children, my father doesn't really speak to me anymore unless we run into each other, which isn't often. I suffered from suicidal thoughts, self harm, eating disorders, depression, you name it. My parents decided instead I was on drugs and wouldn't believe they caused it, and decided to make fun of me for attempting suicide. Shortly before I turned 18 I was diagnosed with PTSD due to their physical and mental abuse, but because I was with a child psychiatrist, I was dropped off their list when I turned 18 and got no help. I thought I was managing until the past year.
My son was born and I moved house shortly after. Two of my sisters B and D both had boys very close to me too. All of a sudden my father has a huge interest in B's son, my children are ignored. D gets a dog, he checks in on the dog more than he cares about his kids (he had a dog and was violent towards it so they got rid of it). My mother is babysitting B and D's babies, but told me ""it's your wain you watch it"". I lost my childhood to raising her children while she cleared off to the bar so this was a dick move. The difference they make with me and my children has been setting me off, my PTSD episodes are getting longer and more frequent, so after calling out my mother for making a difference, she gave me one of her usual pathetic excuses, so I blocked them off social media and my phone. Even my sisters, but C is autistic and lives with our mother as her personal maid, she won't understand. I feel awful for blocking them too, but I'll still see all the things my parents do for them if I keep contact with them, and all it will do is make me feel unwanted like it always does. There's so much they have done that won't fit so it's hard to explain how bad it's been. My siblings didn't really do anything though, so I'm pretty stuck. Am I wrong for blocking them to let my mental health get better?",01Jul2020,1

My boyfriend picks me up and drives me. I’m just worried if that’s too many times in such a short span of time to see him. I don’t want them to think I’m doing anything bad because I’m not.

924,"Everything this year was going great, I had a stable job that I thought respected me, I lowered my credit tremendously and was becoming more financially stable, I thought I was rebuilding my relationship with my family and girl who I dated but we became exclusive friends but it seemed like we will be more. Everything came plummeting down on me, job doesnt respect me or want me enough to follow my school schedule and they just use me for when they need someone who will do a job, there seems to be no hope in getting a job in the field I'm studying for even in high school highest required education jobs, and apparently I'm really behind from where a student like me should be at career wise. My family made it clear that they are all gone once they get the chance, only one who might stay is my dad but only because hes a free loader and cant change his way of life at this point. The girl I thought we were getting back into a great place that we even talked about getting a house near her parents, and was just told shes no longer interested in me but someone else, I really dont know what happened. Everything was going great then just like that everything just stopped being great. I have anxiety and just feel like I have been in a rut. I worked so hard to get where I am and everything came crashing down. I have suffered from depression and it just feels like I'm just stuck, I have no medical insurance. Really no idea what to do now. I dont even know where to start to seek help or even better myself in these situations.

925,"This is pretty straightforward but maybe a little niche of a question. 

So I've been having a very difficult time coping with a mental condition/disorder for the past 2 years. 
I have seen multiple psychiatrists and psychologists about it and they haven't helped enough for me to be satisfied with their efforts.
The dissatiafaction comes mainly from the fact that my mental condition is not necessarily found in the DSM V manual and is not a tradition illness that can be easily diagnosed or even labeled.  This is mostly due to the underlying nature of the disorder in that I believe it to have developed from a short period of time in my late teens of experimenting with psychedelic substances. Since, substances of that nature or poorly understood and the fact that there is a lot of uncharted territory on the human brain its suffice to say that the probability of any regular psychiatrist or psychologist to have the means to diagnose me is slim to none. 

So I'm curious are there any psychiatrist who might specialize in a certain neuro scientific practice  most closely associated with psychedelics or am I SOL and just have to accept dealing with the average psychiatrist who only focus on traditionally established methods of servicing mostly understood conditions? Any feedback is appreciated.",01Jul2020,1

I'm a programmer, a gigging musician, I don't read as much as I would like but I love Lovecraft, and horror in general, obviously I enjoy games, so you'd think there are some pretty clear choices for what I should do, but I struggle to organise my thoughts, and I'm prone to starting a project, and losing interest.

I'm super stressed about it, I'm young with no preexisting health conditions but even if I survive I could have respiratory problems for the rest of my life and my parents could die. I don't want my life to be ruined because of some selfish assholes who won't wear a mask but it seems there's nothing I can do to protect myself.

930,Today my friend and I were going shopping in the city and I drove us there and back. We both Made sure we parked in the right area (at least we thought) and payed for a ticket and split the cost. However I got a 200 dollar fine for “parking in a loading zone”. The signs in Sydney Australia - especially in the city are so confusing and hard to read and we were both sure it was okay to park where we did.

932,"I have a comfortable job most of the time. The pay is around 25k a year in Western Europe. It's not that high, but it's above the minimum wage (around 16k a year). I can't really pretend to more due to my lack of skill. Too late to go back to school and I've tried my hand at many a thing; nothing worked out as it was all too complicated for me.

But sometimes the work gets too stressful and I mess up badly. 

If I quit I'll go back home and lose most of my independence. 

My parents can be a bit abusive. On my own I can't find a psychiatrist. I can't afford my own place to rent and housemates are driving me to the edge (because I need help, they are really nice I'm the issue). I will also never be able to buy property here with my salary but I  might be able to back home. But I might not found a job at home, especially with the crisis looming on us.

The job, when it gets crazy, makes me a bit depressed and makes me lose control. 

I'm on medication, I do need to see a psychiatrist. 

I have no friends here, pretty much none left at home. 

If I go back home I might be able to try for a master degree, it's not a sure thing and my last chance is this upcoming year. I could not work in that field, but I could maybe have the title (slightly useless).

My parents would be a sense of security but without much freedom. Freedom here will not lead to much, and I might not get help. I might also get fired if I were to keep on messing up so badly. 

I would ask my parents for advice, but one is mentally ill and would just try to get me back home without truly trying to help ME.

I can ask one other person, they gave me an advice already that I did not follow (yet) and they could try to get what they want without helping ME again (or just be fed up with me in general).

933,"I dont feel I can share what is going on in my life with anyone. My husband is very controlling and will only let me go out with my friends on his terms, the night of the week that he agrees with, not too late etc but he is very hypocritical and will stay out late at short notice getting very drunk and sometimes taking recreational drugs 

Tonight he told me last minute that he would be home from work 2 hours later than usual and to make sure dinner was ready. He called me shortly afterwards to ask me if he could bring his friend around for dinner. I said no as I havent washed in days and the house is dirty and I dodnt want to give a bad impression. He didnt end up coming home for 4 hours and ignored my calls and messages in the meantime. When he got home I cried loudly because I wanted attention and I was upset and he slapped me around the face and squeezes his hand over my mouth and screamed at me to promise to shut up. I couldnt breath and kept trying to tear his hand away. Then he screamed at me over and over again how I was no good.

Before he got home I was so distressed I hit myself in the head and all over my arms and downed 2 beers. The desire to hurt myself badly was very strong.

I dont feel I can tell my friends about my husband's occasional drunken violence because it will be a rubicon we will not be able to uncross.

934,"Title, essentially. Other advice I've gotten says it won't make a difference employability-wise, so I'm picking between the two based on my own interest.

Business pros: I want to be an entrepreneur/lead a company/what have you. 5 classes.

English pros: I want to be a successful writer. 6 classes. If I took 4 more classes (one more class/semester), I'd be able to double-major, something not possible for the business minor.

Essentially, I have 4 semesters and 10 classes until I'm done with my major. At a rate of 4 classes/sem, that's 16 more classes in total (6 extra). At a rate of 5/sem, that's 20 more classes in total (10 extra). So far, I've taken 4 classes/sem, but I expect the difficulty of all my classes to decrease, since I was dealing with weeders.

I could also do neither and put those ""extra"" classes into more CS classes. I'm not that ""excited"" about CS, so I thought it'd be cool taking classes I'm interested in.

935,"It makes me sad to admit but I really don’t like my mum

I love her I just don’t like her

She is fundamentally a good person and I assume she’d be there for me if the chips were down however she is incredibly difficult, to the point where I’d say she’s easily in the top 10 difficult people I’ve ever met

I recently turned 24 and have been stuck at home with my family for most of lockdown.

During this time I’ve been thinking about the past and my current relationship with her, and it makes me incredibly sad to admit but I’ve come to the conclusion that I just don’t like her.

when I was a teenager I felt the same but assumed it was mostly my fault an I would just grow out of it and our relationship would improve

My brothers friends always hated her and so did mine to be honest, although it would piss me off and I’d defend her I guess they were right

937,"
A little context: Jane (not real name obvi) is my best friend and we live together in a relatively small apartment. Jane has been an incredible friend for the most part in helping me deal with a toxic relationship that I’ve been on and off in for a number of years. The one exception being a fight we had a few months back where she asked me not to come to her with issues about this relationship anymore because she couldn’t deal with it. I was really hurt by this and it made me feel really dismissed. I already have issues with rejection/abandonment and usually when I feel I’m being abandoned I start acting cold and pushing people away. I resisted this temptation as best I could and we ended up talking it out. She’s said to me since then that she feels awful for saying that and she was just going through a difficult time being single and becoming over involved in friends relationships. 

Recently it has come to a stand still in that relationship and it seems as though for the first time in years I am going to be truly single. And I’m fucking scared. Just a few days ago, Jane met someone online. He came over and they hit it off immediately. I was so happy for her as she has been celibate and working on herself for about two years. I remember when I was the one in a relationship she would lament and I’d always say “you’re beautiful and you’ll find someone and there’s nothing to worry about” and remind her of all the things wrong in my relationship. We’ve been friends since high school and the dynamic has always been that I have a boyfriend and she’s the single one. I never really thought about it much before, probably because it didn’t make much of a difference to me. However the guy she met came over again last night and ended up sleeping over. 

This is the crux of my issue. I feel so jealous not just of her, but him for “taking away” my best friend. (No I am not in love with her) and it’s only been two days!! I feel so shitty and I know that it is not a normal response and not at all her fault. I know this is all my own emotional issues and fear of abandonment culminating in a break up with my long term guy. I know this all logically but I still keep thinking about her with such envy that it makes me feel disgusted with myself. I feel like such a shitty friend and person and like I should just be happy for her and not make this about myself. 

I guess what I’m wondering is how can I be a good friend to her and cope with my own feelings of jealousy and hopelessness? Should I share my feelings with her? I’m leaning towards no because I don’t want to ruin anything for her at all, ever and I really don’t want to come across as a narcissist asshole.  But I also worry/ can feel some resentment building up inside me and I don’t want that to get out of control. I think I might also feel some residual resentment from the fight I mentioned. Also she’s my BEST FRIEND and I tell her mostly everything so it just feels wrong not talking to her about this. I have contacted two therapists because I know this is not an overnight fix and I need long term help for the trauma behind my abandonment issues but I’m just looking for any coping mechanisms you might be able to recommend. Or even just knowing someone else is/has gone through something like this before and I’m not the evil monster that I feel I am right now.

Edit: I think I should also mention that I am a survivor of sexual assault and this has made sex a very sensitive subject for me. I felt completely safe and desired in my relationship which is why I pushed through all the toxicity and tried to make it work for so many years. I really leaned on him for emotional support and sexual stimulation. I fear meeting and sleeping with other men but I also feel the horrible need for reassurance/attention from them.",01Jul2020,1

She wrecked my car last year and ever since we've been having issues getting a decent running car and getting it legal. 

Well, instead of spending that money on a good running car and getting it road legal...we pretty much wasted that money on BS. Trips, fast food...stuff we wanted at the store but didn't need. And of course now I'm looking back and I'm so irritated with myself that I allowed us to do that instead of being responsible and getting a good vehicle legal. Pretty much thrown me into a good depression. 

We do have two vehicles right now but neither are legal and neither are in great shape. And I keep repeating these horrible financial decisions.

Okay first of all my apologies if there is another sub-reddit where this could be better. I don't use reddit a lot and I am not sure if I need advice or just general words of encouragement.

Also sorry for the formatting I am on mobile.

So here is this situation: This last school year of 2019-20 I was a highschool junior. Due to a not great home situation I decided that I would like to graduate early so I could move out around September when I turned 18. 
The thing is when Covid came around and everything went online I really struggled and left a lot of my work until about the last month. Even with this large work load I finally got my shit together and for each class I calculated what I would need to do to pass through talking to my teachers and some of my own math and just knowing what was weighted heavier in my classes. About a week or two out from the ending of school I was passing all of my classes except one which I needed the credits from. 
The thing about this class is that I had more work done for it and I had emailed my teacher multiple times. For my other classes it took about two emails to get a hold of them which I understand they can miss emails and are busy and what not but this one just wasn't responding. Some of my other teachers who I did email made me think I didn't have reason to worry as this other teacher was just probably busy at the moment and there was a lot of time to get those grades in. So I stopped worrying about. 
A bit of time passed and I was locked out of my school account because the school year ended and the district blocked my email to my counselor for some reason and I was just now able to call my principle about the matter and email him to see if I could get my diploma. In his email he said he didn't know if I passed all of my classes but that he'll check tomorrow...

944,"Recently I broke up with my abusive ex. She was emotionally, mentally, physically and sexually abusive. After I initially broke up with her and after her sending me 34 text messages and 26 calls among endless Snapchat calls and messages I decided to go and talk to her. Long story short I got back with her after talking for 2-3 hours. One of the main issues is she always uses things to suppress her past issues and she uses drugs and alcohol to do this. 

She told me she would change but she was so high off an edible it was like talking to a wall. I’m pretty sure nothing I said stuck but regardless I thought she could change. The next day she was talking about “how would you feel if I went on a date or slept with someone in the 3 days we broke up”....

I asked her wtf. She told me she went on a date and didn’t do anything with the guy but knowing her she probably slept with him. I find it fucked up she moved on that quick and proceeded to go out with someone after saying the same day she went out “I can’t lose you” and “I need you in my life” etc.

Later I called her and she was talking so much shit about me with her parents and family around. I never bad mouthed her but she apparently decided to shit talk me to everyone she knew in the short span of time. She also threw out all the stuff I ever got her and moved on that quick after saying she loved me, wanted me to move in with her, talked about marriage and kids etc. She thought none of the shit she did would bother me but it really did. It broke my heart to see someone who said all these things move on so quick.

I broke up with her again on the Friday because the night before she called me a hookup and was just all around the same person. I asked her to change multiple times and she didn’t listen because she thought I would always be around.

Now currently she is blocked on everything but is still calling me and emailing me on different numbers. A friend of mine messaged her without my consent and told me she cheated multiple times and to get tested. I had messaged a friend of hers that I was friends with asking if this was true and she never got back to me. I did this because my ex is so manipulative that that’s her way of trying to get me back in her life and I didn’t want to feed into it. This friend was told to block me because she is also being manipulated by my ex and I still had her number and insta so of course I messaged her.

Now my ex is threatening me saying to not text any of her friends. Calling my friends ugly, calling her friends “gorgeous fuck buddies”. Belittling my family etc. She then called me a stalker when she’s the one who keeps calling me, texting me and emailing me. She says I’m not over it but she keeps talking shit online about me and harassing me. I’m trying to move on but it’s hard when someone like this keeps harassing you. 

She then turned around and said she didn’t cheat and the fact I was asking if she did was “pathetic”...sorry that I want to know if she did or not because this was someone I cared about. 

I’m not sure what to do. I sent her one last message but she doesn’t seem to get it and apparently keeps talking shit. I have her blocked but it hurts to know she keeps doing this.....and harassing. She was also my first love and first relationship. All this shit was within a month and a half and that’s why I’m trying to move on but I can’t when she keeps harassing me, stalking me, and breaking my heart continuously.

I get jumpy and shakey, I'm constantly checking the doors to make sure they're locked, etc. I believe this is due to me getting comfortable with my whole family being home together most days, as well as a less than ideal experience I had babysitting a year ago (a carbon monoxide detector went off, it was a false alarm but I was so scared).

She passed out of nowhere and left us a ton of debt, I immediately had to move back home to take care of my dad and 18 year old brother...who was a pathological liar and a thief. I found out he had been stealing *thousands* from my grandma and father and they hadn’t said anything. My dad refused to let me file a police report. But due to his thievery, I had to pay for the entire funeral by myself which cost all my savings of just over 10k. Then at the end of the year, my brother stole all of my grandmas old jewelry and anything valuable and just left. 

Ever since then I’ve tried working to support us but my dad only gets $900 in disability every month and due to me having to take care of him, I can’t work much. I have had to cut back and quit every job every few months because there will be an emergency. My dad has fallen out of his chair and broken his nose, will fall over in his chair and throw up blood, anything can happen if I’m not there to watch him. It’s gotten to the point where I genuinely cannot work. My grandma left us her house but I can’t afford this. There are so many things to pay and I can’t work anywhere and make enough to cover this all. I have no family that can help and I don’t know what to do. 

On top of everything, despite me hardly ever leaving the house unless it’s to go to a food bank or church to get free food, I somehow managed to bring covid into our house and my dad caught it and almost died in front of me. I had to do cpr until paramedics showed up while having a panic attack.

Is this a situation that would call for a GFM account? Would people care to help with something like that?",01Jul2020,1

956,"So my sibling and I (20m and 21f) discovered my mom is cheating on my father recently and finally got hard evidence she is. Before it was all shit that could be seen differently. We contacted my grandmother (My mother’s mother) and we told her everything because she would know best what to do. Now my grandmother wants to know if my sibling and I don’t mind my mother knowing that we know she’s cheating. So basically my grandmother will tell my mother that my sibling and I know. Would this be a bad thing for our mother to know? Should we let my grandma tell my mom? Or not? What would be major cons? 

Just saying that no. We cannot tell my father. He already has a weak heart and telling him my mother is cheating may give him a heart attack which will end his life.

957,"Hello everybody, 

A month ago when university applications started, I sat down with myself for quite some time to figure out what I want to study. It was a hard decision but I decided I would go with Landscape Architecture. I did a lot of research, visited the school, and was really happy with my decision. I already have a spot as well because of my grades and I was getting really interested in going. 

But I also put my papers into Photography because I have always enjoyed taking pictures of others (and being sad that there is nobody taking pictures of me).  Just to test it out. 

After two days of very very hard exams for photography and an online chat, I got in. I felt overwhelmingly happy because only 12 people out of 78 were chosen. I felt like I achieved something and I was getting excited as well. 

But which one to choose? I'm almost on the verge of tears because I need to make a decision and I can't.

I'm scared of Photography because what if I study for 4 years and can't find a job? The world is growing so fast and everybody who buys a camera is suddenly a photographer.  I'm also a bit scared because even though I love the field, what if I feel out of love with it when it comes to my job? I have had some really good photos in my life but also thousands of shitty ones.  This is once in a lifetime spot in that school and I may never have that chance again. 

I'm scared of Landscape Architecture because there is a possibility it means abandoning my country just to work as the field is not very big in my country. There are thousands of plants to study and Latin and all that and even though I love studying, I'm not sure if I'm ready for that. I like to draw but am I up to the standard? 

I'm going honestly crazy. I'm afraid to make the wrong choice.  I have already missed two years of school because I spend one volunteering abroad and another one teaching at my old school. I want to study something I love but maybe you guys could give me some advice...",01Jul2020,1

959,"I'm a service coordinator. My job involves interviewing elderly and disabled clients to apply for home health services and other needs. Before the outbreak, I would have to go to their homes or to nursing homes to interview them in person. But that was put to a stop in March when the Covid-19 outbreak started getting bad. 

I have been working from home for almost 4 months. I still do interviews with clients on the phone and submit paper online. It's worked fine so far. But the insurance company that my job is contracted with has been itching to restart in-person visit ASAP. 

This week, my county is in the green, and at a meeting they told everyone to start scheduling visits. They gave us a very incoherent risk-reduction plan that boiled down to figure out as you go along. And I doubt they have enough masks and hand sanitizer for everyone. They told us to keep badgering clients if they refuse visits and to imply that they would lose their services if they refuse. 

They're making us go on 5 visits a week, sometimes multiple locations in one day. I've already had 3 of my clients die from the virus while on lock down. I'm afraid with a dozens service coordinators visiting hundreds of extremely high-risk clients every week, we could easily become super-spreaders.

We're not an essential service, despite what my boss says. I don't even help anyone. Since the lock-down started, my clients have been begging me for services. I would do the paperwork for them, and the insurance company would deny them every single time. They've even cut services. Essentially, if I do my visit, I would be exposing them to potential harm without any benefit to them.

I have expressed my concerns to my supervisor. Though she agrees with me, she's too afraid of losing her job to say anything about it.

It's a miserable job as it is, and with this new policy, I'm thinking of just quitting. What should I do?",01Jul2020,1
960,"When I was 19 I started hanging out with a co worker. We meshed really well and eventually I started hanging out with her and her friends all the time. We were pretty tite. At some point we had a conversation where we basically admitted to being really attracted to each other but we decided to stay friends. She was pretty much having sex with a couple of people in her friend group, including a couple of my other friends, so I decided to back off either way. Eventually we got into some drama and I moved to another state (for a few different unrelated reasons) and we didn’t talk at all for awhile. 

Then eventually we start chatting again, and fast forward to three years later I move back home, we decided to hang out and catch up. This was a couple weeks ago. We were having a really good time and we were really drunk and flirting with each other pretty heavy. Eventually she asks me to spend the night and she wants to cuddle, so we’re laying in her bed and I kiss her. She kisses me back a few times, we make out a slight but then both decide it almost feels weird so we go to bed. Next morning we wake up and talk and pretty much agree to stay friends. Totally cool. 

Like a week later a bunch of her friends start messaging me and calling me out for forcing myself on her and calling me a POS. Apparently I tried kissing her when she didn’t want to? And I made her really uncomfortable? This was clearly not what happened though so I’m really fucking pissed.

963,"TL;DR: I'm a pathetic person who lets other people tell me how I should live and I think my future will be full of regrets of all the things I haven't done.

I'm 23 years old but I still feel like my mom is in control over my life. I know it's pathetic but I can't seem to say no, and I give up too easily cause she'll keep pushing and start getting huffy if I resist. 

For example, she really wants me to get a nice, ""safe,"" job in an office. I did this before but I quickly lost the job due to my inability to sit still for 8 hours and do repetitive work every day, and I know for a FACT I don't want to do that ever again. Any time I bring up a job I find that sounds interesting, she'll find a problem with it and argue with me. Part-time is bad, apparently... but no heavy machinery, no outside work, no retail, you're too good for that job, you can't do that... etc. Hell, I'm even going into a degree that's going to basically limit me to office jobs but now it's too late to change my major and I think I'm screwing my life up.

Even with hobbies and stuff! I say I wanna try out something (say, skateboarding for example), and it's always her telling me I can't do that, or that I only wanna do it cause of ""video games"" or whatever. It's mostly her saying ""do you REALLY want to do that?"" in a disapproving tone and then listing all the bad things that could happen. I've wanted to try skating out since I was a teenager and now I feel too old to do it. I've wasted my whole childhood playing games, but I feel like I should have dabbled in anything that interested me at the time. I want to do SO many things like camping and road-tripping and working with animals and learning and all that stuff. Now I'm too old with a lot of responsibilities like school and work. I can't do this kind of stuff with friends either, because I don't have any.

When I do what she wants me to do, I feel like shit, but when I do what I want to do, I feel like a disappointment. She's not a bad mom, and it's not her fault I'm pathetic and tend to want other people to tell me what to do. I just don't want to die unhappy. I'm at the start of my 20s and I feel like I should be experimenting and enjoying life! It's so frustrating feeling so trapped here all of the time.

I want to be an adult but I'm so incredibly dependent I can't even find my way around town without Google. I hate that I have to consult with my mom before making any decision but at the same time I don't trust myself to make those decisions because I'm so inexperienced.

Does anyone else have or had this problem? How can I get past this and just start living? I don't really have anyone else to talk to for advice. This is such a frustrating place to be in and it's driving me crazy. Sorry for the wall of text but thank you if you actually read all that.",01Jul2020,1

I don’t even know if this is the correct place to share this but I randomly remembered this memory and I don’t know how to feel about it. I remember when I was either ten or eleven I was home alone and being a nosey little sister I went in my brother’s room and saw his iPod. I knew his password because he would literally always use the same one all the time. (I know i shouldn’t of invaded his privacy and go through his things but I did and can’t change that now) Anyways I unlocked the iPod and decided to look in his camera roll. I don’t remember if there were multiple pictures but i vividly remember one specific picture of me laying on my stomach on my bed and I would always wear my dad’s shirts to bed because they were really big and long enough to cover my parts. In the picture the shirt was pulled up exposing my bare butt. Horrified by this I quickly deleted them and put his iPod back where I found it. I never confronted him about it or told my parents or anything like that. I don’t know if he knew I saw them because they were deleted but he never confronted me either. At the time I was either ten or eleven and he was either thirteen or fourteen. Now I am eighteen and he is twenty two. He never tried touching me inappropriately or ever like try and pressure me into anything unwanted and he’s a good brother which is why it caught me off guard. I don’t know how to feel about this. I really wish i didn’t remember this and kept it forgotten. How would you take this situation? Do you think I’m overreacting?",01Jul2020,1
970,"When I (f17) was around 13/14 I was sitting in Spanish class when I remember a repressed memory about when I was maybe 10-12 (I don't remember the age it happen precisely) I was having a sleep over with my brother who is three years younger than me and I made him rub my private parts down there and said I would do the same but I don't remember if I did. And i also remember asking my friends who was a year younger to do the same on a different day but she said no.both times only happened once and nothing similar happened again.

Now I don't feel guilty about the second one with the girl because she laughed about it and bought it up a year later and I straight out denied it happened. But I hate my self so much for the first incident I believe that I traumatised my self by doing it which I wouldn't get help for because it's my fault it happened.i think about it every day and as a result think about ending my life because it causes me so much stress.

I also developed ocd symptoms because of this. As it started when I was 14 and wanted to try remember if I made him touch me like ""properly"" like fingering because I was panicking about it and in the process of doing it remembered he didn't but out of curiosity and things I seen in movies decided to do it properly and that's when I link masturbation to that event and that messed me up. because every time I did it I would wash my bedding or move my room to gain control over my ""bad"" habit. I have since stopped doing this and don't link it to the event.

I still do I have ocd symptoms that revolve around it like washing my hands when I leave my room because I still live with my brother and intrusive thoughts as well as a lot more. But I worry if he remember or if he is traumatised more by it or if he will tell everyone one day and everyone will see me for the monster that I am.but if he did and everyone new and hated me I wouldn't be mad because I deserve it and hope that it would help him mentally if he told people. I truly hate my self and feel powerless. I don't have a close relationship with my brother anymore not since I was 14 and I wonder if its because of that.

And I wouldn't do the stuff I did then to him now and would rather die.i would never do it to anyone now .I don't know what I was thinking at 10-12 and maybe its because I was exposed to adult topics at a young age as my mum was a huge fan of crime show such as criminal minds and law and order special victim unit which had alot of episode about messed up sexual scenario.i keep putting the brain I have now at 17 into my self when i was 10-12 and think how could you do that what did you think you were doing.i forget I thought totally different back then.but I just don't know if everyone views me as a discussing monster or if i will feel like this guilt will make me hate myself for ever or if its easier to end it all. I just thought maybe it would be a good idea maybe to post it here and see if I'm right to hate my self and I sorry this might be to much (also my first time using reddit and sorry for the bad grammar or any spelling mistakes I missed) I just don't know what to do anymore.",01Jul2020,1

972,"To preface, I have very little working knowledge of engines, so I don't know what's normal or what are different symptoms of various auto problems. Two days ago, I took my van to a new (to me) mechanic for a routine oil change and because the engine needed a new serpentine belt. I know this because I checked under the hood and saw that the belt was halfway off of its track. After they performed an inspection, the mechanic confirmed that the serpentine (alternator) belt was worn down, and actually cracking, and needed to be replaced. However, he also mentioned that there were a host of other problems that needed to be alleviated, including new spark plugs (per factory schedule), a fuel injection service, and a new battery (failed load test). As I'll need this vehicle for the foreseeable future, I decided to get all of it fixed in one fell swoop. Hours, and over $600, later, I took my van home as it seemed to be running smoothly. 

However, when I started my van the next day, the engine was squealing. So, I drove it around for a few minutes. I noticed that the squealing would get louder as I accelerated more. However, after a few minutes of driving, the squealing quieted down and was not audible. So, I took it back to the same mechanic and he inspected the vehicle again. This time, he told me that the harmonic balancer was loose/wobbly, and that they ""had not caught it"" during the previous day's inspection. I googled the symptoms of a loose harmonic balancer, at which point, I found out that a shaking engine was a symptom. In recent months, my engine had been shaking a bit more than it usually had (which was almost not at all). So, I thought, yeah it seems reasonable, and I should get this fixed before other problems arise because of it. Another several hours, and $400, later, I took my van home, running smoother than ever. 

However, I started my engine again today and the squealing, although not as loud as before, was happening again, same as before. It gets louder when accelerating, and it died down after a few minutes of driving. After some googling, I concluded that it might be that they tightened the alternator belt too hard when they first put it on, or that they didn't lube it enough. But, like I said, I know very little about cars and their engines. Some additional information that might be relevant is that it the previous owner of the van kept it in their garage when they weren't driving. For the past 1.5 years, since I've owned it, I do not have that luxury, so it is sitting out in Mother Nature. Also, it rained last night, if that makes a difference. So, my questions are: Am I being screwed over? Is it possible that the squealing is natural wear and tear that coincidentally started while I was getting the vehicle fixed? If not, what could be the issue? In your opinion, how should I proceed? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",01Jul2020,1

975,"Hi all, this is my first post on Reddit and i'm really hoping for a response that comes from a mature and understanding place.

I also want to emphasise that, while not perfect, my family have always cared for me to the best of their capabilities, and importantly have never projected their personal battles onto our relationship. They are truly good people.

I'm a 22[M] from the UK who has been struggling with alcohol for most of my life. Genetically my situation isn't great, my mum has always struggled with alcohol and only recently found her sobriety. A defining memory of my early life is finding her passed out at the family allotment (a rented garden) when I was 13, with a bottle of Bacardi beside her.

Similarly, my grandfather (on my dad's side) died when my dad was only 20, my grandmother blamed my dad for his death claiming that he should have helped more during the chemo. This made my dad severely depressed causing him to attempt suicide when he was 24 years old. While he would never admit it, he is still battling with what happened to this day.

At 7 years sober and a carer for the elderly/disabled, my mum is a hero of mine. Similarly my dad provides and cares for us regardless of his internal struggles. In recent years, it has instead become clear that I am the strain on our family dynamic. I have been going through cycles of hyperactivity followed by depression, each lasting months at a time. During the depressive stages I find myself sleeping around 16 hours a day and drinking excessively. additionally I find myself compelled to drink due to the numbing effect. I know it hurts my parents to see me repeating their mistakes, I'm determined to break this cycle and make them proud.

The reason I'm posting this is in the hope that someone from a similar background can give some practical advice on how I can make sure I don't make my parents mistakes, particularly in regard to alcohol. since 16 drinking was an issue, I have truly tried to break the habit however university was my downfall due to the heavy drinking culture there. Similarly I was a few months sober before lockdown but the boredom and lack of purpose has led me to fall back into old habits. I have recently noticed that almost all social gatherings with my friends revolve around drinking. Whilst they are absolutely not to blame for my own weakness, our meet-ups are definitely an excuse for me to further pursue my habit.

If anyone can help it would be deeply appreciated, I am open to AA meetings but I am pretty strictly atheist so alternatives are preferred.  My own health is irrelevant to me right now, but it honestly breaks my heart to see my mum hurting from watching me make the same mistakes that she did. Specifically tips regarding the following are appreciated:
- how to overcome a sudden urge to drink
- how to help friends understand your situation
- how to overcome the ""it's not a big deal"" reflex
- finding a non-religious support system",01Jul2020,1

977,"This might be long and vague and I apologize in advance. I’m using a throwaway account for obvious reasons. So here we go..

I let my brother and his son move in with me about 1.5 years ago. He is a single parent and was struggling to find a place he could afford, and pay daycare. So my we sat down and decided that since his current job didn’t pay that well (hardly over minimum wage) I would charge him a flat fee per month for everything. I said they could have the master bedroom with their own bathroom, since they would be sharing a room. I charge him $600 a month for Rent, Electric, water, sewage, garbage, cable, and daycare since I am a stay at home mom on disability from a major accident. 
The deal on food was SUPPOSE to be that everyone equally chipped in for food (we would obviously buy more as there is 3 of us and 2 of them) and everything in the kitchen was up for grabs unless specifically stated beforehand. But I’ve noticed the last 2 months, the only person bringing in the majority of the groceries has been me. Then a few months ago, he landed a job that pays WAY more than his old job. When I say WAY more, I mean WAY WAY WAY more. Now the whole reason I gave him a break on the rent amount is because of the job he had before, and he knew this. He has made no offer to readjust the rent amount, even know I am watching his son longer hours. When I try to bring it up, he says stuff like “well maybe I should just move out then” knowing full well that would put me in a bad spot right now due to some crap that happened a few weeks ago that is a whole different reddit story. I think it’s unfair that my brother is now just taking advantage of the cheap living arrangements and daycare, and knows exactly what to say to get me to back off. Cause if I call his bluff, and he does leave, I honestly don’t know what I would do. I am in no position (medically wise) to go back to work yet, and if it wasn’t for that incident, i’d be able to afford this place without him.

978,"hello reddit! i would like some advice!

so, i've been a fan of pewdiepie for a long time, probably since 2015 or so. I've been there for all the wall street journal/nazi drama, the n word drop, and a few other of his infamous controversies. since I've been a fan of his for a while, i feel like now he's grown and learned from his experiences and is truly a better man because of it. now i know i cant really speak for him, and i don't have a say in if other people forgive him or not for things he's said in the past, but I've come out on the side that Felix is a generally and genuinely a good person, and i enjoy watching his content.

I'm in a discord server with some online friends of mine, and one time a bit ago i brought up markiplier. a few people admitted they didn't like his content anymore, mainly because he was one of the people to come out and stand by Felix during some of his controversies. they went on to talk about how pewds is totally a nazi and how they despised him, so i decided to stay quiet out so i wouldn't stir up any arguments or debate. 

i don't see felix as a nazi or a horrible person, and like i mentioned, i feel like he's a good person who's genuinely learned from his experiences and has come out better because of it. i also don't judge my friends for having that opinion of him though, but it makes me feel like I'm a bad person for liking him if they really don't like him that much. i get worried if i ever talked about him or mentioned something by him that i like, id be seen as a horrible person, or a nazi supporter, which i DEFINITELY am not. fuck nazis, they can kiss my ass for all i care.

is this something i should even be worried about? am i just overthinking things? should i just not be open about liking pewds and keep it to myself?",01Jul2020,1

984,"Hello. I need some help. I am a teenager and of course I have hormonal mood swings or whatever and freak outs. I'm not mean or anything or take it out on my parents (well sometimes). Say I pick up lunch and its all the wrong food because I ordered it wrong or forget to order something for my fam, I get really embarrassed and because I am a perfectionist, I get really emotional and really irrational. I also get really irrational when I am hungry. But once I have food its all good.  It's really not that bad because I am the angel child out of all of my siblings. I am the most responsible, best grades, do my chores, etc. But when I have my moments (every once in a while) I am the worst out of all my siblings. 

But that's not why I am writing this.  I don't want to dive in deeper, y'all get it it. I am learning to not get all fired up, breath, cope, and brush it off. 

Today was the every once in a while. I feel really bad, because I had a freak out again today, JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T ORDER THE RIGHT FOOD. Looking back I know it's so ridiculous, people mess up! I need to get over it ahh. 

Anyways I did it in front of my mom and grandma. I ruined the whole vibe and energy of the afternoon.  My question is:

988,"\[Apologies for the long post, it's my first ever and need to get this off my chest\]

So... I've known her all my life. We've been close since we were infants, and although we live hours away, we communicate daily and sometimes play online together. Personally, I consider her one of my best friends. We are older now, and due to our age and covid, I don't know when we'll see each other in person again.

**I want to make this clear that it has nothing to do with her sexuality.** I couldn't care less who someone else chooses to love, as long as they're safe and happy. And I value her presence in my life too much that even *if* it did bother me, I would work on changing my biases for her.

I don't know if anyone else has experienced this, as it probably only applies to people who know LGBT people in their own lives.... but the best way I can describe it is that she's always been... different. She never felt uncomfortable ""not conforming to gender stereotypes"" (never wearing makeup or preferring basketball shorts over ""girl"" shorts). As we were growing up, we never talked about crushes or sex in any way other than objectively, so I know for a fact that she has not been in any serious relationships, hetero/homo or otherwise. There have been other instances like that, but I understand that stereotyping gay people to this ""non-conforming"" idea is often incorrect and possibly dangerous, so I wrote it all off as my bias or just her quirky personality- I didn't want to pigeonhole her into something she wasn't- straight girls don't *have* to like makeup, you know? She also lives with a deeply conservative family, who (if she *was* gay and her secret came out) would probably either go deep into denial or disown her. So... she might be hiding in the closet to protect herself- another reason why I don't want to ""out"" her accidentally if she *is* gay.

But I found her personal social media page the other day, (I'm not big on social media myself) and the things she's posting make me really question my perceived sense of her heterosexuality. She re-posts a lot of pro-LGBT stuff, and posts some things that imply that, if she isn't gay, she's at least open-minded. So... I'm back to believing she's gay. 

But the reason why I'm reaching out for advice is that over the past week, she's referenced ""my girlfriend""  or ""my gf"" multiple times. Now, she could be talking about a girl who she considers a friend (because she's done that before), or she could be talking about someone she's seeing romantically (probably in secret and online). 

I don't know if I should be upset about this or not, but I'll be honest, I cried a little bit.  I though that we were close enough that she would feel safe telling me if she started seeing someone romantically (especially she felt open enough about it to tweet about it). I spent YEARS (legitimately since we were early teens) giving her space and not assuming anything in order for her to not feel judged if or when she decided to come out. But here are my questions for you, Reddit:

1. **Is it okay that I'm feeling hurt about this?**
2. **Do you think that this is enough ""evidence"" to at least question her sexuality, or is this all in my head and I should back off? Or is this enough and YAH, SHE GAY?**
3. **Would it be okay if I confronted her about this? If so, how? If not, why?**
4. **Does this whole scenario mean that I've been putting more stock into our relationship than she has? (AKA she doesn't value me as much as I do her and thus didn't feel the need/safe enough to tell me).**

I just want to finish this by saying I really value this girl. It is in NO WAY romantic jealousy, perhaps just a sense of disappointment or betrayal. I'm just asking for advice because, given what is making me upset, I want to do the right thing by her because I'm pretty lost. Thank you.",01Jul2020,1

993,"the question is, what would you do with 240 acres, 180 of which is farmland? 

some backstory. my wife stands to inherit half of her parent’s farm in pacific northwest (east of mount hood and at elevation, so it’s not super rainy like some parts of the state). currently the farmland is leased out for rotating seed crops. her father was an attorney and as such he doesn’t really need to worry about monetizing their farm, the lease pays the bills and he doesn’t need income. 

we own a restaurant and an event space (separate businesses in separate locations) in a bigger city about 2 hours away. for the past few years we have been trying to come up with a way to make money on the farm, (ideally without displacing the current leasee, since we don’t know anything about farming and he’s been there a long time). this has been something we were considering for further down the road, but things are very tenuous for our businesses right now due to covid and we are considering moving the timeline up. 

the question for the hive mind is, do you have any ideas for something that might work as a business out there? some other notes of interest

-i have a few friends in the marijuana industry who have suggested growing hemp, but every farmer i know personally who has tried it in that area has failed. 

-the non-farmland has never been logged. i spent the first 2 months of quarantine working with a very experienced logger and clearing a portion of the land, so i’m comfortable running a chainsaw, excavator, tractor, and dump truck. i enjoy working outdoors and am a relatively quick learner. early 40s and in good shape (run a lot). 

-we have some money we could invest in a new business and father-in-law would likely invest as well, daughter #2 has no interest in the farm and he’s worried about having to sell when they get older. 

-we already have a house on the property, and we don’t own our house in the city, so we’d have a place to
live. 

-most animal husbandry is probably out, as my wife wouldn’t be on board with killing them. 

-there is a good deal of water on the property; 2 springs, a creek, a canal, and several ponds 

in a perfect world we would
keep our event space and schedule events when we could still
do them, go back and forth from the farm. my wife isn’t sold on the idea of full time country living.  

any ideas/feedback appreciated,
i’ve been racking my brain and haven’t had that lightbulb moment just yet.",01Jul2020,1
994,"So, about 2.5 years ago my grandpa passed away due to cancer. We had 6 months together with him, before he got a cold. We all said our goodbyes and the next morning, when he was alone for 5 minutes, his body gave up the fight. He was my rock. 

I've had my fair share of sad days, but have noticed them coming back more frequently  especially since I recently visited my grandma to watch pictures from back in the days. I got one of their wedding pictures and put it on a nice spot in my room. 

Right after we heard about his cancer, I made him write down a sentence that reminded him of me. He could pick whatever he wanted and he choose 'You are my star.' and I got it tattooed in his handwriting. So whenever I got sad, I had something on my body that reminded me of him forever. I also wrote him a letter and put it in his casket, before the burial. 

Now, I thought I had done the things that would make me feel at ease with his passing, but it's all been coming back to me really hard. I just miss him massively.

The thing is, I never respond anymore. We don't have anything in common, he seems to fixate on me. He's made, over the years, vague mentions of feelings for me. He respected my ""no"". 

Hes never done anything bad. Our mutual friends have seen the same behavior. He fixates, obsesses, and doesnt understand why people pull away. Hes GENUINELY KIND. So kind he's so easily exploited. We have had several conversations with him about it, but he doesnt seem to understand entirely.

I just dread his messages. He's muted everywhere but keeps sending me sweet messages about how much he cares about me. Hes done NOTHING to hurt me. Hes done nothing to put me at risk in any way, shape, or form. And yet after 2 years of vague, one word replies to him, he keeps talking like we're best friends and I'm just not sure what to do.

He is a kind soul, truly. But I don't understand why he makes me want to pull away so hard. I feel smothered. He knows this and doesnt seem to grasp why I don't want to talk to him.

Anyways, he liked it, so he bought some more and even offered me some.

Ever since that bad trip I just didn’t want to do anything with drugs.

I don’t know how to approach this. I do not want to give him ultimatums or anything like that, I just need some insight from people who are more open minded than me when it comes to drugs or have more experience with them.

So I'm kind of at a point where I'm trying to decide what to do career-wise. The past few years I've been volunteering in deprived neighbourhoods (I live in the UK) with young people and in schools, and also private tutoring in the richer side of town. I have a teaching qualification (PGCE) and a first class undergrad degree, and did pretty well in my final dissertation. I'm definitely better at academic stuff than practical stuff and I enjoy it.

The uni in my town currently has PhD programs specialising in inequality in education, and I'd love to do one looking at the impact of a disadvantaged background on young people's education and attainment. I've been offered a place on a masters degree focusing on social research which would lead well into one of the programmes. I think I'd have a good shot of getting on one, and I think I'd be good at it (and enjoy it!) 

The thing is I'm also cautious of going into something like that without really knowing where it would lead after and without having a clear idea. So basically, is it worth it? What kinds of things would I be able to do after? Neither of my parents went to uni so I don't really know where to turn!

We were classmates/neighbours and classic 'frenemies' ie we'd have giant teenage girl dramas and really knew how to get each other's goat. We haven't seen or spoken each other in 15+ years and only occasionally 'like' each other's statuses now.
So she's really into hitting that fb share button and usually shares memes and local news and other nonsense 10+ times a day. But twice lately she's shared other people's statuses suggesting that racism isn't a current issue because slavery isn't a current issue. One essentially said ""being white doesn't make you a racist and being black doesn't make you a slave. Idiots however come in both colours"". The other said that no white person alive today ever owned slaves and that no black person alive today ever was one (I forget the rest but the sentiment was essentially that ''they' should get over it?). 
She and I are both from very middle class white backgrounds (albeit with unhappy childhood home lives). From what I've gathered she's now very much a 'quit-whining-n-pull-up-yer-bootstraps' type person. And I'd be surprised if she actually consciously hated people from BAME backgrounds. I think she's just a girl who never left her small &amp; very white hometown and hasn't made any effort to educate herself on this matter.
Given our frenemy history and the fact that we're now practically strangers I'm pretty sure trying to open a dialogue to discuss her comment wouldn't have a great outcome.

1014,"Despite being told by multiple people I'm not, I still cannot figure out if I am evil for what I did or not.

When I was 16, I began dating someone a few months shy of 3 years younger than me. We never met in person, our entire 'relationship' was online. They asked me out, and we had a friend group between 13 and 20 years of age who knew and approved of our relationship. Our relationship was public on social media. We also never did or spoke about anything nsfw or inappropriate.  Honestly, I never felt that way about them, although I didn't realize those feelings at the time. 

We officially ""broke up"" right after I turned 18, although by that point we were both barely talking to each other and were pursuing outside relationships.

I can't seem to figure out if that makes me a predator. In retrospect, the age gap feels too large for me. I can't think of anything bad I did to the person, other then sometimes being a selfish, kind of mean,  teenager. I feel guilt that I didn't treat the relationship as seriously as the other person and didn't end it sooner when I knew it wasn't working. Or why I didn't just say no when I was first asked out, other then I was desperate to feel loved and important to someone.

Now that some time has passed, I am looking back at my past self and feel a lot of guilt over the person I was. I'm not sure the right way to combat this, or to figure out if I am genuinely as evil as I think I am for the age gap. What should I do? Am I evil?",01Jul2020,1

He swears that I can trust him and that he makes his money honestly and he wants to help college students with their loans, and I’m “too pretty and young to hurt.” So I lied and said I didn’t have $200, and he offered to pay $150 of it if I pay for a $50 steam card to get the full $200.

I figured, what’s the worst that can happen? I lose $50. So what. And if it is legit, I get $5000.

I'm a Chilean dude that's studying something like cs but longer(6 years).

I'm doing decently in my college and I don't really like that much the career. I have a scolarship that pays everything and I'm studying it mostly because I'ts a convinient career in my country.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I got into writing and drawing. I feel like I'm studying completly different stuff to the things I'm interested.

In the previous month I opened a blog and I'm enjoying witing a lot. I've also got paid for witing in other blogs and magazines.

My father always talks me about college and I hate it because I don't really care about what I'm studying.

I want to try to have a side hustle aside my career and then trying to make that my actual job.

Any advice on how to feel less guilty?",01Jul2020,1
1020,"My first post here ;) 

My mum became depressed after she developed a chronic illness (chron’s disease) 13 years ago (when I was 15), she had an operation and with the help of medication she soon felt better, but her whole outlook to life changed for the worst after that.

She has always been a bit more sensitive than others (she used to tell me about thing that would upset her, and I would sit down and let her cry by my side) and my grandma has had a depression for more than 20 years too (she actually doesn’t even leave the house and is always slightly angry, although to me she remains cute). 

Also, my mum was manipulated by my dad when I was little, he would be physical with us both when he was angry until I was old enough to stand up to him and with time he actually stopped (well, sometimes he still goes insane, but perhaps just once a year or so, so I know he is working on it) which makes me think she could have spoken to him just like I did but she didn’t. 

After my mum was diagnosed, she lost her job as it was a very physical job (warehouse) and that made her especially depressed. 

She didn’t want to do anything, she didn’t want to look for another job, or even go volunteering, do activities,... she just lost all her drive for life. 

I spent years trying to convince to do things, and I kept feeling bad for perhaps pushing too hard as all she would do is to tell me I was right, that she would do it but then would do nothing.

After much work, she agreed to let me help her update her cv and we together went around town looking for jobs. She found a seasonal job, we were all very excited, she took it and she was doing well but as soon as the contract ended they didn’t ask her to continue working there.

After that, for probably 10 years, I have been unable to convince her to look for a job again. If my dad tries to talk to her about it, she gets angry at him, so basically I feel more responsible as an only child and as my mum loves me like mums do, I feel if she will listen to someone it would be me. 

I tried to get her to volunteer, she applied for a place where I used to volunteer (after much work, as she is very picky as to what type of volunteering) but she gave up after meeting the manager and never actually tried it even for one day. 

I tried to get her to join a club, an activity, to start a hobby,... I asked her to hand me a list of possible likes so I can figure out what she could do (for example, she likes walking her dog, so I said perhaps she could babysit or walk other dogs or even just join a dog walking club but she won’t do it). 

We always have the same conversation (once a month? or sometimes I leave for a few months, then come back in half a year to mention it, I live abroad). She always just says I am right, that she will do it, but does nothing.

It is not just about her happiness but my dad’s too and their lives and future (as they actually do need more money, I know they want to move house and many other things that would make them so much happier). 

I am actually so tired of this situation, I am finally feeling I had enough. 

With the coronavirus, she is feeling depressed because she has to wear a mask, but actually her depression was already there, so it has nothing to do with the virus, only with herself. I am scared she is hidding behind an excuse again. 

It has gotten worse too, she now is taking medication (she hadn’t been for a while, don’t know the medication name, I am from Spain, so probably nobody will know anyway lol) and I am worried she is hoping the medication will do all the work. 

She doesn’t realise she has to fight for her life, that she has to learn to live it. 

I don’t know how to help her anymore, I feel I have tried it all, perhaps too much, perhaps not enough, who knows. I feel we have spoken about it enough and she knows it, so it is time to take action, but she won’t. 

Also, my aunt, her youngest sister, (also, who I consider my sister as I have always been extremely close to her) almost died three years ago after taking some drugs (mainly because she had divorced but also because she liked to party too), she was in a coma for a while and now is in a wheelchair and unable to do things on her own, so of course that did not help. She is a different person now, her brain has changed, so I struggle with it too. 

Until now I could put up with it because I actually believed it would get better but now I am scared that it has been 13 years and the longer the more difficult it will become (my mum is 56 now). 

As to my parents relationship, they are actually very happy with each other now, my dad is almost (364 days a year) a new and calm man (by calm I even that if he gets angry he does it like most people instead of trying to hit us) and they tell me how well they are, how much less they are fighting so I know they do tell me the truth so I don’t think that is part of the problem.

How can I help her?

Thank you so much!",01Jul2020,1

1023,"Hi guys,

I got in a debate with a friend, and needed another opinion on this. It's going to be a rant, but I really want to hear what y'all have to say about it.

A friend of mind has secured a pretty well paying corporate job, in which he was going to start in June.  He was working another job and got laid off due to the virus. I understand this warrants unemployment, but my argument is that it's not justified.

Here's why - The dude lives with his parents (No problem with that, I do too at the moment), meaning his overhead is literally nothing. I know the family, and they've very well off. His start date is TBD, but it's been TBD for literally 3 months already. Instead of trying to go find a temp job to make money, he decided to file for unemployment, and has been collecting the 600 base (CARES Act), plus whatever on-top for unemployment. 

Again, I have no problem with people filing for unemployment - I just genuinely think it should be for those who need it &amp; have bills due/families to feed (The dude has like 6k student debt, but i'm pretty sure he just spends the money on guns and other misc. things for fun), Not for a recent college graduate with a fat job lined up, who just wants to game all day and get free money.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I missing something?  I understand we pay into it as working class, and so did the guy who's currently collecting it - I just still can't find this justifiable in my book. Maybe I'm missing something?

1025," Hi, I'm an 18 year old student still living at my parents home with my sister. Over the last view years getting along with my mother is getting harder and harder. She has been deciding things for me and my whole family that are quite odd. Also threatening me that I might never leave this house anytime soon. She also says if I want to do things my way, that I should get my own place. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far she has given me very weird life lessons that make no sense and has barely allowed me to make my own life decisions. She is demanding 1 third of my money that I make at my job for an account that is not explained to me. So far she leaves me guessing what the intent are for the rules that she makes. Most of the time it is ""Because I said so!"". 

&amp;#x200B;

She wants to know all the time where I am at, and if I don't answer she is directly in panic (I understand that she is worried about me, but she doesn’t do the same thing with my younger sister). Our house is a mess and most of the things that are laying around are hers. I only got my room upstairs and a small drawer, my shoes and jackets downstairs.

Saying that it is ""Practice for later"", even tho I might seldom cook for 4 to 8 people weekly or do a whole house cleaning and laundry for 4 people. She is stubborn and a big hypocrite herself. What can I do to cope with this or change things for the better for me and my sister.

1026,"Hey everyone. 

So I've recently just finished my first year in medical school while in a somewhat long-distance relationship with my girlfriend. We are about 3 hours away from one another by coach (bus) and have been together for a year now.

My girlfriend is wonderful. She's kind, loving, funny, and has a big heart. She's amazing. I'm writing this post asking for your advice because, despite all of this, I don't feel like I can manage balancing her and medical school. I'm an international student and my parents are paying a lot of money for my education. Unfortunately, my course has been very difficult over the first year. I was not able to find the time to revise over the weekends because we would frequently visit each other. Even if we weren't visiting each other, we would video call on our laptops every night. I've tried to address not having time to study by doing these voice-calls while studying. Unfortunately, I'm not the kind of person that can study with someone else (even if that's over a video call). We've even tried to study while visiting each other but this isn't as effective and is very difficult to do. 

Because of all of this, I've lost confidence in my academic life. I've been stressing about medschool quite a bit and have doubts about whether I'll even make it past 2nd year. I don't think I can give her the attention she deserves. Yet, despite all of this I've tried to hold onto the relationship. I know what I need to do but I'm afraid. I'm afraid because I feel like I will hurt her. I'm afraid because I don't want her to POTENTIALLY lose a friend group (""the guys""). I'm afraid because it would probably end up with us never speaking to each other again. And I'm afraid because I love her and I don't want to lose her. She means so much to me, and even though I've met her family,  I know I need to end things.

I hope you can offer me some wisdom or advice. Perhaps something that may give me courage to do what I need to do. I've never broken up with a girl before - she's the first girlfriend I've ever had. 

tl;dr I'd advise you to read the whole post for context but...I care for my girlfriend deeply, however, I can't manage both her and medschool. I'm afraid of losing and hurting her. I know I should end things with her but I don't have the courage or strength to break things off. I would appreciate your advice/wisdom.",01Jul2020,1

I have always been considered quiet and shy but years ago I committed to getting my dream career as a British Army Officer and after a lot of hard work I got through the selection process into the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

Unfortunately, as soon as I achieved it I discovered I had been walking around with a serious injury that needed two major surgeries to fix and years of post surgery physio/rehab etc needless to say the Army didn’t want me anymore.

Slowly my new found confidence fell away until it got to the point where I was diagnosed with PTSD, having panic attacks etc. But I tried hiding my symptoms from my family which lead to me incurring massive debts as I would try and avoid certain situations or convince myself that I would feel better if I bought x,y or z.

1034,"As title states, my fiancé won a considerable amount of money right before our wedding. Enough that he wants to buy a big house, pay off both our cars (and maybe sell one), buy a luxury vehicle, and all new furniture, and still have a lot of money left, which he’s made very clear will be going to his bank account and only his bank account. 

Yes I’m super grateful that he’s going to pay off my car. However, he says when he does he expects me to contribute more to other bills so this isn’t really saving me much money. Maybe like $300 a month. 

My fiancé also already makes triple what I do and gets huge bonuses. He also had me sign a prenup months ago, so I won’t be getting access to any of his finances ever. Basically if we divorce we each get what we put in back, nothing more,nothing less. He’s an attorney and his friends who witnessed it are all attorneys too, so it’s probably air tight.

So I (22M) have a friend (21M) who I’ve known for my entire 3 years at university who is suffering from severe depression. I consider him to be one of my best friends and I think I am one of his close friends as well. Now I’ve known for a while that he has family related issues (His father was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s 3 years ago which made him quit his job) and other stuff. Ever since the quarantine has started we haven’t been able to see each other at university and he’s not the best at text messaging with anyone so our contact has decreased these past 4 months. 

Just a few days ago I sensed he was feeling a bit more down than usual so I sent him a text saying that I know times are difficult for him at the moment but I’m always just one text/call away if he wants someone to listen/vent to. He replied back saying he’s stopped talking about this stuff with his friends for a few years now. I left it at that.

Now tonight he has made an anonymous post at our universities Help group on Facebook detailing all the problems in his life and how he was coping through everything by setting a few future job related goals for him which have not probably failed. He stated that he just feels empty now and ready to die but won’t commit suicide due to religious reasons however he has begun some self-harm. He’s been talking to the school psychologist (since it’s free, can’t afford much) but it hasn’t particularly helped. He also said the friends he had a deep connection with are no longer friends/have died and he doesn’t feel that emotional connection with any other friend. He ended this with saying that if any of his friends figures out that the anonymous person is him not to contact because he won’t respond. 

I have no idea what to do now… I really want to send him a long message telling him how much he means to me and him talking to me won’t be a burden or something like that but I don’t know if that’s the correct response to go about things. I’m really sorry for rambling on here.

My dad said I can go alone which I’m fine with but my mom said she’s going with me. I’ve already told her I would like to go alone but she said she wants to meet the person and go. I feel it would be better if I was alone because I could open up more to the therapist about what I’m going through. It’s really frustrating because this is supposed to help me but now I’m not going to be able to open up because my parent is going to be next to me (which I didn’t open up to in the first place which is why we’re her). Idk what to do.,01Jul2020,1
1048,"I'm a \[21F\] college student living back home for the summer. I go back to work in 5 days, after not being able to work for the past 2 months. I work on campus and want to work as much as I can now, during the summer when the campus is least busy. I wash my hands, wipe down anything I bring into the house, wear my mask, etc. ***I have NOT tested positive for COVID*****.** The problem is that since I'm living at home, my mom is concerned about COVID and wants me to quarantine in my room for the rest of the summer \[6 weeks\]. We are all asthmatic, so I get the concern. Before I accepted my work schedule, my mom sent me a series of texts saying:

""You will have to quarantine while you are at home. That means you can ONLY go from your room to the bathroom. When I cook Ill bring your food to your door. You can talk to us on Facetime.""

""Just remember you will NOT be allowed around us at all. You will not be allowed anywhere downstairs or even in the kitchen. You will drink bottled water. NO to the fridge because I don't trust the electrical box.""

""Understand you will NOT be allowed downstairs. I am going to set the motion detector and camera up so ill know if you do. If you need to wash you will have to put your face mask and gloves and go to the laundry mat. You will have to clean the bathroom every day too. The cases are rising and I really wished you'd just wait this out."" 

I feel she's being excessive with her concerns, and because I have nowhere else to go I have to 'obey' her wishes. My mom works M-F from 8 am- 5pm and I will be working MWF at 12pm-5:30 pm. How is she supposed to make my meals on the days I am home if she's working herself?? I can't even wash my clothes at home. I'm writing this in tears because I don't know what to do. I don't have anywhere else to go. In the 6 weeks ill be working it'll only have made about $800. I've explained my situation to a couple of friends and they've suggested I make a gofund me account. I truly just don't know what I should do.",01Jul2020,1
1049,"My girlfriend and I had a little discussion before i dropped her off at work. She talked about when i pulled into her house, her mom had said to her that I pulled in too fast. She told me she wants me to try and go slower and I told her immediately that I understand and that I would try to next time but she told me no that she wants me to make sure i listen because there are times where i would hear but not listen. I don’t do it on purpose most times it’s instinctively but i felt bad about doing it. She also added that if I got into a accident my insurance would go up and she said that her brother’s insurance would go up to. I asked why would his go up and she told because i could hit him. I understand where she was going with this and that she just wanted to solidify her point but at the moment i had gotten a bit defensive and said i wouldn’t hit her brother’s car. She got upset that i did it again (listening but not understanding) and i apologized and told i wasn’t trying to be defensive. She doesn’t want me feel bad about doing it because it’s only happened a couple time but it’s hard not to. When people bring up flaws in me i first get defensive but then i begin to overthink that one flaw. She asked me if there was anything she can do or i can do when she does need to bring up something that upsets her about me that could make the situation better and so i would listen. I feel like it’s a shitty situation in general and that it’s hard for us to discuss flaws about us without feeling bad that we do those things. Is there anything that i can try doing? any advice is appreciated. Thank you!",01Jul2020,1
1050,"Dear Redditors I (24f) live in the Netherlands and have a really bad eyesight. It is fixable with glasses but it still causes some problems. For example headaches and problems with my work (IT/design). Now I have been to an eye laser clinic and my eyesight can be fixed to a perfect eyesight. This clinic only uses one technique, that is LASEK. According to the internet, it is the method with the least complications later on because there is no cutting involved. It only is uncomfortable during and after the procedure. This sounds to good to be true. 

Now is my question are you or do you know someone who had this method during eye surgery. Because I really like to know, what the long-term effects are and why they chose for this technique.

1051,"So, 23M. I met 23F in high school, became real close randomly 4 years ago, freshman year of college. Stayed that way for 4 years. We live in different states, so we’ve only seen each other 3 times in the 4 years, but we catch up a lot through text and the occasional phone call. 

There was always some sort of, pseudo romantic thing going on between us, I think. There’s an intimacy with her that I have, that I haven’t had with any other girl. We did make out 2 years ago, last time we saw each other, but she quickly insisted we stay friends, which I’m fine with. And then, this December, we started being more open about that lovey dovey part of our friendship. However, that came to bite me back in March, when she thought I was getting too clingey. After an argument over that, we stopped talking for a month and a half. I finally texted her after that, and after a 10 hour convo through text, I thought that was that.

We went right back to lovey dovey “but we’re just friends”, which I’m fine with! Then, Saturday, she said she thinks she’s starting to like another guy. Which, I actually was hugely supportive of! Her last relationship was this brutal, on and off love affair, that ended horribly, so I though this would be her way of getting over that. She was down at first, then, hours later, insisted “I can’t do it”, and got really mad when I told her she could, and stopped responding. She messaged me later that night about something totally different, and everything felt fine. 

Monday was her birthday. Texted her all lovey dovey, she responded the same. An hour later, I told her that a video of her that her friend posted on Instagram was really cute. After telling me she was embarrassed of the video, and I telling her she shouldn’t be, she goes “whats your problem? Why are you texting me about a video of me? Like….?” Then, no response to my apology about that. I texted her again yesterday, nothing.

So its just, what the hell do I do? I feel like this is some sort of dejavu. I know she’s modeling the toxic relationship she had with her last boyfriend, as well as her eternally atrocious relationship with her domineering and controlling parents, where, “I love you” is often followed by toxicity and coldness and hurt. But its just, I don’t know if I can keep doing this. The good thing is, this has only been present in our friendship since March. We had 4 awesome years before that. But, if this is some sort of new norm, its just, I don’t know if I want to be a part of that. 

So, as the title says, should I just, stop caring? I don’t know when she’ll work up the nerve to text me again (and I’m literally typing this so I don’t triple text her). If she does, I do want to confront her on this, because I do think this is unfair treatment. And beyond that, idk. I want her in my life, and I hope I’m overreacting about this, but idk if its wise for me to be friends with someone who continues to lash out at random at me.",01Jul2020,1

1053,"Firts off, it's going to really seem like it, but this is NOT a troll post. So, ever since I was a boy, I've had a fetish with womens legs. I would always but my boxers on, and pull them, up so they resembled womens shorts, and it would just really turn me on. It's gotten a but worse now that I'm older, and able to spend the cash on actual womens clothing. One day when I was at work, I saw this attractive girl walking down the street with these skinny little shorts, and I felt so aroused, that I stopped at wallmart, and bought myself a pair of womens running shorts, along with some perfume, so that it looked like a gift. The fact that I finally got my hands on a pair if womens shorts almost sent me into an orgasm. I know that sounds silly, but yeah. I got home, and wore them around the house, and felt so sexy (even though I probably didnt look it). Lately I've been exercising, and really taking care of my legs. Shaving and etc... they are nearly indistinguishable from a pair if womens legs. I bought a pair of red 3 1/2 inch stilettos, and a pair of really short denim shorts. I have a slight obsession with a character named poison front he street fighter series. Well, I out the heels, and shorts on, and take videos of myself. I'm going to sound a but self absorbed here, but I never thought I would look so sexy in womens clothing. I keep fantasizing about dressing up as poison for a comic con or something, just to fulfill my sexual fantasy, but I know people would just be so weirded out. I just wish I was a women so bad, so I didnt need to feel wierd about that stuff. So yeah, I really doubt this is a normal thought process amongst men. Sometimes when I meet people, it think.

Which is fine, I don't mind having male friends. But they usually are looking for a relationship, and I just want a friend. On rare occasions where I get women messaging me, the conversation usually never goes anywhere. I don't know if it's me, or if it's just hard to make friends of the same gender online.

1055,"     I'm not the best at titling these things--but let me start with some backstory. I (20F) moved to Idaho in 2012. I was 12 years old and had no friends. I met my best friend (20F) at the time and we were inseparable. I noticed pretty quickly that she would copy almost anything I did--her interests would change to fit mine. At first I loved this! But it started to get worse over time. 

     I would get a new friend and suddenly she had to be best friends with them too--I would follow someone on Instagram from my high school (we went to different high schools) and she was already following them, or would soon be following them. I would get a new pair of shoes, and she would get the exact same pair. I got a camera? You guessed it. She got the same exact camera. The examples of her copying my relationships, friends, and actions are endless. As I've gotten older it has become intolerable for me to see her. I believe our relationship over the last 6 or 7 years has slowly become more distant, with us going to different high schools, and different college programs. 

     I try to keep contact with her to a minimum. Only texting her after she has texted me, and trying to avoid making plans. Everytime we hang out I find myself very drained and annoyed afterwards. Am I an asshole/impatient? Do I confront her? Should I look inward and figure out why she bothers me so much? Am I being possessive?  Thank you for reading this far. Any advice is greatly appreciated. If I need to be a better friend I am very willing to work on myself.",01Jul2020,1

I need your help. One of my friends biggest goal in life is to get a girlfriend. He is 19 years old and sometimes had had relationships as a kid, but since he turned into a teenager his love life got quite puny. He's trying for serveal years now to get into a relationship with a girl, but he ain't very successful. (It's not like he looks ugly or is bad at conversations) His suffering is discernible and I just want to be a good friend, who is able to help him through his misery, and him to be happy.

For approximately one month now he's trying to get into dating apps. Hasn't had very much success yet, but I'm still hoping, that there's a nice gal who is interested in him. The desperation has eaten deep into his consciousness and I can see him slowly turning into some kinda ealry stage of an incel. As I previously said, I don't want him to hate everything like he's about to do.

Unfortunately, I have no idea how to help him. So I need some adive how I can help him to get a girlfriend. (Telling him, that he is only 19 years old and that there will be enough women in his future just helps temporarily. He seems very serious, when he talks about this problem.)

1066,"# Sorry if this post seems like a rant at some points, I just have way too much I could say about her and this feels like a summarized version of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I (18M) have been dealing with bullshit from my mother for basically my whole life. I've always been pushed aside by her and she's always trying to guilt trip me. She'd never even offer to help me with anything or show me how to do anything and would scold me for doing something incorrectly even if it's my first time doing it (It was never that I needed help with stuff like school or fixing my issues but it hurt to constantly be told ""you're okay but your brother is so much better than you"" yet he would receive help even when he didn't need it while you're being treated like a toy, used when she feels like it and then tossed into the back of a closet when she's done). She always punished me for literally not doing anything, my brother watched a lot of sports late at night cause we lived in the middle east for most of my life (moved to canada for university) and I'd always get my shit taken away from me because ""WE were watching sports in the middle of the night"" when I didn't even watching my own teams matches at 11:45 pm let alone some american football at 4 in the fucking morning. She's always saying shit like ""I left my entire life to take care of you and your brother and you treat me like this"" even though all we would have done is use our laptops or play on the PS4 when we've finished everything we have to and she claims that my father stops her from getting a job even though she had a job for a few years when they were married (between 4th and 6th grade for me) and they're now divorced so it doesn't sound right to me but that, like many of her other reasons, switches based on situation so it's sometimes ""your dad wouldn't let me get a job because he was always off furthering his career while I was meant to sit at home"" and ""I left my job to take care of you and your brother"" when I would have accepted it if we were in pre-school or like up to 3rd grade but she left when I was transitioning into 7th grade and my brother into 9th grade so we were both old enough to not need constant parental supervision. She's constantly starting arguments with my father and then proceeds to say things like ""this is what I protected you from your whole childhood"" even though she'd start the fight and all he'd do is argue his points or try to escape the fight because it's ridiculous and she's been dragging me into the arguments since I was like 12 but god fucking forbid my brother even hears about the arguments (she always did this when my brother wasn't at home but gives no shits if I see and hear it).  I think my social anxiety may have been caused by her because I've always been made to feel like I'm not good enough and I should be better even when I did things like coming top of my class. She's always complaining to me about shit I don't think I should be hearing about like this guy she likes blocking her on instagram and she asks me for advice like I'm some love guru when I've never even had a girlfriend cause my social anxiety causes me to freeze up around anyone and that doubles when I'm speaking to a girl I like. The worst thing she's done in my opinion was supporting me in front of everyone and then trying to get me to back down at home. Example: At school, I was always ahead of my grade in maths and science and in 9th grade my teacher convinced me of doing what my brother did before me and that was taking the maths GCSE in 9th grade because he thought I could do it. We told my mother that I was going to do it and every single day up until a month before the exam, she'd tell me that I can still back out and that my brother who is smarter than me did it and couldn't get an A\* so I probably can't do any it but when my other teachers doubted me in front of her, she'd get defensive and say shit like ""I'm working with him at home and his maths teacher is helping him at school, he'll get an A\* (A+ in america)"" when the most effort she was putting in was telling me I couldn't do it (in case anyones interested, I got the grade I wanted but it wasn't exactly a victory because it turned into my mother trying show me off like I'm some fucking trophy she worked so hard to get).

Quick point: The situation is as weird as it sounds cause my mother does live under my fathers roof even though they've been divorced for 5 years and where we're from, there is no obligation to give the other person anything after the divorce.

1069,"When I was 12 my parents had a party in Mexico and I lost my virginity to a woman there that was 27 years old. She was a bartender at one of my parent's parties and she saw me there just sitting down being bored she approached me and put her hand on my groin outside my pants and asked me if I wanted to have some fun I wasn't sure what she meant so I went with her she took me to her van she gave me some powder which I later found out was cocaine and alcohol to get me drunk. I had some cocaine and drank the alcohol that she provided me. She then began taking off her clothes and asked me if I liked what I was seeing I said ""yeah it looks"" pretty good. She then took my hand and put it next to her breasts and told me her nipples were really sensitive and asked me to rub them. I was a little scared of this but I did it anyway. She then proceeded to take off my pants and pulled out my penis and began touching it. I couldn't hold my myself and came after she touched me. After that she said something along of the lines of ""we're not done yet"" and she grabbed my penis and put it into her vagina I came again inside her vagina after a few thrusts inside her this time and she literally threw me outside and left me there. My sister found me and I told her what happened but she told me never to tell anyone. Now my question is if this actually legal or if I can indeed do anything to about this.

1070,"To set the scenario. I live in a duplex on the lower level with a shared area. The shared area being the door next to the first garage, which is mine. The second garage belongs to the neighbors upstairs, but if accessed from inside. Just like our shared basement, requires passage through my part of the garage.  

I've lived here for a little bit over a year now and had no real issues with my neighbors that we couldn't talk about. They were moving and I wished them the best. Everything seemed chill.

But then his Mom showed up to clean his place for him. I met her by her coming to my door, knocking on it and accusing me of breaking into her sons apartment, saying she's going to report me to the department of justice, saying she is going to take over her son's (M26?) lease to make our lives a living hell. (I have my Mom here now, (69) and gf (49) here too). And also said something about booby traps.

I can't recall it too well because I wasn't expecting it. At first I thought she was introducing herself and trying to say she's not going to be a bother. I asked her if she's accusing me of something, and she said yeah. I know all about ""you people"". Which is confusing. I'm Native, but her family's mixed too if that's her kid so not sure what she meant by that. I don't think it was racist though. 

Regardless, she was saying she was going to call the police on me, and I didn't want there to be problems and I never saw this woman before so I called the police letting them know some woman came to my door to tell me she's calling the police. Basically. It didn't get far. Well, I also told them she said she's going to take over the lease to make our lives hell and everything else. They said they are filing a report.

Nothing came of that call. But she started making quite a bit of noise from then on. Radio and etc.. I was like... Okay, she's cleaning and stuff. Just want to be left alone. But it kept on into the AM with music getting louder and louder. I didn't want to talk to her because all I know is she said she will be a problem to me, so I called the cops to ask her to quiet it down. She basically did. At least the music. The banging and moving stuff around didn't stop until 6 pm the next day.

At about 7:00 am, day two. And I've been just staying in my place this whole time. I heard some banging on the wall from the garage. I wanted to see what she was doing because I'm pretty paranoid. She instantly started going off on me and threatening to call the police. So I said, no, I'm calling the police! So I did again.

That time I reached out to my landlord and explained what I knew of things. She seemed understanding until she called today with questions about my past and letting me know that the woman is moving in. (I don't know her name. I've never met her before this.) I'll admit my past isn't too great. I got in trouble about 20 years ago, I pay child support and this is actually the first apartment I've ever had since I was married about 20 years ago. Also, the landlord responsible for this place had passed away, and I just found out that the landlord I had as a replacement just passed away. This landlord literally just took over. So I don't have him as a character witness either. 

I'm now having an inspection and having my past brought up when I've been trying to just mind my own business. I've only called when things were absurdly loud. She still had the music pumping when the police came. Other than that, it was because she kept yelling and saying she's going to call the police and I've never had anyone act this way around me before.

I am just planning on trying to abide by all these new things. I'll admit, my Mom here without being on the lease doesn't look good. This was supposed to be just for a month. Money got tight with my gf and I so we decided to come together to make ends meet because of the pandemic. Thought this was temporary, she's not on the lease. My landlord's already hinted at possible eviction and I'm freaking out. I went from everything's okay to someone knocking on the door and now I'm having the landlord called on me and etc...  (Example, her key didn't open a door and she called the police on me for it, the police called my landlord who called me asking why I called the police. I said I don't know anything about the police. It was my upstairs neighbor I guess. All I've done at this point was wake up freaked out with the news the woman who keeps yelling odd accusations at me is now living above me. 

I'm all for peacefulness. Not sure how to navigate our shared areas. Her son let us use the washer and dryer. He offered to sell it to us for 100 dollars, but she screamed that it's hers and we can't use it at me. She has notes saying ""Do not touch"" all over the place now. Stuff that I guess is hers that's been in my garage for a year that her son said whatever's in my garage is mine a year ago. So basically the lawnmower and all the utilities we had are now gone. 

I am not sure how to handle all this and am afraid the damage is already to the point where I'm going to be facing eviction. I went from just trying to stay at home during the pandemic that's currently spiking here, to worrying about being homeless with my family in it. Both my gf and mom have COPD. My mother with diabetes. I didn't get unemployment and child support took my stimulus check, but all together been scraping by. 

So, I'm not sure what to do. Not sure how I became the villain. I'm just trying to ignore her and it's not working. My idea I have is to maybe set up a camera inside my living room to record myself doing nothing when these accusations come again? It's been weird and I'm not saying a lot of the uncomfortable behavior that makes this weirder for me. I'm not afraid of my life or anything, just that this woman who showed up my door saying she's going to cause me problems is currently living above me causing problems. 

That's the best I can describe it and I know it sounds nuts. I feel like nobody believes us and she's been basically screaming victim whenever she sees me. I'm at a loss of what to do. 

And sorry if I am a little incoherent. It's been a stressful couple of days. This seems surreal to me, like I'm going crazy but my girlfriend and Mom here saw it too so, I know I'm not. I wish I wasn't so startled when she came to the door that I didn't think to record. I just slammed the door telling her to F off.

So, that's the situation so far. The maintenance guy is here and apparently we have to mow the lawn. It was her son's turn and I found out why he gave us his lawnmower when he left. It's not starting. His mom claimed it back, so now I tried working a broken lawnmower and I'm afraid I'm going to get blamed for this too. I'm asking the maintenance guy who's changing her locks to check it out with me. He's going to change my locks too because the door he's changing is the door I need to use to get my door too. This is weird...",01Jul2020,1

I ran to her house and apologised to her face to face and gave her some space. She said she wanted to make things work, but I just don’t know how to go about it. I asked her if she needed space and she said she still wanted to talk to me.

1072,"So my (18F) boyfriend (20M) got his wisdom teeth removed and this morning I was supposed to take him but his mother wouldn’t let me (his parents are super controlling and since he’s home from college) and he was super nervous so I was super concerned about him and then up until the surgery happened he was telling me abt how dramatic his mom was being abt the situation and then once the surgery happened I heard nothing. 
He posted on his story and I replied to it and he still didn’t talk to me. Then finally at 7 pm he calls me saying he feels like he’s ignored me so he’s just calling to check in and I’m hurt but he was telling me how his surgery went and I don’t want to make a fuss when today’s about him and his pain, but it’s hard to talk to him when I’m upset.

We have the exact same music taste and she would come and sit with me whilst we listened to music before and after shows.

 I got on really well with her dad, as he worked at the theatre, which seems to be a really great thing to me.

 She even messaged me saying that this cloth smelled of me, which she said was a good thing. 

I thought that she was really into me, but she would speak to other guys and we generally just didn't progress anywhere. I can't stop thinking about her. She is beautiful, she is amazing. I honestly think that I love her.

1075,"Throw away for obvious reasons. 

A couple years back I enlisted in the marine corps. I went through MEPS, where they heavily screen you for any disqualifications. If they find anything you’re classified as unfit for duty. 

I went through MEPS and I was perfectly healthy. I did have to get one waiver for health issues which was really bad eye sight. I obtained that waiver and I enlisted. 

After going through boot camp, MCT, MOS school, all of which are very stressful and demanding phases of the military, I got to the fleet. I got here and everything was fine, after about a month? 2 months I somehow developed epilepsy. Navy doctors through it was anxiety/stress related and they initially diagnosed me as that. I fought for so long with them because, 

1. The fleet is light years away from being nearly as stressful as boot camp itself. This NEVER happened in boot camp. 

2. In order for it to be stress induced (panic attacks) I sorta need something to be stressed about and panic about no? Those 2 huge factors were missing and when that’s literally the name of the “illness” then.. no. 

Every medication they gave me after I proved them wrong (the doctor was humoring me when he ordered brain tests, after calling me a hypochondriac) gave me very negative side effects while not working whatsoever. Finally, didn’t know what else to do with me so the military itself handed me over to civilian neurologists for further testing. 

I made that appointment, they gave me a stack of paperwork to fill out. In the form they ask a couple of questions. Those questions are the point of this post. 

“Have you ever had head trauma?” “Any family history of seizures?” “Any family history of psychological treatment?” 

Head trauma- my parents were abusive, one time my mom beat me unconscious. There was a bunch of blood from my head and I lost a couple do hours of memory from that day. At the time of joining this wasn’t even in my mind. I was perfectly healthy. 

History of seizures- I myself have never had a seizure before this. After actually being diagnosed with epilepsy I asked my parents. Both said no but I know my dad doesn’t know anything about his own family so I asked my aunt. She said my uncle had a period where he had 2 seizures when he was little. My cousin had one when he was little as well. I did some research and these types of seizures are considered “normal” in that they go away on its own when you’re growing up. 

Psychological treatment- my family and extended family is riddled with psychological treatment. We all have depression.

You know your car insurance? They look for literally ANY reason to not pay up? That’s the military. If I say something then I feel like they’re gonna use it as a reason (even if that didn’t cause it) to not pay. 

I’m not even talking about medical separation benefits. I’m talking specifically about treatment benefits. Epilepsy RARELY goes away just like that. I’ll forever need medication, MRIs, XRAYS, cat scan etc. how expensive do you think that is? I can barely afford my own food much less 100 dollars every bottle of pills (copay not even without insurance)",01Jul2020,1

1077,"This may seem like a minor issue but it’s really bothering me.

When the pandemic first began, my boyfriend came to my place to stay with me. I share my apartment with three flatmates, and recently someone else has joined. My boyfriend brought an oven tray from his parents’ house that is kinda old and doesn’t really exist in retail anymore. We used it, and it always stayed in my cupboard. I noticed that occasionally it would be placed in the dish cupboard, but it might have been because I washed it and left it to dry, and someone else then put it away (common practice in our flat).

A month ago, me and my boyfriend fetched his things for him to go back to his house, however, the tray was missing. We searched everywhere, and there was no sign of it. I messaged my flatmates to see if someone saw it, and no one did. I haven’t even met the new flatmate, and I don’t have her number so I can’t message her. One of them had a birthday party a couple of weeks ago and I’m afraid they accidentally broke the tray, or maybe some of the guests took it by any chance.

I really don’t know what to do. I’m not at all close with my flatmates, and I’m really anxious about confrontation. I’m considering calling my landlord about this, but I don’t want them to get in trouble either, because they might be free of guilt. My boyfriend’s mom is really strict about these kinds of things and I don’t want to possibly make my relationship with her tense.

I found an old account on an app, it didn’t have my name or even a commonly used user name that I would use, but I created this when I was younger so i don’t know what was going on in my mind. just by the way, I haven’t had access to this email for years, (I created it when I was super young)I don’t know if I changed the password and just forgot, but I still used this email to sign up for things. also with the same email I used to create this account, I had other accounts on different sites or apps and I did use my full name, so this just adds more fuel to my anxiety.  I looked through some of my ‘reposts’, nothing I had on my profile was uploaded from me, but rather I shared or reposted. there were a couple of reposts that genuinely made me ashamed of myself. my fourteen year old self thought they knew everything, without doing any actual research though, so if I saw a post that aligned with things I had already seen before I just hopped onto it. the posts were specifically regarding a religion. they came off extremely bad, they criticized certain aspects of the religion, and I don’t think critiquing is a bad thing in general, but I’m pretty sure some of those posts weren’t factual and they were spreading misinformation. I didn’t click on it, but one of the pictures also said that the religion should be banned along with I believe the bad things that took place with said religion. 

I am deeply ashamed of the reposts and I hate myself for it. this occurred multiple years ago and I like to think that I am more understanding and not as judgmental or quick to put everyone in a group. I know I’ve changed, but sometimes seeing how people react to celebrities who said offensive things on social media, it just makes me feel worse. I understand I am not a celebrity, but it gives me extreme anxiety to think, what if someone got into my email and found this account out and I don’t know about it? what if someone screenshotted the account and are going to blackmail me? 

i have been anxious and I don’t even like thinking of the future anymore, because I don’t want to start school and get into the career field I want, just to have it taken away due to some dumb things I reposted on social media multiple years ago. I know that is selfish, but I feel like I ruined my chance at a career years ago.

1082,"I'm 20 years old girl on her first job after graduation. I've been there for almost a year yet I could not understand my boss. He lacks communication skills which greatly affects how he manages people. He never gives a clear picture of what wanted and his expectations. He never gives feedback on our work and only points out our mistakes. I never liked how he manage and distrubute tasks. 

Despite of his issues in terms of management, I know that he is a kind and patient person. My senior had a close relationship with him and they even remain in contact with each other even though my senior already resigned. Since that is kind of boss-worker relationship that I saw during my stay on the office, deeply inside of me, I am hoping that we could also have the same relationship. Aside from that, I also viewed him as a father figure since I learned so much from him even though I am just watching him on the sidelines. 

However, like my boss, I also lack communication skills so we fought a lot. I do not know how to start a conversation with someone who is older than me so we do not talk a lot. He have a much closer relationship with my junior who arrived later than me and with my other coworkers, which makes me jealous.

Pros: 
great friend group
My moms chill as fuck
Plenty of food and clean drinking water
A roof over my head that only leaks sometimes
Hot water
A job
Access to technology 
Access to books
Internet
Highschool graduate
Marijuana and alcohol (both pro and con I guess)
Cons:
Job is unfulfilling and doesn’t pay enough
Can’t leave job
In love with somebody who doesn’t love me back
Various mental health issues
Can’t afford professional help
Don’t have a car or license because of driving anxiety
Get bullied by my brother
Can’t be positive no matter how hard I try
Lack of thought control
Fat
Ugly
Lonely
Not ready for real world
Scared I’m gonna die sad and alone

And that’s most of the big points, I put some general things on my pros list because I am truly grateful for them. But that’s the big points, I can’t change my job, I can’t afford school, I’d probably flunk out anyway like I almost did high school. I’m basically stuck in this position for 4 more years (again not going into why because it can’t be changed) some things can change over the next couple years but who knows. I used to just be cool being alone, but after meeting more people and being more social the loneliness has just become more so. I would feel so sad and sorry for myself a month ago and every year previous to that. But now I’m just more angry at my situation. My emotional capacity will be represented by a jar. A couple months ago my jar had a little bit of water in it, with a few drips coming in every so offten. The water already in there is depression, the drips of happiness and optimism. A month or so ago (not really sure what changed) my jar got flooded with water, now it’s submerged under the ocean. It’s full of anger, sadness and loneliness, but as of recent mostly anger. I’m not the hitting things to feel better type, but I have to fight the urge to break things even when I’m not confronted with anything that would make me angry. That voice in my head says “smash that plate you’ll feel better, punch that wall it will lesson the pain,” and sometimes things that are worse like “smash your tv do it, do it” stuff like that. I was very angry and violent when I was younger and I used to have a lot more anger inside of me. I would break things I would throw things and I would hurt people. When I was older (around 14-15) the urge to hurt people and myself would constantly cross my mind. I’m pretty good about holding back but it would genuinely disturb me. I was much more sick and twisted, and I feel so bad for thinking like that back then. Some of it has carried over but not all of it.

I was a severe insomniac back then, and when I was 16 I started self medicating with marijuana. It lessened the pain, made me a little more numb, and it was enough to get me through high school. It also helped my sleep a lot at first but has since stopped helping as much as it had. I went from sleeping for 10 hours a night (when smoking) to being lucky to get 3 hours. And whenever I’m sober it just goes back to being power naps and long nights of frustration. I eat like crap because eating is the only thing that really helps me feel happy anymore. Booze helps but like I said I have self control, I could drink myself to sleep every night, but I don’t let myself. I’m in a perpetual state of stress and suicidal thoughts,I got to the point not to long ago where I put a bag over my head and tied a belt around my neck but woosed our last second. It still crosses my mind a lot but I try to remember that it’s not an option. The only reason I haven’t done it is because I’m my mothers only reason to be alive. She claims “if you ever kill yourself I’ll follow soon after” and I just couldn’t put my mother through that even if I wasn’t around to see the consequences of my actions. I

 want to change, I want to be happy, and I can’t talk to anybody anymore because it’s all the same shit. Advice that doesn’t help, and being put down for “acting stupid”.

I just take shit from people because I can’t stand making it worse and it almost always becomes worse after. How can I be better, I don’t wanna feel like this anymore, just constantly wanting to cry?

1084,"For some context, I’m 19 years old and living at home with my younger brother (18M) and my two parents. I also have an older brother (22M) who lives a couple hours away.

Also, I’m on mobile, so I’m sorry for any formatting issues along the way!! 

Way back in September, I started a new job and it was going GREAT! By December, I had been able to save up over $1.2k, which was a big deal to me as I hadn’t been able to save money for a long time. 

A few weeks later at the start of January, they cut my hours and I started working a third of the hours that I was previously working. I was heartbroken; my job had been a beacon of light during some really dark times. I was sad to see it go. 

A few days after they cut my hours, my card gets declined while I’m trying to get coffee and I immediately know something is up. I check my bank account, and there it is. Just five minutes before I stopped to get coffee, my account was emptied TO THE CENT, under something akin to “MEMO FEE”. All of the money that I had saved was gone. 

Confused, scared, and stressed, I called my dad and asked him if he knew anything about what may have happened. He tells me no, and that I should just go about my day “as usual”, which is impossible because I don’t even have enough money to take the train home. I had to bother the person I was ON A DATE WITH for cash to take the train home. Not a great first impression, amirite? 

A few days pass, and my dad explains that this happened because he defaulted on a loan that was for my older brother’s college, and that instead of the money coming out of HIS account, it somehow came out of mine. 

He offers no explanation for how I’m going to get my money back, and tells me to forget that it happened because he’ll pay me back. 

The timing couldn’t have been worse, as I was now broke and working a job that only gave me 12.5hrs a week. I was lucky to still have a job though, so I kept pushing and hoped that the financial complications would work themselves out. 

Boy, was I wrong. 

After the rise in COVID-19 cases in my state, my job shut down. Luckily, I started to babysit for a family who lives across the street, which was a blessing given the fact that I’d be totally fucked if I wasn’t offered this job. 

I was working semi-frequently and was able to save up around $800 or so over the course of a couple months. Unfortunately, I was the only person in my household who was making money. My parents don’t buy groceries or cook very often in the first place, so during the pandemic food was a little scarce. With the money that I had, I started buying some groceries, cooking/ordering food for my brother, and other small things in order to help out. 

My older brother was also out of work, and my parents began to worry about his wellbeing. My mom asked me to send him some money, then asked again a week later, then again, until he started texting me asking if I could send him money. I knew it would be a total dick move to say no, so I sent him money every so often. This ended up being a little over $100. I also ended up paying for my little brother’s senior trip, because my parents promised to pay for it and then didn’t follow through. This was another $90. 

Suddenly, I found myself getting more and more upset over the sum of money that’s been growing over time. There are smaller amounts that are in increments of less than $10 or so, which didn’t bother me, but they really do add up fast. I’ve also seen my family members take money out of my wallet for various things without asking, which is also a little frustrating. 

All of the money that I’ve given out to my family members has been money that I was promised to be paid back, but it’s been months since there’s been any word on when or how that’s going to make it back to me. I know I probably sound greedy, but I have a LOT of student loans that I have to pay back in order to resume school next semester. My older brother has even started working again, but there’s been no word on whether or not that money is expected from him or my parents. 

As time passes, it seems less and less likely that I’m going to get this money back, which is really disheartening. Am I being ungrateful? Should I just let this go? 

I don’t want to sound ignorant of my family’s financial situation, especially since I can see it taking a toll on my siblings’ physical and mental health. My parents have always struggled with being straightforward and honest about our financial situation, and there have been a lot of times where my parents have been reckless with their spending during times where they shouldn’t be. 

I know it’s hard to be a parent and that I’ll never understand the hardships that come with it, so maybe I just need some perspective. How do I talk to my parents about our financial situation without them yelling at me and controlling the conversation? Where do I go from here?",01Jul2020,1

1089,"Okay, I don't really know where to start with this but I've been trying to make a decision for months now and I'm not sure what the right thing to do is.

Me and her started being friends in elementary school and were friends for about 8 years, through all of middle school and part of high school (we're both girls, 18 years old now, and just graduated high school). We started hanging out in a group of mutual friends, but eventually the two of us kind of broke away from the group and it became obvious that the two of us were a pair (we instantly had a lot in common). We always thought of each other as ""best friends"", and even as we formed a new friend group in middle school, the two of us were still the closest within that group (the middle school friend group ended up drifting apart, but me and my best friend stayed together, similar to what happened with our group in elementary school). The thing about me and my friend was that we were kind of different from other girls and their best friends. We had a really long term friendship, and she was my best friend, but we weren't really ""close"" the way that other people were. We didn't text very often outside of school, we didn't hang out very much over the summer, and we didn't share personal things or tell each other our secrets. It was kind of a strange dynamic, but at that time I didn't have any problem with it, and was completely satisfied with the way our relationship was. If I had to describe it, I'd say our friendship was based more off of our similar interests and senses of humor than our actual bond as friends. In hindsight, our relationship was more like ""two people that enjoy spending time together"" than ""best friends forever"".  

Anyway, fast forward to high school and the two of us started to make a new groups of friends. They were people we had both known for a long time, but we had never been super close with. This group felt, to me at least, like the strongest friend group we had been in, and we both loved all the people and were super close with them. It was around this time that I started becoming somewhat irritated with my best friend. At first it was small things... she'd take my stuff without asking and would make small comments that annoyed me. But eventually I realized that, for whatever reason, everything she was doing got under my skin. I realized that she would only ever talk about herself, and would interrupt our friends to bring the subject back to her. She would never be happy for me or any of our other friends when we'd accomplish things, but would always want everyone else to know if something exciting or good was happening in her life (in a way that was very obviously braggy and condescending). Pretty much I started to realize that she didn't care very much about any of us, and was a very deeply self centered person. At this same time, she started to slowly drift away from the friend group (the group of us would always spend the morning together before class started, it was our only opportunity to all be together during the school day, and some days she would go stand with other people. It also became very clear that the dynamic between the two of us was becoming awkward, and we didn't have much to talk about). I think everyone in the group started to notice that she was drifting, but we didn't think much of it and kind of just let it happen. 

So halfway through that school year, our class schedules changed, and I no longer had any classes with her. Pretty much, I would not be seeing her at all throughout the school day, unless we saw each other in passing times or during the one free hour that the school has each week. So at that point, we stopped talking. Not gradually or overtime, but very very suddenly. It just went radio silent between the two of us. We would see each other occasionally, but neither of us said anything... I'm not really sure why, it just happened kind of naturally. We haven't even waved or smiled at each other, just no acknowledgment at all. I regret it looking back, I wish I had maintained at least some kind of contact with her. Now things are just awkward... it feels like one of those situations where I should have dealt with it then and now is too late, but if I keep putting it off, it will only be later and later. The last contact we had was when I texted her on her birthday, about a month after we stopped talking in person. She responded and we had a short conversation. She did not text me on my birthday a month later (I'm not angry about it and I understand why she didn't, but I think it says something that she didn't bother to reach out).

It's been a year and a half since we stopped talking. We both have new best friends (I'm still friends with almost all of our old friends... she still talks to them occasionally and casually, but doesn't really spend time with any of them anymore). I don't know what her new friend group is like, but she seems happy. I feel like now that we're both happy with our own lives, there's no reason to have any issues between us. But I feel like I still have no closure, because I have no idea how she views the situation... did she have a problem with me that made her stop talking to me? Does she think I was mad at her and stopped talking to her? Does she think I turned all of our old friends against her, or does she just honestly think we drifted apart? I'd understand her being angry with me, in my mind we are both equally responsible for how things turned out, but I'm not sure if she views it the same way.

Pretty much the main reason I want to deal with this is because we just so happen to be going to the same college next year. I wish I could put this in the past and move on from it, but I feel like us going to the same school will just make it eat away at me more. I don't want the two of us to be the best of friends again (I think the way things ended up proved that we're just not meant to be that close), but I would like to at least be civil with her when I see her around and not feel like there is awkward tension between us. I'm a very anxious person by nature, but I'm also incredibly stubborn, so as much as I want to settle everything and figure this out, I equally hate the idea of having to reach out when she hasn't reached out to me. But I think I have to in order to get closure, because I hate the idea of having unsettled issues with someone and loose ends that aren't tied up, it just adds unnecessary stress.

So, yeah, I guess my real question is, should I reach out to her, and what should I say?",01Jul2020,1

Hi everyone. My partner and I have recently bought a 3 bedroom/2 story townhouse in the western suburbs of NSW, Australia. We have just purchased a 7.1kw split system air conditioner for downstairs but are not sure where to put it in the room. We have an open plan living/dining area which is approximately 38 square meters and a staircase opposite the room. We we have basically 3 places we can put the air conditioner. Straight in the middle of the room which will be directly opposite the staircase. Towards the back door which is opposite a wall however we dont spend that much time on this side of the room or closer to the front door which would be directly over the lounge where we spend majority of our time. It gets pretty cold in the winter time (below 0 celsius overnight) and pretty hot in the summertime (up to 50 degrees celsius) so we dont want to waste any of the goodness from the air conditioner. I will attach some pictures to hopefully explain the layout of the room a bit better. Thanks!

[//imgur.com/a/3bWl68H](https://imgur.com/a/3bWl68H) \- this picture is looking towards the front door. You can see the staircase which is pretty much in the center of the room

[//imgur.com/a/k1dQCxT](https://imgur.com/a/k1dQCxT) \- this picture is looking towards the back door and the kitchen. The kitchen has a sliding door built in which could block off the air from getting lost in there

I am not shy or socially anxious but I like being myself, it's peaceful, so I want to become independent, I want to have initiative in my life. For example, I have always liked skateboarding since I was a kid but I never properly did it as a hobby because I was scared and just not willing to go out by myself and ride or practise at the skatepark.

1100,"Here is my current situation. I have a full-time job which allows me to work from home. I am completely financially independent because of it and I pay for everything in my life myself. Though I'm pretty much making just enough to get by and am not really able to save much money away.

I am *severely* unhappy with this job. It causes me a lot of stress and I care neither about the job itself nor the company I work for. I wake up with my stomach in knots and my teeth and jaw hurting because I've been grinding them in my sleep. Every. Single. Day. I have this job *only* for the paycheck. I feel very unfulfilled because I'm spending 9+ hours a day at a job that I hate, in a field that will offer me no advancement because I'm not interested in it. Plus I basically have a glorified data entry job so it's boring work that's not really challenging at all. It feels so mindless all day.

I'm so desperate to feel happy in my career that I am considering returning to college to earn a bachelor's degree (at the very least, possibly a graduate degree). I already have a B.A. in physiology (emphasis in health studies), and I never did anything with this degree because I don't enjoy it. I was pressured in high school to try for a major in the sciences because it was ""more respectable"". The arts and humanities were always looked down on, so I never felt right in trying to declare a major in one of these areas. I had to graduate with this degree because I already had a lot of credits towards it and I wanted to graduate within \~4 years. I've always regretted it.

Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of savings built up and I'm not planning on finding another full time job right now. I sincerely don't know what I'd do with my job background and degree. They don't align with my interests at all. So, I'd like to go back to school and essentially ""start over"". I would have to take out student loans.

I would plan on going back as a student full time. Knowing myself, I need a lot of time to do well in school. Previously in college, I did very badly. Did *not* get good grades. I take some accountability for this, for sure. But I'm also sure that a lot of that was due to having no passion or interest in my major/classes, and working part-time (15-20ish hours a week, while being a full time student). This left me always floundering to keep on top of my course work. 

My current job also wouldn't help pay for school because...

1) the classes/degree must be related to my current job--it's not. I'm in data entry and would ideally like to go into the classics or social justice.

2) if I leave the company within 2 years of completing the course, I will be subject to repayment. I absolutely plan on leaving the company, I'd like to not work for them as soon as I can help it.

3) I would have to be a full time employee. Therefore, I couldn't be a full-time student.

I will say that I'm very nervous at the possibility of quitting this job. Even though I hate it so much, and it's causing me a lot of mental health issues, it still provides a steady source of income.

Oh and I am single, and don't have to support anyone financially right now, just for some context.

So I am asking for some advice on this. Has anyone had a similar experience? I'm posting on here because it's hard to get out of my own head sometimes and just want to hear from others.

However, I have previously been in abusive relationships and have been sexually assaulted multiple times.

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Little warning: I'm not very emotionally mature, so maybe take this advice with a grain of salt.

I feel like there are two issues here, namely forgiving yourself for your past beliefs, and anxiety that the results of those past beliefs may come back to haunt you later. Regarding the former, my view is that shame and regret serve a purpose, which is to get you to identify bad behavior and change your beliefs and your actions. It seems you have done this, so these emotions have accomplished their purpose. Don't feel like you need to hold on to these feelings as a sort of penance. The only way to put it right, so to speak, is to change for the better, and you have, so now it's over and done with.

For the anxiety, all I can say is this: If you can get access to the account(s), delete the concerning posts and secure your email/social media accounts. This is more for peace of mind, than anything else. I think it's quite unlikely that anyone will ever come across these posts and link them back to you. And judging by your post, you seem like a pretty self-aware human, so I doubt it was as bad as you think. I know saying ""just don't be anxious silly lol"" isn't helpful, but I think you would be well served by identifying what specific thoughts cause your anxiety. You might find mindfulness/cognitive behavioral therapy/stoicism useful. The basic idea is that you can become aware of what your mind is doing, and if a thought is not productive, you can put it out of your mind before you begin to dwell on it. I can't guarantee this'll work for you, but after learning about this stuff a couple months ago, I went from fantasizing about suicide every night, sometimes for hours on end (from the age of \~12 or 13 to 22) to being able to push those thoughts from my mind and not become anxious or despondent, at least not to the degree I had been before.

 the fact that your ashamed of that version of you means that youv matured into a better person, thats part of growing, doing stupid things or having beliefs or opinions that wont stick, you shouldnt be ashamed of who you were in the past, just be proud of who you are in the present and if someone tries to hold that stuff against you, give them your more updated beliefs. if you think someone could use that stuff against you in a proffesional sense, jobs and stuff, try to delete it, if you cant then just dig into what you believe now, and dont let anyone tell you that your the same person as before.",01Jul2020,1
1109,"Hello. I have spoken with a couple friends about this situation and I am removing a lot of specifics to avoid identification. I live in the rural midwest. I had a referral for a surgeon to consult with me about a lump that I needed removed. The lump is actually a result of a birth defect but I digress, long story short I do not need surgery. I am grateful. I was told that I could not bring my partner in with me for the appointment due to COVID-19 restrictions, which is understandable enough. The doctor/surgeon in question was incredibly rough during the examination, and then while explaining to me the birth defect and how it causes my situation, he was sitting immediately next to my legs, almost crowded against me and rubbing my leg while explaining this to me very condescendingly. I jerked my leg away from him and scooted away while my brain was trying to rationalize that ""he surely wasn't being inappropriate as he is a doctor, right?"" My partner assured me it WAS inappropriate and my friends are encouraging me to find a way to file a complaint. 

TLDR; went to a surgery consultation, surgeon was sexually inappropriate with me, no witnesses in the room due to COVID-19. I feel compelled to file a complaint given his authority and power as a surgeon over unconscious patients, but how can I go about that without a witness?
