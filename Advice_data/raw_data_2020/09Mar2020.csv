0,"Feeling really down lately. I've put all my ambitions aside to help the people I love and as I continue to do that I've watched childhood friends grow into impressive careers like doctors and lawyers. I keep telling myself I'm doing the right thing and that's why it's hard. I just feel dissatisfied. I'm single, have no friends, work constantly, and can't get out of this slump. I'm trying to do what's right and best and what I need to do to help my family and I feel like I should feel great about it but I've come to realize everything I've sacrificed everything that I'd earned, and it's now too late to go back. I don't know what to ask any kind internet people on here. I'm in my mid 20s and I feel like I've had enough of everything since I've already given it all away and continue to do so. Please send kindness.",09Mar2020,1
2,"For the past 5 or so years, my (older) brother has gotten more and more unhappy, and has taken a more negative view on living. For a long while we would constantly joke about offing ourselves (yes, very stupid, I know) but, because we were pretty young, I thought nothing of it. It wasn't until recent, that I noticed he's been more serious.

My brother has only been an adult for about a year now, and due to the lack of parental help throughout our lives, he wasn't at all prepared for it. He's still a junior in high school, and they wont take him anymore due to his ""unwillingness to participate"" and  not having nearly enough credits to graduate. He has wanted to get a GED but fears that our father will kick him out of the house if he doesn't finish high school and go to college.

My brother sort of wants to get a job, but due to him not wanting to socially interact with people, he wont even apply or look into jobs. He's been very miserable, hasn't wanted to do much of anything lately, and has stated multiple times that he doesn't want to be alive anymore. I can tell he's depressed, and anytime I tell him that he should see a therapist, he tells me that they wont help him and that seeing a therapist is a waste of time. 

I am very scared. My brother and I a really close and I do not want to lose him to a situation that could probably easily be fixed. Somebody help me out. What do I do?",09Mar2020,1
3,"Apologies if this isn't the right place to put this, I'm aware this sub often focuses more on personal concerns and less about anonymity and financial services so certainly let me know if this doesn't belong here.
Long story short, I want to be able to pay people online without having to expose personal details. No this isn't about xyz  illegal stuff. This is more ""I want to commission some art without the artist knowing more than necessary"". I have an especially uncommon name (I'd put money on being the only one with this particular first name and last name combination in the whole state), the subject of the art is embarrassing and I'd rather the people I know in real life not know about my interest in it (nothing shady, it's something that rhymes with blurry and I live in a small town where word travels fast), and I honestly see very little reason for buying $70 digital art to require that I divulge private information like my full name and address (it's digital art, nothing is being sent to my address to begin with).
I know for a fact that certain cash apps and other services like paypal show information like that to the person receiving the payment. I also know that none of the artists I'd discussed this with accept crypto payment. So those two methods of payment are unfortunately not a viable option. 
So if anyone has any other solution that lets me support an artist without exposing my identity, it would be much appreciated. Thank you! :3",09Mar2020,1
4,"A bit of context: I was unschooled as a kid and grew up without any responsibilities but dreaming big, being a musician or actor or author, having a nice house, having a big family. But I never put any work into anything. I didn't really grasp that if all I ever did was sit around having fun I wouldn't be moving towards a goal. 

Now I'm 24 and I've been slowly giving up on life. I'm borderline homeless now because I'm severely depressed and working seems pointless. I almost killed myself last year. Now here I am trying damn hard to pull myself out of it, but I don't know what to do... I don't even have motivation to pursue my passions because I'm too cynical to believe I could ever get anywhere with them. I don't have the motivation to study hard because I don't actually want to spend my life working any of the jobs I could study for. 

So what do I do when I don't want to give up, but trying seems worthless, and I can't muster the will to put in the effort? I'm always thinking about suicide but don't actually want to die. I just don't want to live a life where none of my dreams come true and/or I'm sinking all of my time into a job that I don't want. I'd really appreciate any advice... I've been trying to figure myself out for years and I just seem to be slipping farther down as time wears on. Thanks for reading.",09Mar2020,1
5,"Hi. So I don't know how to start this so I am just going to dive into it. I have been with my fiancee for 8 years, we are getting married in October.  Last October of 2019 I was on Whisper and met someone. We made it clear it was to be a friendship only, and we decided to keep chatting on Snapchat.  I never went looking for romance or to cheat, and he knew I had a fiancee. He also loved in another country so there was no chance at meeting up. So, a couple months go by and we are really connecting as friends. It's great! We talk often, he's 10 years younger than me (I'm  32) but we still had alot in common. He has a sarcastic humor, and I dish it right back. Well one drunken night I'm *feeling in the mood* and my fiancee is asleep. I'm pretty open with this friend and he mentions that he is too. Long story short, ended up sexting. Next morning I wake up and feel like shit because I know what I did was wrong. I talk to my friend about it and he understands, and we reestablish that line that it'll never happen again. It never does.
We continue on our friendship, we never even get close to that line again.
But, the guilt has been with me ever since, and my fiancee is an amazing man and i knew he deserved the truth.  So, first I started by telling the friend that I need to cut off this friendship, because I'm having a hard time getting past it. He understood, but still left things open if I ever need to vent.
That night I'm so anxious and upset because I know I need to tell my fiancee, it's not fair to walk down the aisle with this secret between us. So I confess. I tell him everything. 
Somehow, this angel of men, has decided to stay with me. That is the good news!
Bad news - I feel so lonely after cutting off my friend. Because aside from my life lesson, he and I had such a good friendship. Like we clicked instantly! We joked that we were long lost twins.

I'll be honest, it hurts so bad! I miss chatting with him. But I know (logically) that I shouldn't talk with him because of how I disappointed my fiancee.
Truth is, I am lonely. I don't have many friends so I was very happy when I made this one.

What do I do? I dont know where to go from here. I talked with my fiancee about feeling this lonely, and bless him he is trying.

I just keep crying today. 
I don't know what to do or if this will get better.
Help please",09Mar2020,1

8,"I know it must be tiring to flood this sub with my teenage troubles, but I need to tell someone, anyone. 
Context: I (17 F) met this bully (18 M) (I’ll call him John) last year (around March) trough friends.
That night, he was being really flirty towards me. Not gonna lie, I started to like John.
The next time we met, he was being still friendly. Since he doesn’t go to our school, we only hung out on the weekends. Anyway, during these hangouts, he was distant towards me. NBD. Then, out of nowhere, he started to bully me mercilessly for being bi and a proud feminist (he called me slurs, such as fag*t, femin*zi, so on)
I hosted a Christmas party (more like a hangout) in my house, he even threw up and stuff, made a mess of my room and living room, and insulted my decoration. Even my mom was mad at me for the mess. He was the first to arrive, and we we’re bantering until some of our friends arrived. Then, it was like I was invisible: didn’t talk to me AT ALL. A few days passed by, and I couldn’t take his insults anymore: I confronted him about this in our group chat last December (a few days after the party) and he told me that he didn’t get what he did wrong. I took a break from social media. He then asked me to forgive him, so I did. Then, in January, we all hung out again: I was the one to first talk to him, because he wouldn’t even look in my direction, even though I’m the victim here. That day, he announced that he began dating my friend (I’ll call her Jessica). It was weird at first, since she’d rejected him multiple times, and since she knew all of the things he’d done to me. I felt weird, and I cried the entire night the minute I got into my house. 
A month passed by, and we fought again: I told everyone (in our group chat) that I went to a new store in the mall, and he said “lol no one cares” I told him to shut up (I know it wasn’t mature of my part, and I’m sorry) and he told me “what’s your problem) and I messaged him privately, and I told him that he’s being rude again, and that it’s wrong since we were just renewing our friendship. He told me that I was being dramatic again. I told him that I’m not, that all I’m asking for is a little respect. He then told me, and I quote: “WHAT THE F*CK IS WRONG WITH YOU, F*CK YOU” then blocked me. I had to tell everyone in our group chat to tell him to unblock him, Jessica told him. Then he apologized, saying that “It’s not him. He’s usually not that angry, and that he has outbursts. And that he’s sorry that I got that impression of him”
I called him on his BS, telling me that he’s been rude to me SEVERAL times, and I’m the one that’s always the bigger person and the one that always makes up, even when I’m not wrong. I told him I’m sorry for telling him to shut up. I told him that he will respect me, and I don’t want him to talk to me anymore. He left me on read.
He’s still on the group chat, and my friends LOVE him: they won’t shut up about him, and how he’s so funny and kind. I think he wants to drive them away from me, because he’s often saying “we should hang out at my house sometime!” And stuff like that. Obviously, I’m not invited. But everyone’s looking forward to their hangout. Yesterday, I confronted some friends (not all, since some don’t go to the same school) and told them: “Look, I’m not going to the hangout. We’re not in good terms; I want to hang out with you guys, but I don’t want to see him. I’m not telling you to pick sides, since you’ve been friends with him longer than you’ve been friend with me, and John’s dating Jessica, so she obviously won’t be on my side. I’m just saying that you shouldn’t normalize his bullying. I expected more from people who claim to be friends with me.” The air got tense, and one of them said “Well, you’re putting us in a hot spot. We can’t choose sides. What do you want us to do?” 
The same day, I texted another friend about this, and he told me that he didn’t know we weren’t in good terms, (I doubt this, since we fought in the group chat, and everyone saw) but he told me he’s stand up for me if John tried to bully me again.
I feel like we’re not going to stay friends. Am I being dramatic? How can I keep my friends?
This is what’s making me miserable. I’m already stressed out by college, my mental health and the future, and now I’m miserable because I might not have my friends.",09Mar2020,1
9,"I live in novascotia, and family doctors are hard to get. I need a psyche evaluation or something because I’m losing it. 

Idk what I need. I don’t know where to start. I feel like walk ins are a waste of time and hospitals will just lock me in a room if I say I’m suicidal/sad all the time. 

I’ve been experiencing trauma my entire life. I won’t go on about it.. but the first time i tried to kill myself I was 20(now 25) after my first gf died. I figured i was grief stricken. Floated through life for the next year away from everyone in another province. Came back made a new toxic relationship that recently ended and realized I used it as a distraction.  It also caused me to severe ties with all my friends so I e only one left. 

Back to being lonely and I’m either so empty I sit in my room for days on end, leaving only to use a bathroom. I’m basically anemic. Or I’m so up I go out and clean my car, room, and visit friends. Rinse repeat. 

I can’t cry no matter how sad I get. The closest I came to crying is when I was let go from my 7th job this year. I thought I snapped on my drive home. 

I need help, because I feel like I’m trying so hard to just survive but I can’t get ahead, I can only go backwards.

12,"6 months ago I moved over 3,000 miles away from home with my fiancé of 12 years. I have no friends or family out here. Ever since I moved, I’ve been dealing with some pretty bad health issues. Literally the day we got here is when things started happening. Hair falling out, was hospitalized with kidney failure, diagnosed as a diabetic out of nowhere. 99% of the time I feel either physically or emotionally awful. I had a job but quit a month ago because I just couldn’t do it anymore. My depression and anxiety have also got significantly worse. 

My fiancé works a lot, which is understandable since I have no income right now, only savings. However, that means I’m alone most of the time. He loves it here and hasn’t given any indication that he would move back. I feel like I’m losing my mind. I have a car, but let my fiancé use it to get back and forth to work. Even if he wasn’t using it, my anxiety is so bad I’m afraid to drive. 

I feel so isolated and alone. I’m so scared to end the relationship and move back because I honestly don’t know if that’s what the best option would be. I don’t want to live with a potentially even bigger regret. I’m SO torn between staying here and trying to make everything work, or moving home so that I can have the support of my family/friends and likely manage my health issues better.

14,"Hi Reddit, buckle up for a long post. 

So, here‘s the problem: around October last year I noticed a small black cat near our house. I pet her and noticed she was really skinny and had kinda scraggly fur, so I was pretty sure she was a stray. Someone from the neighbor house also seemed to feed her. Now, I would have probably kept her back then, but 1) I wasn‘t entirely sure she was a stray and 2) our landlord generally doesn‘t allow animals. 

Now, usually you can‘t entirely forbid your tenants from having smaller animals around here. Cat is included in smaller animals, I think things like hamsters or rabbits are also like an exception. Apart from that, I‘m sure we could come to a solution with him, since he said it was just decided bc no one in the house had pets and we talk often. 

Yesterday we saw the cat again after some time passed and she seemed pregnant. I don‘t have any experience, since I only had a male cat, but as I said, she‘s small and skinny, but has this huge, round belly all of a sudden. Since then I‘m also sure that she doesn‘t belong to anyone, bc who would let their cat walk around town this pregnant? 

My boyfriend and I both took a strong liking to her and would like to help/keep her. We feel responsible bc she hangs out around our house a lot. 

Problem is, we‘re both studying at Uni and our lives will be very busy the next few months with both of us studyig and working. We don‘t have the capacity to help a new Mama raise kittens. Not to mention food and medical bills to get them all checked up, vaccinated etc., since we‘re broke students. 

One solution would of course be to let her have the kittens and then take her in and get her spayed, but as I said, we feel responsible for her and don‘t want her to have a litter out on the streets. 

Our current idea is to ask at our local shelter for help. We‘d catch the cat and bring her to them to make sure that she can have her litter in a safe, supportive environment where it‘s also clear that her kittens could be adopted out later. Afterwards, we‘d adopt her. 

Is this a good solution though? And what should we do if the shelter refuses to help?

Any tips from people who have some experience with animal rescue would be appreciated :)",09Mar2020,1

20,"Listen, I've read through a couple of posts on advice, and maybe what I'm looking for is more of validation, but both my wife and I are struggling to make a decision here and I feel like its leaving my kid in limbo.

So the problem isn't that we can't find a day home for my son (1), its that two different day homes are actually viable and enjoy having him. However the problem is that when we were looking for day homes originally we had a bit of a hard time, but the first one that we found (shall be referred to as S) gave my wife a strange feeling. Now the day home itself is great, it just feels like the lady running the day home is desperate for kids as she only has 1 regular little girl. Now my wife only works part-time, and we only need a day home 1 or 2 times a week at max. The lady who runs and works S  keeps being a little pushy and asking for more time so she can make more money. However a couple of weeks ago, she went on vacation so we tried a second day home (shall be referred to as A), and she's amazing. Never pushy, has many kids that my son likes, and sends daily updates and photos as a regular practice. Now here is where I need advice, is it wrong to tell S that we don't wanna send my son to her anymore, or just to have her as backup because of how well he's doing at A's, or how would you go about telling someone that you found better placement when you know they are almost ""desperate"" for more kids.

24,"I am 21 years old, and I have been in school my whole life basically. No breaks between high school and college. I am graduating with a degree in botany, and I have an awesome job lined up after graduation, with a starting pay $8 above minimum wage. I am excited to be graduating and working in my field of interest, however, I am concerned when thinking about life outside of schooling. 

One of my concerns is **will my life just consist of going to work and then coming home?** I will be working full-time, as I have said, but I get sort of nervous thinking that I won't have any other things to do outside of that. In school, I have always been busy with studying and homework and I often wonder if I will have too much free time outside of work that I will be bored. I grow orchids as a hobby, but that is a very slow hobby (purchase an orchid, care for it until it blooms, repeat). I have been so busy with schooling and work, that I don't have time for hobbies, so I don't really know what I am interested in doing as a hobby. How did you discover hobbies you're into now?

Another concern of mine is **what to do with such a large increase in income?** I will be working 40 hours a week at much higher pay, which will result in a much larger income. I know this sounds really stupid, but I don't know what I should do with the money other than saving it. There are some repairs around the apartment I want to make, but that's it. Should I look into investing money in stock? I really have no clue. I know I will divert some money towards a 401K, build up my savings, but what other good decisions are there to divert part of your income to?

Lastly, **have others felt the same way as this? How did you go about life after education?** I know I can't be the only one who feels in the fog after graduating, how did things pan out? Did you find that it wasn't really worth worrying about and that your decisions will come naturally?",09Mar2020,1

I can't do anything because my mom wouldn't be able to get over it; however, my dad probably could. I think if my mother died I’d probably kill myself.

I have absolutely no energy. I'm really fucking tired but I don't have time to sleep and no matter how much sleep I get I never feel better.

Now I'm posting onto Reddit because I don't know what to do. I've waited it out and nothing has changed. I started medication and nothing has changed. I've asked for help and nothing has changed.

I thought it was bad when I was twelve, but now it's much worse. I tried to kill myself when I was thirteen, kind of. I took some pills and then got scared, thinking about going to hell, so I woke up my mom. I now can't kill myself because I know she cares, which is bittersweet.

I don't want to be alive, but I don't want my mom to feel like this so I feel trapped.

I'm miserable without a reason and my mom is trying to look for one. She brought up a ted talk and said that depression has a cause. (I think I've heard that depression is genetic, but I don't know anything.) I don't have a reason to be depressed, I live in a white middle-class family in America. I haven't faced any adversity except for depression and anxiety. I feel like I'm not allowed to be miserable because of how fortunate I am.

I feel bad posting this because I've seen posts on Reddit before of people saying they are going to kill themselves, and it brought me a lot of anxiety and a sense of needing something.

29,"Hello, Advice, first time posting here and I have a coworker who doesn’t believe a great deal of things he hears. We work a job where we have a great deal of time to discuss things between us two and our other coworkers. For example, when talking about recent events and the new coronavirus, he dismisses all information about it being deadly and prevalent. He tells me that outbreaks of new diseases and old ones like swine flu, SARS, and mad cow disease are covered by the media in times of great political scandals in order to turn attention away from them. I ask him what is the scandal right now and receive no answer except another question to why does the stock market dip right before a national election. I answer by saying that the dip is probably due to investors being scared about the uncertainty of a new president and their policies and making unwise stock changes. He answers back with my most pressing issue. Why is the color blue blue he asks, and why isn’t blue red. I respond with a scientific answer involving absorption of colors and wavelengths of light. He says that I shouldn’t listen to everything that I hear just because people tell me so.

Hi, i need help. Let me begin where it all started, i was with my classmates on a party, one female classmate got drunk, like barely walking drunk.
I had couple of beers myself but i could walk so i offered myself to help her get home along with my friend who was her ex. We were to sleep there anyway so we left the party early. When we got there se tried to put her to sleep but she didnt want to. In the end all three of us ended sleeping next to each other. Out of nowhere she took my hand and placed it on her chest. When i took it off she did it again and said ""dont you even try it"" By that time i was barely awake so i left the hand there. When i woke up to her ex saying ""M do you have to do this"" i realised what i was doing and promptly put my hand next to my head. And after that i went to sleep to different room for good measure. Now they both hate me.",09Mar2020,1

but the void feeling never fades because I’m not used to being alone I’m a social person and I’m used to having alot of friends or just friends in general and since I stepped in 9th I don’t have any. Which I’m too blame cause I had to get rid of the negative ones and the rest was my fault cause I was being toxic and I didn’t know myself during that time  (middle school) lol. I had one friend this year that I really enjoyed but we stopped over some bullshit she was basically my only friend and I got selfish which was stupid 

someone knock some sense into me or something or tell me how to continue cause idk 
I was thinking I can make friends in class when we do like group projects or something idk

34,"I’m now at the age of “adulthood” my parents expect me to now pay for everything while I’m still in high school. For an example today I asked for some bras since I only have three pairs and most of them have the wiring sticking out or general tears and rips (pretty beat up). He yelled at me because I’m always asking for money apparently and that I shouldn’t expect them to buy these things for me as he said “we aren’t obligated to get you things” while that may be partially true I think bras is a basic necessity for a 17 Year old girl from her parents. He told me we can go to a thrift store and get bras and underwear which is really unhygienic, so I asked my grandpa to help me out since I couldn’t afford it, he sent me 10$ to help me get at least two pairs of bras I was very grateful. My dad yelled at him and told him to stop giving me money, I don’t understand why he’s like this?

But I have a few question about It:
1. Is it possible to be an exchange student for only like the first semester, an not the full year?
2.I am from Croatia, and I would like to be an exchange student in Vancouver, Canada because my godmother( who is originally from here) lives there.Is it possible for me to live with her during the exchange process?

37,"I'm a 22 year old female, graduated from Uni in the summer and moved back to my hometown and in with my boyfriend (24) of 2 years. He lives with his parents and younger brother. Financially speaking, moving in with him was my best option at the time as I had no job in my hometown and my parents didn't want me living with them again. I recently got my first full time job (was bartending for 6 months) which pays about £16700 a year before tax. 

Unfortunately, my boyfriend can't currently afford to move out as he has decided to go back to college. He is only able to work part time due to this. Obviously I totally support him on this decision and want him to finish college and pursue the career he wants. This is gonna take some time though. 

Although living with his parents is fantastic financially as I'm only paying £130 a month in rent, it's starting to feel a little cramped. We have a very tiny bedroom and I'm having to keep the majority of my stuff in my parents storage locker. Plus, it feels a little awkward living with someone elses family. Don't get me wrong they never make me feel unwelcome, I just have anxiety. So for me simple things like making food in the kitchen translates to ""I'm in the way, I'm making myself too at home"" ect. I feel having my own space would really help with my mental health. 

I've talked with my boyfriend about the idea of me getting my own place and he thinks it's good idea. To be fair we probably moved in together a bit too early in our relationship, which does put a lot of pressure on us. I love living with him, but I'm definitely the needy one in the relationship: I like a lot of kisses and cuddles all the time whereas he enjoys his own company (or more the company of his computer games) a fair bit more. Point is he probably only thinks it's a good idea as he'd have more time to play world of warcraft uninterrupted.

Also, I currently have a £2000 planned overdraft (which is almost at it's limit) as well as a £1000 loan I'm paying off monthly. If I wanna pay off all this debt, the best thing for me to do is stay at my boyfriends and just grin and bear it with my mental health. If I was gonna move out now, I'd probably need to do a hell of a lot of overtime to make it work. Which probably won't be very good for my mental health. So I'm unsure if I should just wait it out and try save up my money or just try and go for it with moving out. 

All advice appreciated, thanks for reading",09Mar2020,1
38,"Hello, I need help. 

Backstory: my family was what I would call very bipolar. One one hand we had family dinners, went to the beach over the summers, went camping, and went to my grandpas farm. But there were also a lot really bad things. my dad when we were like 5-8 (me and my 2 brothers) used to what he called ""discipline us"". he would lift us up by the hair kick the back of our heals hit the back of our heads dugg his nails into our scalps pull my nose really hard until I fell down one time he head butted me hit me and my brothers head together one time he hit me to the ground told me to get up as I was crying and hit me again until I fell to the floor told me to get up hit me again until I went to the floor. this was because of things like arguing with my brother or taking things from th fridge. we were also very neglected. our house was a comlete horror show. they never took care of the home. we coloured all over the walls and they did nothing. the toilets were full of shit and did not work. there was a leak in the pipes which caused 2 ceilings to cave in. the bat did not work and we would shower once a week in the community centre. there were rats in the basement. one time I woke up when I was mabey in grad 7 and a rat was eating thorugh a pack of buns. I will never forget that. I literally saw it chewwing away as I woke up. they would chew through he bedding while my 2 brothers and me were sleeping in one bed. once my brother found a dead mouse in his shoe while he put his foot in it. then one summer we had flees everywhere when I was like 10 or something. they would jump on outr legs and suck our bood and I would pull them out and bite them dead which was gross The worst thing was that they had a capacity to normalie everything. it was just normal. I had my brothers so I was fine although still annoyed obviously. I truly love my brothers to deat (one a year older and one a 2 years younger). And I still always loved my parents although I knew that they kept betraying what should be there love for us. Im and infj and apparently we are forgivers by nature. 

part 2: normalization of sex: they would fuck, constantly. they would keep us in the same room and as we were sleeping they would have sex with eachother. I remember vividly waking up to them fucking on the bed beside us. we would say its gross but they would say that they are teaching us to be compfortable with sex and other people are not. they would always say that they are raising us perfectly and they ""know exactly what they are doing\\"" they are very smart people. and th truth is thatthey are book smart but obviously not wise. Also I should mention that my dad workeda few times a year until I was like 5 but other then that they did not work alot of government checks and possibly money saved up from before we were born. anyway my dad will cut my moms skirts and she would walk aroud in a mini skirt with no underwear everywhere. we would always see her ass and vagina. But she was ""showing us how to be comfortable with our bodies"". well guess were that ended up? we were comfortable with our bodies. and guess what 5-6 year old (also one day a rat ran across my brothers back whil he was sleeping) I did I started doing sex with my brothers. and we would touch eachothers bonders touch tips I would dress my younger brother in a mini skirt ( guess where I got that from) and make him si on my face naked. oh ya and I still ave scars in my hands from dad. anyway we eventually stoped and they never knew because were were so neglected. I still have a great relationship with my brothers but don't talk about it.

that was another way our house normalized things. shit happens and after it happens it does nt matter. that why I say its bipolar. one day my dad woud scar me make me blee the next we were eating together. 

that was normal.

As a grew older; as we grew older obviously resentment started from us. we were no longer the little kids who took there bull shit. fights ensued.obviously our house was destroyed and we never had phones until I was in ollege so we couldn't interact with friends. they kind of knew that we hated them but only for a little then it would be back to normal because that fucked up lace was our normal so we acclimatized to it. as we entered our teenage years we had less and less tolerance for there bullshit. we moved to a condo they promised to keep it clean but like 6 months latter it was a wreck. and they never stope fucking! my mom would still wear her disgusting skirts. and while we were eating my dad would adjust them and grope here.

my shadow side: as I started to go into puberty my sex drive obviously increased. they had 3 more kids 2 younger sisteras and a younger brother. I love them all to death. ii should say that there were summers where because they did not hve tv or were allowed outside they would sit in their room the whole day and do nothing. I would buy them pizza, get them timhortons get them abunch of Geronimo stiliton books and attack on titan noverls from the library I would watc movies and cartoons that I would download on my laptop from the library 

and we would spend time together. I felt bad for them. I wanted to help. ive always wante to help. that's why I forgive so eaily. my older brother despises them and my younger brother as well though not as much but I always realize that no matter how bad things we can always make the future better it beat smaking it worse. anyway that was my relationship with the 3 youngest of my siblings. 

abuse as a teen: obviously life was very fusturating. they were always late to pick me up from school. when I made the soccer team my dad said you just got lucky they would still fuck vonstatly I had to go to the library to do work because we did not have a computer. I got really mad at my parents because they would never get me a phone and my clothes were always dirty. and his is the worst part. as I was developing my sexually and seeing my mother like that I started being attracted to her and masturbating. whe I was like 10-13. they would have a collection of nude pictures in there room with here ass sticking out that I would masturbate t. then I started when I was like 10 when I was playing with my sisters I started spaking my older sister. I was like 10 and she was like 6. but it was not sexual I was genuuinly playing with her.  but then I started masturbating to thoughts of my little sisters. we would play games where we would slap eachothers buts. like one a year. thene time when my sister was in grade4 mabey and I was in grade 8 I would come to there room at night and touch them. I would groe my sister and touch here privates while she was sleeping. then I would masturbate. th fucked up par is that I dint realize how fucked up it was until recently (il talk about that realization afterwards). anyway i did his a few times ovr the cours of like a year and I did it to my two sister. one tie my little sister coagh me when I was like 15 and said what are you doing. i stupidly laughed and left. I was ashamed that I wgot caugh but did not process the terrible act. I think this is because every really bad shit in our house was normalized aso no matttter how bad the shit was it was in a way ok. we could not hurt eachother. I was very nice in school and definitely did not think aout doing this to anyone else. I fell deeply inlove with a girl all throughout highschool. I would hold my hand in my other hand before I went to sleep and think of it as holding here hand. I still do that actually and I can still feel for her if I allow myself to even though I am in 2nd year college. I was agood person in my mind with a lot of fucked up shit going on but I never saw what I was doing as bad. it was just another fucked up thing in the house of fucked up shit. Normalized. any way I would spack my sister as she was in grade 7 and 8 like for one week each year usually during the summer to satisfy myself and she would try to spank me. we would have water gun fights that ere oriented to this end. I would grope her. one time when I think I was in mabey grade 10 so like 14-15 we would play this game where she would have to get something from me and she would be on top of me and she would sit on my boner although it was not penetrating (this is so fucked up) and she would grind. for like a minut. I remember he left and then came back and grinded on me again so obviously she enjoyed it. although sh was of course way to young to gve consent. then I would spank her and grope her. but nothing happened in the end it was fine that was that. it was not a problem. that was as far as I got with the eldest sister. but I started spanking my younger sister when I was like in grade 11v and she was in grade 5 mabey. this was not sexual though. It was not until I was in the summer of my first year bck from college that I did this to my youngest sister who was 12 where I picked her upo by the butt and groped her and threw her on the bed. see I was playing with her but it was to satisfy my self. but in my mind it was fine because I could hide under just plsying. but then she was in my lap and I would rock her back and forth and stimulate her. but in my mind I was just playing. then onetime se came on to me and rubed gherslf back and forth on my leg then it sanpaed. oh fuck! now I wasn't just playing with her she was sexually engaging with me. I remember te look of hate she gave me. I would never forget it. then I finaillly came lets say online and I was stunned. I should say all the while my parents would fick in there room anai groped my sisternd leave the shit in a newspaper bundle that would stink up the place. and I would still be a great brother. I wwas the only one who saught to there well being. I got a piano home to give them something tot do any would still buy them food. the first job I had I spent the irst 400 dollars buying paint and a brush and cleaning supplies to clean the terrible place and paint there room and the living room. I only made 1500 dollars that summer. I spent 1/3 of my money trying to help them. anyway I was stunned because I started to realize that this isn't ust some game I play with them that is stimulating me on the side. this was now making my little sister sexualized. I swas sitting the couch and she was trying to get me to play with her but now I didn't and she came to me lyed down on my lap first showed me her but thinking I would slap it I dint then she sat on my dick and I was like thinking what the fuck then she sat upright and grinde on me for like 4 seconds and left. I was literally tunned. this dint go back to normal. 

she was actuing fine because it normalized it for her as my parents normalized their behaviour on me. but I was starting to mature and I realized this was not good. 

coming to terms with the consequences of my action. I rnew I needed a break from school. I had 2 shirts the entire semester and did not care. medical school only looks at 2 years and the courses were so eays I dint bother. I went from a 4.0 in first semester to a 2.4 this semester. now I only take one course because I new I KNOW I HAVE ALOT OPF SHIT GOING ON THAT IS WAY MORE IMPOERANT. MY COCIOUS WAD KILLING ME EVERYDAY FOR LIKE 2 MONTHS. I TOLD MY PARENTS, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAID, OH ITS OKAY ITS NORMAL. WTF. I TALKED TO THE ELDEST SISTER AND JUST STATED CRYING WHO ISKNOW 15 AND SHE SAID THAT SHE DIDNT KNOW ME TOUCHING HER IN HER SLEEP SO I DID NOT TELL HER. THANK GOD I THOUGHT. SHE THOUFHT THAT ME SLAPPING HER BUTT WAS JUST PLAY AND SHE SAID SHE DIID IT WITH HER FRIENDS.SHE GAVE ME A HUG AND I TOLD HER THAT I WANT TO MAKE ER PROUND . THEN I HAD TO TALK TO MY YOUNGER SISTER. THIS WAS ALOT HARDER BECAUSE I KNEW FR A FACT THAT SHE SEXUALLY ENJOYED IT. I TOLD HER THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER DO THAT WITH AYONE EXCEPT SOMEONE SHE LOVE AND WHO LOVES HER. BUT MY IDIOT DAD WAS LISTENING AND HE CAME IN AND TOOK HER AWAY. HE THOUGHT I TOLD HER SOMETHING BAD OR SOMETHING. 

anyay that is the sytory up until no. it was my sisters birth day the other day I said happy birthday she said thanks she seems ok sdo does my other sister. my  brothers hate my parents and im eating myself up. 

I keep having thoughs of killing myself although I know I will never do it becausr it will do much worse. 

I am worried that they will grow to hate me as they get older and realize the magnetude of what happened. 

Also when i was lik 17 i said my mom smelled because i was refering to htem having sex everyday. my dad got mad and hit me to the washroom told me to take off my clothes. i did. then he spit on my face. i cryed uncontrollably. as i walk around now when im alone i have intrusive thoughs of he spitting on my face. i gt like 50 of them a day. i feel him spitting on my face. i think i have ptsd. i can forgive him because the only thing that matters is to make the future better.that is how i finally realized how fucked up what i did to them was. i realized that this behavoiour that can easily be pushed off as a kid fucks with you in adult hood. im afraid it will fuck with my sister particularly the youngst. i want her to have a happy fullfilled life. 

&amp;#x200B;

My solution: i am taking jordan petersons advice. i ant nothing but the good. i want to work in its pursuit, im starting with myself,. i waent to mass today and started o read scriputre. i was talking with a lady and i hade almost a freeze moment because the first thing i thought was im not a good person this person is a good person and i dont deserve to communicate with this person. funny enoguh im really value being honest and i feel that my true self is not worthy of acceptance. my parents cant even accept me. my dad from the time i was 14-18 told me to get the fuck out of my house when he was made. he tells me now whenever i come back o try to set it straight that im afraid of the real world. most peopl would call this emotionaly abuse but inlight of eerything else this is nothing to me literally. anyway does this sound like a good plan? 

&amp;#x200B;

plan of action: i fizx myself. i have been reading ethics and have cometo realize that moral excelence as aristolt put it comes with habituation. you develpo virtues like honestly self control bit by bt and it becomes your character. my plan is to tlak to my parents and not try to be mean or anything but say look i want this to go well for everyone and i say that if they dont stop doing the really stupid things like fucking and shouting then i will call child protective services. even if that means i get punished. i will tel them to go to church everysuday. not because god exists or anything. because they can get out of there bubble where fuckedup things are normalized. they start to integrate there behaviour with there community. i will also need to make my sisters proud. - i am kind of a smart person and i dont want to get into this to deeply but i see that the best way too act is to help others. so i want to get a phd in biology and learn as much programming as possible as as ai and shyntheitc biology show alot of promise. i want to start a busniss and i will work every week as hard as i can so that by the time im round 30 i hope to be very wealthy. i know this sounds kind of outlandish but i ont need to waste my time with the bullshit o college kids. i will work to make my dream a realityi want to be wealthy so that i can provide for my family build something for myself worth while so that i can show my sisters that i am worth it and i want to help other people. this has always been the true me. i know it. but my fuckedup self got the better of me and i was almost in the deep end of life. i want to have  a really good family life i want to buy a farm with animals and i want them to have kids and i want to have a big fmily get together everysummer where we are all happy and everyone forgives everyone. then they can finally pass judgement on me. If i hurt them s much that i need to be charged so be it. i dont want them to suffer. i realized theconsequences of my actions when i realized that i got flashback of my dad spitting on my face for the last month. i have had periods of profound shame feeling like i betrayed someone i was supposed to care for. but i need you to understand while i was doing it i didnt think it could hurt anyone. what do you think i should do? thanks",09Mar2020,1
39,"I have a classmate who I haven't spoken to in months. I hung out with her for a couple weeks the first year of grad school (which was a while ago, now we're about to graduate), but figured we didn't have that much in common so I started hanging out with other people.  Since she started dating this guy in our class (last year) she's been randomly sending me candid pictures/videos of him on Snapchat (laying on her lap, holding hands, etc.) and on the occasions when I do have to work with her, she texts me about doing intimate things with him. I never know how I'm supposed to respond. I'm not close to either of them so it just feels weird. We never even sent Snapchats to each other regularly before this. Is this normal?

40,"So, I'm 17 years old and finished school last year. I was going to get my A levels (I'm german, sorry if that's not the correct term) but just a few weeks into the school year I realised that what I've been working towards wasn't what I wanted but what I thought the people around me wanted me to do.
After that realisation I decided I wanted to quit school and work but.. well.. I wouldn't be able to live on the money I'd get as a part timer and just the thought of having to stick to an apprenticeship for 2-4 years makes me physically burst into tears. I'm just so scared that I'll regret whatever career path I'll pick. No matter what I end up deciding on, not even ten minutes later I'll be sure I'll regret applying and search for something else and this cycle has been going on for months.
I know I probably sound like a brat but I just don't know what to do. It's getting to a point where I can't cross a street without wishing I'd get hit by a car and die so I wouldn't have to make this decision. Not to mention that I'm still stuck having to go to school every day until I have an apprenticeship, which is just getting increasingly harder as well. It's like it's getting harder and harder to just read normal sentences when I'm there. It could be the most basic stuff and I'd have to read it 10 times before I'd even get close to understanding what the words mean. 
I just don't know what to do anymore, everything's getting too much and I'm seriously starting to think I might need professional help but that also just feels ridiculous to say because this would probably be such a minor issue to other people.
I'd really appreciate any advice on what to do, literally anything",09Mar2020,1
41,"I'm 24 and I've been slowly giving up on life. I'm basically homeless now because I'm severely depressed and working seems pointless. I almost killed myself last year. Now here I am trying damn hard to come up with a reason to keep going, or a plan, but I don't know what to do... I don't even have motivation to pursue my artistic passions because I'm too cynical to believe I could ever get anywhere with them. I don't have the motivation to study hard because I don't actually want to spend my life working any of the jobs I could study for, and if I had a career, I wouldn't have the kind of time I need to do the things I want to in life anyways. 

So what do I do when I don't want to give up, but trying seems worthless, and I can't muster the will to put in the effort? I'm always thinking about suicide but don't actually want to die.

42,"What works for you?

When I say early, I mean like 3 am. I'm trying to get the gym going again and I moved, so it takes me 20 mins to get to the gym, then I have to shower there as it is on the way to work.

3 am is really the only time I can go to do a muscle routine, because typically the later it gets into the day, the crowd progressively gets worse. I can go to the gym after work on the way home, but only to do cardio really, cause by then most of the barbell/dumbbell/Weight Machines are spoken for.

I've struggled with this issue for a while now. I go to bed early enough, but rather than getting 8 hours of sleep, at 3 am I hit the snooze (or I turn off the alarm(s) in my sleep on the way back from taking a piss in the middle of the night.)

43,"Hey all. First time posting anything here, but I really don’t know what I should do. For background, I’m seventeen (almost eighteen) in my senior year of high school. 

I’ve participated in show choir since December and our competition is on the 28th, but I’ve just accepted a job at a local news station as an associate video producer, which is absolutely crazy and huge for me since I’m only seventeen and I have a dream of being a journalist. This will be my way to build a foundation of what working in news is like and I’m incredibly excited. 

I sent in a message to my show choir director, and she seemed super disappointed, as she’s already given notes to the people at states that includes me, designed t-shirts with my name on the back, and our choreography and such is set in stone. 

Also, it’s important to note that a freshman I was friends with told my directors I was thinking about quitting just because I “didn’t want to do it anymore”. So now her and I are in a little bit of an argument, making things even worse. 

I have it absolutely thought up one hundred percent in my head that I am quitting show choir. My director wants to meet with me tomorrow to discuss everything and I’m afraid she will try to convince me to stay. I feel so guilty but I really don’t want to overwhelm myself, even more so because me and this friend had a falling out because I can no longer trust her. 

What should I say to my director? How do I get across that I can’t do show choir slash don’t want to stress myself out? How do I do this without looking like the bad guy?",09Mar2020,1

Was in the market for a mattress and was lied to about return and exchange policy several times. they withheld signed documents from me saying it was ""standard"".

I went in the store as well as spoke to the sales rep that sold me the mattress. They are now telling me I cant return or even exchange the mattress at all. I never would have bought the mattress if i couldn't return it and they lied to my face just to make a sale.

It's really new and I'm still figuring it out, and I'm not comfortable with talking about it to anyone just yet, but I did download Grindr and Tinder and have had talked  with a couple of guys.

 My friend Emily (22F) went to my place because we were going to the movies, and she really likes my phone's camera, so I let her use my **blocked** phone to take some selfies while I took a shower, so we could then head out to the movies.

But she just didn't take selfies. Not only she figured out my phone's password (it's my father's birthday, but I had no idea she knew it), but she started to going through my apps and pictures, and in doing so, she found Grindr and Tinder.

She confronted me when I got out of the shower, but I played dumb, we went to the movies like nothing happened.

52,"Hello! I'm a 24 year old female who recently did a modeling gig for a pretty famous and well established company. I used to model a lot in my early twenties, however now I only do it freelance so I don't have an agency. I did the modeling gig about a month ago and had a conversation with the head of the company about payment. He agreed to paying me in money, about 160 dollars. Some of the models wanted to be paid in clothes, but I made it very clear that I didn't and it seemed like he understood that. I took a day off from my day job to do this modeling gig and I really needed the money, as I'm also a student. 

Now it got complicated only two days after the gig, as it was explained to me that it would be difficult to pay me because I didn't have an agency they could send the money to and document the transaction. I thought this was a bit odd because I clearly stated that it would be freelance work and that they would have to pay me directly. Anyway, I contacted a company (for freelance workers) that sent them a bill in my name with a deadline to pay me the 160 dollars. I got a mail about a week ago from the fashion company stating that the bill had been paid and that I'd get my money after the deadline passed. However, today I got another email from the freelance company as the deadline has passed and the fashion company still haven't paid me...

I don't know what's up with the head of the company, but he's not been good with me at all. Not once has he tried to contact me about anything, I even had to set up the meeting to talk about payment myself. I also had to call him about how payment would be done and explain to him how he could pay the bill I sent from the freelance company (as he couldn't figure that out himself). I literally had to do all the work here, even though he's the one who wanted me in the gig in the first place. I get that I'm a freelance worker, but shouldn't he at least show a little bit interest in paying me? And when I've actually sent him a bill he should at least manage to pay me on time. Like I said, this is a well established company, with high prices and a good reputation, it's weird that they do things like this. I really didn't expect it as my friend (who also has worked for them) talked about how great they were. She got her payment in clothes by the way, because that's what she wanted.   


I'm kinda thinking that if I contact the head of the company again he'll get angry with me (this will be the third time I'm contacting him about payment) and demand that I take my payment in clothes. I'm also thinking that this was his plan all along, to avoid paying me in actual money. I'm kinda stuck here. Really don't want to burn any bridges either with this guy, but I need my money. What should I do here? Should I contact him one more time?",09Mar2020,1
53,"So.. throwaway account obviously.. i need advice. 
a little background: I’ve been with my current boyfriend (we’ll call him Gabe) for a long time now, he’s become very close to my child that i had before we begun our relationship, he’s basically his father. We’re all extremely close and i’ve always thought of Gabe as my best friend and closest companion. We usually tell each other everything and he has never acted out or ever disrespected me in anyway shape or form... Never hid anything... until now.. 
So i’m at gabes house for the week watching his animals while he works. I’ve been home alone all day (oh yeah, mind you, this JUST happened).. and so i’ve been cleaning, doing laundry. and I just currently lost my job so I went to get on his laptop to look for another... And that’s when I found that he had signed up for a dating sight last month.. a gay dating sight.. and has been getting messages on it up to even today

now i am in complete shock, as he is the most straight man i’ve EVER met (or at least i thought).. he’s always been a very loyal partner and has had no reason to cheat on me.. he’s always talking about how happy he is and how we have changed his life for the better... but I don’t know what to do.. im so conflicted. i don’t want to just throw everything away because of this but i honestly am just in shock. i’m shaking and I don’t know what to do.. i’m also stuck here the entire week unless he brings me back home because my vehicle is in the shop ATM. please, please help...

That patient’s father broke quarantine code and attended a school event with his daughter, and many students from that event then went to eat at the restaurant where my father works.

I posted something emotionally in the heat of the moment, and a poor choice of words led to it sound like I was angry at all Chinese people, even though I was only trying to express my anger with the Chinese government, for a wide variety of things, (Uygur Muslim concentration camps, Hong Kong, and likely covering up how bad the situation actually was in the early phases). A lot of my friends now believe me to be racist against Chinese people, but that could not be farther from the truth.

56,"My very independent (read ""stubborn"") childless widowed aunt is currently in nursing care for rehab after a mild stroke. And it took two days to convince her to go to the doctor after the event. But she's doing well, and moved to rehab after 3.5 days inpatient and a poop. She's oriented and aware, just needs therapy for left side weakness, but (and Aunt doesn't know this yet,) she probably can't ever go home by herself again. We'll cross that bridge when we get there. 

So far, most of the personalized caregiving has fallen on me, my brother, and my youngest cousin, because my aunt doesn't trust the three oldest cousins, the only living sibling is almost 88 and needs full time care, and my aunt is adamant that biological family only know her business. And even that has its limits.

So far, we have managed to dig up a medical power of attorney. One of aunt's friends - a retired probate judge whom she trusts and respects - is visiting this week to harangue the beloved battle-axe about a financial power of attorney, and the consequences of not having one. (And tbh, after years of trying to get Aunt to address that, I'm not stressing. At this point, she's able to understand, and choosing to make no decision is as much a decision as signing a paper. It's on her.)

On the advice of a very dear friend of mine and my aunt's, I've made sure that the room has a clock and calendar, to keep Auntie oriented, plus a TV for entertainment and a little radio for white noise.. I make sure she has the paper and appropriate clothes and shoes and Chapstick and a cup of coffee. My brother brings the mail. We manage the laundry. My cousin arranged a phone designed for simplicity. 

I'm the primary emergency contact, because I can be at the center in 5 minutes if traffic is bad, and my two college aged kids are even closer, and are willing to go be my eyes as needed. So far, my aunt hasn't objected to me making decisions nor sitting in on medical appointments and such. Technically, she has every right to bar me from those, but I'm doing that until she says otherwise or isn't able to make that decision. She's legally competent, and I'm closest and most able. (And I'm also as blunt as a hammer and won't sugar coat anything, and I think maybe she has begun to respect that?)

Anyway, sorry for all of the really dull novel, but:

TL/DR: if you have cared for a stubborn, independent semi-invalid at home or in nursing care, what has been useful for you and for the person in your care? (Aunt doesn't read except for the newspaper, and all of her hobbies are more active than she can tackle right now.

Bonus question: How do we take away the car keys, if/when Auntie goes home?",09Mar2020,1
57,"Just a bit of context. I'm moving out of my house really soon, and I have a job, a small amount of savings(started saving money from my job in September 2019) and I have this friend who I really want to meet and she really wants to meet me, things are a bit romantic but we both agreed to not try to have an online relationship, we both live our lives as if the other person didn't exist.

So basically, I have an opportunity to go see her this summer and it would only cost 800$ CAD maximum, for a flight back, a couple of nights in a motel(I could live in her house but her parents are agaisnt her having sex, yeah). The issue is that I'm scared that this an amount of money that I can't afford. To add a bit more, I have enough money for one semester of trade school atm(trying to become an electrician), a couple month's worth of rent, food, etc, and potentially a program that would allow me to live in an apartment where rent would be 390$ CAD for a month, and I'd be allowed to live there for a year. My friend lives in the U.S. 

Also, I don't want to get into it too much, my parents are abusive so I'm leaving my house and getting emancipated.

I just need to know if this is a horrible idea or not, my friends don't want to give me advice since we're all young and they don't feel like they can give me good advice on this issue, I need an opinion other than my own.",09Mar2020,1
58,"19/male

Hello! I'll try to keep this short and sweet. Basic info is I have some undiagnosed mental health issues which have been detrimental to my life.

I fell in love in my life once. I became extremely hurt by it. I tried to move on, and I suppose I did. In college, I got in my first ever relationship as I thought I got over my mental health issues, and I was fairly happy. It didn't turn out well for me or her.

I suppose I don't know how to handle my situation. I wish I had a partner to comfort me and make me feel safe. I feel lonely, and I just want someone to hold me and make me feel better.

However, due to my mental health, I tend to switch people on/off like a lightswitch. One day, I'll just lose all interest in a person. This happened with everyone except two people in my life thus far. I am incapable of being in a relationship or playing with someone's feelings as much as I crave being in one.

I can't make someone suffer or even fall in love with me for me to one day basically say f*** you, I lost all interest.

I guess I just need some advice to calm the emptiness in my heart from the lack of having a girl to support me. I made up my mind that I can't ever support a relationship, and I just want to come to terms with the reality that there can be no one for me.

Before everyone gets sappy or whatnot, I know myself and analyzed my life. My mental health conditions are permanent, and I am treating myself the best that I can, but I literally can't ever support a relationship or make someone happy just as much as someone can make me constantly happy.

Even in the case of love or something, I can't rely on someone else to bring me happiness. If the person dies or something were to happen, it'd be truly traumatizing to me as they would've been the source of my happiness when it should come from myself at the end of the day.",09Mar2020,1

72,"The company I work at hired a business consultant three months ago to help us build structure since we grew so fast over the past year. I’m the office manager and have been with the company for two out of five of its years. 

I’ve always had good feedback. I have received a promotion and three raises since I’ve started. I’ve made few mistakes and have never had any disciplinary problems. I work 40-50 hours a week and manage two admins. 

The day I met this business consultant I knew I didn’t like him. He brought me in a room and grilled me on what I’m going to do once I get married and start having kids. I said that I already am and have kids.. he responded by saying “back in my day they hired them old so they can’t bear children.” Unbeknown to him I’m pregnant. With twins! I haven’t told the company yet and after that comment I was planning on waiting until he left to tell them. He also referred to my other admin as the “ pregnant one” because she is currently pregnant too and due this month. I’m not due for a while so our leaves won’t over lap. 

Anyways, I eventually had to tell the company sooner than I thought because I’m showing and wanted to prepare since twins can be high risk. Literally a week before I told them one of the owners told me ho they want to invest into me and put me into financing and he classes to help me grow with them. I was excited and felt valuable at the time. Well a couple days after I told them I was pregnant I received a call from the same owner saying that they decided to just hire a finance manager because they don’t have the time to wait on me. I understand and that’s okay with me. I was admittedly disappointed but we are a small company and we are growing so more opportunities will come up in the future. 

Since then I have also been forced to reduce my team during all of these policy changes and system changes which has led me to working more hours. One of my admins is on military leave and we still have my other admin for about a month. But it will be just me eventually. I asked the business consultant what we should do to prepare for these leaves and he said we would hire a temp. Great. I’ve been very overwhelmed at work and some days I cry on my lunch because of my work load but I’ve tried to stay positive and power through it. I do love the company and have always been treated right by them.

Well the owners call me and want to meet with me yesterday. I come meet with them and they blindside me by saying the business consultant thinks I’m a zero on a scale of one to five. I asked what the scale was and they said they didn’t really know but that he suggested letting me go. They refused to do so and instead chose to talk to me. I asked why he rated me a zero and what I need to do better. They said that I should be working 50-60 hours a week when the workload is high. I’m fine with that but nobody ever gave me these expectations which they agreed with. I asked if there was anything else and they didn’t really have anything else to say or any more constructive criticism to give me at all. I also informed the owners how I felt about the consultant and they asked me why I didn’t come to them before. Honestly it’s because I did come to them before about his comment about pregnant women and they just laughed it off. I wish I told them this yesterday but I was at a loss for words and just trying to hold back tears and asking what they needed from me. 

I’m extremely upset and hurt that I’m graded a zero on a scale of one to five. It’s a huge slap in my face because I feel like I’ve been busting my ass off. I’m glad they didn’t fire me but now I feel discouraged and embarrassed. I’m going to start going into work at 5 instead of 7 so that I can rectify the hours situation and show them that I’m taking this feedback very seriously. Other than that I’m not really sure what else I can do? I should also mention that I usually do work 50 hours a week anyways but I took two days off last week because we closed on our new house (I actually ended up going into work one of those days because they needed me.) and I gave them a very in advance notice. I took two days off in the beginning of February for bereavement, my grandpa passed ( however I still worked while I was at the hospice from my phone and took work calls.) and I took two days off in January because my kids had the flu. Obviously those three weeks I didn’t work 50 hours but I still worked 40. 

Our finance manager starts on Monday and I will be reporting to him instead of the owners from now on and the business consultant leaves Friday. I’m worried he is going to paint me in a bad light to my new boss. I’m also very worried about losing my job now out of nowhere since we JUST bought a house and I’m expecting twins. I can’t stop crying and feel sick about all of this. I plan on tracking my hours now since nobody was before and I wish I was so I could have a case about how hard I have been working.

to give a little bit of a back story, I'm 17 y/o and I have always been nervous to because i feel like my family are gonna make fun of me and ask me too many questions if i say i'm gonna have a girl over. so i didnt for like 2 months, but finally i had the balls to ask her to come over and she said yes (i knew she would), but then i had to ask my mom, i knew she would say yes as well, but her and the rest of my family give a lot of rude comments because whatever.

Okay, so the way i told my mom about her was i waited until she was on her own, and then i asked her and told her that i think she is someone special (which she definitely is) and it would mean a ton if she could come over on Saturday, she asked  me questions like who is she, how old, how long I've known her, etc. i answered them and that was that. 

Saturday was the next day, and i had baseball like all day pretty much and she had work till 9p.m, so the plan was for her to come over after work and watch a movie (she like doesn't watch movies \[like seriously, name a movie and she hasn't watched it\]). i had to be at baseball by 1 and i was done the day at 6, so my mom was nice enough to clean the basement which was nice of her. you may be wondering ""why not chill in my room?', my room is upstairs right next to my parents so that's why. so the basement was cleaned and i got home from baseball at 6:30, i showered, and by 7 i was setting everything up. by this i mean that i took my ps4 downstairs and set that up for Disney plus and took down a blanket and water, i made sure a lamp was on as well as the main lights (because i didn't want her to think we were gonna watch a movie in the dark, i made sure the lamp was on so when we sat down i could turn the lights off with the lamp on). so the place was set and ready to go.

When she got off work i sat upstairs waiting with my mom in the front room, i told my parents to not embarrass me so my dad did the smart thing and left while my mom stayed in the front room and we talked, she asked more questions like what are her interests and if she is athletic, and things like that. she was cool about it and did anything she could to not embarrass me.

When she arrived, my dog did her normal greeting and then i introduced her to my mom (if my mom wasn't there we would have went straight downstairs). and once my dog was somewhat familiar to her i asked to go downstairs and then we went. we went down there and the lights were on, when we were walking to the couch i made some small talk by asking how her work was and then when we were done that mini conversation, i asked if she wants to watch a movie so i went and turned off the lights (the lamp was still on) and then i got it all set up while we talked about dogs because she has one as well. when i was about to press play i asked if the glare from that light was bothering her and if i could turn it off, she said yes and so i did (i feel like the lamp part was important just because some people are scared of the dark, so even if she wanted to keep it on, it still would have been generally dark, and a lamp is better than the overhead lights). we sat on the couch and she sat right next to me, not touching, but close, like maybe 6 inches away (side note, when you have a girl over, sit close to her, or try to get her to sit close to you, its awkward when you sit far apart). so when i say she doesn't watch movies, she doesn't watch movies. we started watching star was episode 1 and she doesn't know a thing about it, which was great. i explained to her what was going on and my internet kinda sucked so it buffered a good amount, which was good because it actually made us talk a LOT. we would make subtle jokes here and there and she would sometimes readjust her position and it was normally to move closer. i didn't put my arm around her right away because i didn't wan't to rush into that too fast. 

(side info: we are in the same English class and we are doing a debate on Monday and we are going against each other)

we were talking about the debate when it was buffering one of the times and i accidentally slipped one of my groups points and so she started writing it down in her phone so i was like hell nah, so i was trying to get it from her (keep in mind i am over a foot taller than her so i could have easily won) but i let her win because i am nice like that, and when we sat back up my arm was still behind her and she didn't want me to move it. so i was happy from that and then she started showing me pics from her cruise a couple weeks ago and all she did was get closer from there. we were over half done the movie at this point but every 5-10 minuets it would buffer. at one point she was sitting weird so i pointed it out (she used to be in dance so she is flexible while i'm over here with the flexibility of a 2x4) so she proceeded to put her leg over her head and then stood up and showed how flexible she was, in an attempt to show my worth i tried to do the same and almost pulled every muscle in my body. wehn i sat back down i put my arm up fast and then around her when she sat down. this was a smart move because at this point i realized she was serious and that she does actually like me. we cuddled for about half an hour until 12:15 because she had to be home by 12:30. i loved it and I'm pretty sure she did too.

when she got home she i said i had fun and we should do it again, she said she would love too. and my mission was accomplished

the only bad things were is that we talked through a good amount of the movie and the worst part of the night is that my Disney plus broke literally as soon as you heard the beginning of Duel of the Fates. but that was okay because that just gives us a reason to hang out again.

**TLDR: I had a girl over and it went great, 10/10 would cuddle again, star wars is GOAT, this is to help others, so ask questions about my experience or ask for recommendations for your own**",09Mar2020,1

80,"hello :) so, my boyfriend (16m) and i(16f) are in a long distance relationship. we’ve been on and on for 2 years now, but there’s always been something between us. recently, his mom decided that she didn’t want him talking to me. he sat and begged her to just listen to him and he told her how much i actually care about him and she didn’t listen. he had to block my number and all my social media’s. every couple of days he unblocks me to talk to me before his mom comes home and checks his phone. recently, he never unblocked me. he’s just gone. 

now i just want to know what you guys would do in this situation, would you just end it or wait it out?

also some extra details. during my freshman year, i was depressed and i never thought i would come out of it, i figured that one day i would end up killing myself and it would all be over, but then i met him. he made me beyond happy and we fell in love so quickly. i love every single thing about him and i don’t ever want to lose him because he is somewhat my happiness. i have cried myself to sleep every single night this week because i miss him so much and i just don’t know what to do. part of me wants to wait, and i would wait for him, i would wait forever, but the other part of me thinks i’m being dumb for clinging on and wasting my teenage years. i also know i’m going to have to heal a lot. it would be hard to get over him, and i don’t know if i can. i’ve had other boyfriends, ones that actually live near me, but they’ve never made me feel the way he does. 

another thing, we’re off and on because we don’t know how to settle arguments. we have one little disagreement and we just end it, but neither of us have ever once lost feelings. he always tells me about how he’d have dreams about me when we’re broken up and he’d just get so sad because he always wanted to talk to me (this part was a lil unnecessary to the story but he just melts my heart bro) anyways yeah! does anyone have advice? have you been through a similar situation?",09Mar2020,1

I work at a big company now and they'd figure out how to get by without me but I don't know how to talk to my boss. Ideally, since I don't want to leave my immediate team scrambling, I'd be fine to stay around if they'd accept limits and I'd even work plenty of overtime, perhaps 50 hours instead of 80 a week so I could have a life outside of work. (Working 80 hours a week has made me miss out on intramural sports games that I really enjoy, improv classes that I used to do weekly, and virtually any social events).

89,"Tl;dr I (27F) think I may have autism or something else, but I've not had a medical professional actually take me seriously. I'm wondering if there is something else I can do. 

I (27F) have suspected that I am on the spectrum or something else for a few years now. I've been to a few different therapists and psychiatrists over the course of about 5 years. When I was about 23 or 24 my mother and I were talking about my mental health and she said ""I wonder if you might be autistic"" or something along those lines. At the time, I didn't give it much thought. It wasn't until I began doing my own research that I even considered it to be a possibility. 

I've formally been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. One of my former psychiatrists suspected I may have Bipolar Disorder or Borderline Personality Disorder, however neither was ever diagnosed. 

I've been struggling with my mental health since I was 11. My mother took me to a psychiatrist once when I was a child. They suspected that I had ADHD, but she stopped taking me because she didn't like the idea of them suggesting there was something ""wrong"" with me. Thankfully, my mother has matured since then, but I feel it would have been much easier to get an idea of what was wrong then. 

Within the past two years, I've been trying to find a doctor who specializes in diagnosing autism in adults. I guess I'm starting there because so many of the symptoms align with what I'm experiencing. I want to make it clear, I am not self diagnosing nor am I seeking any type of validation. I just want to know what the hell is wrong with me and how to fix it. 

I've gone to a few doctors and have told them I suspect I may be on the spectrum. None of them listened to anything I had to say. They didn't even try to hear me out. One of them actually laughed in my face and told me it's probably just anxiety. Of the doctors I'd seen, all of them had autism listed as something they specialize in. I figured because of that they may be able to point me in the right direction. 

This post is getting too long, so sorry about that. I have written out everything that made me suspect I might be on the spectrum or have adhd or something similar. I just want to talk to a professional about these symptoms and get some idea of what it might be. However, it seems near impossible to find someone who will take me seriously.

I've followed every bit of advice I have found through countless Google searches and they've all been dead ends. I've talked to my doctor. They referred me to a therapist who didn't listen to  my concerns. I found therapists in my network, psychiatrists in my network and nothing really came of it. I don't know, maybe there is something I am doing wrong. 

 I don't know what else to do. I just want someone to listen to my concerns. It is important to me because I rely too much on those around me for things most adults do for themselves. I feel that I'll never be able to stand on my own unless I get answers as to why simple things are so hard for me. 

Is there anything else I could be doing? Who should I go to? Any advice is welcome.",09Mar2020,1
90,"Hey reddit! So, theres this guy from school (we’ll call him Karl). He’s a pretty cool guy, handsome, smart, and kind. (We were working on a school project together when this story took place btw)

So one day, before I had a crush on Karl, I came to school with my best friend, when Karl comes up asking if I want to go out for coffee to work on the project. I say yes, and he looks pretty excited about it. Fast forward to the coffee date, and Karl and I start working. We talk for a while, and we get a lot of work done. We’re both pretty tired, so Karl asks if I want to take a break. I say yes, and then we walk around. We immediately start talking, joking around, and just hanging out like best friends. It was a lot of fun, and I’m pretty sure Karl enjoyed it too, because we decided to go hang out again. This time, we weren’t hanging out because of a school project. This was just for fun. We go to this mall, eat, shop, and talk. I got to know Karl a lot, and I guess I started to catch feelings for him. He was just so thoughtful, smart, handsome and everything. But then everything changed. After we went to the mall, we decided to go to this arcade, with a photo booth inside. 

I got pretty excited when I saw the photo booth, and asked Karl if he wanted to take a picture. He laughed and said yes. So we go up, put a coin in, and stand inside. We take a few pictures, just goofing off and having fun, and then we leave. But suddenly, one of Karl’s other friends (Let’s call him...Caesar) Caesar, he saw us, and shouted “Karl! I didn’t know you had a girlfriend!” I think Karl got really embarrassed, because he shook his head and said “She’s just a friend!”. Now that, that broke me. Karl didn’t know that I had feelings for him, but I still felt horrible. So I excused myself to the bathroom, but when I came back, Caesar was holding the picture me and Karl took and was still teasing Karl about me being his girlfriend. Karl’s face looked sick, 
and confused. He looked at me, apologized, and then told me he didn’t want to hang out anymore. Karl ran home, leaving me standing there, in the arcade with Caesar.

Fast forward to a school day, and at lunch I decide to go sit with Karl and his friends. I ask Karl if I can join him, and he nods. However, Caesar was also there and then the teasing began. But now, it wasn’t just Caesar. It was the entire table. They were talking like “omg you guys are such a cute couple”, and some people even said “Karl is too good to be with someone like her, he deserves better.” Basically everyone was acting like Karl and I were a couple. But we really weren’t. Even if I had feelings for him, he was still like a friend to me. At least, he thinks of me as a friend. 

This went on everytime I was with Karl. We couldn’t even be together for 3 seconds before someone whispered about us. I hated it. I hated it so much. It made us both so uncomfortable, that we just ignored each other for the rest of the week. Heck, even now we’re still ignoring each other. Once I actually tried to talk to him but he just turned and walked away.

104,"My little sister's depression is not that bad, but she would have depression and feel all emotional and couldn't control her thoughts and stuff whenever she's stress, it's the same condition and symptoms one would have when you are stress up and fed up with work related stuff.

First of all, she studied Nursing in Singapore, we are from Malaysia, a city at Johor Bahru, which if you google, and for those who doesn't know, we are literally 1 bridge across from Singapore, so most Malaysians who resides in Johor Bahru, choose to work in Singapore, due to the high currency rate of the money compared to Malaysia. So, my sister wanted to study vet course as her first choice, but did not get chosen so she went with nursing instead, as we all know nursing is a very tough job to have, and the working hours is very unstable, where you have to work morning shift, afternoon shift, and night shift. So after she graduated, up to the point where she started working for a few years, she is fine, but now she seems to kind of almost break down due to the fact that she got bullied at work, for example her colleague would obviously protect themselves first if there is anything wrong out of the usual when facing the upper level. So during her working period, she felt she was being treated unfairly, which is true, and the fact that she does not have any friends at all at work makes it worse. 

She is living at my mum's old friend's house, they are an old couple, which takes very good care of her, from time to time we will ask them to check on my sister when she's stress, but recently it kind of took it to a whole new level, no matter how busy or stressful she got to be, she would tend to reply to our family group chat days later, but now she does not respond at all, even when my dad asks her a direct question like "" Are you ok ? "". I have never seen her like this, and of course, prior to this, there is her relationship issue with her boyfriend, which I knew everything that was going on in her work life and other stuff from her boyfriend, as he came to talk to me in the wee hours after he was worried that my sister would take her own life. So the main issue right now would be my sister is unhappy with her work life, her lifestyle, because of her work, and her irregular hours, she does not have time for herself, she does not have time to spend with family  ( Which she very much loves to ). So we told her, to apply to change to a different department in the hospital, she did ask the sister for the transfer, but they did not reply, so she being herself did not follow up as well. My mum went over to be with her for a few days, but she just kept mum and did not mention a word or anything that is happening at her work. ( Which we already knew what's happening at her work place, thanks to her boyfriend. ) So, at this point, what I'm trying to do is to get her to come back home, instead of staying there, being more stressed up, but she refuse to come home, and even told us she won't be coming home anytime soon because the hospital does not allow anyone to travel back due to the COVID-19 Virus. Which we found out, it's not true, the hospital did not mention such rule. 

So, that pretty much sums up most of the general stuff and the story that I can picture here, as clearly as I could, what can I do to help my sister ? She is very very important in my life and obviously to all of us. And we are all worried, especially my grandpa, my parents. She does not respond to text, calls, etc. Which it's how she always is, but this time it's kind of different, she just refuse to say anything because she does not want us to be worried for her.",09Mar2020,1

107,"Thinking about fully applying myself scares me to death. I think it’s rooted in my fear of peoples expectations and fear of not being as good as I think I can be? 

People tell me they can tell I use my whole heart and head with things but I never feel right and hesitant when it comes to no one around. 

For instance I run cross country and even finishing first for my team I felt nothing because I felt I was never applying myself? Do I need to just start doing the things I feel I’m not doing? Even with painting, music, and school the feeling lingers. I generally excel without much effort but I can never will myself to have good practice time and take upon new challenges without social pressure.

I came in exhausted looking first of her words where good morning it was 1 so I just muttered a good afternoon a lil curtly and before I stepped in my room where your sister started her chores you should start yours, I shrug and say yeah well by that time I'm leaving because as a 22 I made plans to go out with friends. She says get started I'm still in my work clothes at time I roll my eyes, and get to my room and start disrobing slowly and taking my sweet time seeing as I finished a 31.5 hour work week. I was being slow she shouts in my name and I go yes might have had undertones of leave me alone in my voice at this point but shes not normal family, she a bitch that looks like a too fat apple with a problem with my manners which are decent at best passable in a normal home but hers was stricter then my parents view and I always lean with what I'm taught when I was young not this new changing bs and now I'm ranting. She remind me for my aunt to wash the table cloth I go gotcha or something similar no mood to deal with I get changed before, she said moving at a snails pace or similar. I groan and say I'm getting there she doesn't like my tone of voice and storms into my room where I'm still getting around to cleaning up my room I tell her to leave me alone again tone bothers her so she grabs my hair and, starts dragging me outside to by my hair which I responded with fists for the first time in ever. I wanna know if I should press charges. At this point in the evening my aunt is blaming me for being bitchy even though I tried not to be but people keep pushing me.

114,"TL;DR at bottom
Okay all the rest of my life I feel like I’ve been naturally happy and never depressed, like I could have a conversation with myself and laugh. But recently whenever I’m free or have nothing to do and alone especially I just feel so sad and I just question life and why I am the way I am. Additionally, most of my day is doing something or occupying myself because taking a break without a phone or book is horrible. I read for enjoyment for at least 3 hours a day because social media doesn’t have the same draws. I’m all about life’s big questions and people who are motivators but I can’t motivate myself at all and I feel like I’ve gotten meaner. Not mean mean, but not as kind or lenient with people as I was. I was stuck thinking about what makes people unhappy halfway through a workout and I just decided to quit and ask for help on here instead. When around people I do enjoy myself though and don’t feel as sad, but I become socially drained after too long and THEN when I’m alone I just feel drained of life. I know this whole thing is a ramble of nonsense and I’d be surprised if people would read this far over an issue I could probably just google, but it feels nice to vent into this and Reddit makes me feel more happy than a lot of other forms of social media. I currently have 9 different YouTube videos pending from some of my favorite youtubers. I procrastinate, but not that much and I think I want to watch the video but I don’t take the step. My room is a mess and I have time to clean, but instead I acknowledge the problem without acting on it. I want a purpose, I have no idea what I’m doing for the future, I don’t want to be alone but I don’t want to constantly have people. I love my dog but I ignore her to read because it makes me happier in the moment. I have a trip in 2 weeks and in this moment I’m not excited because I’m thinking about the drag of travel. Pessimism is taking over my life and I want to be happy.
Advice please.

TL;DR I want to find a purpose to block out the unhappiness I feel throughout the day.",09Mar2020,1

I'll never get to see all the technological advancements because death will take me before that. I'm like a frog in a well. There is a whole world out there but I'm supposed to hop around in my well until I die. 

I can't believe this is how my life is. I have one body and mind and I'll be able to experience life through someone else's eyes. It really bothers me.

I'll never know their story. I'll never BE THEM. I'll never experience what THEY experience because I'm ME. What is this weird feeling that keeps making me sad all the time?

I'm 21 years old and it really bothers me that I'll never be a child again. I'll never get to experience the past again. Time is ticking, isn't it?

My mom was supposed to bring us three to my grandma's and my dad was supposed to come back from work at around 3 AM and go back at 9 AM, but when I woke up just when my mom was about to leave ( it was like 4 AM), she told me that my dad wasnt back yet. Ok, this was normal, I was pretty sure he was going to be back by around 6 AM at least. My mom also told me that he wasnt answering her calls. Well, normally he would answer my mom's calls when he was going to be late, so I started getting a little worried. Aa soon as my mom left, I tried called him to ask him when he was going to be back. He didn't answer, which was strange because he would definitely have answered me because he knows I am very paranoid. I tried a couple more times but he still didn't answer. I couldn't go back to sleep without my dad in the house, with him I felt safer and I dont ike being alone, so I out on some music to calm down a bit. I thought he was probably drunk and maybe that's why he didnt answer, it has happened a few times and he was always okay. Well, a few hours passed and he was still not home. My mom came at around 9-10 AM to bring us to my grandparent's, but I told her that we would all be fine and that I was responsible enough to look after my little brother and sister. Yeah, like that was true, but I didnt qant to get out of bed. She said trusted me and she ate breakfast at home. She called my dad, and he told her that he was somewhere (I dknt know where) and a few other things. I was relieved to hear his voice, and that gave me some energy to actually clean the house. After my mom left, I out the music at max volume and I cleaned out my room, the kitchen, living room and I also took a nice shower. I did all that so that when my dad got back, he would be happy I did all that without him having to tell me more than once. Well, he still wasnt back when my mom was. I was a little disappointed but I was still hopeful he would come back in a few more hours. We all went to my grandparents (some small family reunion) and we were there for like 2 hours, we ate and looked at some photos taken before even I was born. Everyone was laughing and I also wanted to, I even smiled a bit, but I just had this really bad guy feeling in my stomach I wanted to shake off. My mom was going out to look for my dad, with my uncle and grandpa, and I heard a few things about my dad, including he saw Freddy Krueger (wtf?). I stayed with my grandma and they came back a few minutes later. Well, I dont know what happened, but my dad wasnt there. Even when we were back home, he wasn't there. Finally, an hour ago, I gathered up all the courage to ask my mom where he was. Apparently, she want to go look for him where he said he was, but she couldn't find him. He is (or was) with someone and she didnt know when he'd be back. I have no friends to vent to. Well, I have two, but one of them doesnt seem to want to talk and the other one jsnt the type of friend you can vent to.

120,"In September of the last year, a guy sexually abused me while I was sleeping on the school bus. I am on therapy since then. I told a friend of mine about it because they are both med students, and he reported the guy and some authorities know about it but I need to file a letter to make it “official”.


I don’t know this guy, I didn’t even knew his name until I asked my friend about it. My friend told me that he knew he was like that with other girls. I have a female friend who is also a med student, and she is probably in some classes with him because they are in the same grade (I am a grade under). She doesn’t know about this because we don’t talk that much because we are in different careers and the school is so big, but lately I’ve been wondering if she knows something about this guy and his behavior or whether he has done something like this to her or her friends.

124,"A little birdie told me my brother (30) is wanting to transition and that he is worried about telling me (37). I would destroy entire planets for him if I had to. He knows that. But for some reason he fears telling me. He’s seen my social media posts/comments defending other transfolk online when people would attack them. So I’m not sure why he’s scared to tell me. We do everything together so perhaps he fears we will fade. He also told the birdie that if he and his wife split he would likely start dating me. They have a son together and apparently she’s in full support regarding him transitioning. 

Outside of birdie and me...NO ONE KNOWS. 
What can I do to help him be able to confide this to me without letting him know I already know. I’m not sure why his friend...the birdie...spoiled his secret. That’s not very friend like. But it may be because he’s been beating himself up about it and she just wanted his mind to ease. 

Throughout his life, he always credited me for helping him keep his head on straight. Encouraging and guiding him. So he has to know nothing would change and he can come to me about anything. I feel hurt that he’s hesitant. I always figured it would always be me he would tell anything to, then worry about others after. But it’s the opposite now. We are best buds but he told a lesser friend before me. I don’t care about that it’s just the reasoning behind it is what I care about. As if he fears I would attack him about it. 

Anyways, any ideas on what I could do to get the message to him that I’m in full support? Like...maybe find a social media post about a transgendered person and randomly start chatting about it and mention supportive things? This is urgent to me because I know he’s been down for awhile and I feel his ultimate support system in life (me) needs to be able to offer said support over the biggest thing that he’s going through....before it gets worse. 

I know some of you will say to just wait and let him approach me...but if he’s in fear about telling me...he might not until I can assure him I’ve got his back. Thanks, Reddit!",09Mar2020,1
126,"I’m going to try to give as much context as possible. I’m (21F) and graduated high school in 2016. The ex I’m talking about was one year ahead of me (he was a senior while I was a junior) and we dating from my junior year til the middle of my senior year when I broke up with him because I felt he was becoming way too insecure and the relationship was becoming stressful. He would question me randomly about people I went to school if I was sleeping or dating anyone else. We dealt with this first at the very beginning of the relationship and it subsided but the insecure behavior popped up again as soon as he left for college. I broke up with him around November 2015. 

I have had two serious relationships (I am in one of these two currently now as well) since then with other people and one of which he even used to tell me I shouldn’t be a part of because he knew the person since he went to the same high school with us. I don’t have any knowledge if he has had a relationship after us.

Since 2015 then we have tried and failed multiple times with trying to be friends because we try to be cordial &amp; everything on my end is okay and then he says we should date again, I say no and it’s a big disagreement that results in me blocking him (text messages). Whenever we would try talking again it was usually we saw each other out and he’d tell me something that’s going on in his life that I wanted to be supportive for. Usually always a family situation like someone coming home from jail or someone’s mental or physical health being affected drastically. Being someone that grew up in a household dealing with this since a child I knew that people in situations like that need a lot of support. 

So I wanted to be that. But again we’d be okay but then the conversation that we should date comes up and I just can’t date him again. 

Fast forward to now he recently he informed me on a social network he wasn’t blocked on that his grandmother passed away. This news is very sad to me because she was always a very nice, welcoming, and wise woman which I could see very clearly whenever I was around her. I knew she served as a rock for his family as well.

What I’m not sure about is what I should say besides my condolences, if anything or if I shouldn’t say anything at all. I feel like just saying I’m sorry for his loss isn’t enough. But I don’t want to say too much OR anything if that could just cause a repeat of that toxic history.

127,"To cut to the chase, my family lives in a trailer park in silicon valley. We are surrounded by the richest people imaginary but I am a veterinary techncian and my wife has a minimum wage job so we are very tight on cash.

The dichotomy between rich and poor extends to the school systems. Public schools in one district might be amazing, and just a few miles over, those schools might be dangerous.

The district we live in has those schools. Very poor ratings, lots of violence, etc. However, since my mother lives in an district with a great school, we used her address to enroll our daughter there as we cannot afford to move and could never afford to live in those areas.

My mother just told us she is moving to Oregon. We can't use that address anymore and our daughter who is going to be a junior and loves her school and classmates, is inconsolable. I am heartbroken for her. I know how hard it is to change schools especially when she's thriving at the one she is at.

128,"I just got out of my first relationship (5 years) and it’s been difficult navigating how I’ll find someone else I’ll like enough to want to date. When I was teen, I either had an actual crush on a guy (only had about 3 of them) or I could “potentially see me and [male friend] trying it out”.  But I don’t get crushes anymore as an adult.

My first boyfriend was my best friend before we dated and I had a minor crush on him that I was able to ignore/put on pause until he initiated our relationship. Our relationship ended because we may want different things out of life and we didn’t want to play the “maybe I’ll want X thing one day” game.

I’m starting to evaluate how I get feelings for people, and it’s difficult. With my ex, we had a lot of similar interests and I loved spending time with him. He was very much still my best friend even when we dated. But there are other people who I enjoy spending time with and consider good friends, but I don’t want to spend all my time with them or have the desire to hug them or cuddle. I had 2 minor “looking from afar” crushes in adulthood, but they quickly fizzled whenever I actually interacted with them.

I haven’t really met anyone outside of my ex that I’d be interested pursuing a relationship with, and I have no idea how I’m supposed to find someone new if I have such difficulty feeling connected with others.

132,"I am a 24F female who is still a virgin and has never been kissed. I have been a few dates but they never led to anything serious. Therefore, I decided to make 2020 the year I find a boyfriend so I started myself on a love quest by attending meet-up's that interest me in order to improve my social skills and to see who I can meet. I have also installed several dating apps on my phone to increase my chances of finding Mr.Right. I pretty much spent the whole day trying to feel out different guys to see if anything would stick. I had to block one guy who told me his dick was hard in the middle of a good conversation and a few minutes asked me if I would ""play with his dick"".

I then had to block another guy who asked me to send him a nude.

I then ghosted one guy who didn't seem like a bad person but he gave me weird vibes because he said ""kiss your cheek"" after I responded to the very first message he sent me, which was thanking him for complimenting my profile pic and telling him he had nice eyes. He then asked me if I was single and said that he was a sweet and affectionate guy and that he was interested in me and said, ""we can be together if you wish"". I told him that I prefer to get know someone a bit before that. He said ""good I just want to make sure that we were on the same page in 868ol5wanting a serious relationship."" We then talked a little bit our interests and I told him I like movies. He said. ""We can watch movies while we kiss and cuddle. Do you like to kiss and cuddle?"" I told I'm not against it but I never experienced it before. He questioned why and then asked me to send him more (non-nude) selfies because he loved my face. I dunno.....maybe I'm a cold and frigid bitch but being showered in that much affection in a 15-20 mins period of conversing kind of put me off so yeah, no thanks. 

Then there's another guy i""m currently talking too at the moment. He seems nice and respectful but I am not sure if the x-factor is there. I am torn if I want to forget about him because the idea of spending the next day or two focused on me and not worrying about boys is starting to sound really really nice. But at the same time, he gives off this sweetness thay kind of makes me smile and seems rare to find and I don't want to regret not giving him a chance sooner.

138,"So I work for the US Forest Service. I was working at a festival, running a booth for information about the local area. They have raffles and prizes. These prizes range from mountain bikes, wheels, a television, helmets and other items. All items were donated and all proceeds go towards the community

A partner of our agency had won many prizes. He has done well for himself and has all the top of the line items already. He didn't want them and wanted others to claim his winnings.

So this is the ethical dilemma...

My boss and I were by our partner and asked if we wanted to claim the items. One was a new wheel set and the other a television. 

My boss and I said yes and were blown away at his generosity. 

As we are loading everything up in our vehicles we realized this may be a gift given to an employee situation. 

We went back and said we are thankful and it seemed weird to take something like this. He didnt understand because he honestly likes us as people and for our positions and wants us to have the prizes. 

Should we or should we not take the prizes?

There is no 'you scratch my back and I scratch yours' we all work together to get the same things done. Nothing more and nothing less. 

We are all friends outside work and the partnerships. We are all community members. 

This was just a here you would put this to use and not me.

So again...would you?

139,"I have a windmill palm growing in my yard I planted about 3 years ago in 6b/7a in TN. It has done fine and only defoliated the first winter. It has stayed green since then. I mulch it and throw blankets over it in the coldest parts of winter. How tall will this palm end up growing? My only concern is there is a power line I didn't think of that is about 15 tall in the air beside it. It is a good few feet from it but still. I'd hate to start over with this palm after I've waited so long to get it established and grow. It says it usually grows 10 to 20 feet. However, would it not grow a little bit smaller here since technically it is rated a zone 7b or 8a palm? I'm thinking it might grow 10 feet at most, I sure hope so.

141,"I know this might be a question that is asked a lot, and I know that you might think I'm just irresponsible, but please hear me out.

We both live with our parents, so we don't have sex very often since we almost never have the chance. I used condom and pulled out, but she's not on birth control since her parents don't know that she has ever had sex. Now, she always got her period right on time, and today (sunday) she still has not gotten her period, which was supposed to come on friday. Since her last period, we only had sex once, I think it was on february 20? Around that date.

Now, there's two big problems, first, we are both only starting college, a baby is really not an option for either of us right now, it would ruin our lives. Second and the biggest problem, my girlfriend has a really bad health condition, she is taking strict medicine and was specifically told that she can't have a baby, and in the case that she had one, it would come out as amorphous or with horrible health issues. So really, we cant have a baby right now.

We are both really stressed right now, I know that we should first wait to check if her period is just running late, and we are, but I just need someone to tell me what should we do in the case that she is in fact pregnant. Honestly, her parents knowing that she is would also cause a massive problem, can you abort during this time? Abortive pills? What do you need in order to take them? I just need someone to guide us through this, I dont know what to do, we need help.

I'll be honest, he was a bit pushy to call and get to know me, but I didn't think much of it because we had compatible personalities. We immediately had some deep conversations (I have no idea how we got to that topic, but we ended up talking through the whole night) and discovered that our sense of humor is nearly identical, or so I thought. We ended up on calls with each other almost every day and it was great to talk to him. 

Anyways, the problem now is that he's confessed to me that he has feelings for me, which at first I was glad about because I've felt super lonely lately, but I told him I don't want to rush anything and that I don't want to lead him on if it was just infatuation. I was okay with where we were after that, but for some reason, I've recently become annoyed at him for no reason. His jokes are getting old, I don't enjoy our conversations that much, and I feel obligated to answer his calls. I don't really know how to navigate these emotions and I don't know how to bring how I'm feeling up to him. He's also told me that I am one of the only people he talks to, which honestly makes me feel a bit uncomfortable because I feel like he sort of rushed me into being a close friend if that makes sense? He has been basically treating me as a girlfriend and I'm not comfortable with that. I want to be considerate of his feelings when I explain this to him and I just don't know how to.

I was sexually abused as a child and did not receive any professional help, which led to some very poor coping mechanisms. When I started using the internet around 12 years old, I became involved with older men (20-40 y/o) online. I never met them, just texted, video chatted, and spoke on the phone. I was involved with each these men anywhere from several weeks to 1-2 years. The conversations eventually became sexual with each one. This went on somewhat regularly between the ages of 12-16. I am 21 now and thankfully much wiser. I was fairly savvy on the internet at that time and found the Facebook accounts, locations, workplace info and whatnot of a lot of these men. Some of them probably know similar info for me. I did not save screenshots of conversations or photos that were sent to me. I honestly have no proof of anything that happened other than my word. I feel so sick knowing that they could be doing similar things to other kids now and I might be able to do something about it. Some of them have kids of their own. I want to report this but I don't know what could be done without proof, especially after this long. I looked at the NCMEC Cyber Tip line but noticed it seems to rely heavily on having screenshots of chatlogs and whatnot. I would feel so much safer being anonymous if possible. I know this is a somewhat unusual situation but is there anything I can still do? Is this worth reporting without proof?

When I try to figure it out, I generally come to the conclusion that I’m simply droning on, and not getting out of life what I most desire. Every day feels like the same thing. This doesn’t help me very much, as I always go back to “I have everything I need, I shouldn’t feel this way.”

Idk how i brought my life to this. I used to be able to sit down and study but now i sit down on my phone and even without my phone i daydream or constantly think of everything else but the test even when i have extreme anxiety about the test. Do i have symptoms of ADHD? I can’t even get treated for the anxiety/depression i’ve been diagnosed with becuase my family doesn’t believe in these things. 
I need to not fail history also because i have a 81 in the class and i got a 11 on my IA which turns into a 68 in the grad book as my 20% nine week exam, he might decide to MAX curve it to a 72 which i doubt. if i don’t do well on this 5% of our grade exam i’m going to have a C in his class too. 
I know c’a aren’t terrible but i feel like a failure. I really let myself go. everyone else around me is thriving and i’m just here like bleh.  the only two things that find me solace: i know i can try harder next quarter this balance my semester which counts more to a B and second thing is i always end up ok in the end. it really doesn’t seem like i’m going to end up ok this time though. that’s what’s so scary.

We didn’t end on horrible terms but ended up exchanging apologies so there would be no “bad blood”. However, I still follow the two of them on social media and I’d really like to unfollow them because tbh I just hate being reminded of them! I’m not interested in keeping up to date with their lives bc they’re the type that’s obsessed with social media and posting their entire lives on it and I’ve decided to mute them for a bit but I still hate having to see “blank liked so and so’s picture”.

My problem, is that I know as their old best friend how much Instagram meant to them (insert eye roll) and they would interpret this as a huge attack. I’m almost positive they talk shit about me amongst each other anyways so what’s really point of pretending anyways? My fear is that: 
1) one of their birthday’s is this week and I’ve already planned on not reaching out so I know this will already make her extremely upset bc she feels like the entire world needs to stop and give her attention on her bday. 
2) one of them will try to confront me about unfollowing them and try to start an argument- I’ve thought about just blocking their numbers as well bc they have insane, irrational tempers 

Overall, I don’t want to appear that I’m trying to start a fight. I simply just want to move on with my life and not have to fear that I’ll get insulted for unfollowing them on social media. I’m not sure if I should put this off until sometimes after their birthday like maybe in April.

173,"The following is a rant and is just me calling for help, expect many grammatical errors

&amp;#x200B;

Synopsis of my character:

I am 14 years of age and think of myself as a smart person. I am a self-proclaimed introvert who wishes to go out of my comfort zone in order to achieve many great things. My hobbies are gaming and looking at memes. I am overweight but am trying to change and get back into shape.

&amp;#x200B;

My wish:

When I think of my future I think of me as a successful veterinarian who has a wife and possibly children. I wish to overcome my fears of criticism and to become emotionally strong enough to take advice into account, I want change.

&amp;#x200B;

Where I'm at:

Currently I am in the eighth grade and have felt like I have already set myself up for failure. I've been told in order to become a veterinarian I need to do many things such as volunteer at animal shelters and document those hours, maintain a high GPA and excel at mathematics and science, have experience with FFA programs, have experience with animals of all kinds (farm, household, exotic, etc). Currently I am thinking of volunteer at an animal shelter close by to my house. The issue that comes with that is because of my introvert nature. As a result of being a introvert I cannot express this to anyone around me (friends, family, etc.) As well as this, I am unable to have the confidence to ask my parents to drive me out to an animal shelter to ask for volunteer information.

My in-ability to meet goals:

I have promised my friends many things such as self-centered projects such as learning more about tabletop RPGs and being a DM and teaching them the rules and such but have yet to meet those promises and do not feel like I can. I have told myself time and time again to start a workout program with myself to get into shape yet I always feel like people will judge me for it. I make a commitment to read a book for my literature club yet find myself not reading it at all and letting my team down. I have problems with procrastination and self-criticism.

My health issues:

As previously described I am overweight (215lbs 5'7""). I have been informed by my doctor over and over again that I need to eat healthier and to work out more. I cannot find myself able to do these things for multiple reasons. I cannot find myself eating healthier because of how cheap and abundant junk food is and how good it tastes. When I promise myself to eat healthier my family goes out to eat and purchases soda and other sweets with no input from myself. Just today I exercised the first time all week, yet when I got home I ate a browny and ice cream. I cannot find myself working out more because alls I want to do is play games and look at memes.

&amp;#x200B;

Advice, PLEASE!

I really need some advice for my current situations. Am I over-exaggerating my entire scenario? Am I in need of immediate action? Please inform me of what I should do, I will be sleeping after posting this so I will not be reading comments until after 4:00 pm EST. 

Please don't try to learn personal information about me, I am just trying to get advice from you kings out there. Don't want any more stress in my life.

Thank you all in advance.",09Mar2020,1
174,"Word of advice, don’t get married until after you’ve managed to get through life by yourself. 
I was 24 when I got married after only dating my husband for two years. We’ve been together for 4... 
I was going to college when I married him and right before marriage we decided we’d “hold off” on my studying due to money being tight for us to move in together. I took up a full time job to help pay for bills. It’s now been two years, and the husband is working full time a very good job but I have not found a job since we moved to a new state. 

Today I was thinking about how in just a few weeks I’ll be 26 years old and jokingly told my husband “I’m closer to 30, that’s so bad” 
To which he replied: “I know, and you have nothing to show for it”... 

Not going to lie, this comment ripped through me. making me wish I had not given up my life to be with him. It sucks because he’s right. I was stupid to leave studying behind for marriage. 

So please, I know you’re young, naive, and in love.. But don’t let “love” sway you from your dreams! Don’t be an idiot like me!!!",09Mar2020,1
175,"17F, recent former virgin yet I’ve encountered a predicament in having sex. Yesterday &amp; Today I had the best sex I’ve ever had ( so far ) and it’s honestly unforgettable. The sex was so good that I literally feel like I like this guy and I’m falling for him. I know there won’t be a future between us because he’s in the military (DW, he’s 18 lol- he was born in 2001 and I was born in 2002) and I wasn’t even interested in him outside of friendship and sex before this. He’s going back to his home town at the end of this month and probably not coming back to this state at all or any time soon and we’re going to have regular sex until then. I’ve heard stories about this but like I never knew that the dick could be so good you get addicted. I want to enjoy myself and have fun- not stress over the fact that after he’s done screwing me he’s probably going to be having sex with who knows who. I just want it all to myself- the great dick, the kisses, and the after sex cuddling but that’s not realistic. I’m just really not sure what to do. Should I cut contact with him after the month is over? How do I stop thinking about how good his dick game was? I’m just scared sex is going to be ruined for me forever or for a while  or I won’t be able to enjoy it as much because of how absolutely good it was. 
He made me cum like- 6-7 times and he was pretty big, like, you’d think I’d be tired and I’d be satisfied for the next week or month but it’s just made me want more. We were going at it ( with breaks of course ) from ~7pm or 8pm - 12:09pm this morning 

TL;DR I got a phenomenal fucking but the guy is in the military and leaving at the end of the month- don’t know how to not get clingy/saddened by this because his dick game is too strong.",09Mar2020,1
176,"The sagittal bands of my middle, ring and pinky finger of my right hand have been torn for decades, but after a recent work accident I dislocated my fingers and was sent to the doctor on workman's comp. Prior to this freak accident, I've never had an issue with the torn bands, just the click noise of it slipping and a jerk through a short portion of my finger's range of motion when it slip back into place. Post accident, it hurt when the tendon dislocated, but my knuckles were all swollen and painful in general. It's been almost a week and it no longer hurts, but the ortho is telling me i need to have surgery now because workman's comp will cover it. This isn't even the injury I went for, it's a pre-existing injury that was temporarily aggravated by a new injury. I'm worried that since it has been like this for 20+ years the surgery is pointless, with the possibility the bands having been withered or something beyond repair, and opens me up to potential risks  like complications, lost wages, and missed employment opportunities (I'm trying to find a new job because this one wasn't working out and the only guy lower on the totem pole than me was just released) while I recover. Not to mention all the time I'd lose from the gym. Also, I feel like it's a moral grey area or possibly even illegal to use workman's comp to repair an old injury, even if it's somewhat relevant to the new one.

177,"It's a long story, I'll cut it short. 

Theres this girl and we arent together because of long distance,  but we are clearly into each other. She cried alot before I left, and she has been kinda distancing herself by saying g shes busy etc, even though I feel like she does try at times. 

I'm the opposite,  I'm all in, always have been. 

My issue, is this feeling I get when I see her pic etc. For example she posted a story I clicked on it, and it was her. I felt my heart drop. 

The reasons I might be feeling this way are :
- still having strong feelings for her
- jealous lunatic who doesnt want anyone else to see her
- overthinking that she might be with someone 
- not sure what the cause it at all. 

As you can see, I'm all over the place in trying to understand why I get this feeling when I see her etc, I get very sad and kinda ruins my day. It does get me extremely anxious,  not sure why. 

I need someone to try assessing or troubleshooting what I might be going through. No need to go to a therapist , I just want to talk it out here and see what people think of this situation so I can understand myself abit more.

178,"So I need a bit of background to really explain the situation.  Me and my best friend are fairly young and I've known her since kindergarten.  Our school was extremely small so we hung out all the time and grew really close.  In 2017 her dad was diagnosed with stomach cancer.  He's been having chemotherapy and other treatments to try and win the battle.  I've always tried to be there for her whenever she needs me, be it about her dad or her family or something else.  This year we started at a new school and we've just drifted a bit.  I love her so much but she doesn't feel as connected to me anymore, I can just feel it.  She found new friends.  I don't mean as much to her but she means the world to me.  A couple days ago we found out that her dad's cancer has spread and he has 30- 60 days left to live.  He'll be gone before the school year is over.  She has three younger siblings (an 8 year old brother, a 9 year old brother, and a four year old sister) and I think she being the oldest is the only one of her siblings that knows.  I can't even imagine what they're going through.  If I wanted to I could move on and forget about it, but she can't.  All I want is to be there for her, but I'm not sure if she wants me there.  And I won't even be going to the same school as her next year, when she would've needed me the most.  I just don't know what to do.",09Mar2020,1
179,"So i'm going for an interview this Wednesday for a government nursing scholarship that's the most prestigeous in my country. The scholarship has a bond of 4 years, but it also gives me an assured place in postgraduate diploma studies (specifically, an advanced diploma in a nursing specialisation -&gt; so I will be given the fast track to be a specialist nurse and it's highly likely that I will go into geriatrics/community nursing/mental health nursing.)

Details aside, it has always been my passion to be a doctor, and not a nurse. I ended up in a nursing degree in university because my grades were not good enough to make it to Medicine. However, alongside my nursing degree, i'm currently in a Pre-med class in one of my local medical schools, which gives me about 30-60% chance of getting into a postgraduate medical course which would allow me to become an MD. I am studying for MCAT while doing my nursing degree as I intend to make a career switch after 3 years of nursing school and go into postgrad med immediately upon graduation (in the best case scenario).

My question is, should I tell them in the interview that I am actually keen on doing postgraduate medicine? or should I 'sell myself' as a 100% committed nurse so that they will offer me the scholarship? I have spent weeks thinking of this and so far, I have only decided that:

- if I were to be offered the nursing scholarship, I will reject it because I do not want the bond duration to push back my medical studies by at least 5 years

- in the best case scenario, if my MCAT is good enough to grant me a place in med school, I will graduate early from nursing school after completing 3 years, skipping honours year and going into med school asap, since I hope to finish my studies as soon as possible due to finances being extremely tight.

tl;dr not sure whether to 'sell myself' to interviewers that i am the best candidate for their scholarship, when I am planning for a career switch, or should i tell them honestly that i am keen on a career switch while considering their scholarship?",09Mar2020,1

185,"I was an exceptional student, I did very well at high school and even interviewed at Oxford University for Law. I was rejected due to a technicality but still went onto study at a great university in the UK. 

Once at said university, I was sexually assaulted which resulted in me developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). For a number of years I struggled to leave the house and engage as as a usual student would with learning opportunities. I found it hard to leave my house to shop for amenities, let alone to study for my degree.

I am now completing my studies from home on an exams-only basis. However, given the strenuous nature of my degree it has become increasingly hard without academic assistance. I am still able to access lectures but have not been able to use seminars/tutorials as a chance to ask specialised academics questions regarding my course. My exams are in 2.5 months and I am reaching a point where I am contemplating suicide. My university has advised me that as I am finalising my studies on an 'exams-only' basis I have not paid for tuition, thus cannot ask questions of my tutors until the last minute. 

Had I been financially better off, I might have still been able to afford to remain living within campus and would subsequently have been able to attend the office hours provided by my tutors due to the fact I could have continued my studies in person. Now, my only choice is to teach myself a course at a university regarded as consisting of the top 30 worldwide- even though I had never had the opportunity to attend teachings where I was able to make substantive queries. I have two units to complete, one of which I could have attended seminars for but could not on the basis of being ill. The other was a course that did not run whilst I was physically at university meaning I could have never received any academic support.

The only option besides completing my law degree to me seems like suicide. I have always aspired to be a solicitor or barrister and have dedicated the past decade of my life to this. I don't think I can go on knowing that this aspiration has been spoiled by an abuser. I cannot let him win. Please can somebody help me. A life without a 2:1 degree is nothing, and I stupidly took a number of exams whilst suffering from PTSD.",09Mar2020,1

193,"This in in the UK

Hi everyone, massive apologies, this is going to be a long one and may be a bit disjointed, but I’m just trying to piece everything together whilst feeling very helpless in what I can do. I’ll get straight into it.

My sister and her husband have been married for around 10 years, have two sons and own a house together. In this time he has physically cheated on her with 3 women that she knows of for sure (could have been more and may have covered his tracks) He has also on countless occasions been found to be talking, sexually, with women online. Most worryingly on one occasion my sister found he had been speaking with an underage girl and had received photos from her. Judging by the messages upon learning she was underage he simply said something along the lines of “you’re very young, I could get in trouble”.

Their youngest son suffers from severe anxiety and other emotional issues, resulting in him not sleeping alone and not wanting to go to school. They have a therapist come to the house to help with his issues but otherwise my sister pretty much has to deal with this by herself. This kid is 10 years old by the way. This is where the husbands reasoning for cheating stems from - he says he cheats because she doesn’t spend much time in bed with him.

The older son has reached out to me in the past looking for advice on how to confront his dad about how much he drinks because it upsets him that he’d rather drink than interact with his son. He was 14 when he reached out to me.

Cut to around 3 months ago and my sister, through the pressure of her husband has made an effort to be more intimate for a little while. Everything seemed to be getting back on track. Then she finds out for the last 3 months he’s been sleeping with yet another woman. This time he says he wants to end the relationship and wants her out of the house in 3 months. (I know he can’t legally force her out because they jointly own it)

He is now filling the kids heads with lies about how its their moms fault the family is splitting up and that she is the reason for every issue past and present. Along with this he has been openly starting a relationship with the woman he cheated on my sister with and has stooped as low as making comments on the phone about my sister to this woman, in front of my sister. For example the other day, she walked past and went upstairs and he very loudly said “the bitch is going upstairs now” purposefully loud enough for my sister to hear. Not only that but the woman has now even messaged my sister on social media to tell her she’s a bad person!

In the past there have been physical altercations, as far as I know nothing too bad (but my sister has kept stuff from me in the past out of the worry I may do something to her husband). He has also shown controlling tendencies and anger issues in the past. I could go into detail but i’m trying to keep this as short as possible but am willing to share should there be a need. 

My sister has been to Citizens Advice but they said that because they own a house she won’t get any help from the council in finding a place for herself (she works a very low paid, part time job due to looking after the kids so was looking into council housing). He has refused to sell the house as he believes it should go to the kids.  

As far as I can tell a lot of what he is doing is classed as mental abuse, right?

He had told our entire group of friends that he was depressed for at least 2 years now (self diagnosed), and in multiple occasions he texts our group chat saying that he’s feeling sad right now or feeling really down and he would pity himself in it as well. The problem is, we all want to help him but he says to just leave him alone and that he can pull through it himself. The way that I see it is, if you are feeling really depressed, haven’t seen a professional, and it’s been more than a year if you trying to recover on your own, it would be best for yourself to seek any kind of treatment/help, even if it’s from your friends. His parents don’t know about this, and his behavior is also getting weirder.

I’ve talked to everyone in the group, and we’re all tired of hearing the same thing, offering help, and the help being declined. He also has issues letting things go, such as his relationship with his ex girlfriend, who is in our group. He is extremely overprotective of her and was clingy until they broke up. His ex tells me she could never do something alone with us, he would always have to tag along. Even so, he wouldn’t share his problems with his ex girlfriend when they were still together, so his life was secluded from her and he knew every aspect of her life instead. Another thing he hasn’t let go of is his crush for my girlfriend. At this point, his behavior is getting ridiculous around my girlfriend. We’ve asked him to stop clinging to my girlfriend and to stop casually flirting with her and taking her stuff, he still does it anyway. The only way my girlfriend can get her stuff back is if she comes and gets it from him, not me, or anyone else in the group. It HAS to be her.

217,"Struggling

Let’s start this with a bit of background. I graduated High School last year, I did pretty well. Not overwhelmingly amazing, but I did get an unconditional offer to my first choice university.

This is where it gets a little messy, I’ll try to explain it as best I can.
I left home during my senior year and came to live with my friends parents. My friend is smarter than me, period. She did better in school.

Her parents were worried that I wouldn’t get into university so instead of applying for uni in 2019 like I wanted to they pushed me to do a year long graphic design course at the local college. This was before I had my uni results as I then applied in 2020 and got an unconditional offer based on my existing grades.

I’m about halfway through the graphics course and I’m miserable. I feel like I’ve been held back a year for no good reason when I had the grades to leave the year prior like all my friends.
I know, you’re probably thinking why didn’t I fight them on it? Truthfully I was kinda worried. I’d just left home and they’d taken me in, I didn’t feel like I would have much ground to disobey.

I’m taking a writing course in university so obviously this graphic design one isn’t really relevant. I don’t hate all aspects of it, I get along well with my tutors but the majority of it I’m struggling with. Everyone else in my class went to the same high school so they all know each other, where as I’m the only outsider and i haven’t really been able to make friends.

So my main questions are,

1. If I spoke to my university and ensured there would be no repercussions would it be reasonable to drop out? I could use this year for something more beneficial to me, for example my foster father is a professional proof reader and has displayed an interest in me helping his workload. Surely that would be more beneficial? Or simply going out and finding a job? 

2. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?

3. If it were you, how would you explain this to your parents? I desperately don’t want to disappoint them but I’m so worried and anxious about this work because it isn’t a passion or even a hobby of mine. I don’t have the photoshop software at home so I can’t even catch up independently and the Mac-book rooms are only accessible if a teacher is in there.

Backstory: 
My (17,F) best friends boyfriend told me that he wanted to touch and see my boobs. I, of course, told him to fuck off. He proceeded to show me his penis. 
I was at my best friends' house, she was asleep in the next room over and I had no way to escape the situation. 
He was scared that I tell her what he did so he tried to get rid of me by pretending that I stole money from her mother (I mean wtf???)
I told her what he did and that I am afraid of him as I don't know what else he is capable of. She seemed unbothered by everything and I was devastated. 
We got into a heated argument and I told her that she has to choose between me and him and that I would end our friendship on the spot if she chooses to stay with him. (He practically lives at her house and he is always(!) there when I am there, too. And I don't want and can't stay in the same room as this person anymore. I didn't see another way as to end the friendship)
She chose him, I went home and didn't talk to her since.

I told my mum, because she noticed that I was devastated and she said that I am an asshole for making her decide between her boyfriend and me.

222,"I live with 4 roommates and I knew one of them before moving in. I would consider him a very close friend. He was there a few times when I really needed someone to talk to.  So a little background before hand. This was the first year I actually lived with him and throughout last semester and this semester, I now realize that I have been taking my anger out on him. I personally like to keep the apartment really clean, so I get on his ass about cleaning. In the beginning of the year, I would nicely ask him to clean up after cooking, or clean the dishes within 24 hours and throw out your trash. But after the cycle repeated over and over, I guess it started to build a bit of anger in me. Then I would yell at him saying like ""dude clean the fucking sink!"" or ""can't you see how dirty this is? Do you need your eyes checked?"". Fast forwards to this morning, I was not too happy with him since I just cleaned up Saturday morning just to find that the living room was a mess again. So I was cleaning up while watching the Joanna vs Zhuang fight. Then he spoiled the ending and laughed in my face that I spoiled it for him. I got really pissed off and punched him in the arm really hard. Then he punched me back and I thought it was over. He even joked with me a little bit after that, but I think he was holding something in. So later that day I come back from a hike to see that he ate all my bacon instead of using his and on top of that the sink was a mess and the kitchen was riddled with bacon oil. It wasn't like he was busy so I was pissed off and ranted off like usual. I guess this was the stick that broke the camel's back. He went into my roommates room fuming, didn't say a word and was just extremely tense (flexing all his muscles and clearly irritated). He came up to me and said lets go outside and scrap. I was pretty shocked and I didn't handle it right. I laughed and said sure lets go, but my roommates realizing how serious this was came out to stop it. After realizing the magnitude of this situation, I tried everything to get him to talk about it and avoid fighting. After spending 30 minutes trying to resolve it by talking he wouldn't budge so my roommate suggested we separate for a while. I told him I loved him and I apologized and left. After I left he talked to one of the roommates and I got the scoop and realized that I have been taking my anger out on him (anger comes from me having to clean up after him on a daily basis) for a while. I wish he could've said something earlier instead of letting this boil to this point. But all I want to do is just have a conversation with him, but he doesn't seem like he wants to talk to me just wants to fight me. I don't know whether to ignore him or try to talk to him. I hope someone can give me advice on what to do.

TLDR: I have been yelling at my roommate for not cleaning almost every week. It reached a critical point and now he just wants to fight me. He believes I am taking my anger out on him. I know I am in the wrong and I apologized countless times, but all I want to do is have a conversation with him. He won't budge, just wants to fight me.",09Mar2020,1

224,"I know there must be a million posts about this, but I feel like every situation is different, and every guy shows how he likes someone differently.

We’re in college and have known each other for a little over a year. Im a female and met him through a mutual friend. At first we didn’t talk much and I wasn’t super attracted to him, just thought he was cute.

Our mutual friend often hosted hang outs so we would see each other a lot but didn’t have a lot of one on one interactions together. 

So things were kind of awkward between us at first bc we didn’t know each other that well yet. But soon we found we were taking the same class just at different times, and talked about doing the homework together. 

He never initiated it and probably would’ve forgotten had I not texted him one day like “do you wanna work on the homework together?” He said yes happily and said he was studying in the library with several of our other mutual friends if I wanted to join him. My roommate told me that was a sign he saw me as a friend at this point.

I still went and we did the homework together. And I think we did it a few other times too. It was super awkward at first but somehow we ended up becoming better friends. I don’t even really remember how it happened it just kind of happened.

So at this point when we’re in a friend gathering we tend to gravitate towards each other and talk. Our conversations were always great too, like never as awkward as before, we got along great, and would laugh so much and make so many jokes. 

My feelings for him never fully disappeared, although they would kind of plateau every now and then. 

One time we ended up going to a school concert together— he wanted to go with someone but didn’t know who, and I was considering going but didn’t know who to go with. So he texted me and asked if I wanted to go with him to the concert since he didn’t know anyone else going... I said yes ofc but was wondering if someone else was there would he still have invited me??

The day of the concert I’m wearing my usual leggings and T shirt (i had never been to a concert before and didn’t know people tended to dress up nice for it), then when I meet up with him I find he’s wearing a nice T shirt and he gelled his hair extra nice. 

At first I thought it was bc he knew the rule about dressing up for a concert and I just didn’t, but now looking back on it, maybe he dressed up for me?? Maybe?? 

Fast forward to present day, we are still good friends like before and have great conversations and get along great. I’m noticing now some of these things:
- He (I think) tends to lean closer than he did before when I’m talking/when he can’t hear what I’m saying 
- He asked me once who i danced with during a ballroom lesson (we do ballroom but he does it more than me) but again this was just once
- When i mentioned I was on a Skype call once with an old guy friend I said I was so nervous that I couldn’t stop laughing. What I meant was that I just feel nervous during video calls, but he asked me “were you nervous because of him or because of the Skype call?”
- I feel a magnetic need to look at him, face him, talk to him, when we’re in a group outing together. I can’t tell how often he feels it, or if he feels it at all, but sometimes I catch him trying to make eye contact with me. I’m not sure if this is in a way of “hey friend let’s talk” or “I like you and want to talk to you more”
- Sometimes in a group outing if we don’t talk a ton it feels weird (for me at least) and if I just ignore it and go about talking to other people he somehow manages to come and talk to me at some point. But then this somehow tapers off into us talking with different people
- We sat down for lunch the other day together bc it was the last day of finals and we were both done. We talked for like 2 hours, and probably could have talked longer but we had a meetup scheduled with mutual friends that we had to make it to
- He seems to forget the small things that I think would be cute if he remembered (like when we last talked, even if it was only a little bit, or that he told me he was going to a frat party for the first time) but seems to remember the random stuff I don’t find important and forget (like when I mostly finished a story about a student who cheated in a class I TA’d for and the next day we met he asked me to finish it when I’d already forgotten about it)
- He has smoked pot before and when I asked him how it went he said he wished he did it with people he knew well and “could be loose around,” then as if he suddenly just thought of it, he said, “like you” (that made me feel honored)
- He seems to be the first (or at least one of the first) people who usually notice if I’m tired/falling asleep and asks if I’m ok
- He was happy when he learned we’d be in the same town over the summer (doing internships in same area) bc he’d have someone to hang out with over break and maybe practice ballroom dance with
- When he found out I wouldn’t be able to do my arts final project this year bc of some rule I didn’t know from the catalog, (I’ve been working really hard to get it done this year) he immediately showed me pictures of cute cats to try and make me feel better

I should mention I think he’s either bisexual or gay, but I’m pretty sure he’s bisexual because one time we were all playing Smash bros and we were joking if the characters in the game were his “ideal man” or “ideal woman.”

My crush also rooms with a girl who identifies as lesbian.

He seems to have developed at least a good friendship with a guy I used to ballroom dance with (I’m not attracted to this other guy in any way). They hang out a lot and this other guy seems to openly flirt with my crush a lot?? Like he starts dancing with my crush at random points (but my old ballroom partner seems to be eyeing me out of his peripheral vision?) I’m not sure. I just know my crush seems to be more in contact with my ballroom dance partner sometimes. For example they’re taking a train along with my crush’s roommate back to their respective homes for school break. 

I also do theater and my crush has never come to see any of my shows (besides the first two shows, I’ve done a total of 6 shows in college so far, 4 of which I’ve acted in). Our other mutual friends usually come, but again besides the first two shows I’ve never seen him come. (maybe he’s just not interested in this stuff and it’s not just me..??)

I have a tendency to overthink and personalize a lot of things, so I’m probably doing some of these right now, but I just want to know which parts I’m overthinking, and if it’s really still worth pursuing him. 

I have not really flirted with him in any way besides being a really good friend. This is bc I’m too scared to show in any way that I like him. (For the record, I’ve never told any of my past crushes about my feelings)

Also we have not really opened up about personal issues that much yet but we again, we get along really well.

230,"Well, subtely ignorant.  I don't think they truly mean harm, they're just misinformed and ignorant that's it.  I won't get into much details but we are a lit circle group, so we're discussing theories such as Marxism, reader response, and feminist theory.  This book is called ""A Thousand Splendid Suns"" so I think you can guess where this ignorance stems from.  I'm the only brown girl in our group of 4 other white girls.  

They seriously don't mean any harm.  I literally only chose that book because I felt like I had to so I could try and clear misconceptions because I KNEW there would be some incorrect things said about the main religion and culture depicted in that novel.  Now I'm regretting it.

Once again, they're not being racist towards me.  They're just ignorant, that's all.

My question is, how do I separate these feelings from me?  I want to enjoy discussing the book with them, but they keep saying incorrect things about the religion displayed in the book because it's really not a book to learn about religion from, it depicts how the patriarchal culture takes certain points of the religion and twists them to favour men.  

I don't really know what to do.

During a chat we had after our discussion was finished, we were talking about our future (since we're seniors) and a girl said ""my family said I should go into law.  I love debating.  But what I dont like is when the other person gets mad and starts shouting like, wait I'm not attacking you I promise, I'm not attacking you"" and I felt like this was pointed towards me.  Also anytime religion is mentioned or she says the word ""taliban"" she always looks at me (I've noticed) or kinda says it in a way to ask if what she said was right.  Bro why me.

236,"Hi all!

&amp;#x200B;

I've been running into some problems with the two roommates I share an apt with (all 24, F) and truly at a loss for what to do.  

&amp;#x200B;

When we moved in I had tons of kitchen supplies and I had been letting them use my stuff freely until about a few weeks ago.  I had been running into issues where my stuff would be used but not cleaned, left covered in food for days on end (or until I finally broke down and cleaned it), but neither of my roommates would claim responsibility for it.  We tried a system where we would rotate days for doing dishes and cleaning but one wouldn't do the cleaning at all on her days because she ""didn't want to.""  

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago I got fed up and moved all my stuff to a few shelves and told them it was off limits, but if they wanted to borrow something they could ask and I would expect it cleaned right away, which made them extremely angry.  I've been coming home the past few days and finding my stuff dirty in the sink again, but I don't know how to deal with this anymore.  I'm afraid of escalating out of fear of reciprocation from one of my roommates (who tends to be very aggressive) and I'm tied into this lease until October.  HELP SOS

237,"This is a pretty serious post. I know exactly what it’s like to feel compassion, sympathy, empathy, etc. but only for people other than my parents. For some reason, I don’t care how my parents feel. This has led to many fights over the years, and I know that it hurts them when we have these fights, but I can’t seem to care. I don’t know for sure but I might not “love” my parents. I also dislike showing affection or being emotional around them.
I just want to be a good person and I want my parents to be happy. They’re truly good people. But I’m not considerate, grateful or respectful around them. This isn’t just a phase either. I fully understand when they feel sad, when my actions affect them, but I just... I don’t feel bad in the moment, and barely feel bad later.
Please, can anyone tell me, is there a way that I can change this or is this just how I’m wired? I want this family to be happy and I’m the one causing the pain but I don’t know how to stop. Really sorry about the wall of text but I’m kind of stressed that I have some severe mental illness that stops me from feeling love towards the people who I should be closest to in life.",09Mar2020,1
239,"I've found that task/micro jobs (the stuff on r/BeerMoney) don't cut it, either because they have small earnings caps or they waste time, like surveys I'd take for 10min+ only to end up ""not qualifying"" for, so no payment. I also can't commit to a regular, part-time job since I'll be doing this work at my current, full-time job simultaneously.

Explanation of current job: I mostly answer phones, emails, and do a few things specific to our business, pretty much a customer service position. However, without going into too much detail, I work at a nightclub....I know, it's an odd position for a nightclub. But since this isn't a giant company with a service/product that constantly has customers calling or emailing, it means I have a lot of free time and I can do whatever I want (seriously, I constantly watch Netflix/Hulu and have even played video games) as long as I can drop whatever I'm doing immediately to answer the phone or take care of an emergency.

As I said, I've tried a lot of micro jobs and it just doesn't cut it. I'm looking for something that can make me $15-20 in less than 4hrs preferably (I work 8hr shifts and my actual amount of work I do throughout the day takes up less than 4hrs, but I want to be sure I can do this and my current job at the same time). The surveys and transcribing e.t.c.... usually pans out to less than $5/day. But at the same time I'm not sure I could be hired by someone who pays more because I couldn't fully commit to being their employee unless they're ok with me stopping work to answer calls e.t.c.... at my full-time job.

Any suggestions?

Before anyone gets *too* jealous, my pay is minimum wage and there isn't much opportunity for upwards growth here. I barely make enough for my bills, which is why I'm looking for a little extra without having to get a 2nd job that I have to actually *go to in person.* My free time outside of work is limited enough.

I posted this on r/WorkOnline and they removed it. And this post is obviously not for r/BeerMoney because I went there to find those jobs I mentioned that haven't worked out for me.",09Mar2020,1
240,"I’d rather have social anxiety than this bullshit.
I’d much rather trade my anxiety of confrontation for social or any type of anxiety.

By root cause of anxiety is that I fear I’ll run into a stranger who’ll want to start a problem with me. 
I can’t go to the gym to workout and improve my mental and physical health, I can’t go to the grocery store, or to pick up my younger siblings or anything else. I just can’t go outside on my own. 

People seem like they’re willing to start problems with complete strangers these days and that’s why I’m scared. If I go to the gym what If a guy gets mad at me for using a machine too long? Or gets upset because I took the machine before he did and he waited a while?

I have low self esteem, no confidence in myself and anger issues.
Which adds to the problem. I don’t have anyone to talk to about it. I already told my therapist and psychiatrist and they aren’t very helpful. 

Even my 10 year old little sister doesn’t have any issues going outside but I do, a 17 year old guy. It’s not even dangerous where I live. There are fights at night but only in bars and someone did killed around here but because they were in a Gang and had a problem with someone and this was a long time ago. But that’s about it.

We’re doing long distance due to the fact that we started dating the last couple months of high school and now we’re both in college. Long distance was okay at first but now it just feels like a chore to call him and text him. I’ve also noticed my eyes straying to other men on campus which I feel so guilty about. I don’t even mean to look. He has a really demanding major (pharmacy) so he’s hardly ever free due to the excessive amount of homework he is given and I only get to see him about 1 day a month. On that 1 day it’s probably only 3 hours of us together because again, homework and studying. I’m afraid I’m being selfish by asking him to even see me because of the amount of homework. I keep telling him that if I interfere with his studies (at all) then we should end things, as school is far more important than me. I’m his first girlfriend (as well as his first everything) and I just don’t want to hurt him. I can’t make up my mind on whether I should break up with him or hold on a little longer to see if we get out of this dry patch. I’ve been felling like this for over a week now, which isn’t long enough for me to even make a decision and I’m just looking for some different perspectives.

245,"I apologize in advance for a wall of text, but I feel like I've hit a roadblock in my life and I need outside help.

A bit of background info: I have Asperger's, Bipolar Disorder, and Social Anxiety (18F). I was transferred to an alternative school when I was 7 due to traditional school treating me like I was retarded and incapable of education, despite always being verbal and clearly getting assignments done correctly. Throughout 4th through 6th grade there, it was wonderful. But when I hit middle school, it all took a deep dive. I was sexually harassed and assaulted by multiple kids, was physically and mentally abused, tortured, everything. The teachers constantly gaslighted me, would also take part in torturing me, and were convinced that I was constantly lying. I was sent the hospital for a serious injury caused by another student, yet they still believed that I provoked it. Physician got changed by this point, and the new was trying  to convince my whole family that I was schizophrenic and not autistic, even down to having an evaluator depriving me of sleep, hitting me, tugging my hair, screaming at me, and repeatedly touching my breasts to achieve the desired effect of a ""mentally irrational person"" during a psych eval.

It's now almost 5 years since then, and I'm currently in therapy for all of the abuse. The minute my family was aware of what happened to me during the evaluation and my time attending there, I was no longer just getting support for my depression and fear of going to school, but for the actual abuse and torture I suffered. My family had no grasp on just how much had actually gone on until they had seen my IEP and the outright blatant statements that admit her guilt in fabricating all of this. But I feel stuck. I'm getting legal help with suing the physician with the help of my mom, and my therapist is genuinely helpful in me trying to talk everything out, as we determined that me talking about it actually helps. But lately I'm just depressed. I know I'm lonely, but I'm so scared of trusting anyone new and trying to make new friends. I'm scared of the world around me much more than I used to be. I can't get their faces out of my head sometimes. Every time I meet a new person, all I see is my abusers faces. I see someone who will lure me into a false sense of security before beating me until I'm bloody. Deep down I know that the world isn't this bleak, but I can't break this fear, and it takes me forever to make a new friend or have fun because of it. No amount of talking about it seems to break the mindset, and being as extremely small framed as I am only makes me feel more vulnerable. I don't know what to do about this, I just know that it isn't healthy",09Mar2020,1
246,"So I have this ""friend"" I met online (Long story, Short:  We meet in person, lost my V Card to her, she left but came back to the state) And every time I think of her / see her, I blush really hard and think about kissing her.

So today I went to her house. We saw movies, played games and relaxed on the couch together (Nothing explicit) . Later on, her friends came over along to rehearse for some play. So, me ALREADY being there I introduced myself and connect with them a bit. But seeing as how I was the only non "" actor"", I basically just sat on the couch, watching her and her friends having laughs and having a fun time. When they were rehearsing, I tried to give my option to help out with their play (Again I'm not into theaters but thought of just helping out.) and she KINDA shunned my advice cause ""They know what their doing. But thanks."" Ok, no harm, no foul.

Later on they were talking about sex and etc. And it just got really uncomfortable since she was my first and I don't know if it would had been a good idea to admit it if they ask me how I lost it. Cause of that I just made an excuse to just go home since they were all talking about people they know and were doing stuff together while I was just sitting on the couch looking and barely participating in the group.

Cause of this (And remembering that she wouldn't date me cause I'm too young) I think it's best to just stop having these feelings for her. But the problem is, I JUST CAN'T! (Maybe it's because she was my first and the only girl I feel like I can connect to in a way.)

So basically, what I am trying to say is, how do I STOP thinking about her that way!? As in, I don't care if she dates somebody or anything. Cause honestly, I'm just sad and depressed at this point knowing I won't ever date her. ;/",09Mar2020,1

Most people get scholarships so that they don't have to pay for tuition fees or so that when they go on exchange, they are receiving money from their scholarship providers for their exchange. 

I'm already past that point. If anything a scholarship is just gonna help me pay around 2 more semesters of tuition, and maybe give me a little cash while stuyding and also some money for a laptop (but I bought a new one a year ago).

I'm really trying to decide if it's worth taking up a scholarship in my fourth and possibly last hear of university :\ 

This scholarship also has a bond that will be prorated depending on how many years of education I've been sponsored so I doubt it'd be too long in my case. But either way, the economy's bad and it's hard to find a job so I wouldn't mind a guaranteed spot for at least a year or something post graduation haha

Even when it was earlier in the relationship, he would say how he can see himself marrying me, being the mother of his children, etc. I love him and can see him being a good husband and father as well.

But for no particular reason I can think of, I have doubt on whether he is the one I want to marry and spend the rest of my life with. I've tried to think of specific reasons, but nothing significant comes to mind.

He's dated before and had bad relationships, so he tells me his history helps me appreciate being in a good one with me. I've never dated before him (he was even my first kiss) so maybe this is preventing me from fully appreciating him?

I'm scared that this feeling of doubt won't go away and I'll be wasting his time if it doesn't, so my question is, for those of you that have found your soul mate, did you just ""know"" it after dating awhile or were there lots of doubts during the process.",09Mar2020,1

The problem is, I’m my Dad’s ADHD child and it’s so hard for me to listen to her venting about my dad because I see both sides of the issue.

I flinch at the smallest movements people make

I hate physical affection 

Every time someone touches me all my muscles get really tense

For example I had a sleepover with a friend and her leg accidentally touched mine and I froze all muscles were so tense and I just felt so trapped. 
My friends will hug me and I just freeze just hoping for it to be over soon. 

Every time someone hugs me or touches me I feel really disgusting and it makes me want to take a bath 


I feel it may because my parents never gave me emotional support to me. I never feel like I developed an emotional connection with them. They don’t want to talk to me or anything. My dad tries to hug me very rarely like maybe at the most once very two months.

My mom also blames for a lot of stuff all the time. For example she told me I was the reason she took Xanax and I asked her why she was blaming me and she said that she wasn’t blaming me. My dad works a lot and doesn’t have a lot of time so I am so scared that I am a burden to him. I have celiac so  I can’t  eat gluten and I just eat cereal everyday so I don’t cost him money. I’ll ask my mom and she’ll say that I am being picky for not wanting to eat straight Swiss cheese for dinner. 

And every time I get into a small disagreement or they say something kind of mean I cope very unhealthy (sh)

Bottom line: 

I don’t have an initial event that caused me to be so uncomfortable with touch that I know of except for my parents the only attention I got was negative 

If anyone knows why I tense up and hate touch especially physical affection that would be very appreciated

276,"Alright y'all I'm kind of freaking the fuck out right now because I take an antidepressant and an anti-anxiety medication. I have enough supply of the latter to last me like 6 months because it's a PRN. But my anti-depressant (Wellbutrin) is a 30 day supply. I am going to be between jobs this Friday. My insurance through my current company will end the last day of March. My new company's insurance won't kick in for 60 days. So I will have no insurance for those 2 months. I pay about $7 for both of those medications in a month and have since I started taking them 2 years ago. I have never been uninsured in my life, which is a blessing I had NO idea I have had.

Moral of the story: the 30 quantity dose I take of Wellbutrin without insurance is $1,544.

279,"Obligatory *this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons

Couldn't think of a great title but here goes. I (f) used to make out with two male family friends as a kid. They're brothers, one older and one younger than me. I'll call the older one A and the younger one B. Our families are really close and we would spend a lot of time together as kids. They would have kissing competitions where I would choose a winner and sometimes they would have me compare their penises. A and I would sneak off all the time during trips to make out.

As we got older this stuff all happened less and less until it stopped completely. A became distant as we got older so I became a lot closer to B over the years. Now, A is married to a girl who is super similar to me and B is dating someone similar to me. I don't know if I'm reading too much into that but the similarities are eerie. 

Anyway, I've definitely developed strong feelings for B even though we don't see each other very often anymore. I saw them this weekend and it just brought everything back. The thing is, none of us have ever talked about what we used to do as kids. Ever. It had suddenly stopped and was just never brought up. 

I guess I'm looking for advice on how I can move on from this? I don't know if they've moved on because we've never talked about it. Maybe we shouldn't? There's a very real possibility that I might move back to the area they live and would be seeing them a lot more frequently. And as I've said before I have romantic feelings for B and I don't really know what to do about all this.",09Mar2020,1
280,Just wondering for the next time I smoke to make sure I won’t have a panic attack.,09Mar2020,1
281,"Before I get started: 
Just want to say this is going to be kind of long and complicated, I'm not even entirely sure what is going on but I just know I'm struggling and I don't know what to do. Also will be changing minor details or keeping things vague to ensure identities are safe. 

So I'll start by stating my problem and then give some details and background information. I think I'm in love with a friend and not sure if I should leave my current partner for this person. My current boyfriend is not doing well and we have had some problems. He was going to college but quit and has not gotten a job. I'm still in college and work part time. We do not live together, he still lives with his parents but we are in our early 20s so, not that much of a problem. But his lack of motivation has been a constant struggle for us and he can be very clingy especially when I have important deadlines to meet which is the absolute worse time. Now, not everything is his fault in the relationship and I know that but I feel like I deserve more and better from him. We've been together since high school and have really seemed to grow apart. I've tried to break up with him before but he talked me into staying because he isn't a terrible person I just struggle with a lot of his faults, which he told me he will work on (haven't seen much progress in the past few years).

So now onto my friend. My friend is in a program that corresponds to mine so we work a lot together or near each other. We share a lot of the same views and I've started to fantasize about him. The only downside is that he is asian, to me it doesn't matter but his family is very traditional and wouldn't like me dating him. Also I'm not sure if he even remotely feels the same for me. He knows my boyfriend, they were friends for a little while. That may prevent him from wanting to have a relationship with me. This friend and I have never talked about anything sexual or discussed any sort of feelings other than mutual friendship. I do think I've given myself a way a bit to my friend because I bake him things and leave him notes on his desk or computer. But this attraction to him has really affected my daily routine, I find myself thinking about him, fantasizing about him or when we are in class I'll look over to see what he's up to. I check in with him a lot and make it a point to talk to him daily. I know he is single and he has confided in me that he isn't really looking for anyone right now. I think he may have said this because most of our other classmates ask about his love life to which he always says he is still single. Before he would also reply that he was looking but just recently changed his mind. I think it embarrasses him and he'd rather say he doesn't want a girlfriend than say that he can't find one. I find him extremely attractive, he's definitely not an incel. So I'm really hoping he didn't mean it. I know I probably sound a little crazy right now but my actions haven't differed much from how I treat my normal friends. It's not completely suspicious or weird but I do tend to give him more special treatment.

Ok, so let's get into the slightly weird side of this. Since I was young I've had a thing for asian women. I think they are absolutely gorgeous and for a while I wanted to look like one. I know this is a fetish. However, I DO find other races attractive as well so it's not just asian women I'd sleep with, but really anyone I found attractive. Although I always come back to asian women. I'm not exactly sure what it is about them, but I just think they are so gorgeous! So part of me wonders if this infatuation with my friend stems from this fetish and also the fact that he is an amazing person. Just to say, this is not the weirdest thing I'm into and I don't think asian women are a ""thing"" to be used for sexual gratification, they are human and wonderful and just all around lovely people that should be treated with respect and kindness! I think what draws me to them is mainly their culture and that I've always wanted to be petite (I'm fairly tall in an area where most people are about 5'7) but I'm not sure how that turned into me wanted to have a relationship with them though. I guess we all have weird coping mechanisms?

So to continue with my other issue, my boyfriend isn't the best but states he is trying. I'm not sure if I want to wait another 5 years to find out if he'll get his act together. My friend is incredibly attractive, motivated and seems to have everything I'm looking for. But do I throw away several years of a not entirely crap relationship to see if things could work for me and this other guy or try to find any one else that might be better?

Also, just want to state that I've been faithful in my relationship and my boyfriend and I have a very active sex life. We experiment a lot and have considered experimenting with other people but have decided that we were both too jealous to share. However we decided that commenting or talking about sex with others is a suitable alternative. 

Also also, if anyone thinks I just need to stfu and be happy please let me know. I definitely don't want to ruin my life with fickle feelings that might change. But I'm pretty tough so feel free to be blunt. 

TLDR: I think I'm in love with my friend who may or may not feel the same way about me. I need help trying to decide if I should break up with my boyfriend (who has been kind of crap for a while now even though he has stated he is going to change) and pursue a new relationship with my friend that may be difficult because of his family and culture.",09Mar2020,1
282,"TL;DR at the end.

So we are a flat of 3 people in our house: my partner and I, and our flatmate (we will call them Unicorn 🦄 ).

Sometimes Unicorn takes up to three showers a day, some of them for more than half an hour at a time, to about an hour.

My partner and I both shower before work (separately) and given we tend to get ready quickly, we spend no more than 5 mins in the shower, and then 2 mins to brush our teeth.

It’s gotten to a point where both of us have had no hot water many times because Unicorn will have showers in the early hours of the morning (between 2-4am sometimes).

There have been times where I have come close to feeling like I will shit my pants because Unicorn has occupied the bathroom for so long. We also stress that Unicorn will hop in the shower just before we start getting ready for work, because we know once Unicorn is in there, we will either be late or will have to forfeit having a shower and brushing our teeth.

We’ve asked Unicorn a few times politely (we have a friendly relationship) to curb their shower time, for which Unicorn has apologised for and said it won’t happen again. But nothing changes.

We’re at the point where we want the house to ourself now and want to ask Unicorn to leave. But here’s the thing, we both hate drama and admit we are pussies (to put it simply).

We have to give Unicorn at least 21 days notice, as per tenancy laws in our country. With saying that, if Unicorn can’t find accommodation in this timeframe, or if something falls through at the last minute, we will compromise as not to leave them homeless.

How do you kick out a flatmate?

TL;DR: Our flatmate uses the shower for so long that we often don’t have hot water and sometimes we almost shit/piss ourselves because the toilet is also in the bathroom. We want them out of the flat. How do we kick out a flatmate?",09Mar2020,1
283,"When should you put on deodorant?

So my boyfriend and I are having a disagreement about when to wear deodorant. 

I was brought up to put it on as soon as you get out of the shower; and in the morning and the evening. So I mostly shower at night, put deodorant on when I get out of the shower and then in the morning when I get ready for work etc

Now he showers morning and night, but he doesn’t put deodorant on when he gets out of the shower, only in the morning when he gets ready for work. So he comes to bed without deodorant on; he doesn’t smell bad or anything I just think it’s weird!

So I got fed up and hatched a very intelligent plan (I often do this due to my huge intelligence). I threw a banana peel down and I acted like I slipped on it. I planned for all the workers to come to me so I could distract everyone and then I would jump up really fast and head to another checkout station while everyone is distracted and crowding around me trying to help.

How do I make myself good enough to be loved? I don’t care about sex or anything like that, I just want a person that values me and that I can love back.

I’m going to preface this with that I live in a somewhat suburban university town, with a pretty popular fast food restaurant chain smack dab in the middle of it. I am 17 years old.

I applied for the job and was accepted immediately; they extended me the offer and I was hired in mid-January. They gave me an account on the company website, gave me a uniform, and I attended an onboarding class inwhich my name was on attendance.

Issue: I was told to fill out working papers, as I am underaged. These working papers require me to get signatures from my school, physician, and place of work; rounding all these up took about two weeks. When I turned in my working papers, I discovered that the manager that hired me was transferred to a new branch. When I turned in my working papers (to a manager I had not met before), I was told that they would “call me when they were ready.” It has been two weeks.

Should I just try to reach out to the general manager, or am I waiting for shifts and just paranoid about my first job? Should I keep waiting for them to call? Should I assume that while the other manager hired me, the new one isn’t aware of my existance?

Since the beginning all was great I got pregnant and I thought ok I can do this once more early 30s   (I was a young mom) as in start all over again raising kids. he is over 10 years older than I am no kids.

Backstory: when we met he lived in mom's basement because mom needed help. She's married. Apparently there was more to it he had an injury and had to move back supposedly. I feel there is way more to it.

When I was preg. at about 6 months I went through his phone and I saw he was taking pictures in my apartment and sending them to females and trying to set dates up. At this point he was not having sex with me because of his dear of hurting the baby.  Let's just say since then we barely touch each other once a year.  He gets upset when I remind him of such.

I manage the finances he has never signed in to see what's gotten paid.  I work 2 jobs and have numerous side hustles which limit my time with the kids and this hurts me to the core.  His car got repod when our child was barely a year because he missed payments and lied to me, he finally admitted to me that he had over 50k in CC debt. 

A few weeks ago I went through his phone to find him in women's DMs. I flipped out on him and had verbal diarrhea where I told him I'm sick of him not putting his part in regards to the house finances etc my mom is elderly and helps with cooking cleaning washing clothes meanwhile he gets home at 3 or 4 pm and I'm strolling in at 8.

So here is what's getting to me I again find him in a females DM the lady was at a baby shower we went to a couple weeks ago it was awkward a friend at the table made a face to me, hubs and her said nothing to each other. Situation 2: I've been working out and following a specific diet I asked him what he will be making for dinner since his family was coming over and said well this is for them not you. 3. For what ever steps I want to make forward he doesn't do any himself I want to purchase a home he saves nothing. He's not motivated to climb up the ladder at work, my base salary is about 15k more than his. 4.

306,"I’m going to try and make this post very short and very honest. I love my parents. I’m extremely grateful for everything they’ve done for me – including paying for my college tuition.

I need advice as to how to handle the following situation:

My roommate is moving out in a few months. My mom wants to turn the second bedroom into a second room for her. I am 23 years old, and in grad school. When I told her I’d prefer to use the room the studio, because I am an artist, she told me it was her space to do with what she wished because technically, she was paying for it.

Last night, my parents told me – jokingly, and I’m still not sure of the situation-did they were going to be using my savings account in order to finance the purchase of a new home. My parents have control of my savings account currently, as it has always been easier (I’m forgetful and do not make any notable independent income). specifically, my parents said they would be counting my savings account towards their annual income, I assume is beneficial in purchasing their home. When I mentioned that I wasn’t comfortable with him using my savings, before I understood what they were going to be using it for, my dad laughed and said that how they had funded my college meant they could do what they wanted.

The money in that savings account totals several tens of grands. It is a combination of gifts I have gotten since I was eight years old – I have never spent a single cent that my family gifted me for birthdays and holidays, and as the only child of very very wealthy grandparents, I ended up with significant funds. It also holds money gifted to me by my mother – she put in some money every month since I was a baby – as well as the money that I earn, which totals roughly 400-500 a month. 

The way that they pay for my college tuition is through a post 9/11 G.I. Bill. Basically, it was given to my dad after he served in the military. He was able to transfer it to me, a viable dependent. My college tuition has never come out of their pocket. In fact, I have gone to great lengths to let them know that if it ever did financially burdened them, I would be happy to take a full-time job and do whatever needed to ensure that they did not have to pay a single cent. They always asserted that being a successful student was my full-time job, and I was very grateful.

But during the conversation about using the second room in my apartment, my mom mentioned that they could’ve given the G.I. Bill to anyone. Herself, my dad, even though they had no need of it. She was using it to try and manipulate me, to make me feel like I owed her the space. When I brought this up to her and mentioned that very much hurt and shocked me, she acted like I was spoiled and ungrateful. My home is also paid for by the post- 9/11 GI Bill. 

In my life, I have never known her to be this way. I am absolutely flabbergasted.

I know the story probably paint me as a very privileged child, and trust me – I know I am. I’ve always been very aware of how fortunate I am to graduate debt free. But because of that, I’m left in a very difficult situation. The money in that account was mostly a gift. I didn’t earn any of it. And, honestly? If my parents needed it for something, even if it was the finance their second house (they don’t need a second house), I wouldn’t mind. It’s that they’re now using the fact that they gave me this post 9/11 G.I. Bill to lessen my voice in the conversation that is hurting me.

Additionally, just as a point of reference, I have excelled in my field academically and professionally. I pulled 40-80 hour weeks for my major (I know I said I’m an artist, but to be more specific I’m 3D artist— film and video games). I am the only child, and I have never once given them a problem – – straight A student, no drugs, and I graduated top of my class in my undergrad program. I call them every day and visit when I have more than a weekend off.

Is it my place to discuss this with them? I want to say “I understood this was a gift, and I’m beginning to feel as though you expect something in return. While I would be happy to repay you in some way, I feel you are using your generosity to manipulate me, and it has hurt and shocked me gravely.” 

I’m afraid what they’ll hear is me, Ms. Never-Worked-A-Day-In-Her-Life, bitching about how I don’t want daddy to take away my platinum credit card. They don’t take my concerns seriously because I don’t know the “real world”, and it drives me nuts.

307,"Recently, I (23F) been starting to date guys again after 5 years of focusing on my studies. I don't want a serious and commited relationship at the moment, since I'm finishing college and I don't need distractions or drama. So, I'm looking for a stable sex partner, just that. The thing is, I go out to have a couple drinks with them on weekends and rarely on week days, but my parents (52F and 60M) think that I'm sleeping with those dudes. I mean, get a few drinks and go straight to bed with them, when it's not like that, we go out to know each other like four times and the we decide what to do. 

To be quite honest, my sex life isn't that impressive. I've been with two guys in my life, one was an ex boyfriend and the other one a dude that we've been talking just to do this. There was a period of five years where I didn't had sex at all, and my parents criticized me for that, saying that ""It's abnormal, you can't just not have sex for so long"", and even implying that I'm into women. 

Now, the thing is that they are calling me a whore for enjoying my life, and finally having a high self-esteem and being confident enough to be with somebody in an intimate way. I don't know what to do, tomorrow night I'm supposed to go to this guy's house and spend the night with him (We've been talking for a little bit over two months and met five times). 

So, my question is: What can I do? How do I make them stop thinking that I'm an easy woman, when I'm picky as hell? I don't think I'm doing anything wrong, but the fact that your parents shame you over something natural is driving me insane, especially when they always criticized me for not having sex!

Long story short I have been basically best friends with this girl for about a year now and about a month ago I starting catching feelings for her, which I have kept repressed since.  My main fear is that if I tell her how I feel it will ruin our friendship and my friendship with her friends, whom I am also very close with as well.  I want to tell her because I can just keep acting like everything is normal when it isn't but I fear that it will ruin our friendship and she will stop talking to me.  Is there a way to approach this without it ending badly.  I also have no idea if she has feelings for me as well, all though she has complimented me in the past platonically as friends do.

313, So I've looked into palm growing in Tennessee. It looks like I'm limited to needle palms. This pisses me off a little bit because I love palm trees! I also love coconuts. I decided I will begin growing a coconut palm. My friends think I'm crazy. I'm starting as soon as possible. I heard they grow over 100 foot. So I thought about using a ton of duct tape and taping the whole thing when it gets cold.. I have planned on ordering truck loads of duct tape and hiring people to do this for me. People tell me to wait until at least April or May. But it cannot wait. I also have electric heaters I want to run an extension cord to outside. I plan on building large platforms around the coconut tree and run at least 20 or so electric heaters all the way up it's trunk. I will power them on when it gets cold like below 30 degrees and power them back off when it gets warmer. People around the world will pay to see my coconuts. I will charge $50 per person. A whole family will get a discount like $100 for a family of 10 or more. My Tennessee coconuts will sell for at least $200 each. I will be rich! This project will pay for itself in time.

318,"TLDR at bottom

I'm F14 in high school and there is a boy who I have P.E. with. We both did water polo, so we chatted a bit. I never really knew much about him. He was friendly, but we were never too close. My friends often made comments on how they were creeped out by him. When the girls water polo team went against the boys team, he would grab the girls' arms and wrap them around his waist as a form of ""defense."" It was nothing to big, just an odd tactic. I didn't pay too much attention to it.

We talked a bit during P.E., as he sat directly behind me for role call. I thought of him as a friend only. He began texting me through Messenger, and and I didn't think much of it. We were in the middle of a conversation through text and all of a sudden he texted, ""hey OP you're kinda cute I wanna go to your house"" followed by an immediate ""LOL jk."" At first I thought someone had stolen his phone to type that out, as our school is full of immature people who do that (something I've done before as well), so I responded ""haha who stole your phone."" He texted ""I don't have a phone."" That's when the realization hits me. He is always asking to borrow my phone when he needs to call someone because he doesn't have his own phone. No one stole it. He had just typed that message himself. I brush it off, slightly weirded out, but just thought maybe he just tried saying a joke that didn't come out as planned.

A couple days later, I tell him about how bad I am at water polo (which is completely true because I just started learning it). I'm not saying it for pity or anything, I truly was awful at it. He responds with ""OP, you are beautiful. Don't be depressed."" 

Around this time, he also began touching me weirdly. Other classmates noticed as well. It started off with just randomly massaging my shoulders. Every time he did that, I would shrug him off and tell him to stop. He would also randomly slap my thigh, which aways left me confused as to why. He would also squeeze my cheeks, but I wasn't too uncomfortable with that.

He always try to start conversation with me, and it's obvious he always uses the same conversation starters. He has asked me multiple times what classes I take outside of school, even if I've answered the question before. One time when I was walking to the girl's locker room to change, he kept asking me what my GPA for the semester was and I kept saying firmly that I didn't want to tell him, and he just grabbed my backpack and tried to drag me away from the locker room.

One day, my friend was trying to execute an elaborate plan that involved us standing behind our friends who have crushes on each other and making romantic poses (hard to explain but it's not pertinent) and whenever we failed, we'd break off laughing. The boy kept coming up to me and asking ""what are you guys doing?"" At this point, I started feeling less comfortable around him and I told him to ask my other friend. He just sorted looked around awkward (he knows that friend well because they were on the same water polo team, so it shouldn't have been weird for him to ask). He asks me two more times ""what are you guys doing?"" I got annoyed and replied with an irritated look on my face, ""go ask my friend."" He finally did.

A couple weeks ago, I started going to an outside math class, and with my luck, he was there. He didn't have time to make conversation with me and sat in the front while I sat more to the back. But I often caught him turning around just to stare at me for a few seconds with a grin on his face for no apparent reason. At first, I pretended to ignore him, until I got sick of it and just stared back at him and mouthed ""what?"" and he just smiled even wider and mouthed back ""what?"" I just continued working on my math and ignored his weird stares. I even decided to count how many times he stared at me, and I found over the span of 2 hours, he looked back at me 17 times.

I started going to the math class 2 times a week rather than 1. It was for help for outside school work. It was basically a time for you to sit there and do homework and if you had questions, you could ask the teacher, so it wasn't exactly a class. I was with my friend and we were both doing work. She was sitting by the wall, so I when I was talking to her, I was facing away from the door. We were just talking a bit when I hear the door open. I don't think much of it because there are always parents and kids walking in and out. My friend is facing the door and says in a weirded out tone, ""that kid is staring at you."" I immediately know who it is. I glance over a bit and I see him staring. Although the teacher is asking him questions about how his math test went, he isn't facing the teacher. He's facing me and just staring at me. I pretend I don't see him and just keep doing my work. He goes to a different room to do his work, but he sometimes leaves to ask the teacher a question or to get a tissue that I notice he doesn't use. He would just stare at me as he grabbed a tissue, put it up to his face but not actually let it touch his face, and throw it away. It was all just to come out and stare at me. I was extremely weirded out by it.

One day after the math class, I was about to head out, when one of my friends wanted to show me something in the math class. I followed her into the room and we talked a bit about the things she showed me. One thing I noticed but didn't mention was that the boy had also followed me into the room. I asked him ""why did you follow me."" He kinda just stared at me and smiled before leaving.

He eventually stopped being weird. Last week, we started our swim unit in P.E., and we were assigned to lanes based off our skill. Again, with my luck, we were assigned to the same lane. When I was resting on the wall waiting for the person in front of me to go, he would cut in front of the person behind me just to be next to me. One day, everyone in our lane was slacking off and not swimming. He said that he wasn't going to swim because the teachers weren't looking anyways. I didn't want to be near him because he was right next to me, so I decided to keep swimming. I was the only one swimming until I noticed he began swimming as well, even though he stated he was going to stop swimming before. I was extremely freaked out at this point (I'm an anxious person. No, I'm not one of those people who sef diagnoses. I really am an anxious person who has had panic attacks before). He is faster than me, so when he started catching up, I switched lanes and swam over to a different lane. The teachers didn't notice because there were 3 classes sharing the pool for swim unit.

The next day we were swimming, and the line was held up a bit. I was waiting behind about four people when he cuts the person behind me and waits. The line began moving up, and just as I was about to move forward, he puts his hands on my shoulders and says ""OP, move up."" I expected him to lightly push me forward, which I would have been fine with, but instead he leaves his hands there awkwardly for a good five seconds of silence before letting go. I don't say anything and just keep swimming. 

The next day, I really was not comfortable around him, so I switched over to a lane my friend was in. I had confided to her about how he was being slightly creepy to me. The teachers weren't paying attention, so we were messing around a bit, pushing and splashing around in the water, when all of a sudden, someone behind me pushes down on my shoulders and I sink. I wasn't prepared for that, and because I was laughing, I hadn't really taken a proper breath before being pushed down. I resurfaced to see that he had crossed over to the lane I was in. He had followed me into this lane for no reason. I was extremely creeped out and begged my friend to switch lanes, but thankfully class ended.

I began telling more of my friends about him and one of them told me in seventh grade he lifted a girl's shirt up.

I'm an easily anxious person as said before and I start getting stomachaches leading up to before P.E. and math. He's not being overly weird, but I just don't like him following me and staring at me. It's not a crime for him to stare at me, but I just really want him to stop.

How would you guys feel if your boyfriend still has not told his mother about you after dating for 10 months? 

I’m long distance with my bf rn and he claims it’s because his mom is a control freak and tried to break up his last relationship. He’s 22 and active duty military. He doesn’t even live at home anymore. Idk if I’m overthinking. 

He claims him and his mom are pretty close but hasn’t told her about me, yet has told his dad and stepmom. I’m just confused. 

I know a lot of men cheat in the military, so that’s what I’m scared of. He’s also been cheated on in his past relationships and so now he’s been pretty possessive of what I do and who I text and who I have on social media. 

I’ve also mentioned and asked when he was going to tell his mom and he just keeps putting it off.

322,"Hi all, just found out after living for quite the while after birth (I’m older than 18) that I have half-siblings, two to be specific (which are way older than me)

My mom has been on the hunt for them (passively, though, not actively) and recently, well a few months back, got a phone call from relatives and they mentioned about how they stumbled upon them. 

She eventually found their information online, such as a phone number. She contacted them, and told her that she’s their mother and whatnot. They replied “why, after all this time” and then said “I need time” and whatnot. My mother has been saying how she misses them, happy birthday, send some positive messages.

I don’t know what to do. I told her that she needs to stop sending messages (thankfully it isn’t spam, but it could have been) and wait for a response. 

But I’m scared we won’t get a response, I don’t know if even made the right call. She’s hoping for a text now, it makes me sad. I want to cry on the fact that she might not even get a chance to reunite with them, with a positive outcome, before she passes away (I don’t even know why I’m thinking about that! It’s making me sad)

I want my mother to be happy. I hope they don’t think she left them on purpose. She didn’t. It was an abusive relationship I believe at the time and she couldn’t do anything at the time and now it took her this long just to be able to do something. 

She was only with them when they were barely kids I believe. 

I don’t know if I should contact them myself, maybe I can make something happen considering I’m their half-brother. But they’re older than me, and I don’t know. Obviously I won’t make a move now, but maybe later as in end of the year.

We don’t know if anything will happen, I wish we did, I just want to make my mother happy by having them reunite, of course it’s gonna be hard and stressful - they barely know each other but it’s already very hard on them I’m sure.

So flashback to my birthday's eve she started to treat me like complete shit. She wouldn't hang out with me and she went through the entire day like I didn't even exist. On that same day's evening we had a long talk. She somehow made me believe that I treated her 'too nice' that I was suffocating her. She hurt my feelings in every word she said to me. She said that she wanted space and time. I and our other best friend gave her exactly what she wanted: Time and space. Then my birthday came. She came into the class in the morning and she treated me like she didn't even remember what happened last evening.  Told me a very warm 'Good morning.'. I didn't even look at her face. She went to her seat and started playing with her phone. (Oh and a very important detail, she doesn't have any friends other than me and our other best friend.) The day being my birthday my friends celebrated it. It was fun. Then she came to celebrate it. She was holding some sort of present in her hands behind her back. She said ''Hey! Happy birthday!'' and I in a very deep, formal voice said ''Thanks.'' and didn't look at her face again. The next break our other best friend came to tell me that she was literally crying a river. She told her that she had no friends left and were alone and she needed me. She cried 2 times that day. So she wants time and space , I give her time and space but after giving her what she asked for in the first place she starts crying. I was the one being heartbroken by her actions in the first place but being this idiot I wrote a long paragraph to her. She held the upper hand for all the talk. Told me that I was acting cold and she couldn't recognize who I was. I accepted the fact that I was the asshole and went on. 2 or 3 weeks after that we had a huge fight. I told her that she just doesn't want me anymore but she is scared to lose one of her only two friends and she didn't even care about me the way I cared about her. She started screaming and left the class slamming the door. I acted like nothing happened the next lesson. I just had fun with my other friends and our teacher but I overheard her talking about me with our best friend.  I was the right side in that fight but guess who is dumb enough to write to her yet again? You are right! ME! I busted my ass to get our friendship back together for 2 weeks. Writing to her nonstop. She responded with cold and short replies. Then her birthday came. I wrote to her at 12 AM on her birthday. She just thanked me. Then in the evening of her birthday she wrote to me sending photos of her crying.  Told me that I was her best friend but I haven't been to her birthday celebrations and that broke her heart. That night was a long night so I will just tell you guys that we were together again. Our other best friend has cut off her ties with my best friend after that and it was only she and I from now on. Then this past thursday she made me extremely mad. She started acting cold again. I went to her to have some shitty BFF chats that we used to have. She didn't even raise her head from her phone to look at me in the face.  She was always sleeping or using her phone. She acted like I was non-existent. She chose loneliness to me. And oh God was I getting angry. I wrote to her about this telling that Whatsapp and Instagram has become more important then our 'best friendship'. Told her that I didn't even really believe that I was her best friend anymore. Stuff between us weren't mutual because I constantly felt in a race with her friends from holidays. Her friends at holidays that she sees once or twice a year has become more important than the person that unconditionally loved under every circumstance, the person that cared the most about her and the person that would do anything to make her happy. Didn't let her have any sort of upper hand or anything in that conversation because I just reached my limit of tolerance. She acted like she was something more than she is. She looked down on me. And told me that I was the one who didn't believe in her best friendship. I went extremely angry at that stage of the conversation and told her that she doesn't do anything to make me believe in it. Told her to be honest as a newborn and answer this question: Do you really see me as your best friend or did I live a lie for the past 2 years? She told me that I was her best friend but she doesn't have to do anything to make me believe. She told me that I didn't need to give her any sort of attention or love because she doesn't need it because she just had a boyfriend and she gave her all she needed in terms of love and support. I couldn't believe my own eyes reading those. I asked her this: So you don't want any sort of love and attention, you don't want to talk to me and act like I don't exist and then tell me that I am your best friend. Can you tell me how the fuck is this any sort of best friendship? And she replied that this was her sort of best friendship. I told her that I wouldn't even write to her if I knew that she didn't even love me. She told that she loved me. I told her that I don't fucking believe her.  She blocked me from all social media and end of story. 

Reunited with my other best friend which right now is my only best friend. She told me that she has no friends other than me. The only one left is her boyfriend at her neighborhood that is extremely jealous (he was the reason that she wanted that ''time and space'' without even meeting me he was jealous of me. She knew him for 6 months or something but she ''loved'' him so much that she left her best friend of 2,5 years) and they are very surely going to break up. She told me that she will be the one who will return crying as she did the past 2 times.  

So this is what has been haunting me for the past 5 months. Her boyfriend fucked everything up in our friendship and she has become more and more filled with ego. She started to think that everybody  just wants to take her attention, while nobody other than me gives any fucks about her. I have a ton of friends but she has none (other than her ''holiday friends''). She just sits in class uses her phone and  sleeps. That is just all. She used me as a wallet when we went out to eat and she used me as a payphone to talk to her boyfriend while her phone was taken away by the principal. I feel sad, angry and anxious. I want to reach out to her someway because I don't think that this friendship will revive anytime soon. But on the other hand knowing that she was the one who cried and mourned for me the past 2 times I somewhat think that she will return again.

I want her back in her real self. I don't want her ego taking over her relationship me. But I really don't have any idea at this point. My friends tell me to move on but I just can't, you know? I feel that something is missing without her. Yes she has become toxic but I just feel some emptiness in life that nobody other than her can fill.And here I am asking for advice from you guys.

329,"So hi there everyone. I want to know your thoughts on this.
My boyfriends mother, who has been with me at least 3 times before and never got my name wrong, just kept calling me by his exes name repeatedly the last time we were together. When she did it the first time, I pretended not to hear and just let it go although I was mesmerized because she called me the name of her ex in front of my parents, as soon as she got out of the car to say hi to them. After a while, we just went for an afternoon snack (me, her, the bf). Here's where it gets ridiculous. As we enter the car she says ""so, where are we going next, *ex name*?"". I didn't even answer and my bf started talking to her in their native language and I could understand he was complaining with her. After this, she just gets the name wrong AGAIN and my bf just curses at her. 
Here's the thing: I know for a fact his mom loved his ex and after the ex betrayed him she wanted him to go back to her, they dated for four years, but they also broke up four years ago which, don't get me wrong, is a lot of time..
So she never got my name wrong and all of a sudden decides to call me by the exes name, and for the record, our names are nothing alike.. Just to give an example, mine is Camila and hers is Marie.
I felt humiliated and its really bothering me as it is deeply frustrating and I don't want to get to the point where I'm rude to her. Any advice?? Any similar experiences? What did you do? Any advice would be appreciated since I'm at a loss of ideas here.

So for the past month I’ve been trying to get my hands on a console for about nearly the same retail price. Original price is $300 (minus tax) and I tried to negotiate with this eBay seller that I would contribute $350 if they were able to accept it. The seller originally has the price for $450. 

Moving on, this seller told me that they were previously scammed on eBay before and the scammer managed to get back all of the hundreds of dollars that they paid to this seller by requesting a chargeback with their bank. This seller is wary that, because I’m asking to pay $100 less than their listing price, pretty much the same price the item originally goes for, that they’re wary of the fact that I might do the same thing to them. So they tried to compromise with me by asking for my PayPal email, or for me to create a PayPal address, so that they can send me $100 and I’ll be able to pay for the amount they listed the item for, then I’ll be able to keep the rest of the money. I felt skeptical about the idea so I rejected it. They replied saying that selling the item for $100 less and sending me $100 is the same to them. Which confused me. Why can’t they decrease the price and I’ll buy it from the listing...?
Next thing they tried compromising was that I’d give them my address and I immediately shot that idea down once I saw that message. They replied with the response that they have two Amazon accounts and they were just going to give me the account so that I could change the address already listed there to mine. Once again, I was extremely skeptical but if I could try to get this item at nearly its original price then I was really about to do anything. Sadly, my compromises with them didn’t work out and they continued to state that they’re feeling wary about the situation, yet they continued to negotiate with me?

One thing I’m not understanding is that they’re taking these “precautions” that sound like I’m being put at risk by giving them my personal information before the final purchase. I don’t think any of that is necessary but I might be overthinking all of this. Maybe this person has good intentions and I’m the one thinking that they’ll scam me in the end. I don’t know. Which is why I’m here. Please give me your opinions and thoughts on this situation. 
Thank you for reading this. 

TL;DR: eBay seller tries to get personal information out of me before a purchase because they think I might scam them. Currently at a loss.",09Mar2020,1
331,"for the past few weeks I’ve been completely spent of any energy that I had left, at first I brushed it off as just being lazy but to be completely out of it for several weeks doesn’t really seem normal considering that usually it’s only a couple days MAYbe that I’ll be a bit tired but no. And I have anger issues that I’ve been working on and anytime I “want” to get angry I legit don’t have the energy to even clench my fists or grit my teeth and it almost breaks me every time because I want so badly to BE angry but I can’t even let it out and I’ll be honest it makes me wanna cry. But I’m not sure if it’s a bad thing that I can’t get angry but i might be keeping it in until one day I fucking snap and it worries me. Not only do I not have energy to get angry but I don’t have energy to do ANYthing, like people would ask if I wanna go out. And I do want to, but I just can’t because I’m too goddamn lazy and I feel super bad because that’s a crappy thing to do to just not hangout cuz I don’t want to get out of bed. I’m not sure if this ‘out of energy’ thing is because of depression, the meds I take, or maybe even my diet but I’m so sick of it that again: I want so badly to get angry but I just can’t, it feels like the anger just converts to feeling pathetic and sad.

332,"Hey all, 

I just want someone to talk to. Ever since my partner told me that they think they’re trans, I’ve been so guilty about my thoughts and how I wish things could have been.

Don’t get me wrong, I love my partner to bits and I would never say or do anything to purposely hurt them. But I really need someone to who is in the same boat as me, and will understand how I feel. 

Honestly, I’m so anxious about her trying new things and it always makes me so sad about everything. For example, women’s jackets, I didn’t see as a problem but now I do since she told me. 

It’s stupid little things that get me, and I’m willing to do anything to support. But I just really need a friend who is willing to chat every now and then, so we can check up on each other and make sure we’re doing okay. Maybe discuss how to support our partners and how we can better ourselves. 

Anyways, I hope everyone is going good!",09Mar2020,1

Hello. Posting this on a throwaway account because I don’t want people who check my profile from time to time to see this, as this is extremely personal. 

I am part of an online community on the app discord. We play games and hang out and are really good friends. We have about 7 guys and 5 girls, so we have a nice mixture of people. Until a couple of weeks ago, we all had just been friends for about 2 years and had fun gaming together. 2 weeks ago, however, 1 of the guys (19) asked one of the girls (17) to be his girlfriend, and she said yes. Everyone was happy for them, except for me. I still put on a facade of being happy, but deep down I was hurt. I (20, somewhat close to 21) had also had a crush on the same girl. For over a year I’ve concealed my crush on her well because our age difference (when we first joined the group I was 18 and she was 15. I was always an adult and she technically hasn’t been yet), it always made things super awkward. I didn’t want to be looked at weirdly, because the age difference was enough to make things really questionable about my motives. 

Perhaps concealing my feelings for so long was a mistake, but ultimately I never wanted our friendship to end, and didn’t want to make things awkward if she didn’t reciprocate feelings. I figured that a month after she turned 18 I would tell her since it will be a lot less awkward when a 21-year-old is dating an 18-year-old. But all of that is down the drain. Every time I think about them together, my heart feels heavy and I have to actively suppress these feelings of sadness. I was never a social person in high school, I had very few friends and never dated anyone. I had plenty of crushes but I was always too scared. Now, it wasn’t being scared but waiting for the right moment and she got taken by a friend who didn’t have quite as bad of an age difference. Nobody has questioned their relationship.

Overall, I’m feeling like nice guys finish last. I tried to wait for the right moment and give her space to finish HS since she’s a bit scatterbrained and already needs reminders to pass classes. But because I gave space, I now feel sad, depressed, and jealous. I also feel like she’s being influenced by the BF in a bad way but that’s a topic for another time. So I am asking these 2 questions: Did I do the right thing by waiting, or did the advice I got a year ago really backfire on me? And what should I do now? Do I tell either of them I had feelings, or just feel heavy-hearted and jealous all the time?

Thanks for answering, this post means a lot to me.",09Mar2020,1
334,"I'm a full-time student studying a community college; I have every intention to drop school and pick up a trade and move to another state where my buddy says he's got a place i could stay with him, however that's not for many months

I've been lying to my father, otherwise I'd be homeless, he thinks I'm studying to be a music teacher and earning a transfer degree for state university. I am not, however apparently being a full-time college student isn't good enough for him and I need to ""get off my lazy ass and go find a job"" like I don't fucking already have enough things to worry about. He's very mentally abusive and insanely narcissistic, definitely a r/insaneparents kind of parent.

so I can't find a job, I've put out tons of applications over the course of these past 2 months, I've called and called and called places, I've only got 4 interviews and each time they say the same bullshit ""we'll hold onto your application on file for X days and keep track of it"", and it's bullshit everytime. it's the same line, over the phone, over email, in person. 

and my father has no sympathy, he's so out of touch he doesn't realize that a jigsaw puzzle schedule with no previous employment history is not viable for employment. I guess back in his day you walk into a store and they just start handing you fucking paychecks as easy as he makes it sound.

Anyways as time goes on he continues to belittle me and insult me, he actually calls me moron and idiot more than he calls me by my name or even ""son"". I've counted it's like 4:1 ratio of moron to halolavapigz. and more and more he threatens to throw me out if i dont get a job, and I dont know where to look.

I wanted to in 12th grade and decided against it because of the math I knew would be involved.

I just need Biology classes(2), Chemistry classes(2), and Physics. I know it'd be a lot, but I feel as though if I get them finished now, then after I graduate and pass the bar, I can try to throw in some medical school stuff such as studying for the MCAT and taking those steps to go to school after I set myself up as a steady lawyer.

336,"What’s your point towards this?

I am currently distancing myself from some people because I am uncomfortable around them. They don’t make me unhappy. As a matter of fact I have a lot of fun around them, but unfortunately, I realized I like them too much and that makes me uncomfortable.

So things are becoming awkward because I don’t want to seem needy around these people and now it’s just... uncomfortable. So distancing sounds better than feeling scared of being involved in their lives. 

I know, silly. But I just haven’t had real connection in a long time. And when I finally find it, I’m just too uncomfortable to stay and see where it leads.

337,"So this guy and I started sexing in may the first month we met. We called eachother baby outside of sexting which makes me think we dated then. But the thing that confused me was that he said good thing we aren’t more then friends. I’m thinking wtf anyways. in August it slowed down with sexting and in October it got so heated so many times on that month. We sexted 9 times that month. It was a lot the most we probably ever done. Then it continued onto the next month which was November we probably did that 4 times and in December I carried it on and sexted on Christmas Eve. 

On January 4 we a big argument and we stopped texting. So I’m thinking free at last.  Then he texted me 4 days after, like oh he clearly wants to keep talking to me.

 The day he comes back on the 8th we just chatted for a long time that day and it stated sizzling back to our thing...we sexted. And on the 26th. 
Here’s where shit starts to hit the fan.
The day after we sexted we were chatting and he texted “But hey you still want the video?”and I’m like what? And he said “Whoops wrong person” he said he was sending a funny video and I’m thinking who would ask someone if they want a video still of something like that? That got me very on edge. My mind immediately thought like he’s sexting another person and asked them if they still wanted a video of him jerking off. Cuz I can see him asking that. I didn’t ask about it and believed him then we just stopped sexting. I did it out of pure caution for him idk.

 So now it’s February 16th and I hit him up saying I’m horny thinking he’s gonna help me. And he said “Can we stop this please? I don’t want anymore. I’m sorry” my heart broke because this was our thing. I’m still a little hurt it’s tender to the touch but I still text him with a smile across my face.  My theory is that right after he said the wrong person thing he just stoped sexting me so he was probably talking to someone else. And until I bring it up he stops me. What is your theory? Or am I thinking too much? He’s been dry with me as well at that time and I’m thinking he wants nothing to do with me anymore so I tell him,
if he is about to tell me he’s done talking to me then leave and say it cuz go ahead I’m waiting. But he said no it’s not that. So he’s not leaving me, despite his ways communication. His actions are saying one thing while his words are saying another. He seems confused and doesn’t know what to do. I flirted with him just using a wink and he said “Don’t” I asked him a day later what was that about and he said some bullshit answer “I saw. I forgot what it said. But I saw” wtf does that even mean. He didn’t even answer me at that.

The hard truth is that he don’t wanna do anything with me anymore he’s rude to me low key. He pushes me when he past me, but he be looking at me when I’m not looking. When I was helping him out he got close to me and had his face close to mine, I could’ve kissed him right there. But I didn’t because he’s sending confusing signals. I didn’t feel any tension or sexual either, kinda disappointed. But These signs are confusing me. I’ll update it anything if interested in his actions next with me but ugh wish me luck guys. What do you suggest on me doing? How can I got back about our old roots? Make him feel connected and cared about? 
I don’t wanna sound cheesy but this thing we had no one can replace i mean yeah but the feelings that were felt? Nobody can make that happen like we did. That’s facts. 
if he sexts me again what should I say to him? I’m
Gonna wanna do it again but I want answers first",09Mar2020,1
338,"So, my parents have given me until the end of the month to move out, but I'm extremely unprepared. I work at a crappy fast food place, and have almost no money saved. I can't drive myself either, as I don't have a car or my license yet. What should I do?",09Mar2020,1
339,"Yeah, so I'm pretty sure I've been disassociating/in shock the last few days. I'm 19/F. Truth be told I've been really unsure of myself lately, who I am, what I'm going to do with my life. It's all been weighing down on me. I've been working at McDonald's for a year, trying to save up for a car, and go to college. But I also feel like I'm just wasting my life away, because I can't actually get started on anything and it seems like time is just going to fly by and before I know it I'm going to be 40, homeless, or just barely surviving.

But the other day, my work let me go home early because they wanted me to come back later and fill in for someone else. I agreed. It's important to note that I live with my grandparents, and I depend on them for rides to get places. It's also important to note that both my mom and dad are addicts, and haven't been in the picture for much of my life. But I've been establishing at least a little bit of a relationship with them. 

I caught an uber home because my grandparents weren't answering my phone calls. I didn't mind at first, because I don't use uber much and it wasn't a lot of money. But I realized when I got home, that I'd left my key inside. Meaning I was effectively locked out of the house, and my grandparents were working. For two hours, I tried calling my grandparents. Nobody answered, and I didn't know what else to do in the meantime so I texted my mom and told her I was coming over. She was cool with it, so I caught another uber to her house. 

I was feeling very anxious about everything, because I was still in my work uniform and my mom is a smoker, so I knew by the time I'd get back to work, I was going to smell like cigarette smoke and I wasn't really too happy about it but it was whatever. But apparently, my mom lives with a bunch of crackheads. I'm not joking or exaggerating. They're legitimate crackheads. Like four other people were there along with me, my mom, and my toddler aged little sister, and they were all tweaking. Lots of arguing, shouting, in the other room, and had to deal with a bunch of random ass people walking in and out of the room. Seriously, my grandparents are straight-edge so it was a definitive culture shock. And I've been pretty sheltered for most of my life. I think I was there for a good 3 or 4 hours. I was not comfortable. 

But finally, two hours before I had to be back at work, my grandpa answered the phone. I told him I was at my moms, and he gave me his usual attitude(Bossy, assholish) and said he'd come get me. All I wanted at this point was to get some taco bell and go home, and get ready for work again. I was feeling very shitty. I asked him if we could get some on the way home, and if he could pay for it because I'd already spent a lot of money on uber. And he said that it was my fault because I forgot my key. Started going off about how he was paying for it everyday of his life, and that he wasn't talking about taco bell. This isn't unusual for him. But I started yelling and everything because he kept saying all this hurtful shit about how he hated his life, how we weren't actually a family, and how it was, once again my fault I spent so much money because I'd been in a rush that morning and forgot to grab my stupid ass key. I reminded him that I tried calling(For 2hrs), and nobody answered and he made all sorts of excuses blaming it on technology. 

I was in a daze by the time I got to work, and all of my coworkers could tell some shit was up with me. It was horrible. 

But since then I feel like I've been walking around in a daze. Like I have these moments where I'll forget where I am, or what I'm supposed to be doing. Especially at work. And I feel numb. It's so hard to explain. But idk what to do? It's like I'm rethinking my entire fucking life, I'm not going to lie. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has dealt with feeling like this, and what did you do to get out of it?",09Mar2020,1

I also avoid me friends now because they’re higher in economic status then I am plus I have a feeling they look down on poor people with statements they have made since they have acquired way better jobs.

So before I start with this dilemma of mine, I have to make a few things clear so you can follow along. I am a student pilot. Basically the way it goes in my country is you go through private pilot theory first, then you take actual flight lessons. After that you have to go back to ground school for the commercial pilot theory and then you go on and you take more real flight lessons.

So I am a 24 going on 25 year old guy at flight school. I got my aeronautical engineering degree before that, so most of my classmates are between 18 and 20 years. It was the first day at flight school (August of last year), I was smoking with a professor I had met before and got along with pretty well. We were just talking and smoking while the next class started and all of the sudden, this beautiful girl (a 20 year old girl which latter on I found out that she was at the moment taking the commercial pilot theory) comes down the stairs and instantly caught my attention. That very same day at the end, while I was getting ready to get into my car and go home, I saw her again on the cafeteria. I paid no mind to her until I heard one of her classmates shouting at her something that can be translated to ""is he the one?"" and then she blushed and ignored him. I pretended I was ignoring them but I could see all this because I was wearing sunglasses and no one could really tell what I was looking at. So basically that day I thought she felt attracted to me, at the moment I did not give it much importance because I was in a bad place place in terms of self esteem and being in a relationship or anything remotely alike was completely out of the table. However, the idea of being someone's crush made me feel good about myself. And again, I wasn't really expecting for something like that to happen. So as time went by, I saw this girl on a daily basis at school but we never talked. A couple of times she approached to say hi to whomever I was talking to but ignored me, which I found really rude but a female friend of mine told me that it's one of those things a girl who has a crush on you would do to catch your attention. I don't really believe that to be true but hey... I am a 24 year old with a crush on a 20 year old girl, obviously i am not the brightest man on earth. So anyway, we would still find each other at school, and constantly find ourselves staring at each other. There was even one time where we were at opposite sides of one large hall walking to each others direction. Those were one of the longest seconds of my life as I could not get my eyes out of her and she did not either. At this point I obviously was sure about my crush on her but never really dared to talk to her. I have to say that I am a pretty outgoing person. I am not the most handsome guy in the world but I am not ugly either. Also, I have to stress the fact, one again, that I am 24. I've been with a considerable amount of girls by now, and I had always been pretty confident around women but while being around this girl I felt really nervous and powerless,which never really had happened to me before with any girl.

***At this point it is worth mentioning that she is a popular, beautiful 20 year old girl, I am a 24 year old, not ugly but not that good looking guy who doesn't have problems getting along with others but still feel pretty uncomfortable around my classmates as they are about 4 or 5 years younger so I'm usually alone. Like I said, I have several issues, due to past relationships and recent family problems that to this day still make me feel insecure about myself. Also...When I started talking to this girl (more about that later) I realized that even though our lifes were pretty different in terms of friends and you know... Mental wellbeing, we were pretty much alike in lots of things.***



Anyhow, months went by, she finished commercial pilot theory and I stopped seeing her at school, that was around November. A couple weeks after that, I finished private pilot theory and went on to Christmas break. So now it's January 2020, I am now on the actual flying part of my training. So I went to the school's flight base, which is located at the coast, a few states away from ground school. First day at my base and I see her there,couldn't really believe that she was sent to the same base as me. At first we would ignore each other like we used to, but the staring continued and the tension continued as well. Eventually we started talking, nothing too complex and more of a small talk while waiting for the airplane to be ready sort of thing. Then we started meeting each other at parties and reunions, not because we agreed to it, but because we shared the same circle of classmates so talking to her stopped being that awkward and even though we never talked much, we started to know each other. Now at this point I am all over the moon about her, thinking the kind of bs you think about when you really like someone but, again, I felt frightened by her and never really took the first step to ask her out or something because even though I was sure at that moment that I liked her, I still had some issues from the past that made me doubt about it. At some point somehow everybody found out that I liked this girl, even her (again, I am a guy, we are pretty stupid and obvious when it comes to this kind of situations) and they would go around making jokes about it, which made it a million times more uncomfortable than it already was. There was even one time that she offered me a ride home, but I refused because I felt really uncomfortable about it, even though spending time around her is something I've been looking forward for a long time (yeah, i am an idiotk) So, it's almost March, I am about to finish my flight hours and go back home. I find her one day on her own (she's a popular girl, she is usually never alone) and I was like fuck it, I have to at least ask her out for lunch, which I did, and to my surprise she agreed to. She told me that it was fine and to text her so we could agree on the time and place. So i did, i texted ""hey, are we still up for tomorrow?"" and she never replied. Next day I sent a text that read ""guess not. Oh well, hope you're alright. Take care"" she never replied. I went back home a little bit disappointed about the way things with this girl turned out, but happy about becoming a private pilot. It's been a couple weeks after I got home, she never texted me, not even to apologize about not replying and sort of standing me up (which is fine actually, I don't think anyone should give any explanations about why they do or don't do anything) but I kinda felt sad about it and those self esteem issues started triggering again. Today I decided to follow her on Instagram. She accepted my follow request but would not follow back. So now I am angry, I feel sad and pretty stupid. I mean.... Why? I get that this past weeks may have been really awkward because of being around someone who likes you and is pretty obvious about it, plus those weeks at ground school... But if she doesn't like me, why not saying so? Why couldn't she just say ""hey man, it's not gonna happen? And.. Why acting like I am some kind of weirdo that is stalking her, because really, that's not how it went....

I don't know what to do... There is a part of me that just wants to say fuck it... and go fuck the first girl I find at a bar and repeat until I forget about this few months... But there is also this part of me that wants to be straight forward about it, text her about how I really feel about her (talking to her in person is not really an option right now as she is still at the coast and don't know when she'll be back) and apologise for not doing anything before and for letting all this situation become really uncomfortable for both. But at this point I don't know if she might like me as well or the other way around.

Anyway, they started liking each other again and my seatmate didn’t really like that. He made notes for her in class and asks me to place it in her locker after to class so he can avoid suspicion. 

But eventually, they found out that he has been making those notes but they didn’t tell him anything about it.

I opened my eyes very suddenly to see a huge half dollar sized black spider with indistinct markings walking along the wall. I pulled back in fear and tried to adjust my eyes, and it was gone. It faded out of existence. I know it didnt run, and i watched it just dissapear. 

It seemed so unbelievably real. Like it was truly there, and then it wasnt. 

This happened once before 2 months ago, and it was much less vivid. I knew it was my eyes playing tricks, and i could cause it to happen again by shooting my eyes open really quick. Not this time.

I dont hear things. I dont see things. I have normal sounds and stuff in my head when im trying to sleep. I dont have delusions. 

Im worried its serious. Please help i dont have money to see any kind if therapist and no friends as a support group.",09Mar2020,1
350,Shit is bad guys. I’ll start from the beginning. Me and this girl from another city had “relations” and eventually we stopped being friends. Apparently she talked shit to some guy in my city. He started off by trying to fight me when I saw him at a hockey game. I warned him not to touch me Cusse my dads a lawyer. So he backs off. He does. A few days latter me and some girl have an argument because she takes shit about me all the same blablabla. I threatened to expose her nudes. She tells this guy. Now he’s accusing me of child porn. I already deleted the pics. But now people who are 17 are defending him and warning me of him. And bullying me. Idk what to do. Should I fight or ignore him. I need help and advice guys.,09Mar2020,1
351,"So quick back story, I'm(m18) in this group of friends and recently I have come to like a girl(f17) who I didn't know if she liked me back. Today I was messing on my phone and out of nowhere I said on 3 I type ""hey"" I and ask her out, well I typed hey and then I felt like there's no turning back so I did it, she said yes but she wants to keep it a secret for now and see if we vibe or not (we vibed hard until now but under the influence) so she wants to see how it is sober, we agreed to meet on Wednesday and Im kinda scared because it's my first real date we're going to be Starbucks for a coffee and to talk.

1)I need advice on the following:
How do I act(like when she said yes my heart was beating so fast) around her, don't want to over do it but I don't wanna pretend I'm someone I'm not...
2)what topics do I talk about with her?
3)do I pay for the date(I have the money but I don't know if she will be offended or anything so idk how to react)
4)(we are looking at the fact that I'm a solid 4/10 and she in my eyes is a fucken 20/10 for anyone else she would be like a 8 or 9/10) how do I attract her to myself because its natural when we are drunk at a house party but I'm a bit shy and don't want the convo to be dry...
Thanks for any suggestions ♥ ♥ ♥",09Mar2020,1

360,"My life is a disaster. I work a underpaid management job and I can barely afford bills. 7 months ago my girlfriend at the time broke up with me(we had dated for 2 years) . Within a week she found another guy (my best friend) and started dating him. This lead me to be super depressed because we all went to the same college. Forcing me to see him and her every day for the next two years. About a month in I said fuck it and stopped going. I had dropped out of college. A few months later my job asked me to be a manager, and I had obliged. My roommate (the assistant store owner for the place I work) said I'd get a raise. Well that very came through. And to add to it, I'm working about 40 hours a week as a part timer, getting paid 16 cents more than my lower ranked coworkers. The 16 cents came from a yearly raise. Then 2 months later my roommate leaves the lease. Taking a few of my belongings like my pots and pans and denying everything to do with them. Great right? Then I find out he was lying to me all along about how much he was putting in the electricity. See, he could see all the stats of it since it was in his name. But he would put 30 in, then claim it was my turn. We had a deal where we each had to out 50 in each time. Then the internet came around and I realize that we're 100 bucks in debt. Those were from the times he hadn't paid each month. They kept our service though for some reason. So I sit, now out a lot of money due to this. And forced to pay these things or they will come after me. 

And to add to that, my ex and I are talking. The one that left me for my best friend. Well it turns out he had forced her into everything. He had asked her out, and she felt obligated. Like she could try it and see how it goes. Then everytime she thought about ending the relationship he would threaten to kill himself. They were still dating at the time she started talking to me again and I told her how to get herself out without having anything too bad happen and it ended up working. And I still have major feelings for this girl. Like I seriously love her. I forgive her and everything. And she says that she may want to try us out again because she was so stupid to break up with me. And she has apologized so many times saying she feels so bad and that she feels like a horrible person for doing what she did. But she said may want to try again. I'm getting my hopes up and I really want us to get back together again because she seems to be the only thing that makes me happy in my current situation and at all as a person. But she has made it very clear that we may not get back together. Yet, we hang out every other day. She comes over and we will cuddle and kiss. We won't do anything sexual, but we will watch a movie and cuddle. And I just... I really want us to work out. But the uncertainty of that matched with the terrible situation I'm in with work and my living situation, are really taking a toll on me. I'm super depressed all the time and I just want to kill myself. But I can't because I don't want to lose these different opportunities, like her. I just... Guys I don't know what to do anymore. At this point I'm not even sure if she is just leading me on and not sure how to get out of it, or using me for her own personal comfort, or genuinely unsure and really wants to date me or something.

I was talking to someone who I thought was my friend about girl 1. I was saying how she is a bit obsessive over me and it’s kind of creepy. I said she was irrational and a bit psycho (mistake on my part)

Obviously this friend went and told girl 1 about everything I said. I just received an angry message from girl 1 saying I’m disgusting and stuff. Girl 1 is friends with a lot of my friends and I’m scared.

So while my mother was pregnant with me my biological father left her and had 3 daughters with another woman a few years later. 
From what I hear those 3 were sent to an orphanage, and that's all I know about them, since I heard that I wanted nothing to do with my biological father, I dont even know his name or what he looks like and don't plan to. Because of this I had no intention of meeting my half sisters either.

Now yesterday they reached out to my mother and asked if they could meet me and get to know me also stating that they have not spoken to the father in about 4 years, I haven't agreed yet but I would like to meet them as well.

368,"Hello, I'll make this short.

I (F-20) have been with my SO (M-20) for over a year now. Our relationship has been so rocky all throughout and just recently, he's had enough.

I only recently realized as well that I have been an Emotional Manipulator. 
I have always know that I mostly only care about myself and he's one of the VERY FEW people I truly care about, but having realized that I am an EM, I want to change.

Throughout our relationship, he's the one who always apologizes. He's always blames himself when I feel bad. I barely open myself to apologizing or talking about issues. He always feels like he's causing all my pain. 

The root of issues is almost always me, and I have broken up with him a lot of times - all of which ended up with him asking me to come back. Sure, he's left me a couple of times too before, but within good reason. 


tl;dr : I realized I am an EM and want to change. Any advice on how I can do so?",09Mar2020,1

By the time I was 14 i started to go on webcam sites to mutually masturbate with another person. I feel very guilty now, as I would lie about my age in order to do so. I realized how it was sick, I continued to do so for a few years, until I connected with a girl who had the same intentions as me but she said she was 14 and I who had almost turned 18, thought about it. Luckily nothing had happened or was shown, but I feel sick to my stomach because I almost had the the urge. In the moment I had forgotten how serious the age gap was and the fact she was also minor. In all my experiences on video chat sites, I have never did it with anyone underage despite me being a minor as well. I knew I had to stop, however it just made me head to cam sites instead and I have wasted way too much money on them. I have also been with 3 prostitutes since I have turned 18. I feel like a fucking loser and I have had urges to kill myself. I don't have anyone to go to and I have almost non existent social life. I am embarrassed for all the things I have done.

I have this weird problem with textures and biting into things.  The worst part is that it happens with foods *that I love the taste of*, but I still can't get it down my gullet without either choking/gagging like a fool or feeling nauseous and not wanting any more.  Ironically enough, I work at a fine dining restaurant with amazing food, and chef always gawks at me, baffled by the fact I'd never had a pear or fish or beans.  

I can't say I don't love the taste of meat for every meal, but I know that I'm missing out on millions of other delicious dishes and flavors, I'm disappointing every cook, mom, and server I've ever eaten with, and I'm slowly imbibing myself with artery-clogging shit and depriving myself of essential vitamins, nutrients, etc. 

Most food is a world of sensations and tastes I've never been able to enjoy. I think it's probably a mental block or some fear translating itself into adverse physical reactions, but I don't know what to do about it!

374,"My bf and I are pretty young (me being 18, him 23) and we very recently had a pregnancy scare. Despite having always used condoms, our anxious asses thought since I was a week late, I was pregnant. It was stupid to panic like that I know but he told me he’d honestly be okay with it. 

He told me he loved and that if we had a kid together and I decided I wanted it (claiming he had no choice in what I decided bc he respects my decisions) he would be glad and happily be the father to my child. He did say that he would prefer us to be financially stable, though. Like he kept telling me he’d be happy to have kids with me and wouldn’t regret it. 

This sent me into a spiral where I kept thinking that if we had a baby he’d be regretful down the road with his decision to stay with me and not abort it.

379,"This will be part rant and definitely advice seeking. I’m not a fan of trigger warnings, but I will say there will be triggers in a thread like this. I’m sorry for my insensitivity, but I come here looking for advice, so I will respect those I am asking of. 

The title says it all. I have United Healthcare, it’s better than most US citizens’ insurance, I will say that much. It also might be changing to a different provider in the near future. Their website is atrocious, and their phone system is even worse. I have used both to procure therapy in the past, but was left feeling as if something was lacking. I didn’t put nearly as much effort into my previous searches as I have this one though.

I’m fairly confident that I don’t need a psychiatrist. I want to avoid drugs if at all possible, I prefer talking about my issues, and I am fairly confident I don’t suffer from a serious mental condition. 

What I *feel* I need is someone that I can talk to in the utmost of confidentiality. I have a very small group of close friends and a large gathering of “people”. However, I don’t trust anyone to know everything that is going on in my head. The closest I *ever* came was the therapist that did a previous intake for substance abuse. However, it was a less than ideal situation. The confidentiality was obviously there, I had no problem telling her the truth, but she had a “woe is me” mentality that drove me crazy for the several months I was seeing her and participating in group sessions. 

I need to find someone that is like an all-purpose therapist, a jack of all trades. Someone that can deal with the, as I assume they would see, mundane issues of every day life, to the deep seeded issues that I want to talk though. From the “I got mad at the guy that wouldn’t let me zipper merge on the freeway in standstill traffic” to the “my alcoholic dad beat me and died young shortly after making amends”. 

However, some days are perfectly fine. I breeze through life without a care in the world while accomplishing what I want. But I have seriously dark moments and thoughts as well. I’m not suicidal, but I have thought about it. Not fleetingly, but I also can’t say that I *haven’t* thought about it. Hell, I’m thinking about it right now, but I’m not thinking about *actually* doing it. 

I have my prejudices in this matter as well, and I feel this is where my previous attempts have all failed. Side note, I almost wrote for the previous sentence “I feel this is where my previous therapists have all failed me”. As if it is their collective fault that I am still a mess. Heh. Moving on, these prejudices, I feel, are based around me wanting something I can never have. An outlet that feels like a peer that I can say ANYTHING to. I have stuff that I want to say that I could never tell my family, my friends, a priest, but I *know* I can tell a therapist. I have started to in the past, but it was cut short for various reasons. 

I have been in various forms of therapy sporadically for the last 13 years. It has always stemmed from my inability to control myself when I drink. It has always been court ordered or recommended by an attorney. I never *really* had much in common with the therapists aside from maybe one or two things, race and affliction. I knew they could empathize with what I was going through to a point, and well, race is race, can’t change that, just the other thing we had in common. 

I don’t really know how to put what I’m looking for in a therapist down in words, but I’m going to do my best. Please forgive me if it sounds like a wanted ad, but it basically is. 

I can’t talk to a guy about my issues, so I’m looking for a female therapist to start. I have a lot in common with old people, but I don’t find them remotely relatable. I like sweaters, books, quiet, and unsweetened ice tea, but I don’t want a therapist that has seen more patients than days I’ve been alive. I get that experience can help in the whole treatment plan, but I would find it very difficult to open up to someone that I don’t *think* can empathize with my problems. Both of these stipulations definitely come from my upbringing. Very much a “boys don’t cry” and “respect your elders” lifestyle. I was raised “tough” and that gave me a rather Bill Burresque ability to bottle things up and shove them deep deep down. However, I have also previously opened up too much and scared people away.

Unrealistically, what I think I want is a female version of me that has been professionally trained to deal with my issues. I’d probably drive us both nuts though. 

What I *feel* I need is a female friend that has is legally bound to confidentiality, and that is why I’m looking for a therapist. I can’t find that in the “real world” aside from a therapist. 

So how does one, easily, find *THE* therapist? Or do they? Do I just make due? I don’t *want* to do that, but that is probably the best description of my life to so many degrees for so many years. I feel like I’m just making due with huge swathes of my life. 

Sorry for my existential crisis, I mean, long post. Also, sorry for any grammar issues or spelling, see next sentence. It’s super late now, thanks daylight savings time and Obama! I’m sure some things in this post didn’t make that much sense, I’ve been typing it out over the last two hours. As a result, I will gladly answer any questions. Just later. I’m going to knock out for a bit.

Peace.

380,"my (19f) dad (65) is probably one of the most irritating people I’ve ever met. Firstly, he repeats things all the damn time. We’re in Ireland to visit friends of his, and he says “Aye” every 4-5 minutes or so, and anytime I ask him to stop he gets mad at me. Secondly, everything apparently takes rocket science level of thinking. Just this morning he couldn’t put a pin button on because apparently it’s too hard to figure out, I had to help him. Then he couldn’t figure out the drain in the shower (pull drain, very simple) and then the light switch on the lamp. Then he eats like a pig. I’m talking open mouthed chewing, moaning, it’s disgusting and embarrassing! And then he makes these grand scenes in public sometimes when he gets even mildly inconvenienced and just screams and screams and that’s soooo embarrassing. He also treats me like a child and will talk over me or even for me, even though I’m an adult. 
I’ve tried addressing this with my therapist but she says he’s probably a narcissist and that this will get worse as he ages (my mother was a narcissist so this sucks). I just want to hear your thoughts Reddit, i’m stuck.",09Mar2020,1

383,"I'm starting my first job very soon at a stocker at a store located in a dangerous area. When going there for the hiring process I had a very creepy encounter with a lady, I'm not gonna get into detail too much because it would make this post even longer but basically she was asking for help and I wanted to be helpful and I have a hard time saying no to people but I regret trying to help, I became uncomfortable and didn't know how to get out of the situation(she was saying things that didnt add up and it eventually became clear that she was either not mentally okay, or messing with me and wasting my time for who knows what reason). After that situation I just want to entirely avoid speaking to strangers without coming off as rude. Like would it be fine to just say ""sorry but I dont speak to strangers""? I also hate it when random men stare at me as they drive by or say hi to me when they walk by me (I wish it was them just being overly friendly or polite and they maybe say hi to everyone they walk by but i doubt that's the case with most of them because I think its creepy for grown men to say hi to a girl that practically looks like a middle schooler. So whenever that happens I just pretend I didnt hear them) Another concern I have is getting my phone stolen, phone theft has been high lately where I live so I want to leave my phone at home because I saved up a lot to get it but my mom insists I take it and just have it out of sight in my bag so I can communicate with her so she knows I'm safe. Lastly, how could I deal with creepy men while I work? I've been followed around and overly stared at while at grocery stores before, I looked my worst most of those times and I'm not even pretty, I guess they are just creeps after underage girls (I'm 18 but I look much younger), but I would just leave when that happened, but if Im working in the store I of course wouldn't be able to just walk out and I might be stuck in one aisle for a long time stocking shelves so I wouldnt know what to do. I would really appreciate any advice anyone has on dealing with these situations so I can stay safe and am prepared in case I have to deal with them.

387,"For some backstory, 6 months ago my step dad (my brothers dad) was kicked out for cheating and never watching his son. Slightly before one was kicked out she started drinking casually, then it got heavy.. then he was kicked out, and now I go from babysitting my brother occasionally and seeing my mom a lot, to babysitting my brother to the point that I’ve nearly lost my job and never seeing my mom who’s out bar hopping every single night. During her drinking binge, she’s met this guy (who has a girlfriend, and is moving in November to a different state), essentially they hang out all the time, and she’s fallen in love with him. She’s paying for their hotels, high bar tabs, bought him AirPod pros, brings him coffee and food, etc.. but when it comes to her kids, she hasn’t bought actual groceries since December for Christmas. Her groceries now consist off beer, microwave dinners, and sweet tea and those are suppose to last a month or two... I’ve essentially gone from a caring sister, to a glorified babysitter who has no social life, while my mom who’s 37 years old gets to have the time of her life.. 
All of this has driven me to find an apartment to move in to, which she knows, and my move in date is in August. At this point, I’ve lost all my money for this apartment (I had 3k saved) because I’ve been having to buy actual food, use gas to take him to a babysitter that puts me an hour away from work, and pay for my own car payments, plus my tags are now expired but I have no money.

She recently told me she’s going out of town on a hike, for a week. With her boyfriend thing. Without her kid. This forces me to lose MORE work than I already am, even if she does find a morning babysitter, most babysitters in our area stop babysitting around 3, when I’m suppose to get out of work at 6 if I want an actual paycheck. Or she’s offering to pay for my hotel “anywhere” which I’d also be losing money, and I’d have to pay for all of my own expenses.  I essentially told her i don’t want to watch him without her for that long, and I hate that she didn’t think of coming to me and at least asking if I’d be okay with it before just doing it. She essentially told me that I’m entitled, ungrateful, and irresponsible because of it all.  I wouldn’t mind as much if I didn’t watch my brother from damn near 7am, to 4am every single night, wondering when she’ll be home on a regular basis (while I still have a 10pm curfew). 
In the end, she gave me an ultimatum.. In 2 days i tell her what i want to do... 
I either watch my brother, and figure it out on my own and deal with it, or I don’t watch him and I get kicked out in 30 days, but I don’t get to keep my car, phone, or anything else, just my clothes. 

I want to say no, mainly because I know i have a place to stay at my best friends house, and i could keep my car because the title loan is mainly under my grandfathers name, hers is just a secondary name. The car, any tickets, payment, and whatever else all show his name on there, not hers, and they would help me as long as i can keep paying my car. I could probably get my phone and tablet switched over, it would take time but I could. 
I’m just absolutely terrified of my mom. Ever since I started living with her again, even if I was nice and just giving my opinion, she’d always tell me to ever fight her, or try to fuck her over cause she will always win. Which I’ve witnessed before, and the fact she would screw over her own kid just because she’s an irresponsible parent terrifies me. 

I just need advice, any advice i can get. Legal, money, taxes, home, emotional, just anything I can get.

Hi, I don't frequent much reddit, however I heard it is a very useful way to get information and maybe they can help me.

I have a brother who is 30 years old he was always a very sociable person, He is a dentist, he has a girlfriend, my whole family love him.

I don't want to generalize, I know there are people who can have it all and they are unhappy.

However, from December last year to March, my brother has been acting quite strangely.

It has given him to investigate psychology and philosophy something that would not be strange but is digressing for maybe six hours He talks and laughs with laughter while talking However, nothing he has researched really reads, he has been inventing things for example 

-he thinks he can become a reptilian If you wish
-He thinks Louis Pasteur he was friends with Galileo Galilei
-He thinks he will give Alzheimer he doesn't believe it's possible he is very sure that he will give.
-etc

It is impossible to correct it, if you try to get it out of its error it becomes defensive and starts to get angry

Leaving aside his mania for false information, He has neglected his personal appearance, he came to be with a poop full pants for 3 days.

I can't take him to the psychologist he refuses

My mother thinks they are drugs

I really don't know what to do, I want to help But he refuses any help.

What do you think I have? Is there really any drug that can affect your brain like this or is it bad psychologically?",09Mar2020,1
392," 

Hello everybody, I'm a 22 year old  male and I live with my parents. I live with them since the place I grew  up in also happens to be the city were I go to the university, and  living at home saves me a lot of money.

Ever  since I was little, I would cry uncontrollably whenever my parents  started to argue, and I would yell at them to stop. My parent only  verbally argued as far as I know, but the fights would get very heated  at times. Some stuff would be said that scared me a lot, but they never  started throwing with dishes or something like that. This fear of my  parents fighting stayed with me my whole life, and since a month or 3  has gotten a lot worse. I always fear that the fights might escalate too  much, resulting in something that can't ever mend, even though I don't  think that has happened in the last couple of years.

I  always felt that the worst thing that could happen in my life was that  my parents would start arguing, and parts of my life revolved around  being in fear of that happening, and trying to prevent it from  happening. As soon as they start fighting, I feel like nothing can bring  me joy any more, and I lose interest in everything. I would just wait  and cry till it was over (I never let them see me crying, as they would  tell the other that they made me cry). I don't really have any friends  that I can just go to at times like this, so these feeling always stayed  with me. The only people I have are my siblings, who do not live at  home any more, but I don't want to tell this to them, as they would feel  sad too, even though I don't think it hits them as hard as it does to  me.

My  parents used to fight once every couple of months, with a very big  fight around twice a year. Other than that it used to always be pretty  normal. My parents have been married for 38 years now, and have built  our house together, ran a business they set up from scratch together for  almost 8 years, and pretty much do everything together. But as of  December, things have gotten worse. They had a very big fight, and said  things to each other that really shook me up. It took me more than two  months to somewhat recover fully from that fight, way longer than usual.  Ever since that fight, I started interacting with them more than I  usually did, in order to make them happier I guess? My thought was that  they would could talk to me more than to each other, which could maybe  result in less fights? But ever since then small fights would happen  frequently, and I have a very hard time hanging on, as I feel like I'm  in a nightmare the whole time. Tonight they started a big fight again, I  usually do feel like its more one persons fault than the other. But now  I can't think straight any more, I can't study any more, I can't think  about playing a game any more because I can only think about them  fighting. I just want them both to be happy, and seeing them fight  saddens me so much. I don't think I can move out of my parents house  anytime soon, as I need to be there with them when they fight, to ensure  it won't escalate, and I also know that they would be sad if I left, as  I am the youngest of my sibling, and the last one to remain with them.

Does  anybody else hate it when their parents fight? Do you guys feel the  same way I do? Do you guys have any tips on how to deal with this? I am  just so confused as sad right now. I can write additional paragraphs on  my parents fighting and what that does to me, but I think I've noted the  most important parts now.",09Mar2020,1

I am stuck in such a mess i dont know how to go about it.
I belong to an Indian family and i live with my parents. It all started in December 2018 where i was about to get married to my long time gf with my parents in agreement.
All of a sudden they refused to accept the girl and went all negative on the whole situation.
They started blaming me as to why did i like this girl and why did i put them through all of this.
Now since that time its just been about how i put them through this bs and why can't i just move on because they said so.
Being stupid and having immense love for my mom i did what they asked and broke up with her.
I tried doing everything in my power to move on.
Met girls, partied, did drugs, drank till i lost my mind anything that'll help me move forward but nothing helped.
Now i have reached a point where i am just not happy.
I tried talking to them about this and the only thing they tell me is you are still stuck there and you should try to move forward, have faith in life like it was supposed to happen.
I don't feel the same way and i am just not happy.

So...when i was i kid and was vacation time my dad used to take me with him to his job, he used to cut grass, keep the place clean and all those duties, my mom worked too and they let him take me with him i was a quiet kid so it wasn't a problem.
The other man that worked there (A) it's the ""security"" there, so A was always very friendly and seemed to be good friends with my dad.
I only remember this happening once or twice but he kissed me in the mouth when he said hi and i remember being grossed out because it had so much saliva (still grosses me out) the last time it happened i was wearing a short and a t-shirt nothing weird right? But when we were about to leave my dad said ""I don't want you to ever wear that again"" and i was like okay??

411,"There are three neets in this house. Including myself. All above the age of 21 but still in our twenties. I’m the youngest. 
My dad is the only one that works.
Last year, he told my two older brothers that he wanted them to get jobs by the end of that year. Six months in advance. Also kept reminding them during the later months. 
However, they disrespected his wishes by not doing so. I don’t know if they even tried looking for jobs. 

My siblings and I all have our different issues.
- One lacks motivation. He won’t get a job without consequences. My dad is completely unwilling to kick any of us out no matter what. No consequences were set. 
He also has social anxiety and claims to have undiagnosed avoidant personality disorder.
- Another is a game addict, depressed, has suicidal thoughts. Refuses to get therapy.
- And lastly, me. My parents never had any set expectations for me. Both because I was never very smart, always very quiet (have cognitive language issues and possible undiagnosed selective mutism because of it), and being the youngest, all the expectations were already spent on my older siblings. Being a girl helped too.

I feel invisible, almost. My dad never told *me* to get a job. He knows I’m incapable. 
Years ago, I remember talking to him about me getting a job and he said I didn’t have to. He didn’t care.
If last year, he had told me to get a job as well though... there is no way I could ignore that. 

I can’t understand how my brother’s can just disrespect him like that but of course, I can’t say anything cause I’m really no better for not doing anything my self. My opinion doesn’t matter to them because I’ve never had to deal with the expectations they have had to deal with. I’m just a hypocrite, in any case. 

No one would hire me, anyways. I go mute when people ask me questions. Interviews are impossible.
It’s not like I want a job. Though, I wouldn’t turn one down if offered. Unless it was inappropriate, of course.
But I don’t have connections so that’s not going to happen. 
If my dad told me to get a job, I don’t know if I could actually land one but I sure as hell would try my best and not give up until he gave me permission to... sigh. 

If I were in my dad’s situation, I would be so fed up with us. But he hasn’t said a word to my brothers about the deadline and it’s been 3 months since they officially disrespected it. 
My dad wants us to work. But he also isn’t pushing us very hard.

Might I mention, we’ve all been socially isolated throughout our childhood? Especially me, since I didn’t really attend school, aside from 4 elementary school years. 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th. All other education was given to myself by myself and some textbooks. I don’t recommend homeschooling without a good curriculum and maybe... a teacher.. and someone to keep you accountable.
I’m not trying to use this as any sort of excuse, just a little background, I guess.. 
for even more background:
I’ve been an official neet for about 6 years, since I got my ged. 
One brother has been a neet for 4 years since he dropped out of college. 
The other has been a neet for 1.3 years since he quit work to get a surgery. He has completely recovered since over a year ago. 
thanks for reading, sorry if it’s a bit messy.

I want to know... what you think of all this? Do you think we’re despicable for basically leeching off of our dad as grown adults? Do you think we’re pathetic, selfish, scummy human beings for allowing ourselves to be so unfair? 
What do you think you would do if you were any of us?",09Mar2020,1

He literally lost all of his friends, it started with his very best friend who just out of no where ghosted him, got fed up w him and then preceded to tell his gf (my friend thats why she told me) that he doesn’t have the energy to deal w my bf 

my bf was ok until his other best friend fought w him because he thought he said something wrong while he didn’t but even after he explained his P.O.V he still didn’t talk to him

(mind you both of my boyfriends best friends are also best friends so maybe what the first best friend did affected the other one) 

he only had these two, he’s also incapable of making any new friends since this year he’s homeschooled and without having homeschooling in mind he struggles to open up and make friends with new people. 

i know i don’t have much to do except be next ro him through this rough patch, but i really wanna help, his depression is also causing me to be depressed which is just putting a toll on our relationship and makes me wanna leave. 

i really love him but this is just making him whiny and he zones out alot and can’t focus on any shit.",09Mar2020,1

415,"I’ve been with this girl for about 6 months and we worked incredibly well together. We made each other laugh, smile, the whole bit. We made each other warm inside to no end. This of course was my first real relationship like the title says but I don’t need experience to tell you that there was real love and a real connection there. She had one problem that turned out to be fatal though. She was avoidant with people. Big time. This was a girl who, as she stated, couldn’t bring herself to talk with and be around people on a regular basis. She had periods of time where she would hermit up from, well, everyone, for weeks at a time. The first time it happened I thought that I was being played. Why wouldn’t I? So I reached out to her to have a talk with her about it and she shed some light on the mental problems she deals with, that was believable enough but weeks at a time? That wasn’t quite enough to convince me that this was real between us. I asked around and found out that yeah, she does this to pretty much everyone. Friends, family (that she doesn’t live with), me, everyone. Ok, I feel better now. She gave me her reassurance and I found out that I wasn’t alone in this. I give her the benefit of the doubt and even offer my love and support double time after hearing about what she deals with. But then it keeps happening, far too much for me to be comfortable with. She’d come back and we’d be normal for like a week again, then she’d vanish again. This happens about 4 times so I start to suspect I’m being played again. And if I’m not then that doesn’t really make it any better because a healthy relationship needs quality time just as much as it needs space and the proportions were way off. There’s a lot more I could say but I’m not here to tell the whole story, I’m just here to ask for advice on the immediate aftermath. We come to today, and I decide that I need to end things. At least from a romantic perspective. I told her everything that was on my mind and how I can’t continue to put effort in if it’s not being returned. I told her that it’s hard for me to believe that I’m not being played or at least lied to in some capacity. She owned up immediately. She once again reassured me that she’s not lying to me, and that she wasn’t playing me. She did agree with me though that it’s probably best if we end things, because as time went on she began to feel increasingly guilty for this issue of hers and started convincing herself that she doesn’t deserve me. We talked a little more, and the whole thing happened so honestly and probably in the best possible way it could have. With her never failing to seem genuine throughout this whole thing, and even going as far as to say that she hopes and thinks I deserve to find my perfect person one day, I felt inclined to wish her well right back. I told her that my door was still open despite everything, that she can still contact me because I still care for her and am willing to be there as a friend. She appreciated that and returned the sentiment, and that was that. The hard part of this comes in now. During the talk we told each other how hard this was to follow through on because we still have love for each other. In that way. That’s where it was hard for me to follow through on this, but considering my own needs I felt that I had to. So we’re on good terms, and it probably won’t be the last time we hear from each other, but damn. I’m gonna miss what we had. My question is this: what do the people of Reddit recommend I do as far as the whole self care deal? What can I do for myself while I learn to accept the fact that we’re not together anymore? This is where my lack of relationship experience comes in. This is the first time I’ve had to tough through the aftermath of a breakup and I’d really appreciate some advice. 


TLDR - I decided to break up with my first real girlfriend today. We’re on good terms. There’s no ill will between us, but due to my lack of relationship experience I’d like some advice on how to take care of myself in the aftermath of a breakup.",09Mar2020,1
416,"I found my ex-gf's phone number. I haven't talked to her in two years, but I have a lot to say. What should I do?

I'm young so I understand that I may very well find someone new so this isn't a problem of wanting her back (even though I do), but more so I was in a bad place in my life when I was with her and I could not treat her to the best of my abilities. You see I'm diagnosed bipolar and it generally develops in your late teens. I'd been struggling with my mental health since high school. I started dating her at 18-right about to turn 19- and was honestly spiraling for most of the relationship. I broke up with her on one of my downward mood swings. I wasn't angry, but I was just numb and I had an absolutist mindset as well. I thought if I wasn't always 110% in love with her everyday then it wasn't real. Plus it was a week after my grandfather died so I was in a horrible state. I had attempted killing myself twice before the breakup (she didn't know) and twice after. I ended up in a 5150 and going to an outpatient program with Loma Linda afterwards where I had realized a lot of my own issues and why I acted the way I did. I want to explain to her EVERYTHING because I feel as if she's owed this, but I also understand this is a want for closure (and possibly a friendship) for me. I was 19 then and it was a fairly short relationship with a lot of emotional history. I'm 21 now. 

I understand that what I want is very selfish of me, and I plan to talk over this with my therapist before I do anything. I just would like advice from you guys as well.",09Mar2020,1
417,"First off, I’m sorry if this triggers anyone. I don’t mean to offend anyone at all, these are just the struggles I’m going through currently. 

Let me give you some backstory. To make a long story short I’ll do a quick timeline

2009- my parents divorce, I am 10. (I go live with my mom. She was not a good mom and neglected me so I had to basically raise myself) 
2012- I move back in with my dad. He is jailed and I moved back to Live with my mom in 2014. 
2014-2018- My mom does not let me move back in with my dad after he is released from jail and i I am forced to live with her until i I finish High school. ( this caused my own depression to spiral out of control but, irrelevant) 
2019- i have graduated and moved back in with my dad.

But things are different. My father is not the same person he once was, drugs have consumed him. While I was not living with him, he overdosed 3 times, the third time was on my graduation day...( they told me he had pneumonia). My brother was the one that found him and now he is suffering from alcoholism. 

I moved out 8 months ago because I knew I would fall victim to suicide if I stayed. I visit them sometimes but sometimes I can’t stand it because my dad is always high and my brother of always drunk and it makes my heart bleed. 

I’m visiting then for the first time in a few months and things are even worse. I left for my own mental health, and they cannot help themselves but they are noticeably better when I’m around, but being around them makes my mental health deteriorate. 

What do I do? Do I put aside my own deepening unhappiness to try and get my dad and brother to go to rehab? Do I move back in? I’m so confused. I’m so sad. I need help.",09Mar2020,1
418,"I live with my boyfriend and two housemates in a rented house in London. My boyfriend's Aunt owns the house and we pay our rent to her - she is a very fair landlord and we have never had problems with her in particular.

In November we noticed the kitchen floorboards were falling through - we knew it was the boiler leaking (we put a bowl underneath the boiler to collect the water leak) but it still took two months to get surveyors/builders/plumbers to agree that it was, in fact, the boiler.

A month ago, our landlady (bf's aunt) started the replacement process through her insurance company, and they were to rip the kitchen out along with the lino flooring so that the floor could be replaced. It became clear to the contractors that the floor that it was originally a cowboy job and absolutely everything needed to be replaced. The insurance company promised emergency accommodation, but it never came through. Then they promised a temporary kitchen to be delivered to us, but it never came through.

We have been living out of our lounge that is piled high with old broken kitchen units for a month now. We have a microwave and a toaster to cook our food in. We have tried to adapt as best as possible but have discovered how difficult it is to eat a balanced diet with no kitchen. We are also on a budget as we're all students, so we can't up and leave for paid temporary accommodation and it's crazy how much having no kitchen (and a mess of a living room) affects your mental health.

Without wanting to come across as whiny or spoilt, I'm not sure how much longer it's viable for us to live without a kitchen. We are getting our rent back for the time that there is no kitchen here, but it looks to be another month before any work is even started, and there are so many companies involved in this process that we don't know who to contact to push the process along. It's ridiculous that anybody renting in London should have to live without a kitchen for two whole months and I'm sure that if proper communication between companies was happening, that we would have a new kitchen by now.

How can we speed the process of getting a new kitchen along? Should we put in a complaint to the insurance company? We just need to galvanise someone to do something about this.

TL;DR: our kitchen was ripped out due to a leak - it's an insurance job but in total it's looking like at least two months total that we'll be without a kitchen. Will kicking up a fuss to the insurance company work to push them along in fixing it?",09Mar2020,1

I was like WTF!! She grabbed me by the coller and kissed me again. I pushed her away immediately and she became angry. I left her house and now she isn't speaking to me anymore.

It was fun in the beginning because these were cousins I hadn’t seen since I was a kid and they are all grown up now so a lot of catching up to do. It got to the point where I had become best friends with like 3 of my male cousins, like we did everything together but that got annoying when they just started showing up at my house unannounced almost everyday.

435,"Hey, all! I (28f) have a stressful job that runs 8:30-4:30 Monday through Friday and I have a chronic illness that causes me chronic pain and makes me tired as a result. My wife (also 28f) also has a stressful job, but that runs 2:30-Midnight, and she also has a chronic illness, and hers causes her excessive fatigue. She can sleep for 12 hours at a time, and wake up tired. If she doesn’t have to work, it’s nearly impossible to wake her up before she’s slept at least 10 hours.

Problem is, she stays up until ridiculous hours of the night, so much so that she can only get 7-8 hours of sleep before she wakes up just in time to get dressed and run through a drive-thru for work. She’s often crawling into bed just an hour or two before I have to get up for work. This morning, I have to be in early, and she came to bed 15 minutes before I had to be up. When she comes to bed, though, she’s not considerate at all of the fact that I’m already sleeping. She turns lights on, runs the hair dryer, touches and caresses me, tries to hold conversations me, watches loud videos on her phone, etc. I’ve told her multiple, MULTIPLE times this wakes me up. She can see that it’s waking me, because I don’t take well to being awakened, and I’m, if I’m honest, sometimes nasty when she does. 

When I get up in the mornings and she’s sleeping, I do everything within my power to not wake her. Sometimes she stirs, but I don’t talk, I don’t turn on lights (use the flashlight on my phone, and never pointed towards her), and I walk as lightly as I’m able. I make sure I have everything before I leave the room so that I don’t have to return and wake her. 

Despite multiple conversations, she doesn’t get it, or doesn’t care to get it. I suffered from issues with insomnia when we first started dating (6 years ago) before my illness got worse and made me more tired, and she uses this as an excuse all the time (you don’t ever need sleep!)

438,"My fraternal twin brother recently got engaged! He asked me to be a groomsman. I'm honored, even though I'm sure his religious fiancee insisted he include me because we're family. Of course I agreed. There is a ""groomsman"" Facebook chat talking about the wedding. I don't really love hearing about it every Sunday dinner AND having to keep up with the chat, but okay. Suddenly my brother is removed from the chat, and the secret surprise bachelor party planning starts. We're renting a beach house in another city for $1700 for the weekend. I'm expected to kick in $355. Like 10 other people are coming, but the 5 groomsmen are paying for the massive, luxurious house. These are a mix of strangers, and my old friends that I used to share with my brother in high school/ grade school over 13 years ago. Most still live in the same city as me, we didn't ""drift apart"" or anything. We stopped being friends, and they kept being friends and hanging out with my brother. I'm not perfect, I used to have anger issues and complain a lot. I'm not even concerned over them dropping me as a friend, I accept it (although they weren't perfect friends either, I seemed to be the one they routinely put down and ganged up on socially). The point is should I really have to pay over three hundred dollars to spend an awkward overnight with people who actively don't want to be around me? I can still be part o the ceremony, no one sees the bachelor party. This is like a high-school reunion nightmare for me. I work part-time, and still live at home with no romantic interests at this time. I don't really feel like catching up and comparing my life to my old friends, and we all know the first thing everyone does is compare their ""life resume"": Housing, Job, Love Life, Car. I never take trips or vacations, after food and booze and stuff this is going to end up being like five hundred dollars. I don't even have a car to get there, no one has mentioned transportation. From what I've researched online, if hotels are involved or there's travel expenses the Groom should pay for this stuff. But my brother can't pay  because it's a surprise. And I can't tell him I don't want to go, or talk to him about it because it's a surprise. They asked everyone to confirm being OK with the plans in the groomsman chat, and I didn't say anything. No one said anything about my not confirming or reached out, so they obviously don't even care. Do I ask his Best Man (who seems to be organizing) about bailing? I feel like I should have sooner, but I just didn't want to think about it, and glossed over the groupchat with a tight chest full of anxiety of a few weeks (he asked about it mid February and I haven't said anything since, its in early June). Should I just bite the bullet and go, and try to have fun and reconnect for a couple days? Maybe the anticipation is worse than the actual event, and I should just deal with an awkward weekend 3 months from now.  It would probably be very awkward, these people very consciously decided not to be my friend a long time ago (in some cases, it was a good thing, as some of them are kind of assholes). It feels like one of those things where it'd totally reasonable to bail, but I'll still look like a jerk. ""Oh, we all have to kick in another $90, Shovel bailed on the plans."" This is tearing me up inside. I don't really have any excuses not to go, they gave plenty of time to ask for it off work, and save money, so I'd pretty much have to explain to his Best Man that I don't want to attend, and don't want to pay the money, and seem like a jerk, because his Best Man is not an old friend, I've never met him and he  would have no idea about the complicated social issues. Maybe me and his coworkers/friends I haven't met get along? They have probably all met each other before and I will be the only total stranger/ancient ex-friend, and completely stand out. If it was just a night out at a bar I'd have no issue, but overnights always get weird, spending too much time together out of familiar surroundings. Do I try to leave? Do I just accept it and go?

447,"So I have a friend, let’s call him Joe.

Joe is nice, around my age, and we like to play online games together, but sometimes he gets annoying, destructive or angry when I remove him from a game. Don’t forget, Joe is also my online friend, and likes to be apart of all the games I play.

At the moment, I also have a small group of friends (me, and 2 others) that I have always played these games with. These friends don’t like Joe, because of how destructive he gets when he gets bored.

So my issue is, I can’t remove Joe from the current game me and my friends are playing because otherwise he gets angry, and I don’t like to hurt people, or neglect them. Also, my IRL friends don’t like Joe because of the constant destructive stuff he has done in the past and the stuff he is doing on our current game to annoy them. At the moment, I have 2 servers set up, with the exact same world and all. I have 1 where I play with Joe, and 1 where I play with my IRL friends, because I don’t want to push Joe away but I don’t want to give up on my IRL friends. At the moment I’m just swapping between servers, but things get out of place fast and I don’t like lying to the groups, saying I’m doing something else but am actually talking/playing with my other friend.

I don’t know what to do. I can’t keep swapping and lying as I really don’t like it, I don’t want to push Joe away or hurt his feelings, because from what he tells me his home life is trash, but I also don’t want to just stop playing with my IRL friends.

I know this is probably silly, although I really don’t wanna hurt anyone’s feelings and I don’t know how to approach this without hurting multiple people

448,"Hi reddit. Basically I’m travelling at the moment around Australia for one and a half months and then going to move to south east Asia for two and a half months (Bali, laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam). The only issue I have is this- I have seen that many flights have been cancelling because of the dreaded corona virus and my worry is that I will get stranded in south east Asia if I go. Like what if one of those countries go in lock down and we can’t leave whilst we are there? I’m not worried about getting corona or anything, it’s more getting stuck in south east Asia because a lot of people have been warning me about this. Is it a risk to travel around there at this time because of flight cancellations etc? Shall I just leave out south east Asia and do it another time?",09Mar2020,1
449," We live in a mobile home park, in a RV/tiny home spot. There are a few other RVs and tiny homes here but it's mostly mobile homes. We are also fairly new to living in an RV. We have an area with grass and our RV is parked on it but we have a bit of extra space, which is our 'lawn'. Lately cars have been parking in front of our RV on our lawn, and it's been a few different cars. At first we assumed it was the neighbors, but even when they had plenty of parking space people were still parking on our lawn. They sometime's will park almost directly in front of our door, and often park right up close to our dog's gate. They know people live here because our light is on at night when they park here. We have no idea who these people are or why they keep parking here. Most of the people who live in this community speak Spanish and we don't. Many of these cars stay over night, and many times they have left wheel marks into the dirt and ruined our lawn. It feels like an invasion of privacy and we're not really sure what to do.

Here we go: I feel like this isn’t that deep or serious but it’s bothering me more than It should. So as the title states, I pick at my skin when I’m stressed. Even if it’s THE SLIGHTEST amount of stress. I pick till it bleeds and then I let it scab and then I’ll pick at the scab. Sometimes I’ll pick till theres a dent in my skin. Kinda like a mini crater. And that shit gets messy cause it bleeds a lot. I normally do it on my upper back,left cheek and sometimes my right cheek (the cheeks on my face of course) and I have SO MANY scars from this. I’ve lost so much confidence cause of it. (I also pick at my scalp but my hair is long so those are covered) I want to stop so bad but idk how. This feels like an addiction. I know it’s weird to put it that way and I probably shouldn’t but idk how else you describe it.

We talked like 3 times and 2 times of that she hit on me (first she asked me how old I was and when she heard I was 2 years younger than her she said ""Oh fresh meat"" and winked. Second time she sat on my lap and put my hands on her ass) Last week I discovered her on instagram and I saw that we have a lot of the same interests. Like 90% of her interests are mine too, and I always liked her personality. So I followed her and I liked her photos she posted and she liked the photos I've posted since she followed me back. I asked a friend of mine who still knows her about her and she said that this girl was just in a slutty phase when I met her and that she changed now.

459,"It's like I have no incentive to study right now. Chemistry is relatively easy because its biochem and we went through it before in biology, almost nothing new. Biology is easy, it's genetics which I went through years ago. Psychology is easy to understand, though I may not remember all the specific studies. English and Finnish are easy. The last subject, math is the only one I'm having difficulties in. It still feels like I can't get anything done though. I don't study math. I don't know where to even begin. Revising past topics seems kind of pointless since I'm relatively well acquainted with them and it feels like I could be doing something more fun all the time. 

There's just not much new relevant information I need to study. I know I can just revise a bit before the exams and do well, so I don't see the point in  doing that now. And I genuinely mean a bit, like not cramming or anything. So I can chill? But I also feel like I'm wasting time and could be so much more productive. I'm not doing anything outside of going to class. I'm not motivated to exercise or anything. I see no point in going to school.

It's just so boring. I have nothing to do and I know it's my fault. I'm trying to find a job but no one is hiring here. I feel like a complete waste of space and I have no idea how to change.

I just want to sleep or game or socialize, so I think I'm just lazy. I can't really find anything I truly enjoy right now. It's all so dull.

i won't do anything i don't find interesting, i have D.I.D. (multiple people in my mind) and i have no talent, i've been trying youtube for 3 years but nothing.

i have no want or need for university the only things i enjoy are sitting on my ass and watching anime or youtube, i hate exercise and not even cause its 'hard' i got ripped at 15, went to the gym everyday for like 6 months but i still hated it and now refuse to go.

im still quite young but that doesn't nullify the pain and hatred i feel to humans i have quite unpopular opinions:

\-im a Mid-Vaxxer (get vaccines but they do cause serious damage in like 40% of cases, not really visible damage but allows super-viruses to get in)

\-I think Climate Change is a natural thing (just look at history, the reason we're warm is casue our   
 magnetic poles are moving and our magnetosphere is becoming thinner)

\-Voting doesn't matter, the government puts who they want in charge, and the ones they dont want they kill (Jfk, Lincoln, etc.)

yes i know people care about me but what does that matter?

Well, the boss doesn't take that well, and forwards my email to him, sort of calling him out.

He responds to the email saying it slipped his mind, but he sent me another email privately saying ""thanks for throwing me under the bus! you could've tried to email me...""

And honestly, past problems aside, it honestly *was* kind of a dick-move on my part. I didn't even make an attempt to contact him, or even ask around before emailing our boss to ask.

463,"I will try to give all the possible info I can. My wife and I have been together for 12 years now, married 5, dating the rest. A year into dating she bought a puppy, Kilo, it wasn't the best choice since only she was allowed to have a dog, and she stayed with me a lot, since she didn't really like her room mates, but we still spent a good amount of time with him, and he never wanted for anything. The biggest issue was that we never had a chance to properly socialize him with other dogs and people. He is a Boxer, Shar-Pei mix, so high energy, extreme protection mode. When we first got him he was perfect for my wife. I was gone most weekends traveling for sports, and since she is so petite having a large dog like him was great. An added bonus at the time was that he hated all new people that weren't me, her, or a tiny group of people he knew. Fast forward to now, he has become a bit of a nightmare. When we first had my son, now 4, Kilo seemed to really like him, but once he started walking, Kilo basically growls at him constantly. For whatever reason, he does not react the same to my daughter who is 3. There was one time Kilo turned and nipped my son in the face, best we can figure, our son pulled his tail or poked him, and being eye level just kinda set him off. I know this part will make everyone scream at us that we should have done something then, we just didn't see what happened first. Kilo tuned at him really fast, then ran away. It was not something he just ran over and bit my son for no reason. Other than this, he has never bitten anyone. We have to lock him up when we have company because most people we hang out with, do not know how to handle him at first, i.e. ignore him and don't react. That is hard to do since he is so intimidating. He is about 75 lbs, and pure black, even his tongue, so he is very scary to see. He has always had extreme stranger danger, especially with new dogs, no matter what size. He will go after any new dog he sees, but he has also always listened to me when I tell him to come back or stop pulling and such. When we leave the house we have to put him in the kitchen since he ""marks"" on literally everything in the house. 

We have always had a good deal of stress with him, but he was our first baby, and he has no serious health issues, and the behaviors he does have we have accommodated as best we can. He has cysts all over his body, but none seem to cause him any pain, he has a great appetite, jumps and runs like a horse still. Here is why I am making this choice now, the other day I let him out back to potty, I was in a rush so I didn't use the rope, I know, my fault, I really dropped the ball, but he ran straight into my neighbors yard and almost attacked their \~20lbs dog. My neighbors were amazing, and wouldn't let us pay for his vet bill to be checked out. They also didn't report it since we all agreed the he just charged and did not actually attack. So now the problem has become our neighbors as well.

Here is where I need help, everyone in my family has told us that we should just put him down. I know that since he has bitten a kid he would not be taken in at any shelter, even if it was provoked. I have been his biggest advocate and have fought to not go down that path. I think a lot of it is because I feel so guilty with how he is now, because I feel like we really let him down by not doing more in the beginning. I know it could just be him though. We have a another dog, a pit bull, who is ""mine"" and we raised her the same way, and she was even a stray for a while before I took her in. But she is the absolute sweetest dog ever, the kids climb on her and play with her all the time, and she doesn't even bat an eye. I also have a big problem with putting down an otherwise healthy dog. I considered training programs with him, but money is tight with us having 2 kids in daycare full time, and all of our other bills. If I could find someone that would agree to take him in, and keep him until his days are up, that would be the best solution if I couldn't find a reasonably priced trainer. I am doing everything I can think of to not have to make that awful choice. I have done a great deal of complaining, but damn it I love this dog. He deserves better than this. I am tearing up at work just thinking about it. I am not even sure if I can make that decision if it comes down to it. If I am being delusional, tell me, my wife is struggling as much as me because this is ""her"" dog.",09Mar2020,1

467," On mobile warning and throwaway account. So a little background for the question. 

I was the shipping manager for a small business for 4 years. Most of the time I did the entire job myself. For a few months I had someone else working with me but once they left it was just me again. Every temp after that either stopped showing up after the first day or didnt have the right skills for the job. When I had help there was enough down time that I could help out in production or collect trash and take it out (there was no janitor here). Once I was on my own again I didnt have any extra time anymore but they still expected me to help out. When I told the no I needed to get such and such done I was always meet with hostility. Maybe not verbally but I could tell in their body language and how short they were with me after I told them no. They really did not respect my time or me at all. 
Everything came to a head when I went home sick Friday (they decided to paint the floors and ceiling during work hours in winter. When the window or doors couldnt be open) and stayed off till Wed. The chemical smell gave me a very bad migraine and I didn't want to go back when they were still painting. So I waited till 100% before actually going back. 
Going in on Wed I was meet at the door and was told to head into the front office.  I was meet with the production manager and the front receptionist and they told me that we are parting ways. They went and gathered all the things that were in the office I used and the locker and gave them to me in a box. They wouldnt even let me go to the break room to get my food from the fridge. 
They noted a few things in the separation letter but it all come down to 'insubordination'. The things that were noted I was never talked to about or written up for. 
This place was a mess. There was no hierarchy so everyone just did want they wanted regardless of what they should be doing. I was constantly asking people who have been there for years to do things like they were suppose to(like I was taught) so that my job wouldnt be as stressful but it was always meet with serious resistance. I was at my ropes end by the end of this. 

In the end I'm happy to be gone from that place. It was destroying my mental health. I had so much anxiety at night about having to back the next day that I would wake up 2-3 times a night and have a hell of a time falling back asleep. Most of the time it was back to a light dozing before I was jerked awake by my anxiety again.

So I wanted to know how to answer the question of why I was fired without going into that much detail in the interview and without saying to many negative things  about the previous employer. This is a huge chunk of work history so it's not like I can leave it off my resume.  I have a job interview today and I'm already terrible at these without adding all this extra drama to it. Any advice would be great.

475,"Back in January my husband and I found a secret TikTok account his daughter had been hiding from us. She knows we think she’s too young for social media, and was using it only when she’s at her mothers for the weekend. A month old account had over 900 videos and thousands of followers.

At this time we alerted her mother, explained the dangers of posting public videos that show her face, and explained we care about her and fear for her safety. I also tried my best to explain that there’s a lot of bad shit on the internet that she really just doesn’t need to see right now. 

At first she promised to delete the account, but we saw she immediately was posting new videos as soon as she got back to her mothers for the weekend. When we got her back, she tried to lie about not deleting the account. My husband lost his mind at her screaming (which he does feel terrible about). We were just both at wits end.

She deleted the account after all that went down. I monitored for a while but all ultimately seemed well and I stopped checking for new accounts after a bit.

Yesterday a friend mentioned TikTok and it reminded me I hadn’t checked for a while just in case. Lo and behold: I find an account created by his daughter February 16th. It has over 200 videos and some of her followers are very clearly adult men. 

My husband and I have discussed this, but we really have no idea how to proceed. She has lied to us every step of the way at this point, and any time we ask WHY she feels the need to make and post videos we get the response of “everyone is doing it” or “I’m bored”. Is there anything we can do to get through to her about this? I remember when I was maybe 12 and I definitely thought I knew everything and my parents were idiots for thinking anything I was doing wasn’t safe.

An important detail: We don’t have much control over what happens at her mothers house. Some of the new videos she’s posted make it clear her mother is aware she’s back at it and just doesn’t care, so getting her mother on board with taking the phone away or something is unfortunately not at option.",09Mar2020,1

- I closely monitor my own productivity and enter an appropriate amount of time in the time sheet. All with the reasoning that I simply do the same job for the same money, just in less time. ""My"" company does not suffer from this, at least in theory. 

- Option B: I take the hard path and talk to my boss about it. Sounds fine, right? Well, I feel terrible talking about stuff like that in real life and have big problems with ""acknowledging my own value"". I know that it probably didn't sound like that earlier, but in reality it was a close friend of mine who brought this up to me after I told him how I sometimes feel about my work. Before that, I even thought that I was unproductive and still am not very confident... 
I also don't like the idea of getting a higher paycheck than my coworkers and feel more comfortable with simply ""using my time more effectively"".

This probably sounds way to narcissistic and self-centered, I know...

479,"Im 13 and well i have been through lots of moves, city to city and country to country and because of this i couldnt spend lots of time with my friends...  mostly 1 or 2 years before i move again.. was in uk for 5 years somehow. 

I was in my native country for abt 6-8 years. Moved to different cities every few years. Then we moved up a city in the north of the country. Only stayed there for about a year but had the MOST precious memories there. Mostly my friends. And i miss one of then A LOT. Sadly and stupid me didnt try to get his contact. 

I have been so eager to meet him. I just dont know how i can get in contact with him. I am literally dying to meet him. Was the best guy u could ever have. I have made such good friendship with him in one year. Made more memories with him than my friends in uk..

Is there anyway i can reach out to him. Only know his full name... please help",09Mar2020,1
480,"I go to this gym often and I see this gorgeous girl all the time. At first I had a slight crush on her, but she always looks mad or serious so I didn't dare to approach/befriend her. At times I would see her interacting with other male coaches/members and she looks friendly. So I try to smile at her whenever we make eye contact but she always just looks away looking pissed. 

One time I was using this cable machine. I put my towel on it and my water bottle is also right next to it (showing that it's occupied). I went away for a couple seconds to wipe my sweat with a paper towel, only to come back with her taking over my machine. I walked over and stood there. She didn't even acknowledge me so I had to take my stuff away (yes I'm a pussy).

The other time I also had my things on a bench. She also put her bottle on the bench and stood in front of it. This time I was super annoyed so I stood behind her and didn't leave. She then proceeded to take her stuff and leave without ever looking at me or acknowledging me at all. 

I don't understand what I ever did to her that made her dislike me that much? Seeing that she is friendly with other guys at the gym made me wonder whether it's because I'm a female.

I'm annoyed and I wonder anyone else has similar experience and advice... (I know I shouldn't care that much but still...)",09Mar2020,1
481,"I will start with a bit of backstory. I was 7 years old when my family and I moved to Thailand and I have been living here since. It's been 10 years now and I'm currently in the process of obtaining my IGCSE's and moving onto A levels before studying to become a doctor. However, due to a very unpleasant economic situation in my home country, we are forced to move back. I'm not acquainted with anyone in Russia, and language will definitely be a massive barrier. It would be impossible for me to attend a Russian school at this point but without qualifications I am unable to go to university or get a proper job (to my knowledge). My best bet is to try an online A level course and with some good luck getting out of there to an English speaking country.

Just last night he texts me saying he's trying to ""make things right with people"". That he ""fucked up big time the other day""

486,"I am a 19 year old student about to enter university this year. I have a British and Australian passport available to me, as well as £10,000/AUD $20000 in disposable income that I have saved over the years. I am very fortunate that my parents are willing to pay my university fees, and so that's not a problem, but as australian fees are lower, I think my parents would happily give me a part of the difference in the fees, as they are anyway slightly biased towards it. 

I feel like I am completely unsuited to Australia, as I am quite a quiet and reserved person, whereas on my recent trip there, everyone I met was very outgoing. I found it quite a draining experience, though the city of Melbourne itself was amazing. I find the more serious atmosphere of London (in my opinion) more suitable to my personality. 

I am faced with a decision, since I do not intend to settle in either country after uni permanently, as, while I will be taking a PPE (London) or a business/comp sci (melbourne) course, I am looking to launch myself into a career in the arts, preferably in writing/directing. 

I would like to know which city is better to live in, with my goals, and which country will afford me better options to live a nice life, as well as to invest the money I have over the long term (and therefore which has the better investment environment and long term potential) .

489,"I just moved departments within the same company and I already feel I have made a HUGE mistake.

There was something from the beginning that made me doubt / feel sceptical that this was a good decision. Which is why I was debating taking the job when it was offered. However I tried to look beyond that and go with all the advise/ well wishes from peers that this is a great career choice etc.

I have only been in the job one day, but what has been asked of me was not, in my perception, how the job was described. At the interview I was told the job posting was more of a generic description, but I actually preferred the sound of what the job would actually entail. However after begining the job, it seems an extreamly large component of it involves skills/ knowledge that I simply do not have. This certain skillset/ knowledge (SQL) was mentioned as a requirement of the job, I do not have this and never mentioned it in either my cover letter or resume. During the interview the fact I lacked this skill was never brought up, so I assumed it wasn't a big issue.

On my first day I was assigned a work task that requires a great understanding of this particular skillset. I have no idea where to even begin in this task. Im not even confident that the computer program I think I need to use, is correct. There isn't going to be has been any form of training, I believe it is assumed I am able to just 'begin'. I have been sent  multiple reference links to information about the existing systems but a majority of them don't make sense as I have no background knowledge.

On top of the lack of knowledge comes the work environment. Although I knew, signing the offer letter, the location was out at different location (which was never mentioned prior to the offer letter) I convinced myself this wouldn't be an issue. Despite the fact my previous position allowed 3 days per week work from home. The new manager is allowing me to work from home one day a week, which I do appreciate as I know that group don't have any other employees doing that right now. However one day at home and the other 4 days still being 13 hour days (from getting up in the morning to getting home at night) is just too much both physically and mentally (4 hours commuting each day). The new manager did also say that someone does/ should be there everyday, so the possibility of me working from home more, in the future, seems very diminished.

I feel extremely foolish for proceeding with this position and for seemingly wasting ALOT of people's time and effort. I feel this position is far from a good fit for me, and think I'd rather face the ridicule of leaving it, than staying. Not only do I not have the skills,  it's not something I can quickly pickup and learn like I have in the past with new software. My previous manager has said he would gladly take me back. My previous job wasn't as challenging as I'd like HOWEVER the people and the manager and the lifestyle it allows (working from home 3 days a week) are a massive benefit that I don't think I should take for granted.

Sorry for the long post! Any advice would be appreciated...",09Mar2020,1
490,"There was a situation where my friend’s (let’s call him B) adopted brother got some guys together and they set me up in a robbery. I can’t say much as for legality sake, but my reaction ended up getting me arrested. Obviously I made some mistakes and let my anger get the best of me and these guys, who I had all once been cool with, got off free. B’s brother had been in my house hanging out two weeks earlier, and then he did this. I don’t know if B knows about what his brother did or even that his brother was involved. I’ve seen him at church recently and didn’t get the chance to say anything specifically about the situation, but I did talk to him. Due to the nature of the situation, I don’t think B’s brother said anything to B in order to save his own ass. The cops called B’s brother that night, and he denied he’d even been there. B’s adopted brother is involved heavily with dealing in coke and other stuff aside from doing the stuff. Him and his fiend friends set up and rob people all the time from what I’ve learned now. He doesn’t have a job and as far as I know, B’s mom still supports him and he lives under her roof. I’m wondering if I should say anything to B about the situation and what should I say?

497,"My Wife, Daughter and I have a vacation booked with EF Tours through my daughters High School. It's scheduled to take place in June. The destinations are Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and Austria. I've got about $15k tied up in this trip for the 3 of us, and that's not including incidentals while we are gone; spending money, if you will. The issue is, with all of the Covid-19 (coronavirus) scares right now, I think the trip should be canceled.

The teacher in charge of the trip (and making the traveling decisions for 100+ people) keeps repeating that ""this is just a bad flu"" and ""I really feel everything is just blown out of proportion"" and ""It's as safe to travel as it's ever been"". I feel this is terribly irresponsible of her, and have asked her to cancel the trip for everyone's safety. If the board of education cancels this trip (the teacher I've mentioned would have to recommend this), then my travel insurance will kick in and I will be able to get most of my money back. If not, I have no recourse other than to cancel now, and incur $7500 in ""cancellation fees"", or wait in hopes that things get better, and risk receiving $0 as a refund (the amount you receive diminishes the closer you get to departure).

I should mention there is another family booked on the trip that share my concerns. Their concerns are also being pushed aside by the teacher.  I'd like to go above the teachers head and put pressure on the Board of Education to cancel this, but it feels like a bit of an asshole move. I could use some advice, thanks in advance!!",09Mar2020,1

My 'spending' kinda started when my fiancee and I realized that we could get nice things if we financed them (made monthly payments, but you have to have a good enough credit score to finance) so when we went to the MOA (mall of america) in February we financed some things. He got a huge TV and I got a really nice custom big beanbag chair, then two days later our one car we had completely stopped working in the middle of driving it, so we went to a dealership and got a new car, so we are paying for that now as well. We also just moved to a new apartment so that is also bigger and more expensive. 

Now that I have more room in my home, I've been buying all sorts of stuff (bookshelves, a new computer desk for the fiancee (he has had that old desk since at least 2004), nightstands for our bedroom and floor lamps and all that). I also started playing Dungeons and dragons and I am obsessed with dice, like I cannot stop buying them, all kinds of different metal dice and creative looking dice. I also have spent on my monthly bills and groceries and any other expenses. 

Now I just want to say that I am not currently in any debt and I am not living outside my means, I just took a step back after buying some dice on amazon yesterday and i realized how much dice i already had and I felt really guilty.

I live with my sister. We work together. I got involved with a man 20 years older than me. We work together. No one knows about it but we have been ""dating"" for 10 months. I had a key to his place. We said we love eachother. He has been very manipulative. I know he has followed me. I don't know if he knows where I live now. We just moved. He knows where my ex and I used to live. He knows where my sister and I work since we all work together. We have had a rough ""relationship"" with a lot of trust issues. He has given me reason to believe that he was cheating. While he was asleep, I made the stupid choice to take his phone and leave. I saw he was talking to a lot of women-one who he said was his ex but from reading texts she still believes they are together. He was having sex with a lot of women. When I got back, he was outside. I ran inside to get my stuff and leave his phone. My stuff was not there. He ran in and started pushing me, holding me down, pulling my hair, hit me in my face telling me to give him his phone. It felt numb but there is only a scratch on the inside from my tooth hitting my lip where he hit me. He almost threw me down the stairs. I gave him his phone. I told him to give me my stuff. He said give me his key. I took it off the keyring and said give me my stuff and I will give you your key. He chased me around outside and a neighbor saw us. He grabbed a big rock and made holes and dents on my car and tried to bust the windows. I recorded him while he had the rock but my phone died before I could get footage of him hitting my car. He finally showed me where my stuff was and when I was grabbing it the key fell somewhere. He told me to find it while he kept hitting my car. I had the chance to run for my car and he chased me. I drove off while he ran and continued trying to bust the windows and hit my car. Even when I waited for the gate to open. While I was driving I called the number of the ""long distance girlfriend"" who has been manipulated just like I have. He was visiting her a couple times a month while we were together. I called her twice. She didnt answer. and he called me to say that I am calling numbers from his phone now. I said no. I think she called him and told him my number called her phone because we are from the same area in Nevada. I stopped calling her. I called him and told him we need to figure out how we are going to proceed since we work together and that we both need to stay away from eachother. He said he called the cops because I stole his property and sensitive information and that they will be at my work in the morning. He knows what time I work. I am scared. I know he has stalked me.

509,"A year ago, I hurt someone's feelings, and tried to apologize to them as I felt remorse. They took the opportunity to tear into me, yell at me and really hurt me. It was out of proportion. This led to us arguing and a cycle of anger with both sides and I talked crap about them later. Each time we talked and I tried to apologize they'd hold what I said a year ago against them and tear me apart when I told them I'm sorry. I started realizing that this person will never forgive or forget, and they will continue to tear me down for a stupid thing I said last year.

Fast forward this year, our past convo I told them to leave me alone. Yesterday I spoke to them and it seemed reconciliation was really happening, and we were getting somewhere. Then they misinterpret something I said, gaslit me and tore into me again, making comments about my loved ones. They said ""you need to feel the pain like I did"" which I never made comments about loves ones, and they are reacting disproportionately. After a while, they apologized for ""coming so hard at me"" and we forgave each other. But I feel beat and like this person will never forgive me, they'll turn on me again and punish me, and I tried to explain that every time I try to apologize and be the bigger person they take it as an opportunity to abuse me. They shared this story about nails in a fence which basically comes down to ""damage is done, it won't be the same again"" and are talking about teaching me a lesson. I find this so out of proportion and they blame me for everything when although I started it, they prolong it and continue it.

I had a very toxic friend who we can call Sophia that I had known since kindergarten. I’ve realized now what a dickhead she was. She got mad if I expressed an opinion that she didn’t agree with and she always used personal attacks when we argued. She didn’t like when I succeed and always tried to find something wrong in everything I accomplished. She laughed at my suicide attempt 2½ years ago when we still were friends. She threatened to kill my dog as well. That’s the main reason I broke of all contact in January 2019. She was just dragging me down.

&amp;#x200B;

In May 2019, she logged onto the same game and server I used to play on, and asked if I'm still mad (which I never was, I was just tired of having such a toxic friendship). I told her to fuck off. Then she texted my number, asked again if I'm still mad.

Me and Sophia have a common friend who we can call Brad. Cause Brad is a cool name. Brad said he had told Sophia a lot about me and my bf because he didn’t suspect anything at first. He told me yesterday that he has been more careful about what he has been telling her because she seems to be very jealous. However, Brad did tell her I have a boyfriend. This happened a while ago. Me and my bf got together in September.

That’s when Sophia got really interested. She has asked Brad if me and my bf have sex and when we fucked the first time. She asked Brad to screenshot my bf’s Instagram and send it to her, which he did not. Brad told me Sophia had said my bf is ugly, and that the reason he doesn't post selfies is because he is ugly. Brad also told me Sophia had spread rumors about me and my bf to some childhood friends who I cut contact with years ago for unrelated reasons

I’ve told Sophia to fuck off every time she has tried to contact me. I’m very clear I want nothing to do with her. Sophia has tried to follow me and my bf on Instagram from 3 different anonymous accounts, another common friend confirmed that it is her accounts.

I feel I’m letting her walk over us. I especially feel bad for my bf, he has nothing to do with this and I feel like a bad partner. I'm letting Sophia spread rumors and talk bullshit about him. I want to defend him but I don’t know what to do. At this point, I’m so frustrated I can’t sleep nor focus on anything else, and I’m really thinking about meeting up with her and make it clear she better leave us tf alone.

She used to get all frustrated whenever I tried to talk about things I am passionate about . I decided to ignore that and despite this we grew even closer in next two years . But since the start of our senior year she has been trying to copy me and if I tolerated her jealousy it was because it did not effect me that much but when someone copies me , I just can't stand that person and now I don't know how to kick her out of my life . I can go for making her understand that I am not okay with her doing this but I am not good at all with confrontations.  She even once mentioned that if I'll take astronomy as a major in college she will do the same which is quite illogical since she loved interior designing and she was sure that she will go for that . She talked to her mom about letting her study in China if I am going to college there . I should mention that before I told her about my plans of moving to China she had never even talked about China . 
And then there are everyday things she does that I do . She  puts up same story on instagram as me . She does her best to learn sketching because I sketch and If some guy tries to talk to me , she will  text him too . Plus she never wants to leave me alone with our other friends . If someone wants to spend time with me she immediately develops hate for that person . 
I really like this  guy from the college , he's my brother's friend  and I am well aware of his huge crush on me but since I told my best friend about his crush on me , she has been trying to talk to him on instagram and when I asked her why, she said she needs to check if he's good enough for me . That was a ridiculous reaosn since she has no need to do that . I decided to not talk to him because I am afraid that she will eventually mess things up . 
I really do love her like sisters . And I do not want to hurt her but she is getting on my nerves . I don't know how to talk to her about this but I honestly want this to stop . Any advice on how should I get rid of her or this situation?",09Mar2020,1

I took injections monthly for migraines in addition to a pill the neurologist prescribed. During that time, I was still able to graduate college, with little to know family support. I had to work 2 or 3 jobs depending on my need and pull out loans. Trying to convince my parents I was in pain, was not successful. They themselves are immigrants but also pretty toxic. The mentality is that depression doesn't exist or that I'm overly dramatic. My mom would mock me even after I had sent myself to the hospital for self harm. 

Now I've begun graduate school, and I'm a year in. It's for education and I'm not liking the area I'm teaching as well as my workload being insane. I have four classes to prepare for and teach a student outside of my class during one of my periods. I also have a ton of paperwork. In addition, I'm in graduate school nearly full time because I need to finish my certification in order to work. I ended up dropping a class that has set me back a semester. I am really having second thoughts. Friday, I ran out of a classroom with chest pain and threw up on myself. I have people telling me well you can't just quit, but I am dying internally. I do know that I have nearly 90,000 in student loans and half way through this program but I would like to switch my degree to an M.A. in Foreign languages, what I got my undergraduate degree in. I just know it isn't a safe choice. Although my tuition will be paid, I only receive about $600 a month in stipend money which isn't enough. I just feel physically and mentally drained and out of it, that I either cry or feel nothing at all. People keep saying ""you have to find out for yourself what it is you're meant to do"", but honestly I need advice. I'm sinking and quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Suffering with health issues, and I'm in school and working. Should I drop the degree I'm working on and find another path?",09Mar2020,1
514,"I was looking for some advice on how to do this. I’ve looked at apartments in different places but honestly when it comes down to it i’m not sure what to do. I want to live in a different state, how would i start this process?",09Mar2020,1
516,"so my sister moved in with me recently (she's 14) because my dad has cancer and my mom checked out years ago,so anyways yesterday i was lounging around in my room and she was in the living room. and she had her friend over and they were making a huge mess in the living room, and this annoyed me to death because my house is clean literally all the time. so i walked by 4 times and each time i told her to clean up after herself and on the 5th time i just snapped i said ""clean this fucking mess up,have you lost your damn mind"" she started crying and i didn't know what to do so i just left and went to a bar and got really drunk,then i came home and passed out on the couch still with a bottle of alcohol in my arms, and this morning i had the worst hangover and i had to call in sick to work, and my sister left for school without saying a word. now i need to know how to fix this, i'm new to taking care of a child but i'm pretty sure it's a bad example to come home blackout drunk,and also i don't like to cuss in an angry manner towards children, but how can i fix this?",09Mar2020,1
517,"So this thing came to light a couple of years ago and the way my husbands family handled it bothered me almost as much as the events themselves. Be warned, this is a long story. I’ll keep it as short as possible without sparing the important deets.
My husband(32M) and I (31F) were high school sweethearts and have been married for ten years. He has a younger sister who married this military macho dude who became a police officer a few years after they married (5ish years ago). My husbands family was always pretty close. they liked to take vacations as a group and spend Christmas all together even as they became adults. The whole group would always drink a lot. It was expected and anticipated. Well, a couple of times when we were the last two standing, BIL and I, both Leo’s butting heads if you buy into astrology, made out a little bit. A little feely feely. I somehow kept enough judgement to never let it become sex- believe me he tried really hard. And tried a lot of times throughout the years. 
I eventually realized through other unrelated lapses of judgment, that I should stop drinking. So I did, and now I just had to constantly be on guard against his feely hands at every family event despite telling to stop. I had to go to bed before I was tired to keep him off of me, despite repeatedly telling him no. At the Fourth of July gathering right before my sons first birthday, bil, probably drunk, tries to grab my boobs in the kitchen otw to the bathroom, I tell him off.  Next thing I know, he’s taking the older kids for a ride on the riding mower in their huge yard. I turned my back for a minute on my baby sitting in a baby pool splashing around. I turned around when the screaming started, to see my baby wedged underneath the lawn mower. I flipped my shit, we showered the mud and grass clippings off, made sure nothing was broken and left in tears.
Thanksgiving and Christmas loomed near, and I wasn’t comfortable spending the night anywhere bil would be, so I had to tell my husband everything. I made the decision to be transparent about it all and I didn’t care if everyone knew the truth. I hid nothing. I told him about the constant sexual harassment and about the couple times I was stupid drunk and let him kiss me. BIL chews tobacky and is a disgusting person I would never even in a drunken state initiate that. Regretfully, the lawn mower incident happened and I never got a chance to record anything, never screenshot the inappropriate texts. I had literally no evidence except my word. That’s the point I really should have asked for advice.
When my mil asked if we were spending the night at her house for christmas, I said no, but we could stay late into the evening. She decided to go over my head and called my husband to ask why. He has no tact so he told her the whole thing. The truth all came crashing down, and when confronted at first, bil denied everything! He came clean eventually, but that’s his character. So now I’m into this shit deep. I’m certain everyone believes me though, because I have a damning reputation for being brutally honest to the point of recklessness.
Most of my issue is that my sister in law refuses to ever talk to me about any of this. The whole thing got out of control before I could tell her or talk to her about anything. After being told all this by her mom, she blocked my phone number, and erased herself from my insta and Fb feeds. And my husbands family still (almost 2 years later) includes him and not me in their group messages, ignore my existence but wish him happy birthday and dote on the fact that he’s a local hero(read: cop). I want so badly to just move on, but I also feel like my truth was not thoroughly expressed. It got covered up before I could feel vindicated. No wrongs were righted here, all was forgiven and no one except a few people even know what happened. 
I don’t know what I can even do, but this double standard is killing me. I go back and forth between wanting to tell the world who he really is, and wanting to be the more mature person, and wanting to ruin them all from afar- we live about 3 hours from the rest of the family now. Should I keep suffering in voodoo doll silence or out everybody on their double standard asses? I am a person who likes to clear the air by talking things out, they brush it under the rug. How can I be at peace?! How do people just forgive and forget?",09Mar2020,1

522,"About two months ago my exbf of two years broke up with me, we stopped talking for like three weeks then started talking and fucking around. I was being a girlfriend to a guy that wouldn't call it a girlfriend though. And during that time I asked him straight up if we are talking to anyone else and if he is talking to anyone else and he said no. A few days later the girl he cheated on me with on our 7 months posted a video on Facebook of them together at his house. And I have my cousin and a friend from work saying I'm a stupid clown for even staying or even Missing him and I should never considered the idea of thinking of him. And then I have two other friends saying if it's meant to be he will reach out to me, it shouldn't be me reaching out. One of my work friends said 'if what he truly wants to be with you, he will come to you because you should grow together that's how a relationship works'. And I am so conflicted with the back and fourth different advice, and more then anything I just want to talk to him again, but at the same time I know I shouldn't and I don't know if I should reach out to him or just block him so I'm not even tempted to message him. All I know is I love him and I miss him but everyone else around me has me so Confused.

523,"I am a fifteen year old and I live in the Philippines. I've been considering suicide for many years now. It isn't a daily occurrence but I can't count how many times I cried every night and considered just ending all of it. I didn't grow up in abuse nor in an unhealthy environment. I wasn't bullied in school. I'm fairly open about everything but my feelings. Not once have I felt safe about sharing my feelings to anyone—even my parents. I did, once, but all I got was ""people aren't going to adjust for you""—type of advice and lecture. I figured if I opened up again, I'll be given that sort of response so I never really bothered.

I tried coping through writing as it is my hobby but that didn't last so long since I slowly lost all motivation to even write a single paragraph. I tried distracting myself, but once I stop, every thought I have just come rushing back—so I basically wasted several hours just watching videos and reading mangas and novels. I tried every method I could do but it just goes through a full circle and I have to find another coping method.

My mother is barely present at home. When she is, she's usually busy or she's resting. I really don't want to bother her just because I needed someone to talk with. My father is the one I usually see at home depending on his work schedule. I fear him. I hate it when I forget a task he tells me to do. They are great parents. They mostly taught me a lot despite being a little bit protective—considering the fact that I don't know how to commute with public vehicles. I have friends, I enjoy being with them. They helped me with my studies and we even play games.

I appreciate them a lot, but I never had the courage to even open up to them.              

My father tends to take things a little bit too far. He overreacts with a lot of things especially when my mother points it out to him. He never hits us though, he usually just lectures us in a loud voice. I love him, he spoils me but sometimes he takes things a little bit too far. As much as I hate to say it, he's mainly the source of everything I feel. He asked me to do the dishes once, but someone offered to do it instead and I had no chance to say that I was supposed to do it. I ended up getting lectured about it and it really hurt. It feels like I'm always in the wrong. It always feel like I am an incompetent person.

I don't know how to cook. I try to teach myself but I feel so embarrassed to have people see me struggle and possibly waste ingredients considering the fact that food can be quite expensive nowadays. I fear if I did fail the first try, my father will get mad at me for wasting food. I also don't even have the courage to ask someone to teach me how to tell if a dish is properly cooked already. I also don't know how to iron clothes, I sort of developed a phobia over heat, always fear that I might cause fire or burns on myself because I burned myself quite a few times: first against a steel pipe under the sun, second is dumping apart of my hand on boiling water, and third is hot water splashing down to my feet.

I feel like my inability to do several house chores (namely cooking and ironing clothes) makes me feel useless at home. A failure.

Just recently, my father called me again. He got mad at me for not eating dinner and not washing the dishes (same as before, someone offered). He told me that he was getting annoyed at me and told me if I continued, I'll be getting some of my things confiscated or have a curfew on them. I knew that our housemaid texted him again. I hate the fact that our housemaid has to report everything to him and every ""wrong"" thing I did is a completely trap to get myself in huge trouble.

I know I'm supposed to take responsibility but it really hurts. This wasn't the first time this happened. Every time my father would call my phone just to lecture me, our housemaid always seems to be the reason why. I try to explain myself but everything gets shrugged off.

I don't know why no one, specifically my father, would listen to me. I don't know why I'm always in the wrong. I don't know why they would make me feel as if they would prioritise the housemaid over me. I don't know why I feel as if death would be a relief for me and my family. I am just an incompetent daughter who only gets average grades and can't even cook.

When these things keep happening, I become more detached to anyone. I can never feel safe. I want to tell someone I know about this but there is none. So here I am, ranting as a stranger in this subreddit in hopes of finding anything to put an end on this loophole of agony that makes my chest and head hurt every time.

Our hotlines don't worry here, there's no hope for it. We are not that financially stable to afford a therapist (as if I can ever request for it without getting called mentally disabled). Is there anything I could do to make myself feel better?",09Mar2020,1

She also only posts photos of me when they’re unflattering 

She made up a whole story as to why she’s doing the exact thing as I do with my people with hers and told it to me as if I’d believe it 

More recently she’s been faking an illness and having me run her back and forth to the hospital.

545,"Hey everyone, I need some advice on what to do this week for work. 

Backstory: I work as a waitress at this small, family run restaurant. About 6 tables, I'm good friends with the owners/boss/the family. 2 weeks ago I got into accident at an event and dropped a massive table on my foot, and haven't been able to walk. No breaks, no massive fractures but there's definitely a bone bruise and possibly a small hairline fracture. I was on crutches for a week and a half.

The past 3-4 days I've been walking, just small steps like limping/hobbling from my room to the bathroom, or to the kitchen, and then laying back down. I can put weight and walk on my foot for about 15-20 minutes at a time without prolonged pain. My dog (who's only maybe 4-5 pounds) put his pay on my foot yesterday and I borderline jumped back on my good foot from the pain it caused, I did let out a loud ow. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've kept in contact with my boss this whole time, he tells me to stay rested and to let him know when he's ready. I misjudged my healing and figured I'd be good to work by now but evidently.. I'm not so sure. My typical schedule is 5 days a week, 5 hours per shift but since I'm a waitress there's a lot of idle standing (by the phone), walking to the back to do dishes, running tables, etc OR running tables in general. Either way, it's on my feet for 5 hours.

My Mom has been on my case, she keeps insisting I'm being lazy and not doing anything and just sitting in bed. She says I'm not motivated. She's saying it's going to look like I'm taking advantage of my boss's kindness and she's saying I need to work and I'm more than capable of it. I'm not sure what to do.

548,"Hey Reddit. I don't know where to find help and figured an anonymous way of doing so may be a good start. 
My mother's cousin went on a 1 year catamaran adventure with her husband almost 10 years ago. Through the years, they were sailing across the world until she got pregnant and they decided to settle somewhere. He decided on a Polynesian island some years ago. I can't give out more details so as to keep her safe. I hope he doesn't know of Reddit nor will he search for this.

She's been free to leave before, we've seen each other a couple years ago and everything seem okay until some months ago. She decided she could no longer live on the island and wanted to divorce him, taking their child with her. 
Right after that, he cut her off financially and threatened to kill her if she took their son away. She hasn't worked for herself in years as he is very affluent, and he has a lot of power in this island. She wants to leave but can't leave her child. She is now working in a local market and communicates with my family secretly. She sleeps on their couch in the catamaran and is afraid he might throw her off board one night, but she can't leave because of her child. 

If anyone knows of any humanitarian mission or NGO who might be able to help I'll be very thankful. I don't have many details regarding her situation other than the ones I've already told you. Again, I cannot reveal the location for now, I fear she might end up killed or worse if this get to him or people under him.

-Come to her if she yells from another room

My parents and her parents say that she’s too weak and that her dad trainer her better than that. They also say that she’s just like her mother (who isn’t a good person from what I’ve heard). 

Here are a few of our interactions:

Mom: I was shy why I was a kid but I got over it myself. One day someone skipped the line at a store and I just realized that I had to stand up for myself. I thought that you should be able to do the same.
Me: Sorry...
Mom: So do you want to go to a therapist?
Me: No I’m fine.
Mom: Why not? I thought you did?
Me: I’ll just get over it myself.
Mom: Well we’ve tried that and it’s obviously not working.

Me: *yawns*
Mom: Are you tired?
Me: Yeah why?
Mom: I’m just trying to figure out why you would be tired. Did you go to sleep last night?
Me: Yeah. Why?
Mom: Are you tired all the time?
Me: Yeah why?
Mom: Well someone your age shouldn’t be tired all the time.
Me: Aren’t you always tired?
Mom: Yes but I’m much older than you. 
Me: I’m sorry.
Mom: Why do you always apologize for things?
Me: Sorry I won’t do it anymore.
Mom: Why are you acting like this?
Me: Acting like what?
Mom: Do you really not know what you’re doing right now?
Me: No sor- How am I acting?
*She never actually explained what I was doing wrong*

For this one I was trying to clean something she wanted clean.
Mom: What are you doing? Wipe under the cabinet.
Me: Okay I’m sorry.
Mom: No go back. It’s not clean!
Me (About to cry): I’m trying. I’m sorry.
Mom: Well I can’t figure out why this is so hard for you! Don’t even start with the whining.
Me (Crying): I’m sorry...
Mom: Are you trying to make me feel bad for you? Stop crying.
Me (crying even more): Sorry I’ll stop.
Mom: What is wrong with you?
I went into the family room to try to stop.
Mom: Why are you acting like it’s so hard to live because you have to help *clean*?!
Me (crying): I’m sorry.
*I talked to the social worker at school about it because ever since I had an anxiety attack in gym class, she would call me down to talk about things that bother me. My mom told me that I couldn’t go up to bed until I told her what we talked about. When I did, she told me that I should tell her about things that actually matter because what she said shouldn’t bother me.*

My brother also has a hard time with her. He has trouble listening because he doesn’t pay attention and instead of trying to figure out a solution, she blames it on video game and tells him that he shouldn’t play them as much as he does. When he doesn’t understand something on his homework, she yells at him if he makes “stupid mistakes.”

I’m not asking what I should do about it because it’s not really a problem but I just want to know if this is normal or not. Sorry if I sound bratty or annoying.",09Mar2020,1
550,"I suffer from anxiety which comes in peaks and troughs. One issue I struggle to do anything about is that in my free time (i.e. when I should be relaxing and lowering my anxiety) I get so obsessive over how to use my time that I end up getting more stressed.

For example, I love music but I got to the point where I was downloading several albums a day on Spotify that I felt like I ""should"" listen to, turning it into a stressful chore rather than just listening to the music I wanted to listen to. (I deleted all these yesterday but the urge is still there.) 

I'll do similar things with TV shows, books, games... I'll think things like ""how can I play all these games when I have so much reading I need to do?!"", again turning everything into stressful tasks I need to complete rather than just enjoying myself.

How can I move away from these thought patterns and just enjoy my free time however I want to at the time?",09Mar2020,1

For details, I'm 14 (still young, which is why I'm scared) My friend who I will be referring as Jane is 13. She's a foreigner.

Yesterday, she sent me a photo of her wanting to commit suicide. I tried to convinced her not to, thankfully she listened to me. 

Today, I come to school, worried, and found her with fresh cuts on her left arm. I told her that she shouldn't keep everything inside of her and she should sometimes let it out all because we're here for her. She laughed it off, and I was becoming more worried. I suggested we go to the counsellor's office, but she said no. I think I was crossing the line here, I don't know.

One of my friends (lets call her Emily) who is closer to Jane, told me everything. Emily is also a foreigner. She told me that Jane started cutting herself since last year Dec, and Emily thinks that Jane is being influenced by the media and a singer that cuts herself that Jane likes.

Jane is very stubborn, she doesn't want any help whatsoever and she wants us to ignore everything we saw today, but Emily and I know that's impossible. We really want to help Jane, but now I'm starting to think that maybe Emily and I are annoying. 

I told my parents, but my parents just waved me off saying it's nothing. Still, the thought of her jumping scares me.

These two months, all my friends are slowly telling me these depressing stuff, and I feel more and more lost. I don't know what to do anymore because hell, I'm the same age as them what do I know??

I know that starting things early and studying will make my life easier, but I never do it. It's not just a matter of feeling lazy, I feel genuinely awful and unhappy with life when I'm doing something like this, so I procrastinate.

Part of me wants to risk it to see if I can land the job.

But since the start of our senior year she has been trying to copy me and if I tolerated her jealousy it was because it did not effect me that much but when someone copies me , I just can't stand that person and now I don't know how to kick her out of my life . I can go for making her understand that I am not okay with her doing this but I am not good at all with confrontations.

I should mention that before I told her about my plans of moving to China she had never even talked about China .

Sorry for any mistake, english is not my first language.  


So I'm a special care counselor, working for the school board right now - and i'm just a substitute, on-call. Basically I never know when I'll work or how much. Right now I don't get many hours, so much that I struggle a lot financially. Like it's common that I literally just work 8 or 10 hours a week.  


Today I received a call and a school asked me to work for them for the next two weeks. I'm very happy, as it will basically save my butt financially at least for this month !  


Problem is, I had accepted to be a substitute to another school for tomorrow. If I want the two weeks job, I need to cancel that one.  


Now I know it's not very professional to cancel a job like that when you said you'd be there. I feel very bad about it, but I just need the money so much that I can't afford to say no right now.  


I have social anxiety and I don't know what to say and how to say it when I call to cancel. I don't want to lie though.  Any advice on that? Thanks!

571,"T'l:Dr at bottom, sorry it's so long! I wanted to include as many relevant details as possible. 

*Please note I am only looking for advice on what to do in order to prevent this from happening again, cover mine and any charities/organisations proverbial a*ses, and keep future event participants safe*


I volunteer for animal charities/rescues in my spare time, and sometimes I organise events/fundraisers for them. Last year I organised a sponsored dog walk, it was admittedly my first big event, but I was confident it would go off without a hitch. I had to go through city hall and sign a few forms, mostly agreeing that I wouldn't intentionally put any attendees in harm's way, and to get the walk route approved by them to ensure it was safe/wouldn't interrupt traffic. I also had to agree (and prove) that I had informed all attendees of general safety tips for the route as well as the laws regarding handling of dogs in that area (i.e. all dogs needed to be kept on leash and under control).

I had already gotten in contact with the owner of my chosen charity, and since we were already acquaintances from previous events, we keep in regular contact. I set up an event page on Facebook and included all information, including that which regards safety of all attendees and their animals, on the page.

The day comes and we have around 70 attendees and their dogs. We have a sign-in table where people sign in their name, their dogs name(s), their dogs breed(s), and the donation amount they wish to give. They can also get free merch, dog food and water here. Most importantly, each person who signed-in received a slip of paper, printed on which was safety guidelines, the walk route, basic etiquette as outlined by the council (aka, no littering, poop needed to be picked up), and a line which read ""Please ensure your dog is kept on a leash at all times, control must be maintained over your dog to ensure the safety of everyone in attendance"", this is important for later.

Sign-in took about half an hour, which was double what I had planned, due to the large crowd. 30 minutes doesn't seem like a long time, but when you have a group of 100+ dogs, bad things can happen. about 20 mins into sign-in, i noticed a dog who was off-leash, so I went to ask the owner to keep him on a leash or he would be asked to leave the event as this was something city hall takes really seriously. In that 5 minute conversation, i heard a yelp from a dog, nothing too unusual in such a large group. I went to check what it was just to be sure, but by the time I got to that area (couldn't have been more than 2 minutes after the yelp) the dog (we will call him rex) and his owners had zoomed off in their car. I thought this was strange as all eye-witnesses (as well as 2 of my helpers) say there was a little too much excitement and rex was overwhelmed/startled. I thought it was a shame they would miss the event, but carried on as there was no cause for alarm, after all, I had a report sheet for any incidents, and nothing had been reported.

The event went great, everyone had a great time and we made a decent chunk of change for the charity (around 300 Euro). However about 7 or 8 hours later I received a message from someone who i didn't know (turned out to be rex's owners), the message stated that I had almost caused the death of her puppy. She said that her dog was ""Brutally attacked"" by a ""Vicious pitbull"" at the sign-in desk of our event (I use quotation marks not to belittle her, i am just quoting her message - we did not have a pitbull at our event, im a total dog freak and met each dog personally, i love pitties and i would have mentally noted that - not to mention our sign-in sheet included a ""dog breed"" column, no pitbull found on there either). She stated that even though she tried to report it, she couldn't find any organisers (this is false, as everyone on my team was clearly identified and in close proximity to her at the time, each person was introduced to them at the sign-in desk, and one of them even tried to speak to her to ask if everything was ok, but she had run off) she also demanded the name of the owner of the other dog (let's call the other dog Spot), so that she could pass the vets bill onto them, claiming that she had racked up a bill costing 300 Euros. She also sent this message to the charity owner, who phoned me soon after. We could not (for legal/GDPR reasons) give out Spot's owners name, so the charity generously took it upon themselves to offer to pay the entire bill (this was the entire amount fundraised at our event, and this being a small charity, it would be a massive hit, however we had an inkling that Rex's owners just wanted Spot to be put to sleep - they didn't say this outright but they said they wanted Spot to ""get what he deserved""). Rex's owners said they would consider the money, however as soon as the charity asked for a vets receipt and also pictures of Rex's wounds (basic things needed when you're paying someone's vet bill so that you can confirm the amount needed....), they retracted and said that if we wouldn't give them Spot's owners name immediately, they would go all over social media and the radio/newspaper to slander the charity (this would cause the charity to close down as it was small and would not be able to survive under such negative media) and also my name (so that I would never be able to organise an event again).

This tug-o-war went on for 4 excruciating days until Rex's owners decided they would take the charity money. In which time I found pictures our photographer took (candids of people with their dogs) and saw a number of photos of Rex and his owners which clearly showed Rex was not properly leashed and was approximately 2-3 meters away from his owners for the entire duration of them being there. It also showed Rex going up and getting in the space of other leashed dogs. I am definitely not blaming rex for any damage caused to him that day, but any responsible dog owner knows not to let your dog just walk up into a strangers dogs face and that this may not have happened if his owners obtained correct control over their dog. I kept this information between myself and the charity owner, as to not upset Rex's owners more, but we did keep this information should she had gone all over social media to try and close the charity.

My question is, how do I prevent this from happening again? I would like to do more events but this has really tainted my experience (not to mention scared the charity out of doing fundraising, which is integral to it's upkeep). Would you even do another event if this had happened to you?


Tl:Dr: I had a bad experience last year at an event I organised, a puppy was claimed to be bitten (never got evidence, but also did not challenge the owners as they were already going crazy- tbh if someone tells me their dog was attacked i am inclined to believe them but have also learned since that people aren't beyond lying about something so awful for money), they threatened to tarnish my reputation as well as the charities i was fundraising for. in the end they let us pay the vets bill, but this negatively affected all involved.

I work with my ex of a year. The last year has been extremely up and down with us and we have finally balanced out in a good spot where we have both come to terms with being friends.

In the mix is another co worker. This co worker was a contributer to our breakup and is a huge anxiety trigger in my life.

Anytime I see my ex and this co worker together (they are best friends) It just paralyzes me in frozen anxiety.

It also just reminds me of the situations surrounding our breakup and it upsets me.

If I hear them laughing together which is all the time it just makes my heart explode and I feel like I go into this frozen panic frame of mind.

Anything that has to do with these two causes me to just go in to a shut down mode. I feel so on edge and frozen the rest of my shift I can’t think straight and I end up in a horrible mood of wanting to cry and wanting to yell at my ex.

I KNOW THIS IS NOT HEALTHY 

I do not speak to this co worker and stay as far away from them as possible but at the same time it is not possible to avoid them 100%

In January this co worker took a leave for another job and this week they come back after a few months of me getting used to working with my ex without this person around (I think this is why we are finally in a good place as friends) 

I am dreading this week so bad.

I don’t want to work with them together. I keep anxiously looking at the schedule to figure out how long I have to work each shift with them.

I am losing sleep over it. It is all I think about.

I don’t want to feel like this anymore and I don’t want to be angry at my ex every shift because we are finally in a good spot.

But at the same time I hate this person so much I just can’t explain it sometimes.

I feel stupid and foolish and an idiot.

I just need advice on how to handle this.

I don’t like hating this person as much as I do but it is how I feel.

I have no idea how to get over these feelings.

I know finding another job is my only option and I am finally in a good spot mind wise and all that where I have started looking for a new one... until then I have to deal with this 

Thank you",09Mar2020,1

It's a very small and compact area, which is why I'm kind of feeling nervous. Transmission might be super easy, especially as I'm in a third world country. Now I'm wary of everyone coming home even if they were out of the house for only just a few moments. How should I get over my irrational fear?",09Mar2020,1

584,"I’m a very shy girl, and I’m still a virgin so telling a guy no to sex is not new. But I told a guy that I was with No and he made a big deal out of it. He called me a child because I didn't answer him after I told him he made me feel like all he wanted me for was sex. He blocked me on everything and won't talk to me anymore. He keeps talking shit and I’m happier now and I’m with someone but I feel like I did something wrong.

TL:DR I told him no to sex and said he made me feel like that's all he wanted me for he called me a child for not answering him after that and blocked me and keeps talking shit about me.",09Mar2020,1
585,"So, for the past few years, I have been getting inundated with harassment and trolling from random jerks online who spew bigoted slurs towards me and my girlfriend.

Recently, I have been thinking about making some major changes to my online presence to minimize trolling and to raise revenue for my conten-creation endeavors. Is this a good proposal?

* Disable comments on all of my YouTube videos, even retroactively disabling the ones from the past.

* Create a Patreon page so that users can support me financially (since I cannot rely on ad revenue alone due to the adpocalyse, YouTube demonetizing me, and admageddon, people using ad-blockers more often now than in 2011) and to weed out trolls. The idea is that if someone wants to PM me, or group chat with me with others, they would need to pay a certain amount of money per month. In my view, trolls would not bother paying $20+ per month just to get an opportunity to harass me, only to get banned almost instantaneously.

* Create a freemium tier model where all viewers get to watch my videos on YouTube and LBRY, another video sharing platform, for free, but if they want extra content, they would need to pay via a patronage/subscription on Patreon.

Does that seem logically sound and plausible? Let me knwo waht you think?",09Mar2020,1

I kind of have trust issues with them because they told me they message many people (50+) whereas they were pretty much my only friend. Not sure how to go about finding someone i can trust again and feeling very lonely.

588,"I don't usually post on Reddit but I just feel alone and need to get it out. So my wife and I are separating after 13 years and 3 kids. We're both 31 and have been together since 8th grade. As soon as we both turned 18 we got married. We've had our ups and downs for sure just like anyone else, and without going into detail, we've both made mistakes but have worked through them as a couple. For about the past few months though she has been saying that she's just unhappy and needs to find herself. I get that and maybe I can understand it too. But at the same time why isn't this something that we also can work on together? We tried doing things together and apart with friends but it still wasn't enough. So with that said a couple weeks ago she decided to finally do it and say she wanted to separate. We're being civil about everything and she isn't immediately kicking me out, but I can't do anything for awhile until i get some money saved up to get my own place. 

Now for the personal stuff about me. This isn't something that I want, it's what she wants. I have to respect that I guess but why does it seem like punishment? I can feel my mental state slipping and I don't like it but she doesn't seem to care. She seems very cold and callous about the whole situation.I will say that I do have some issues of my own that counseling would probably help with but I just don't know. I do still love her and she says she loves me too. I want to believe it but it's hard to.  I just feel so lost,alone and confused. I'm depressed and angry. I just have chaos in my head. One minute I'm sad and crying, the next minute i don't care because i do want her to be happy. Then the next minute I'm angry and seething and then it repeats. I don't actually really have any friends to talk to, she was really theonly one I talked to so this is my next best thing...anyone reading this thanks for reading.",09Mar2020,1

I work for a company in the Denver Tech Center area. I've just  been tasked with taking all of our old machines (10+ years old) and either recycling or donating them.


My question being, a lot of these machines are running 2 core CPUs, DDR2 and no solid states, like 2005 machines. I'm wondering if it is even worth donating or scrapping them? To me they are utter junk and feel they should just be recycled. What are your thoughts?

Our original plan was of course cancelled due to the coronavirus. Now I am conflicted, should I travel to London to be with him now? There are three main concerns: 1. What’s UK’s entry restriction for Chinese citizens now? 2. Would I (a Chinese) be subjected to certain discrimination and racism? 3. How safe really is London?

593,"Long story, short version: I'm really good at screw up things and have bad luck, a lot. Pushed away 5 years long every opportunity to get into a relationship because i never felt it. I was happy. 3 month ago we got a new co worker. Never felt that before but she is awesome. On so many levels i felt so connected to her. We went out couple of times. She told me everything about her life and me either. But she was not able for a serious relationship. I got that because she has a lot of personal issues that she has to deal with.

She has to figure her out before she should date somebody. We talked 2 days ago und set a break because it has no sense. I offered her my help because she has nobody here. Moved to my country 1 year ago. For me a relationship is something where you help each other. Making each others life easier. I told her that im ready to give all my power but also that she's not ready for that. I felt in love in that time. But we're working together. At least twice a week for 5h at a gym. There's no chance to avoid or talking to each other. Im not an ass and im not gonna treat her bad because she broke my heart. She needs that job and i do aswell.
No idea how to deal with that. She's alone and i still like her a lot. I want to help her, maybe cuz thats still hope for me which shouldn't be.
I would like to make a compromise with here, that helps avoiding that getting weird.
Any ideas?.. I feel kind of lost and desperate",09Mar2020,1

I usually ignore those messages for a few hours (unless it’s from close friends or family) and when I do write back (usually later that day or even the next day) I say “hey, what’s up?” I never get a reply! I feel like this person always just needs something from me, and if I can’t give it to them when they want it, they just move onto someone else. Because I have never, ever received a reply after writing back. 

The texts are always the same too “are you home?” “Are you free?” Etc.  Never “are you home? I need some help” or “if you’re free, I would like to get together and chat” I think it’s rude to just ask someone if they’re available before stating your reasons for asking. Honestly, I may not be busy at that moment, but that still doesn’t mean I want to do whatever it is you’re asking me to do. How can I handle this person, or even slowly cut them off completely?

So I just received a phone call from my older sister(27), we live in different states btw, and she told me she was on her way to pick up our younger sister (17) cause she was having a breakdown in school. She let me know how our younger sister has been feeling depressed, how before it use to be once in a while but now it’s become more frequent. 

She also told me that our younger sister confided in her that she had been most likely raped a year ago by her ex boyfriend who snuck into her room while she was heavily sedated after having her wisdom teeth removed. She says she doesn’t remember much but she remembers feeling her clothes being removed and then pain in her lower area. She didn’t tell anyone till recently because she thought that no one would believe her.

My older sister called me because I’m studying psychology and she didn’t know how to handle the situation. So she had her talk to me. From everything my younger sister had told me on our phone call she definitely has signs of depression. She doesn’t have trust in therapist due to one telling our mom everything she had said during their sessions, but my older sister and I assured her that if she goes our mom doesn’t need to know and our older sister would take her. 

I just don’t know what to do as her older sister I feel like I’ve failed her somehow and I don’t know how to help her I feel so helpless and I don’t know how to handle this myself. I wish I could be there for her but I’m so far away. 

I need advice, what can me and my older sister do in order to help and support our younger sister?",09Mar2020,1
599,"I went to the hospital today for suspected kidney stones. I have all the symptoms, however they insisted it wasn’t and it was an infection of my vagina, specifically bacterial vaginosis which I have none of the symptoms. I told them I was certain it was not that but they asked to do a pelvic exam and I agreed. When this was about to begin, a nurse walked in the room and didn’t say a word to me, so I said hello. She ignored me. This immediately gave me bad vibes, but whatever. Then the doctor and a student practicing to be a doctor came in. The doctor was a male, but I didn’t know he was the doctor. He left the room so I could undress and I asked the student why he had to be in the room, and the nurse chimes in in a very rude tone stating he had to be there because that’s what he does. The student specified that since she was a student he needed to be in there to supervise but that he would be at the head of the bed and not doing the exam. I did not want a male to perform my exam as I didn’t feel comfortable with this. Well, this was a lie. He comes in and without saying anything tells me I need to spread my legs and I immediately start crying. He keeps telling me I need to stop crying and relax. Well, I’m in a full blown anxiety attack at this point and am crying extremely hard and hyperventilating and I cannot relax however he takes this moment to SHOVE the speculum in my vagina. He did not enter it slowly. He literally forced it in there extremely fast and hard. It hurt very bad which makes me cry even harder and he’s telling me it’s painful because I have an infection, while I’m telling him no, it’s painful because you just shoved it up inside of me while I wasn’t relaxed. Also this was a good 4 hours ago now and my vagina still hurts from this. The funniest part is, he didn’t even do the exam! Any time I’ve had a pelvic exam done, they use the speculum to open you up so they can look inside. He did not even bother to observe to see if he seen any issues. He took it out, and said the reason he needed to do the speculum was so that he could get a culture of my discharge. Wtf?!?!?! Since when do doctors use a speculum to “swab” discharge for testing? You couldn’t of used a damn cotton swab? Anyway he leaves the room and I can’t stop crying or hyperventilating, and the rude nurse stayed. She tells me I’m crying for no reason and I need to stop. I say I’m crying because you guys blatantly lied to me and I did not want a male to perform the exam. She then says what’s the difference? There is none! Btw this whole time she speaking with a disgusting attitude. When she made that last comment it set me off because there is a huge difference and the way the whole thing was done was absolutely ridiculous. So I just said, I don’t even wanna talk to you because you’ve had an attitude from the moment you walked in here. So she “scoffs/giggles” and walks out and as she is doing so she turned around and said “you can leave at any time you know.” She closes the door and I can hear her talking crap about me to the doctor outside the door and laughing about it. I had a cat scan done and surprise surprise, kidney stones!!! As I was being discharged they sent a nurse into remove my IV, and the nurse is the same one from an hour before. I told her I didn’t want her to do it, and she said well I’m a nurse I have to. I said I’m sure there is another nurse. She doesn’t say a word, opens up the door and SLAMS it against the wall extremely hard. This whole thing was unprofessional and maybe if I actually had some compassionate, understanding people who were actually listening to what I had to say then I would’ve never got upset and started crying in the first place. Anyway my question is, is this situation worthy of reporting or would it just go nowhere? I tried to call my states BON and ask them and when explaining the story the lady cut me off half way through and said “So you want to report a nurse because she was rude to you? Is that what it is?” And the way she said it made it seem like me wanting to report this was stupid. Like, “So you want to call the cops on someone, for looking at you wrong?” Kind of Tone. Basically as if my wish to report her was too extreme for what really happened. But I dont feel like it’s extreme considering how she treated me. If this is worthy of a report, how can I find her information because I don’t even know her name?",09Mar2020,1

I attached the main parts of the conversation I had with this friend once I became lucid. I’m referring to her as a friend, but our relationship has primarily just been copping together for a couple months. Her and a friend drove me to get dope after I had been clean for 2 months. I bought them 2 bags and got 5 for myself, heavily overestimating my tolerance. To clarify some parts of the conversation, I had wine in my bag from the night before that I forgot about. She asked if the alcohol was open, and I sort of panicked and said no, thinking it wouldn’t be much of an issue. Once we had picked up, I took two bumps, not thinking much of it since no one had told me not to use in the car and that they didn’t allow it. I’m fully aware that essentially every decision made this day was wrong. I woke up to a bunch of doctors surrounding me, with oxygen in my nose, having already received narcan. I had no idea what happened until I received the attached tumblr messages. Reading what she said and all she did for me and all that she had been through in the past broke my heart. I told her that I am here if she needs absolutely anything, and that if she wants to get clean at any point, I know a great doctor who can 100% help her. I don’t feel satisfied with that being the end of it. I recognize that she saved my life and I feel like I should do more. I’m not sure what that means though. I guess I’m just asking for advice. Maybe it’s best to leave her be and not bother her anymore? Or maybe I’m really not doing enough? Any opinions/ideas are appreciated. Stay safe everyone.",09Mar2020,1

604,"My sister and I have never had a great relationship growing up. She was a drug addict. Once she became pregnant she cleaned up her life and ended up marrying the guy she got pregnant with. 

 No one in my family likes this guy and my sister keeps acting like there's nothing wrong. The first taste we got of him was when they came to visit me back when I had dogs as pets. One dog nipped at my brother in law and caused some bleeding and he started going off about how he was going to sue me for doctor bills (because they had no insureance or money) and then proceeded to get very nasty with me about it and eventually he ended up even messaging my mother in law at the time to gossip about something I told my sister and him in confidence. To say he is a prick is putting it lightly. 

My sister and brother in law live with his family in their home. My sister shares a bedroom with her husband, and their 9 year old daugther. There is no divider between them, it's just one open room for them to live in. My niece sleeps in her own bed. 

Another issue is that my sister's married family all live together in the same house. One  sister in law lives there with her boyfriend and their 2 kids. The boyfriend is a drug addict and has been seen doing drugs while in the house. He doesn't watch his kids. They were found running around with knives in their hands one day. Needless to say, it's not a great situation for anyone living there. 

I am constantly worrying about my niece living there. My sister works as a waitress and has made good money in the past. She always flaunts it at me and wants to show off to me that she is doing well. But she isn't doing anything to improve her living situation. 

She just texted me the other day to tell me that the car she co-signed for her husband, the engine blew. He has been known to drive like an asshole, and I don't know how a guy who has worked on cars and knows cars had his own engine blow on a fairly new car. I didn't ask her to go into detail about it. But she then told me that he just bought a new car!! A rare one, in fact, only a few thousand made. 

Am I just supposed to sit here and nod and shake my head and congratulate them instead of telling my sister what she should be doing and worried about is finding a place of their own and getting my niece out of that crazy house? 

My brother in law is buying new comic books every week (rare and expensive ones) and yet, doesn't have money to give to my sister for their own daughter to get new glasses that she needs. He doesn't prioritize his family at all and it makes me crazy. Whenever I go over there and he shows me his new comic stuff that he bought, I just nod and smile and say ""That's cool"". 

Do I say something to my sister? Do I just step back and say, you are 35 years old you have to figure things out? 

We grew up struggling. Our dad walked out on us when I was 12 leaving my mother alone, without a job, to raise 3 kids. I just want my siblings to live where they don't have to worry.

This may be an invasion of privacy but I couldn’t ignore this since my mom has commented about Mr. X’s handsome appearance multiple times to me before. A few months back, while casually scrolling through her photos, I found quite a few screenshots of Mr. X’s photos, who i thought might be her crush. Last year my mom invited Mr. X and his family for dinner, after which she asked me what I thought of Mr. X, something that she has never done with any other colleague of hers before. 

I was suspicious that something might be going on between them but I didn’t think much of it until now. I could never imagine my mom doing something like that. But I’ve read her chats and I can’t refuse to believe the reality now. I have no idea what to do. 

I don’t wanna ask my mom because I’m scared. She loves me a lot but I don’t know if I should trust her. I can only imagining the worst right now. I don’t know if I should tell my dad. He loves us both and works very hard for us. He’s going to be heartbroken. Also I don’t think I can handle my parents splitting up right now. Any advice on what I should do??",09Mar2020,1

614,"Taking back sexual health

TL;DR I feel like I’ve been constantly taken advantage of sexually and I’m not sure if it’s effecting my body adversely - I want to know if anyone else has had these types of experiences and what doctors they saw first to feel like they were taking their life back. 

To start I will say I don’t always feel like I’ve been a great person - usually when I do act out though I’m joking or I’m mindless or I’m literally at my wits end and finally to a point where I’m like “well fuck that person I don’t care anymore” 

As a child I was very extrovert-introvert. I usually would push myself out of my comfort zone (or remember pushing myself) whenever the people around me would show concern with how quite or closed off and timid I was as a kid. I was born in Cincinnati, my family moved to California, then Florida, then texas. I really never struggled to make friends however until we moved to a conservative white town in north Texas - it was here I felt like I could just never say anything right that jived with any family I came across there. Everyone wanted to know what was fucked up about my family it seemed, there was nothing we could do to not be outsiders it felt. 

Generally before this situation, I also never had trouble with the opposite sex. I always had an equal amount of big and girl friends and as a child had all the same childhood bfs that lost girls have when a boy in class has a crush on them. When I moved to texas, that was when I became really good at a sport. I also felt like it was the first place where I could just be friends with boys which was alarming to me because that wasn’t really a problem for me before. 

Upon landing in Texas I felt like I did well through the 4th grade. In the fifth grade my parents told us they were getting a divorce and I tried to tel my mom I felt super adhd but other than that I felt like I only acted out on those feelings and emotions rather than actually feeling upset. I started to struggle to talk to people and ask for help or let anyone in ago it my family life because I visited a counselor at school and told her about my family situation and the advice she gave me was to go home and consol my father. My father generally was very hard on everyone in my family so in the 5th grade that was very confusing advice to me. I remember trying to force myself to like boys that I thought were cute but then thinking that I was shallow for only liking them bc they were cute. 

I had my first boyfriend in the 5th grade and I like never talked to him except for on aim - I thought he was really funny though so during that time I think our after school convos definitely helped get my mind away from my changing family life and our changing financial state as well. 

Around middle school my parents told me I would need to ask them about dating moving forward because they are nervous and I was traveling the country to compete in my sport at this point so they wanted me to focus. I remember having my first actual crush in the 7th grade that felt justified because I rally didn’t like the guy at first and then grew to like him once we became friends. I thought that’s how it was supposed to happen but he had a crush on my friend at the time so I instead just supported that I think - or at least tried to force myself too. 

In the 7th or 8th grade the kid started flirting back, we snuggled at a football gMe and I helped his family remove the fluffy things from the band kid hats since they were band boosters. He asked me to go under the bleachers with him but I wasn’t allowed to date and I thought he was going to ask me to kiss him and I just did not feel ready for that (I was 12 or 13 and also still fighting off being timid and afraid of people). I was really hurt after when the boy wouldn’t treat me like that at school. I remember it making me feel like I was in a hole or like a really dark space whenever I was confused or wondering if I even remembered the situations in which we were alone together correctly. I was a really cold matured kid so in the end I just convinced myself that the kid was being mice because he was really warm natured. 

By the 8th grade the kid would definitely flirt with me. I was generally afraid of social situations that didn’t involve my teammates so I would sometimes lean on him during these points. I remember once night at a friends house I was super uncomfortable and out my hand on his leg - he later texted me that I gave him a boner which made me super uncomfortable because I had to look up what it was but I thought it was endearing also. He was staying at a boys house down the street and I almost asked if he wanted to meet in the middle to cuddle but then I didn’t want to get I’m either of us in trouble. 

Later that year he texted me before a party at my house that I needed to ask my parents if I could date. He said if I didn’t ask he was going to ask someone else out and that he was considering asking someone else out already though he didn’t tell me it was my best friend. I remember feeling so fucking panicked to hurt another girl and also panicked to not give him the eighth answer. My mom and I were cleaning heavily and making food but she said we could try to cal my dad right before the party so he didn’t have time to think into it and say no. We didn’t get the time to call him and my mom said she would take the fall for me but I didn’t want her to because my dad was intense. The guy never even asked me or let me tell him about this situation at the party either.

That night that boy asked my best friend out and they apparently kissed in my adolescent bedroom. I remember feeling so mortified and embarrassed and just awful. To make matters worse everyone at the party had gone into my bedroom and gone through my make up that my mom had gotten me because I had interest in make up at the time. They put it on a kid and ruined part of the palette my mom had gotten me for Christmas and let me open already. (Side note: there was also a large dildo in my bathroom that my teammate and I had found and stolen in my house - we thought it was flipping hilarious it was so huge - no one at the party ever called me out for this but internally I figured lol) I finished the night out by lashing out and playing rock band to get me through. 

After my friends thought I was legit crazy I think so I showed all of them the texts from the boy. They all decided to hate him as well. I eventually felt so bad for this and tried to flip all opinions on this guy and become friends with him again. 

He was really nasty to me and would get after me for a pair of bell bottoms that I wore but wore plaid and my first article of clothing from Abercrombie (the outlet lol), my plaid converses (my first pair of converses - on sale so plaid was my only option but I really liked them). One day I was memorizing a poem in class so I highlighted each line in different colors thinking I would memorize a line a day by remember the color that went with that line - he made fun of my for this, etc. I remember thinking how hard this was because he didn’t know it but whenever he made fun of my that hard it made me feel super fucking obese but I had no justified reason for why it would conclude to that so I couldn’t tell him how bad he was hurting me. I also started dabbling with throwing up and starving myself and cutting myself so this seemed logical to me but I couldn’t tell him that without also making him feel bad because I didn’t have these issues before he and his friend started sticking gum on a specific necklace I would wear sometimes to feel pretty at school. 

I convinced myself I was falling asleep I class so I started starving myself because I felt like the food I was eating was making me tired and my gum would fall out onto that specific necklace when I did even though it didn’t happen on any other necklace. I also started cutting myself so that I would think about that when I started to dose off at school. However I never remember it happening again after that and I’m pretty sure the gum did so that’s how I realized it was someone Else adding the gum in. 

I was also just really mean back I think. I remember feeling like I had no clue why I could not control my annoyed looks at him or why I could not just look him in the face. 

While he was dating my best friend he was actually also my first kiss. I cried while he was on the way over to my house because I felt so bad but was afraid he would get so mad at me if I canceled. After I was so upset at myself that I cried and told my mother that I was going to tell my best friend. She told me that since it was his relationship, he was the one who should have been responsible for letting his girlfriend know because I didn’t want to make two friends upset at once. I’m not sure if he ever did. 

I once got the flu for two weeks that year and he would text me things along the lines of how much he missed me at school and how much he was not afraid of my germs. I don’t really remember this time correctly because I actually think I was really sick looking back on it. I had to go to the doctor a few times before I was allowed to stet living again basically.

Later in that year I looked up in the middle of algebra class and watched him finger a girl through her pants in the middle of class in the 8th grade. I thought he was looking at my whole he did it but I’m blind so I am pretty sure I just went to the bathroom and cried and convinced myself I was seeing things until my best friend in the class brought it up later. 

At the end of that semester he left a note on my binder in a pink envelope that I threw away because I was afraid of what was in it. Later that year, he also left a super sweet note in my yearbook that another girl in my class made me feel super guilty that I wasn’t fawning over it so I tried to love him again. This time he told me we had four years together at high school to date if we wanted to however I don’t know about this because he’s sense made me feel like I don’t remember anything correctly about our situation. 

We showed up at high school at the same time once to which I said it was weird and he told me he thought it was fate. I spend the summer in between 8tb grade and high school trying to convince myself there was nothing wrong with me other than my looks and then at the end of the summer realized how fucked up it was thag I had to do that in the first place and tried to just block him out. One of my favorite athletes shared the same name as him and I eventually threw away my signed post card from him because I thought it was strange that my athletic idol and he had the same name and that I would not even sporadically have the consider the kid if I got rid of my hero’s signature as well. 

High school was rough on a boy front. I really jus stopped caring, my first homecoming date cancelled on my when I told Him I wasn’t going to give him a blow job. I found a new one then proceeded to in ditch him for me neighbor that was also giving me the run around. My first date was a boy who invited me to the movies then also cancelled on me when I told him I wasn’t going to give him a blow job. I was trying to wait to try anything sexual until my period started since my family had no moral or religious convictions relation to celibacy. I really just wanted to make sure my boys was working, I also hated my home town for obvious reasons so I never wanted to get attached to anyone sexually so I could leave. I was working REALLY hard to try to be mice, be academic, and practicing for 30-35 hours outside of school I’m a sport and it felt like really unfair to me to be bullied so hard when I generally friend to make everyone feel welcomed regardless. 

That being said - I have grown to be a very angry adult [internally mostly]and I don’t want to live the rest of my life upset and mad because I know it will become external so I’m working through the next years trying to take back my physical and emotional health back and I really actually want to because I’m tired of feeling horrible about myself and also would like to actually form a healthy long term relationship with someone that I can share my life with now that I feel like I actually have done a lot of work on myself and am a good person. (This took a long time) 

To preface this - growing up I was an elite spring board and platform diving from the age of seven. I was probably a pretty bossy girl but I remember every time when someone called me out for being bossy I felt really horrible so I think I really tried to get rid of that habit by around age 10 or so. I generally always felt like I had issues these people around me would allude to but not confront me about out of fear of making me upset so I’ve spent a lot of my life trying to predict the ways in which I will make others upset before I do. This had lead to be not paying attention to a lot of my own needs I think. I’m not sure I just don’t want to feel sad or upset anymore. The way sexuality happened for me was weird because I didn’t have a period until I was 15 then not again until I was 16 then not consistently until I was 17.

The first time I ever gave a guy a blow job was a kid who was 17 when I was 15 and he knew one of my girl best friends that was on my diving team. He would come to my class everyday and try to sell me chocolate for his prom ticket fundraiser and ask me about it my friend. I invited him over to my house one night honestly thinking “wow I’m really far behind all of my friends sexually, I guess I’ll just invite a guy over and make out with him” I think I ended up giving him a blow job. I don’t remember because I was taking melatonin to sleep at the time but it was the reason I stopped taking melatonin. The reason I’m pretty sure I gave him a blow job was that he texted me that the next day. It freaked me out which is why I stopped taking melatonin. 

My first time happened on my couch when I had only had two mensutral cycles over two years. I woke up while spooning with a guy from a jarring dream and he was inside of me. This is when I gave up on myself sexually. I really haven’t valued anything about myself or my body since. My period started happening after this consistently because he was having sexual with me. I tried to break up with him three weeks into it but he told me he loved me. He would also get upset at me for wearing leggings as pants and told me when we died and went to heaven we would be brothers and sisters and we couldn’t have sex anymore at that point because we had to act like brothers and sisters. He would also tell me how he was friend with my English teacher and that his grandparents had a Hawaiian vacation saved up for a honeymoon for whomever he marries. Anytime I tried to break up with him he would go on Facebook and make a long post about how amazing I was and how much he loved me. 

He once showed me the twitter of a girl who was really rude to me in middle school and asked me about her. I said she was a bitch in middle school but that she had probably grown up or something along those lines because she was friends with one of my mutual guy friends. He ended up marrying her. 

On Valentine’s Day I was afraid he’d make me do anal and I was about to tell the kid from middle school everything about our relationship anyways because i was scared and had re read the middle school yearbook note he left me which said I could tell him if I needed help with boys. I figured it probably did not still stand from middle school anymore but I would try anyways and we had started flirting in my eyes. So I just straight up broke up with my boyfriend on Valentine’s Day. 

I continued to get closer to the middle school boy again and we ended up dating and going to prom together. It was obviously a way better experience than middle school obviously because he had grown up and I still remembered the good things I liked about him in middle school more than the scary stuff (expect for the situation that happened out my house - I still sometimes cry about that but I’ve generally disconnected him from the hurt and it just makes me sad to think about how much it changed my perspective on life and love still rather). So, I did indeed let myself fall in love too quickly this time rather but I thought he was too.

For my 18th birthday he wrote me a song and he would quote Beatles lyrics when we had sex sometimes so idk... I figured he also loved me. The song he wrote me was about how I brought love to the situation and how I was his everything so I decided to tell him I did actually love him after he sang that to me because I finally felt bad that I he never said it before.

When I to him he told me we didn’t have time to love each other anymore since I was leaving for college in a few months and I cried myself home from his house, he went on a trip and then came back and told me he did also love me but I while he was gone I trained myself to tell myself that I was never going to say it agin so all I could say was thank you and then I just told myself he knew so i didn’t need to ever say it again. 

When I left for college I frantically cried and mailed him letters that I was going to keep that I had written after every date we had been on pretty much because I thought I was going to forget everything and I had been looking forward to dating him since middle school. So I would try to recount everything and how much I loved him and then date them and then I sent them to him because I felt like I was always negative around him so I wanted him to know I was trying to go home and recount all the positive things. 

I ended up sending them because I was going to miss him and I also was afraid he was going to become depressed because he wasn’t going to college and everyone else was. So I wanted him to know he was okay and that at least someone thought the world of him if he didn’t think wel of himself for not taking a traditional path like the rest of us. 

I went to college and my period stopped. I told him after four days and he told me his brother had had similar experiences with girls and that it was never real. I got scared because I was now also considering his brothers life. So I googled all of the ways to jump start a period and did this things for the next few days until my period started (papaya, caffeine, cohosh, etc.) 

A few weeks after this I had a physical and was put on HUGE iron pills, vitamin D, a myriad of other vitamins, and birth control. This all made me super paranoid about what was actually happening to my body because i felt like I had no clue at this point. I decided to just power through this and delete all of my social media and focus my life into straightening my life out at this point instead.

I ended up having a great year academically and even met a guy that I actually ended up really liking at school. I still transferred to be closer to home and at a cheaper school at the end of the year. 

After about a year of being broken up I would still see my ex and sometimes even cheat on my boyfriend with him. We were once planning to hangout and I was about to start my period b UT had also decided I would finally tell my ex no and move on. This time he didn’t let me really say no anymore and so I had to physically get out of his car while I was giving him a blow job because I felt like I was gonna throw up on him. In my head I was telling myself it was because he was not letting me be consensual anymore and getting really mad at him but in reality I went home later that night and realized I had started my period in his car. I was so embarrassed and also have had a history of throwing up on my periods so I told myself it was that rather. 

When I confronted him about the situation and somethings he had said to me to try to get me to hook up again he told me I wasn’t remembering the situation. I did feel pretty sober but hit my head a lot growing up and was high so I’ve always assumed he was right and responded to this situation by lashing out and cutting him out because I honestly felt like I was ruining both of our lives. I was like seriously depressed and also scared of him and also wanting to jump back into another relationship so that he would just have to respect that. 

He told me he wanted to hook up with other people and that I should want to as well. I finally go the the fuck it point and hooked up with his friend that he was always wary about. That friend ended up taking pictures of my ass the best morning while I was getting dressed and sent them to people I went to school with. I was mortified and everyone consoled me by telling me I looked really good in the picture. 

After all of this I jumped into a relationship. The relationship was both so bad both ways that no feel like I will never ever be able to date again. 

I also get chronicle migraines and stomach pains and my periods have gone back to me throwing up and nearly passing out with shard shooting pain down the insides and out raises of my legs from my thighs to my knees. 

I don’t want to have to take depression medication and I want to be able To feel like I can be truthful in a relationship and also take care of someone.

Does anyone know any advice for how to approach doctors in these situations? I am aiming to see general wellness doctors over therapists first because I honestly think part of me feeling so awful is something medically that might be wrong. Thanks you in advance for any advice or encouragement.

I don’t want to lash out at my family and want to be able to be honest with my friends about my relationships and not have people constantly point out to my that I could be treated better or find a better partner in a relationship. I don’t trust myself to get to know someone or treat someone right or be able to be sympathetic/empathetic to their feelings at all anymore and I’m afraid I’ll just be dishonest in relationships forever as to not be a burden and appear as though I can just take care of myself in every possible way. So really - any advice is helpful.",09Mar2020,1

It's getting to be a lot to handle. I do my best to have thick skin but the constant burden of pretty much having to take care of someone because such a wide variety of things upset them is difficult and it's hard for me to manage. I'm not a professional in this capacity. I've had to physically restrain them before from hurting themselves.

632,"I had a female co-worker who pursued in getting to know me, added me randomly on every social media, she gave me her number and we started talking everyday.

It started as a regular friendship but eventually it became more we definitely put everything on the table when it came to us, we let each other know things about each other we never told anyone else.

It eventually became a no title relationship, calls before bed and when we woke up, arguments on why didn’t you call or text me all day (her), jealously (her) why is that female on your page and who’s that girl always talking to you at work....lol

I caught feelings hard always daydreaming of her when she wasn’t around, I thought she had the same feelings.

I admitted my feelings to her but she declined saying she just wanted to be friends. 

I kept my distance for a while and she cried, people at work noticed and would ask me what happened? I played dumb.

We slowly got cool again but set ground rules and boundaries, but it killed a fun and closeness we had.

My conundrum is I want what we had but my mind says to find someone who wants you how you want them.

Now we hardly talk and it just got so awkward that I just avoid her at work because I just don’t want to know what she’s been up to.

I don’t even expect any advice, i guess I just felt like venting because I know I’m probably just done with this relationship even though a part of me still wants her.",09Mar2020,1

634,"I recently moved to TX with my husband because he got a new job there. I exchanged my ID to the Texas ID and basically changed everything over to my new address.

However I still work in NY because there's not a lot of jobs for my field in TX. So basically I live in TX but fly out to NY for work. I plan to go back to TX about every month. While I'm in NY, I stay with my parents.

The problem is, my HR is giving me a bit of trouble because for tax purposes, they say it's a red flag if I'm being taxed in NY but I have a TX home address. They're asking for ""the address where you live"", and to keep my Texas address as a mailing address. For personal reasons, I want to keep everything in my TX address. Is this a problem? How do I explain this situation to HR? I'm not sure of the legalities behind it.",09Mar2020,1
635,"REPOST 

So I have this  ""friend"" I met online (Long story, Short:  We meet in person, lost my V  Card to her, she left but came back to the state) And every time I  think of her / see her, I blush really hard and think about kissing her.

So  today I went to her house. We saw movies, played games and relaxed on  the couch together (Nothing explicit) . Later on, her friends came over  along to rehearse for some play. So, me ALREADY being there I introduced  myself and connect with them a bit. But seeing as how I was the only  non "" actor"", I basically just sat on the couch, watching her and her  friends having laughs and having a fun time. When they were rehearsing, I  tried to give my option to help out with their play (Again I'm not into  theaters but thought of just helping out.) and she KINDA shunned my  advice cause ""They know what their doing. But thanks."" Ok, no harm, no  foul.

Later on they were talking  about sex and etc. And it just got really uncomfortable since she was my  first and I don't know if it would had been a good idea to admit it if  they ask me how I lost it. Cause of that I just made an excuse to just  go home since they were all talking about people they know and were  doing stuff together while I was just sitting on the couch looking and  barely participating in the group.

Cause  of this (And remembering that she wouldn't date me cause I'm too young)  I think it's best to just stop having these feelings for her. But the  problem is, I JUST CAN'T! (Maybe it's because she was my first and the  only girl I feel like I can connect to in a way.)

So  basically, what I am trying to say is, how do I STOP thinking about her  that way!? As in, I don't care if she dates somebody or anything. Cause  honestly, I'm just sad and depressed at this point knowing I won't ever  date her. ;/",09Mar2020,1

. I have one coworker who has been getting onto me nitpicking at me over many things the last two weeks, starting on week three now. Examples are: telling me to print certain things from the fax email account, then later retracting she said no such thing, I need to print or not print these said items- then rinse and repeat (daily). Telling me how to pull up clients emails for invoices but then told me she didn’t tell me to do it that way, it’s another way to do it. How dare I do it that way. By the end of the week she’ll be mad I’m searching their emails that way and want me to do it the other way. Getting mad because I’m transferring calls to her too fast but getting mad when she doesn’t get calls transferred to her in a timely fashion. Constantly screaming at me to pay attention to what I’m reading- yet, despite my efforts to skim every little detail I still get yelled at for it. When I try to explain things or thoughts or reason why I thought something yadda - she cuts me off and tells me she doesn’t care and proceeds to fuss at me anyways for a said mistake that I’m actually doing right in the first place because she told me to do it that way, but suddenly she changed her mind and it’s not right. Getting mad at me for giving her too many orders... later mad because I didn’t evenly distribute the orders between her and the other two sales people. Mad because I transfer calls too quickly but later not quick enough. 
Anyways I feel like she doesn’t like me at all obviously. I thought about whether I should approach her with my frustration of how she speaks and treats me or if I should go straight to the supervisor and talk to him about my issue. Thanks x",09Mar2020,1
644,"Over the last couple months, I've worked tremendously hard to land a dream job of mine. To give some background, I had to network extensively, complete multiple tests and go on several interviews. It wasn't easy at all. And after being unemployed, struggling to find work in my field for the last year, it was a huge relief, financially.

This job will require me to relocate to a state halfway across the country and it will be a place where I know no one. The job begins with a class at a local university before starting the actual position. My start date is in a few weeks and with the seemingly imminent spread of the coronavirus I am seriously starting to consider not taking on the job.  I'm concerned about the safety of travelling right now. And after I actually get there, I'm worried the university and/or company will momentarily shut down if things get worse and I will be essentially on hold, unestablished and without pay in a new place by myself. It is not a job where I can work from home.

I'm thinking about bringing up these concerns to them and trying to postpone my start date, but I doubt they're going to allow it. I'm not even sure if it's best to be honest or just make up a different excuse. I really don't want to say the wrong thing and have them retract the offer. I'm anticipating that I'll be left with a ""take it or leave it"" decision and that is really stressing me out to think ahead about. Or, I can just wait as it gets even closer to my start date to see if any official decision is made in response to the coronavirus, but I'd be cutting it close. I could also just go without saying anything and hope for the best. There are just so many unknowns and I don't know what the best way to navigate the situation is",09Mar2020,1

I just want to be happy. Doing biology, chemistry, and math courses, don't give me joy. I even volunteered at a hospital in high school, to get a feel of being a doctort, and I hated it. 

I want to major in psychology, get a masters, and become a therapist. I've had my own share of mental health issues and want to help others with it. I'm currently a biology major and I'm suffering. 

I told my dad a while ago that I didn't want to be a doctor. And what did he do? He emailed me a link about the highest paying jobs in healthcare. I don't care about money. I don't have it in me to go to medical school after uni and then residency after that and taking the MCAT etc. But psychology is something I have an interest in, so I want to pursue that.

What I'm scared though, is that they'll be right. I'll end up in a deadbeat job with a psych degree and and make no money. If that ever happens, I might even kill myself. I'm just suffocating right now, and I don't know what to do. 

I'm beating myself up a lot about this too. I feel like I'm some kind of coward. Or that I'm lazy in backing out of my pre-med plans. I feel like absolute shit. 

And the worst thing is, I even said that I wanted to be a doctor before. But that was a quite a few years ago, before I had a reality check. I've dug myself a hole that I can't get out of.

Basically I don't know if I am experiencing disassociation, depersonalization, derealization or something else. Since before year university, Ive been dealing with this (so around 5 years). Haven't gotten help but more recently have been looking into it and becoming contempt with the fact that I need to talk to someone. Before I went to university, I had an episode where I was high that made me freak out. Since then, everything hasn't felt the same. I looked at my parents and outlook on life differently. I think because of anxiety it has evolved to something else. I quit smoking weed almost instantly after this. I specifically have become hyper aware that life is in first person and that freaks me out a lot of the time. An example would be yesterday when I was driving, I looked onto a large city skyline and became aware of how open everything was and that I was experiencing it all in first person. I relate to somethings in disassociation but the thing is I'm a social person most of the time, and I always have been so I don't disassociate with people, more so reality, if that is even what it is.

657,"Gonna be a long winded one but here we go.

Last month I was backpacking and I met a girl in my hostel and we ended up sleeping together. She was really sweet and our energy was great together. The condom ripped and I ended up not cumming which added to me wanting her even more.

When I left we didn't exchange contact Infos cause I figured she was drunk even though I wanted to see her again.

That night I found her on fb and just sent her a message that I really enjoyed being with her and wished her a good trip and she ended up following me on insta a couple hours later before even reading the message so I thought OK there is interest there.

I told her I was gonna be in her city in 4 weeks and that we could maybe meet up again.

No jokes for 2 weeks she seems crazy into me. Her friend put insta stories of the hickey I gave her and tagged me and commented my name on all her pics saying stuff like this is waiting for you etc. And I became super excited for our little fuck appointment and I thought she was so sweet too.

She plans a huge date, all day and even says she's gonna book a hotel and I told her I'd take care of that. But I'm talking lunch reservations, mini golfing, museum etc. Which I was stoked for.

Fast forward a week before I'm there. Wed been chatting and being super cute she's sending pics of her in the lingerie she wants to wear etc...all of a sudden Friday night comes like 5 days before I'm meant to see her and she started being less enthusiastic. Her friend puts a story on insta of her with another guy which was hidden from me but my friend saw it and sent it to me. To which I was totally crushed by but I decided this is meant to be a sex thing so whatever just play it cool.

So I'm in her city and she's writing basically nothing which I decide to just be cool with and meet my friends and have a good time anyways. I also ended up hooking up with my ex flatmate in this time but this girl was Totally dominating my every thought and I wanted her bad. I was putting lots of stuff on insta to try and make sure she knows I'm not like only there to see her or smth.

Day were supposed to meet I text her asking are we on for tomorrow? She says yeah totally for sure. Day goes by I don't hear anything anymore no times no nothing so I decide fuck it this probably isn't happening. Next morning I head out early and again start uploading pictures and she writes me at around 11am that she'd just woken up and if I still wanted to meet. To which I told her sure she can just head downtown and let me know when she's gonna be there and I'll let her know if it's good. She says 1pm and I said OK.

Mind you I'm already confused because we were chatting like everyday up until a week before this and being really sweet and cute with eachother.

So we hang out (Museum) she is avoiding eye contact the whole time and being very cautious and in a protective body language to which I learned the best response is just to be super laid back which I was not being touching or trying to get into her bubble. Then we go to lunch and share a bottle of wine and she starts being friendlier and looking at me more and responding well to small touches even so I was happy and thought hey maybe this will end in the hotel after all.

Then we go to minigolf with her and her friend and we all get roaring drunk there. She actually starts being overly touchy and I stop responding well to it because it got a bit annoying and she was pretty drunk. Then her friend asked me if I had booked a hotel because we stopped discussing it over chat when things got quiet and I told her yes there was a hotel and they both got giggly and excited.

She keeps being touchy but super rude in the minigolf basically just cheating and doing her own thing trying to make me hold her cup and I started feeling like a chumpy nice guy and I asked her friend what was going on... And if she actually wants to even have sex and her friend assures me she does and that she is into me.

So I get direct with her and ask her are you coming to the hotel with me she says yes and I ask are you sure you're not drunk enough and she asked for what? And I told her to have sex with me to which she laughs and says no I'm good and I do want to have sex. OK I'm excited at this point and think OK maybe I was just over thinking this entire day.

In the hotel, we kiss the first time for the whole day and I go down on her but I already notice that she is a bit reserved. Then we begin having sex and I notice she seems a bit quiet compared to last time so I take it slower I'm kissing her a lot and we change position a few times but I can see that she was a bit sensitive and I think I was hurting her a bit because she is pretty small. It ends with her on top which it seemed like she had very little experience topping even though she said she had been with 25 guys before.

While we're having sex her phone also rang around 3 or 4 times to which I kept telling her just ignore it. 

She tells me it's hurting her a bit and if we can stop for like 5 mins then continue and that she wants to pee to which I'm like yes sure of course.

Then she gets up goes to the toilet and takes her phone and she starts talking to someone, she's giggling on the call asking where are you and what are you doing. Then I dead ass hear her say OK what is the address and she puts this guy on speaker phone and I'm hearing some code language and she's giggling and says OK I'll be there in 5.

She comes out and takes another call and I hear a woman. And it sounds like her mom. She says I'm with *my name* and that she's safe and good and she had told her mom who I was while we had been chatting etc. So she hangs up and says her parents are fighting and she's gotta go. I tell her without any hesitations that's OK and just get quiet and wait for her to dress and she awkwardly hugged me and asked if I was mad and I said no it's fine even though it was clear I was hurt. And she sort of acted like I was some hurt little puppy dog. 

Ffw. Next morning she sends a text saying she had an amazing time and that she was really sorry and that her parents fought even though I didn't believe it for a second. She says she would have loved to stay and sends xxx

I send her a voicenote said its cool and joked about being used and confused but that I wish her all the best cause we probs wouldn't see eachother. Then she wrote a super lame AHAHAHA I DIDN'T USE YOU I PROMISE 

Then I sent another one saying I'd felt hurt and just was left feeling gross after the whole experience and that she didn't need to sleep with me if she didn't really want me and that I got it was meant to be casual and that I'd seen her friends story with her and another guy and I was cool with that it but expected our night to be at least respectful and fun but that it just seemed super immature and disrespectful how she made new plans giggling with the guy on speaker.

She sent back a huge apology and that she totally gets why it would seem like that happened but that she really did go home and she felt absolutely horrible. And that she wrote her friend saying how bad she felt and that she never wanted me to feel gross or hurt or disrespected and that she would feel so bad if it happened to her and that she got it but her other response had been laughing it off when I told her it's cool.

So I told her thanks for the apology and explanation and that I appreciated it then I removed her from all my social media and she removed me from fb.

I'm just left feeling super confused and still a bit nasty from the experience because looking back on her avoiding eye contact... And how she was passive while we're going at it I just felt super weird and disgusting and left wondering why did she do all that stuff? She organized the date and was sooo excited just a week ago but it all ended so badly and she clearly went off to see another guy and made it a point for me to see that.

She used to laugh and send full responses but now all I get is '😳' or a '😳 anyways...'  I don't know what to think about it and it's been making me feel down.

I definitely fell victim to the “weed is evil” preaching in health class. Now that I’m older, I’m fine if someone wants to smoke or drink. A person very close to me confided in me that they got high at school. Then, I found two empty bottles of Miller High Life (gross) hidden in a common area. Recently, this person had friends over. I imagine that was something they indulged in. I’m seeking advice on what to do. Frankly, this is out of character for this person who confided in me. However, I know especially in high school teenagers can be difficult. There has been behavioral problems with this person recently, although very mild. I know that many people went through similar stuff in high school. I didn’t, and that’s why I’m asking here. I have a bias against that kind of stuff and I can recognize it. My question is, should I go to this person’s parents? If it’s something serious, I don’t want to be responsible for not saying anything. If it’s something harmless, I don’t want to get the person in meaningless trouble. What can I do? Or what would you do?",09Mar2020,1

A couple hours later my friend fell asleep and only his buddy and I were awake. His buddy only had a couch and a recliner to sit on and my friend was laying on the couch. I asked his friend where I was supposed to sit. He was like ""haha do you want to sit on my lap?"" So I did lol. We were smoking a cigarette and I cuddled up on him and he held me. I jokingly kissed him on the cheek and he kissed me back on the cheek. We were both tired and we ended up falling asleep with me still on his lap. I'm not sure I just feel weird about what happened.

671,"I’m going to try and make this as brief as possible because I could do on and on about the specific annoyances that has occurred since I opened a savings account with CitiBank . 

I opened a savings account with CitiBank because or their high APY. I deposited about 200.00 into the account and set up auto withdrawals from my checking account. 

A few days after opening it, I try to logon to my account and it says I’m locked out because I need to provide my debit card number. 

Since it is a new account I have not received my debit card in the mail yet. I wait a week, still no card. I call them, they say they will send me a new card. Another week and a half goes by; still haven’t received a new debit card from
Them. At this point, there are auto withdrawals coming out of the account, and I can’t even access the account online to stop them. So I begin to panic. 

I call CitiBank again, and say that I would just like to close the account all together out of annoyance. The lady on the other line, keeps interrupting me, as I have to repeat that NO I would not like another debit card sent to me, I would like to close the account (I can barely understand her by the way; English is not good) She rudely says that her supervisor has to close it and puts me on an abrupt hold. 

I’m on hold, for a few minutes, then she asks if I would like to transfer the money back to the account on file. I say yes. She claims that the supervisor is closing the account and they I will receive an email confirmation. 

It was a weird and unprofessional call. Ended abruptly after she said that. 

It’s been a couple of hours and I have yet to receive ANY indication that my account was closed. I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place because I keep calling and speaking to the same female in that department that’s giving me the run around. 

I’ve made a complaint to the BBB in hopes that I will get my money back from them. As of now, I’m locked out of my account, don’t have a debit card, and every time I call I have to repeat myself with these people who give me a hard time about closing my account. 

I haven’t been able to find a Citibank complaint line. 

Any advice on how to proceed? I only have a couple hundred in that account, and I’ve issued a stopped payment through my personal bank where the money was being withdrawn from. I honestly don’t think it’s worth the hassle, if they want to keep my money they can. I just don’t want any ties to them l,  my personal info, bank account info, sitting there open for anyone to see possibly steal.

676,"Hey guys, a little bit about me. I am currently married to my wife (19F). In our culture it is norm to marry early. I am also unemployed but a student at college. My wife is currently working through her college co-op program. We live in my in laws old house, which my father in law has blessed us to live in together with no worries about fees (except things like groceries and food). 

On paper my life looks really good. But the reality of it is, my marriage is depressing, me and my wife got caught up in our culture and the happiness or being independent that we took no time to adjust. Now we've turned out marriage into an endless argument. 

I had attempted suicide a couple months back and that event convinced my parents that my wife wasn't loving me (they're reaction makes more sense from a cultural perspective but it's too much to explain right now) and caused them to go ballistic on her AT THE HOSPITAL. This event ruined mine and my wife's relationship to my parents. I haven't seen them for months now even though they are 10 mins drive from me. 

Due to these events, and my mental health becoming worse and worse, my success in school has withered away. I am currently failing literally all my classes.

All of this said, I have been trying for months to fix everything! With my wife, going therapy, working with a counsellor at school for academic accommodations, studying hard all the time. Regardless of my efforts, things have gotten worse. 

I've only hurt my wife more which has caused her to be a less empathetic than I need her to be to help my mental health. My relationship with my therapist isn't as helpful as it used to be before. My classes and assignments just keep piling up on me cause I'm so far behind.

Now with all this said. I want to leave. I want to leave my current city, drop out of college, move to another city. I will take a loan for find a way to start making money to support myself. I want a divorce. I want to pack my stuff and find a place to live. Go Adult highschool and fix my grades so I can afford to go to a more organized program (my current program is shit lol). The main advice I need is, how do I do it? What do I need to plan? How do I plan out my financial security? How do I find a place to live? How can I learn about all the bills I haven't been paying? What else do I need to know that will probably save me in the long run?

I plan on doing almost all of it myself, and I probably won't tell anyone except someone I really trust, someone I can lean on if shit hits the fan.

I know my situation might sound cliche or looks simple from the outside but it's been a life I've burdened for too long and I think being alone and focusing on myself, far away, is the best idea. One which I've given a lot of thought to.

If it helps, I am in Ontario, Canada looking only to move cities within the province.

Tldr; Although my current life looks fun, it is actually terrible and I want to put my current life behind me and start fresh in another city, with nothing of my current life with me. I don't know where to start.",09Mar2020,1

G recently got into a relationship (it’s her first) and things have been rocky, she constantly asks for my advice and I only tell stuff from my own experience with precautions like “it might not be applicable for your situation” because frankly I don’t want to be caught up in some unwanted drama and give her some advice which might worsen her situation. Till now she’s led me to believe that the guy doesn’t give her any attention and she doesn’t even feel like she’s dating anyone. So one day when all hell broke loose she told me that she was seriously considering to break up with the guy and I told her that it’s okay if she feels like her needs are not being met in this relationship and I added “I don’t think your relationship will last long if this kinda behaviour continues” then she proceeds to tell me that she’ll tell her bf what I said about him. Till now I’d been the biggest supporter of their relationship and my only insights about their relationship come from G and I mostly just validate her feelings but then she told her bf what I said and he got super mad, he then later apologised for being mad at me and I wrote an apology back to him. I told her about the “I’m sorry- no, I’m sorry” thing and she tells me that she told him that I was the only one who was supposed to feel sorry. And I don’t understand my fault in all of this. G goes around telling me about her relationship 24/7 and constantly asks for my opinions, I give one unsavoury opinion and suddenly I’m in the wrong.

700,"Since I was a little kid, my parents' relationship with each other has been disastrous and noisy, yet they are still together. My mom (48F) and dad (57M) married very young and early. Their marriage has had great days, but double as much bad days.

I see my mom cry and upset when she leaves for work every morning all the time. She is a college teacher. I do feel sorry for mom, she works, takes care of the family and is a nice person, I don't know why my father is treating her so badly.

In January, a few days after New Year, I saw strange messages on my mother's phone. I read and it was a guy named Lawrence (28M) who wrote to her. The messages were mostly about school work and teaching, and then I realized that it was a co-worker for my mother. Her assistant.

As I scrolled down the messages, I also saw content that was about dad's and mom's relationship and I saw messages where my mom describes what is going on in the family and how dad is treating her badly. Then there were some flirty messages from Lawrence and the last messages were sent in late January, Lawrence wrote that he wanted a chance and that he had feelings for mom, but my mom declined and wrote ''no.''

I showed my mom and she explained that she no longer has any contact with him and that she replaced him with a female assistant. That was good news for me. A couple of weeks ago, everything changed. Dad ended the marriage after the problems between him and mom increased and was unstoppable.

Dad left and started living in our second house in Florida. Mom was devastated and shocked. A week later, my mom reveald to me that she is now dating Lawrence, her co-worker. She left and started living with Lawrence in his apartment, which was located close to the college they worked in.

Dad came back three days ago, when I told him what had happened, he was furious and became very angry. He talked to mom and mom agreed to return back home and be with father again. But their marriage won't be the same, because my mother (for the first time) has been with someone else, other than my father.

Personally I was really excited about being invited to something so personal. My mother has cancer and he doesn't know about it but it was going to mean a lot to me that he would donate his hair and that I'd get to be there because I know the difference a wig can make in a person's life. 

Anyway, last Friday I asked him if he had picked a day to do it yet. He said he hadn't decided yet, probably Monday or Tuesday. I just presumed he would let us all know when he had decided.

1. Because she went out with the guy I liked (not this guy) and confessed she felt good about it.
2. She had done things to make me feel bad and question myself 
3. Her mother is really manipulative 

But, all these things doesn't matter and I believe her. When she told me about these, I was so angry and was triggered. So I confronted her ex. Her ex and I had been pretty cool with each other and my friend knew it and didn't object. Her ex was crying and saying he could never do this and that he had trusted my friend blindly. My friend does have a manipulative streak and she doesn't believe in anything permanent, but she can't lie about this. Even though I have my own reservations about her, I do believe her. I can't imagine her trauma. She must have been through a lot and it took a lot of time and courage to come forward with it .

But I'm having a dilemma. This guy is in a volatile situation too and might be suicidal. I'm triggered as well and can't be friends with an abuser. 


PLEASE TELL ME WHAT TO DO.",09Mar2020,1
707,"This morning my husband and i walked to our car to see that it has been rummaged threw...again! The dash console along with the center console are open and all the contents have been strewn about. The trunk had been left wide open and had about half a dozen cigarette butts laying in it (we don't smoke). Thankfully there was nothing in our car worth taking... this time. 

About three months ago, my husband and I had just gotten married and had all of our wedding gifts in the car. We lived in a ungated community at this time and it was in the ghetto. We woke up one morning and all the gifts were gone. About $600 worth of stuff vanished. 

We now live in a gated community in a really nice suburb. We thought that our car would be safer. Neither of these incidents were break ins that included broken windows. How do people keep getting into our locked and alarmed car??? Is there anything we can do to prevent this? 

My sense of security, privacy, and safety are all gone. I don't know what to do. The worst part of all of this is that damn cigarette smell. Its a reminder over and over again that someone stranger has been in my car.",09Mar2020,1
710,"So I dropped out a few years ago, bombed my gpa because I just stopped going to class. I’m really just exploring my options. Before I bombed my GPA, I had several scholarships and was doing well but I’m pretty sure that counts for absolutely nothing now. I had a hard time focusing in college (University of SC) not in class but just in general. I was dead broke, trying to figure out how to survive and still do well in my classes, it didn’t help I started drinking and smoking weed all the time to cope as well as trying new drugs. Anyways, had a mental breakdown, moved home, lost a lot of weight, stayed in my room for months. Now I’m sober, working a job I really enjoy. My parents have mercifully allowed me to stay at home, so I have been saving a little bit. I now know for my mental health and financial well being I have to work. So I can’t do full time. What I’m thinking is getting a bunch of certificates at my local tech (accounting, computer science, engineering, welding maybe idk) instead of one bachelor degree or a couple associates. Has anyone done this? I know specializing is key but my mind works by casting a wide net. I STILL don’t know what I want to do with the rest of my life, but I want to cast that wide net so I can be successful many ways. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks in advance.",09Mar2020,1
711,"I have a friend who's been smoking pot daily since high school (maybe 4-5 years). I'm basically 100% sure that he's depressed and miserable because he's been abusing it for so long.

I don't have a problem with weed, I smoke myself but I don't think using any substance 24/7/365 is healthy. I've mentioned taking a break to him before when I went on a road trip with him (two years ago) and maybe trying other methods to cope like meditation and trying to find some hobbies he enjoys and he was very open to it. he agreed to take at least a month long break when we got home which he never ended up doing.

as the years have gone on, he's gotten progressively more depressed and started smoking more often (averaging about 20 bong bowls a day). now whenever I mention taking a break to him he gets extremely defensive and says that he'd rather die than quit smoking. he claims he needs it to treat his anxiety, which he never had before he started smoking.

he calls me every once in a while to talk and he usually tells me how depressed and suicidal he is. he genuinely believes that all of his problems are external, the main cause being his dad. his dad has got him multiple jobs (all of which paid extremely well, like $50/hour) every time he's been working he starts of very happy and content that he's able to buy things again, then he progressively gets less and less happy until he quits. by the sounds of it his dad just wants to see his son do well in life. but he absolutely despises his dad, mostly because he doesn't like him smoking pot all day every day, but he's convinced himself that his dad is the devil and that he's the most evil, hateful person on this planet.

It's so sad to see a friend in a place like this, but every time I talk to him it seems like he's asking for help, and any advice I give him is immediately dismissed. he just wants to feel sorry for himself, and I'm not sure what to do. I try to talk to him about how I've gone through the same things (being depressed and suicidal for years) and that there's hope after it all, not in a way that I'm trying to one up him or anything, but to just try and show him that he's not alone. he usually just turns it into a pissing competition though, claiming that his suffering is worse than anyone else's and no one can ever understand what he has to deal with.

I hate to sound like such a prick, but he's really not in that bad of a situation. he's got a place to live, rent free, he's got food to eat, friends and family that care about him, etc. it's just impossible to show him that he does have some good things going for him, he only wants to see the negatives.

I wanna help him get out of this rut, but I don't know how. I don't think I can ever convince him to stop smoking, so I've stopped bringing it up. I usually just tell him that I care about him and he's got family and friends that are here for him. sometimes he's grateful when I call and talk to him and other times he just gets angry that I can't seem to see things from his perspective. his parents want him to start working again but he refuses because he hates his dad so much he won't work with him, but any other job that he looks for is going to be minimum wage since he only has a high school diploma so he pretty much just sits at home smoking all day.

I don't know what else I can do, if anything. if anyone here can give me some advice I'd really appreciate it",09Mar2020,1
713,"Hey everyone! 

Im kind of in a struggle atm and need some advice to help me sort these things out. 

Here is the background story, I'll sincerly try to keep it as short as possible. 

We've met in another country although we're both from the same country. Actually the situation is sort of rare. We were a couple of guys traveling down to a city in Europe with the intention of partying and spend time together. On the airport of my friends (lets call him Marcus) met two girls which he already knew, lets call them Maria and Rosie. My friend is often known as a kind of a handsome dude who always gets all the chicks. This lead the rest of us to believe that one of the girls, Maria was already in his net (gently expressed). 

Later on the airport my friend encountered with them again, although one other guy from our crew joined the party by introducing himself while the rest of us though felt that is was kind of a needy action. 

Regardless of that, we arrived in the country and met the girls at some sort of a mall. We ended up in social interaction where introducing myself wasn't avoidable. We talked a bit and they told us that they wanted to join us for drinks later. After that short interaction me and my other friend made a bet regarding one of the girls (Rosie). We told each other that the one capable of landing her would win 10 bucks (haters gonna hate). 

The night came and it was showtime. The girls joined us at a restaurant and I'm very sorry to tell you all that I don't remember any details due to my condition. Although I remember one thing that caught my eye, I remember feeling that one the girls (Marie) keep eye contact a little longer than usual. I didn't reassemble it at that point due to the statement I posted earlier about my handsome friend and our thoughts about their connection. 

The night went along and we suddenly ended up at bar. Worth noticing here is that at this point I was clearly avoiding the girls, especially Maria because I felt that I didn't wanted to interfere on my friend Marcus, I true noble deed. I remember that I sat down in the corner with for some reason an empty seat beside me. Suddenly out of nowhere Maria came and sat down next to me. I felt kind of confused, of course she was beautiful but as a said earlier she was supposed to be with my friend. She started talking about some certain thing I don't remember again due to my condition. We talked for maybe an half hour and weirdly enough about deep questions in life. When one of my friends initiated that we were about to leave to hit another bar she leaned in close and whispered ""I want to talk more about this later"". Just when we were about to leave the girls went to the ladies room leaving my some time with my friends to discuss why she in gods name is interested in me and not my friend. My handsome friend answered by telling me that he was greatly jealous of me (this comment will matter later). 

We continued talking while we walked to another bar, although this time we were separated from the group as we walked in front of them. I felt really great about her, she was smart, funny and beautiful, everything that I was looking for. Suddenly we got interrupted by on of our friends telling us that we were on our way to a nightclub. I remember that I felt quite bad about it, a nightclub with high music was not what I needed at the moment, I wanted to go to another bar and sit down and talk. The club visit didn't become too long after I got told from the other the other friend Rosie that I should leave her friend alone and start to hit on other girls. I still remember those words in my mind and they got me thinking ""What did I do wrong, am I to desperate around her"". I left with another friend and went home. Didn't get much sleep that night. 

The next night we met the girls at a bar. I sat kind of in the wrong place so she started talking pretty briefly with my other friend, as for sure, made me upset. I quite remember that the girls were really drunk (important detail). We left and as we were walking towards another bar the girl started talking to me agian. At first i got relived feeling that she might still be in to me. Although i quickly realized that she was all time drunk and was acting weird but I gave here a change anyway. We sat down on another bar but and I bought here a drink. We started talking, although a correction might be made here.. ""she talked, I listened"". It was not the girl that I've been talking to yesterday. This girl was aggressive and not nice at all. I felt really unattractive to here at that moment, I did even ask a friend thorough text messages to help me get away from here. Of course they helped me and we got away from the girls. I remember that I in this moment felt kind of good, I felt that my expectations was lowered and that now I can truly relax, It must have been the bear that made her awesome the other day. 

The trip was over and we went to the airport were I met Maria again. I was still kind of pissed at here so my aproach wasn't so loving. Although while I talked to here I sensed that this was not the girl I've spoken to yesterday, now she was nice and caring. We talked a little bit more and she stored some songs in my playlist before the flight. When we landed in our home country the girls disappeared. Speaking afterwards I realize that I in this moment should have left it to die. 

I texted here on the buss home through social media, saying something catchy about the music she stored. She replied pretty fast and asked for a date. I accepted and we hang out the day afterwards. We walked for three straight hours and talked about life, it was really cozy and I felt that this girl was really nice. 

After that we continued to communicate trough text and hang out the other day at my place. We talked from 8 pm to 3 am about life and got quite physical. After she left that night, I realized that I was starting to fall for this girl and that I would probably be the death of me. After that occasion I asked here if she wanted to come by my place the day afterwards. She wrote me a long text telling me that she really wanted although she had promised her friends that they were going out to party. Later that night she texted me saying that I should join them on a bar in the city. I was quite tired so I kindly said no. We kept texting that night and I remember that the conversation was so good that I stayed up from 2 am to 5 am just to talk to her. At this point I was seriously starting to fall for this girl which I told my handsome friend when he asked how things were going. 

Yesterday (which is the day after that day) we stilled texted in the morning as usual. Suddenly out of nowhere my handsome friend wrote a text and delivered it to me, he had wrote something about how he understands that I felt the feelings that I did and how it use to make girls scared. I answered him by saying that ""I got you man, can we talk about this later"". He replied by saying that he managed to in some way send that very same text to Maria including my name. I thought that it wasn't the biggest of deals until she out of nowhere started ghosting me. I have sent here several snaps since then but she is still ghosting me.

What shall I do, should i write to here and tell here that I really like here or should i just let her go. I am thinking about send here a text tonight asking what is wrong and see if it the reason to her behavior is text that my friend sent wrong.",09Mar2020,1
714,"One of my friends has been extremely depressed lately and it seems to be getting worse. They have severe anxiety, ADD, and depression and take pills for it. They tell me the pills only make everything worse. I myself am not the most emotional person, I am optimistic and have high goals and ambitions for myself. My friend tells me they think everything about life is pointless, and that everything is temporary, including happiness. They sent me a note they wrote about the meaning of life, which I later learned was their supposed suicide note. I’ve tried to empathize and ask how I can help, but they say they don’t need help and they deserve everything that’s happening to them. We are both high schoolers, however I cannot contact administration because we go to different schools, and they will soon be homeschooled. What should I say or do in order to help them?",09Mar2020,1
715,"I recently got a boyfriend and we are taking things slow, but I feel like bc we like never touch hands, kiss or say cute ass shit to each other yet, I feel like I'm still in the crush fase whit him. Like I still speak quietly bc I don't want to emberass myself in front of him, I tripple read all my texts and everything, I'm even scared of walking up to him and talk sometimes (since we are in high school). I am really funny to my friends bc the only times they are funny is when they to stupid shit like pretend to flirt whit a wall, so when I come whit jokes they laugh their ass off. But my bf is like the funniest person alive I feel like, we share the same humor but I can't share it whit him. Each time I'm afraid it's to dark, to sexual or too dry. So I tend to listen and not speak. I feel like he  is loosing feelings cuz I tried to talk, and after a while  he just left me on read. I feel so stupid, and I'm afraid to talk to him about it since we just newly became a couple. It's gotten to the point where my friends and his thought we broke up bc we didn't talk for like two weeks, he blames it on school work, but I'm not sure if that's the whole truth. What to do?

Growing up on LI and working construction has left me realizing that I will have to work for the rest of my life to live a very minimal life.  It is just too overpriced here and I don't want to raise my kids here when we go have them.  I would love to move somewhere such as upstate NY or the southern US.

718,"Hey, I like this girl, a lot more than I’ve liked people in the past and we were on FaceTime for about 10 hours the other day, playing games including truth or dare, where we talked a lot about relationships, and what we want out of them, and I’ve been pretty sure for about a week or two that she likes me back, but the main two problems are that

1) she kept mentioning how she has a tendency to lead people on and

2) towards the end of the call she mentioned how a good amount of people had apparently said to her that they think I like her, here is where it gets interesting:

She asked me to be straight up with her, and even though I had a plan to ask her out, where we would have a lot of fun mini golfing and stuff, I had to tell her then because I wasn’t going to lie to her. It got awkward quick, and the mood felt really weird, and I could tell she didn’t want to date me or anything, but I wasn’t sure in what way. She texted me later after I said that I was sorry and all that junk that she wanted to be friends, and “it isn’t that you’re unattractive, you’re a REALLY great guy-“ and some more stuff but the main part that she mentioned was that she had recently gotten out of a relationship, which was part of why I was waiting, it had been over a month but I get it takes a lot of time to move on.

I told her I didn’t want things to be awkward and let’s just return to how it was before, and so we just kept texting like before but something definitely felt off.

Anyways here’s what I need advice on: what do I do?",09Mar2020,1
719,"My whole life has felt like a long list of contradictions. My parents migrated from Israel to my present country when I was quite young to avoid having me serve in the army. I dont have a good relationship with anyone in my household, but it is especially toxic with my mother; weve been arguing and yelling at eachother since I was very young, she has died as a mother in my eyes a very long time ago. I always wanted a dog because I thought it would fill me with the affection I lacked but my parents made it very clear that I would never get one. Well, I told my parents I want to leave them and go back to Israel and serve my term in the army with the end goal of living in Israel. A few weeks after made that clear we got a dog... I am now in a position where I feel totally lost, I cant go to Israel because I cant bare the idea of abandoning that dog, I cant go back to school because I dont have the courage to commit to something as knowing myself I will grow to stop liking whatever Ill do.

I'm hoping for some advice even if it's advice I'm not going to like hearing (toughen up, suck it up, etc).

So, I'm stuck in a dead end job that I don't like as well as one job that I love but can't get full time nor do I want to continue to do this type of work; no one wants to be rocking the line at 50 (I'm 29). I've spent 10 years as a chef. I am in debt 10k to the bank, I support someone who isn't working and spends too much, her three cats as well as a dog, she smokes and I have to pay for the car. I get if I'm lucky 5 hours of sleep because traveling to my jobs takes forever (she won't drive me to them and I cannot drive) and after work I have to clean the house. I haven't had a day off in four months and I'm burnt out. I look at the clock some days and cry because I'm so tried , I have been falling asleep at work, hallucinating, and just over all fucking up at work. Both places have given me warnings and I can feel my physical and mental health getting worse and worse. I cannot kick her out as she is my family and my ex. Kicking her out isn't an option for me.

I want to become a programmer but I don't have time to learn nor the money for school so it would be self taught. On my commute I do my best to learn while staying in my 4 gig data limit; it's not really sticking in my brain though.

728,"Okay, so this bloke... To preface, I have issues around germs, but I don't think I'm incorrect in thinking his behaviour is gross (the amount of anxiety it causes me is deffo out of proportion lol).

Kitchen:
- He chops raw pork a board that makes up part of the communal kitchen side. Its not a chopping board, it's a communal surface.
- He leaves large portions of said meat-based dishes, along with large pans of rice, on top of the cooker for 4-5 days at a time. He continues to eat them, and scrape leftovers back into the pan. There is one cooker, so I have to move these gross pans of slightly rotten smelling food in order to cook.
- Definitely does not wash up items properly (ie with soap) and leaves foul smelling water in the sink
- Does not seem to sanitise the sides, or if he does he's been using my cleaning supplies
- There are communal items, and my items. I keep my items together so it's clear they're part of a set, and in spite of maybe 8 communal knives he keeps using my fucking knife to chop meat. I have asked him not to very politely maybe 4 times. Same for my glasses.
- Leaves the unwashed pork containers on the side with the dry recycling
- I don't know how this man is alive????

Bathroom:
- He does not flush the toilet after he pisses
- Nor does he wash his hands
- I know this because he leaves the door open and I can hear
- He leaves hair everywhere
- I don't really want to touch any door handles bc he walks around w pisshands lol???

General:
He has not cleaned anything in the 6 months he's been here. He spilt sweetcorn last week and had to ask me where the brush was kept. The cat shat in the hallway once and he stepped over it to ask me a favour, then back over it, leaving me to discover it on my way out of the kitchen. He is on his phone loudly in the corridor until like midnight. If you leave anything out he decides it's communal. No understanding of boundaries/manners.

I don't understand how I can communicate to a full grown adult so obviously lacking in basic knowledge of germ theory. Would print-offs of food hygiene signs work? He doesn't seem to respond to polite verbal requests. Either does not understand or pretends not to. I could cry lol, pls someone who has had equally gross housemates lmk what to do",09Mar2020,1

I am so passionate about politics and history and always have been, but know switching into one of those majors will make finding a job harder and I will sacrifice a higher wage.

733,"So I'll give everyone a nice run down. 
I grew up quite a while away from where I am now. Never grew up with my dad since him and my mother divorced just after I was born. So I've always grown up around people who were just my mother's partners and my sister. There was one great guy, I loved him to bits but one day he stopped seeing me and my mum. I still don't know why to this day. However when this happened my life went down hill. We were kicked out of our really nice house and forced into living in a crap hole. This is probably due to the fact my mum not working. A few years into living in this house she started to drink. Alot. She had lots of dodgy friends one of which then beat and raped her. Which is why we moved away. Somewhere far away. This took a toll on all of us. Me, my sister and my mum. We all reacted in different ways but all affected the same. My mum got diagnosed with PTSD and me and my sister were worried. She didn't stop drinking tho. In fact it got worse. Much worse. She started to hit us some days. When she was drunk. However my mum was a lovely person when she wasn't I loved her to bits. I still do. But fast forward a few more years I'm 13 at this point and my sister is 15. Her drinking gets alot worse because of again the bad crowd of people. She started to give my sister so much abuse it was scary so scary it drove her to move out. So myum didn't even care. She just tried to pull the 'im still your legal guardian card' I always said to my sis to just stay away because it's better. Now to the present I'm 18 and my sister is 21. She is nearly done with uni and I've just been kicked out. She has been sober for a while now. Hasn't drank since my sister turned 16. Which is something I'll always be proud of. However. She didn't stop her anger she just kept getting worse. Always snapping at me and making me out to be the bad guy. Tried to turn my girlfriend against me who loves me very much. She taught me some bad lessons, taught me to lie. Taught me that you can always pull a mental card.. etc. Now I don't live with her and she kicked me out. I'm happy now where I am however she has made things harder by saying I need to decide if I'm moving out forever or if I go back it'll be  better for us.

734,"I am not sure if this is the proper place for this, but I just really need some advice.

I have been at my current job for 11 years. The past few years movement and growth in my department has really grinded to a halt. The shifts are 11 hours long, and they can vary at will starting some times at 4 am, but then sometimes swinging to the other spectrum and you don’t get out until 2am. My days off change every 6 months and I am low seniority so people take my days off every time I finally get a weekend off. And I have to work holidays. And it is a 2 hour drive to get there. I have been absolutely miserable. This job has effected me health as well. 

I finally got a job offer after job searching for 2 years. It’s a 9 to 6, with Sunday’s off. It’s 45 minutes away from my house. They say they have benefits!

I am starting to have second thoughts though. 

The pay is 2.68 less, and I am worried about insurance. I made the horrible mistake of looking up employee reviews on them and it’s pretty on the fence, which has me really nervous. And there are no sick days, which is a concern because I have a heart condition, and bad immune system.

I guess my question is. Should I turn this job down, and continue to search for a job in my pay grade that I comfortable with? Is it normal to be nervous when switching from one job to another? I have a lot swimming through my head about everything. Any advice at all would be appreciated. I’m willing to provide more details!

738,"Um hiya so recently I got into my first ever relationship with a guy I really care a lot about. He's a pretty understanding boyfriend and sorta understands how hard it is for me to deal with an extreme case of anxiety. Often at nights I don't sleep nor do I go out and hang out with people because of how difficult it is for me. Now with the context here's my problem he has done this test thing a few months ago which he continued to leave me on read on snapchat and refused to answer if he was okay and if I did something wrong. Later that week he asked to call and he told me he wanted me to tell him to call me and explain why he left me on read. I'm very timid and I always feel like I'm bothering people and that I'm clingy and because I feel like that I kinda don't express my emotions that well for fear of bothering that other person and it not being mutual and getting hurt. He's left me on read for two days and I'm hesitant to ask what's going on because I mean I'm two days he could be busy and I don't know it but if he was he would normally say that he's busy. I'm feel so dumb and clingy asking what I should do but idk. Please understand like I said I always feel like I'm bothering people and that they only speak to me out of pity. So when I don't get responses I get worried cause it always feels like my worst nightmare is coming true, that he or anyone for that matter never cared and only spoke to me and began a relationship out of pity/a cruel joke. I feel so uncomfortable and idk if I should ask to call or talk to him or not I feel so clingy and I hate it. If anyone has advice I'd really appreciate it thank you so much",09Mar2020,1
739,"We’ve been dating for almost 4 months, and we’ve had sex a little over 30 times. She’s the girl I lost my virginity to. There have been no more than two times that we’ve had sex without a condom and I used the pull-out method. Every other time, we’ve had unprotected sex for a couple minutes, and then used a condom. Other than those two times, I’ve always finished in the condom. It’s never spilled, broken, and if something  were to happen or feel off, we made sure to use emergency contraception. 

No, she isn’t on the pill. Yes, we’re ridiculously stupid. I told her that I’ll never have sex with her again unless she’s on it.

Her period was supposed to begin last Thursday or Friday; today is Monday. Thinking positively, she said yesterday that she was craving chocolate, her breasts looked bigger, she had been eating a lot/gained a little weight, etc. Yet, we’re still both absolutely terrified, and while my parents may be a little more lenient/understanding, if her parents found out that she *was* pregnant, I’d likely never be able to see her again.  

With the way she lives with her family, I don’t believe there’s any way we’d be able to go through an abortion process (which is what we’d absolutely do) without her parents knowing.

740,"Alright Reddit,

Should I quit my job to focus on losing
weight and developing a healthy mindset towards food?

I'm currently two years out of college with a degree in mechanical engineering and work as a design engineer. I enjoy my job, but have an unhealthy relationship with food and eat when I'm stressed, bored, etc. This has led to me putting on 40+ lbs since I graduated college and now I weigh 265 lbs and am only 5'10"". 

I have tried to count calories and stay disciplined on and off over the past two years, but have failed to do so.

I would like to step away from the working world for 3-6 months to fix these habits and focus on fitness. 

I have no debt, 17k in the bank, and the option to move back in with my parents so I don't drain my savings paying rent. 

I am also not in a relationship currently and don't have any obligations. I figure if I'm going to make a life change by doing something drastic now is the time before I have more responsiblities. 

Realistically I see myself being able to lose at least 25-40 lbs over this time frame and I believe I will be a lot happier with myself as a result.

I'm also planning to use this time to find a career somewhere outside of the Midwest (preferably a warmer region of the country with mild or no winters) as well as to develop my programming skills further through a local community college or online course. I figure this will help keep my brain stimulated even if I don't end up using what I learn in a future work place. 

Is this a delusional fantasy or can I make a positive life change by taking a break without setting myself too far back professionally?",09Mar2020,1

so as shocking as it sounds my dad has always been a terrible father to me and my brothers. he sided with his new wife more than his own kids and her daughter. he did horrible things to my mother before divorcing her. calling her crazy, yelling at her all the time. 

My mom recently had done a lot of bad things too. buying my high school brother weed (very common for anyone to be smoking weed in california, but he’s in high school). as well as going behind my back and talking bad about me to my girlfriend. She knows how much my girlfriend means to me, even talked to her about marrying her very soon yet she still did that after. 

My girlfriend and I have always talked about marriage and who’s last name to take given she wants my last name. she knows i’ve always had family struggles with my mom and my dad either separate or together working against me my whole life. I want to marry her in the near future yet i still haven’t decided on what to do as far as last name. Part of me feels like maybe taking my moms, part of me wants to take my dads last name cause it’s been the same one for my whole life, or possibly just picking a new last name? i don’t know how common it is to pick a new last name.",09Mar2020,1

26 million, maybe someone will see this. I don't want to type the whole thing right now. I live in a different country. I travelled over 10 000 km to find peace, and for a while it worked. I live alone, I am the only native English speaker in this town. For the first few months, I found peace. But now, even though I am truly alone, I am still flooded and overwhelmed with anger and violent intent. I wasn't always this way, I had to be like this. I grew up with violence. My earliest memory is being held down while my mother was beaten. The last memory before I left, was having my car trashed, and covering the man who did it and his truck with gasoline. I just want this feeling to go away. It feels like I'm being torn up inside. It was always reactionary. My fault for not finding a different environment. Hindsight as it is, it's my own fault.

How can I find peace. I drink until I throw up, but I cannot sleep. I smoke every bit of cannabis I can get, and I'm still angry. I have been addicted to every drug I could find.

The way he explains it they had all sort of problems but he thought marrying her would make her happy and fix everything- and of course it did not. He is now 24, I am 23 if that matters, and we have been happily married for about 4 months- I know we moved quick, but I have no regrets and we are very happy together.

At first I deleted them and moved on with my day, but a couple of them have requested to follow me a second time. When I showed my husband the usernames he quickly recognized them as his ex wives friends. I dont know how to explain this next part other than putting it bluntly- I have been stalked before and seeing these girls attempt multiple times to get information on me sent me back in the same state of fear. I know trying to follow my instagram isn’t the same as when this man would stand outside my house for hours and follow me wherever I went, but it triggers the same feeling at least.

I moved out of my parents house about a year and a half ago and got my own place. My older sister ended up breaking up with her previous BF and needed a place to stay so I said she could move in. She was paying rent/utilities in the beginning however a couple months later she meets another guy. The new guy ends up coming over more and more, and eventually is sleeping over every night. He has two kids of his own who come with him almost every weekend / some weeknights and many times end up sleeping on my couch. He has a job making okay money, probably around $20/hr, but living at a family members place, outside of that I don't know much else. At first, knowing they were trying to save money I wanted to help them out so I didn't say much; just that they not come over every weekend and that I have some heads up on weekdays. Jumping ahead to the present, she ended up getting pregnant and stopped working. We talked with the understanding that this was just temporary so they could save and get their own place. It has now been around 6 months. 

To note, the guy isn't a bad guy by any means; he's respectful and treats his kids well from what I've seen despite the living situation. Being in my low twenties and this being my first place out of my parents though, I guess I'm having a difficult time adjusting to having essentially a new group of people moving in, topped off with a newborn.

771,"I know the immediate answer is probably no, but I think it's worth thinking a second more about. Especially since only a small fraction of the population has an advanced degree. 

I want to study Organizational Leadership because I think it's fascinating. But I also work in higher education and know that I can't go higher without getting a Masters. Naturally, everyone I know at this particular college studied for a Masters in Education. But I honestly don't like it. The course descriptions for these programs seem so dry, and I feel like I'm already established within the school to continue my knowledge on how this place works. In other words, my experience is trumping my masters' knowledge. 

The main reason why I am finding it hard to believe it's not worth it is because the same was said about my Human Geography BA. People talk down on the Humanities a LOT, but I turned out really fine because of it. I enjoyed school again, which was huge for me. It was like my only positive force in my life. I wasn't resting on my laurels though either, I have had multiple internships and volunteer experiences and projects that showcased my thought process. So even though the Masters I want seems obscure, isn't enjoying it worth it? 

A few years ago, I was in a nursing program and hated it (I was also working as a nurse assistant, so I knew the full scope of the job to come) and did not last, so I quit. My mom was furious and kicked me out of the house, and I started over in community college and only took classes I liked. I ended up in Human Geography and liking school again. Even though so many people said I did the dumbest thing ever, especially as that time was the height of hiring new nurses. But I don't regret my decision at all. I actually want to like my life, not be consumed by the so-called logical choices. It's not logical to follow only what you think you should want and not what you actually want. I think you end up losing a lot of steam and not wanting to put the energy into something.

Background info. My ID says I’m born in India but I was always told that “the government got it wrong and I’m born in Singapore (where I live right now).

However I don’t even know which hospital I’m born in &amp; I have not even seen my birth certificate before // no other documents from the hospital I was born in

Another thing is that. My parents seem to not know what’s my blood type when I ask them (coz I’m not so sure myself)

I also resemble nothing like anyone in my family. 

I’m also the only one in the family who is really fucked up. I have terrible eyesight (1000 plus degree eyesight), I have severe Kyphosis (need surgery), slow metabolism (easy for me to gain &amp; retain weight, hard to lose weight / belly fat) I had multiple surgeries for my Lower body when I was younger

I have behavioural issues (which I acknowledge), such as Short Temper, Aggression, easily stressed, history of depression &amp; anxiety. (no one else in the family except has a history of mental health issues, except for one of my cousins who has OCD) 

*Essentially just bad genes. But no one else in both my mum and dads side has had ever such severities or whatever issue I have that are pretty serious* 

My mum also told me that I “had” ADHD when I was younger, but never got help for it. So essentially I think my behaviour stems from my untreated ADHD. (also always had difficulty paying attention in school) 

I’m born in 2001. Which means when my mum birthed me, she was 40, which is almost impossible. Also they visited India around 1999. My mum said that she went to India and gave birth to me there. Why did my mum who was pregnant at 40 year olds travel to India to birth me there ? (We are an Indian family and so am I) 

Most pregnant women don’t travel especially around 6 months onwards (at least to my knowledge)

He has two kids of his own who come with him almost every weekend / some weeknights and many times end up sleeping on my couch. He has a job making okay money, probably around $20/hr, but living at a family members place, outside of that I don't know much else. At first, knowing they were trying to save money I wanted to help them out so I didn't say much; just that they not come over every weekend and that I have some heads up on weekdays. Jumping ahead to the present, she ended up getting pregnant and stopped working. We talked with the understanding that this was just temporary so they could save and get their own place. It has now been around 6 months.

To note, the guy isn't a bad guy by any means; he's respectful and treats his kids well from what I've seen despite the living situation. Being in my low twenties and this being my first place out of my parents though, I guess I'm having a difficult time adjusting to having essentially a new group of people moving in, topped off with a newborn. I'm just wanting to get some other opinions on the situation as I want to help my sister through tough times but also don't want to be taken advantage of.

Thanks in advance for any advice.",09Mar2020,1

I love him but I don’t like him; I’m 18 years old and we’ve been dating for about 5 months now when I started dating him I didn’t considered him handsome although many of my friends did, with the time a started to like his physical appearance but the reason why I dated him in first place is because he’s was everything I wanted in a boy (smart, funny, humble and affectionate) I like to read and he likes it too... for this 5 months we have had a lot of little fights for jokes because both of us like to be right. He wrote me a letter saying that if he annoyed me that much (I told him yesterday “ why are you that annoying?”) Why I don’t break up with him? Because he thinks having that much fights isn’t normal and I agree so I talked with him and I told him I wouldn’t be mad all the time (pretty toxic uh) hours after that he started texting me and telling jokes about marriage with me (he usually does that and I think is cute) but the next day (Monday) in Mexico is a movement where the women is going to be at home and don’t use any social media in order to protest against the feminicides in the country. In Facebook he post “the girl who comes at school will be rewarded with a muffin”.......I was like hahaha so funny not really wtf is wrong with him, but I didn’t say anything because I can’t use any social media until tomorrow, BUT in my classroom we have a WhatsApp group (he isn’t in the group but the whole classroom is) where some boys screenshot the post and where saying “I’m the only one or no one sees the joke?” I agree with them because it wasn’t something he could joke about in the other hand “my bf” has told me that he respect women and he’s treats me like a lady idk why he did that but it really annoyed me, besides everybody knows me in the classroom bc I’m a feminist so.... by the way I just checked and he remove the post.thats the tea sis sorry bc is to long.

So all their stuff is pretty old school like paper checks, speaker box for the drive thru instead of a headset, etc. It's an okay job. I'm about to go on salary which will hopefully make it more worth it but my biggest issue is when I was hired I was told we would all rotate working weekends and having them off. I don't mind working the weekend but I was told we would rotate them off and that's not how it's happening. Other people have even told me that's just what the HR lady said to get me to take the job like she did to the other person who was hired the same day as I was.

All the scheduled days are no less than an 11 hour shift with NO BREAK, and that right there is my biggest issue. The regular employees get breaks but evidently my company gets away with not giving managers breaks by saying that we have time to eat on our shift in the down times, but what if there aren't down times? I can't tell you how many days I've worked without eating at all on a 11-12 hour shift. I barely got anything to drink. It's just frustrating b cause some days the bosses wanna give you shit for trying to sit down and eat something  so it's all that and including the fact we get ""two"" days off but one of them are on days when we have to be at the store from 430pm til 4:45 in the morning so it doesn't really feel like a day off when I sleep all day from working all night just to have to be back at work at 6:30am the day after my ""day off"". Also they can call you in at anytime on your ""day off"" and you have to go in. So it's really hard to have a life or schedule anything. Plus!!!! They make the regular employees schedule for two weeks out and post it every week but our schedule is posted every two weeks so the last night of the week, none of the mangers know what they're working the next day because they don't even have the decency to give us a month in advance schedule so we could possibly attempt to have a life outside of a fast food business 🙃 please be honest with me and tell me if I'm overreacting or if this company is abusing their authority over people.

My Mom became disabled a few years ago and due to the circumstances around it, she's still awaiting a court date to receive disability funds. Because of this our entire family was on Medicaid, but since I turned 19, I no longer have any insurance. This is a major issue because when I was in Middle School I was diagnosed with ADHD and SAD and went untreated due to my parents beliefs. Everyday around multiple people there'd be a pit in my stomach and I'd constantly feel like throwing up. When I go to the grocery store I shake and sweat a lot and I've never wanted to eat at a restaurant because of having to talk to someone.

I have no work experience and am currently looking for a job however because of the anxiety, I don't believe I'd be able to hold a job without being treated for my SAD.

799,"Tldr: hate my face, I'm insecure, think I probably have autism, and think I'll die alone because no one will accept me 100% as who I am

I've been doing well and sticking with this philosophy of ""if you cant control it, then there is no point in stressing or being upset over it"" and it's been helping me tremendously. However I have always my whole life hated my appearance and I've always been deeply insecure. I'm not fat, maybe a bit chubby, which is honestly a miracle considering I eat enough for 4 people. My weight isnt even what I'm insecure about. It's mostly just my face. Everything about it. I hate how ugly I look and I've never felt like I was worthy of being loved. 

This deep insecurity leads me to being anxious or easily bothered all the time at little stuff, whether I get left on read or someone half heartedly says ""sure we can hang out sometime"" whatever it is, I feel completely vulnerable in most situations I put myself in out of my comfort zone. I've never asked someone out and had them say yes, (I've asked out maybe at least 8 people over the course of my life) in fact, there's only ever been one person in my life that showed true interest in me, and I swear she was psychotic. so this adds to the deep underlying insecurity I have. Not to mention that I always felt different and felt like your typical 'weird kid.'

I am quiet 90% of the time, I stutter alot on the few times I do talk, I almost feel like I lack emotional depth in a way idk how to describe it, not like psychopathy but as if I dont understand the emotional depth other ppl have. i am socially awkward, but I've improved on that alot within the last year. It is easy for me to get overwhelmed at work and I feel like my problem solving skills aren't perfect unless I have a decent amount of time to analyze the situation. I have limited interests, but the interests I do have I become somewhat obsessed with. For example, I LOVE the walking dead. Hands down my favorite show I could watch it any day. I also like being creative, so I combined my interest into one and I've created a walking dead fanfiction comic series with 50 fully uploaded comics and a rough draft script done for another 20. (r/TWDFANCOMIC for anyone who's interested) Watched a video on autism the other day and some of my traits were lining up perfectly with it. 

Whether i really am on the spectrum or not doesnt matter to me, what does matter to me is the fact I cant shake the feeling of being so incredibly ugly, unlovable and weird that I'll never find someone to love me for who I am. Yes i know i still have plenty of time left, yes i know i need to keep working on stepping out of my comfort zone, yes I know it should only matter what I think about myself, but it's just not that easy. I know I've got a more pessimistic attitude, but when everyone says ""you'll find someone"" over and over it's not helpful and kind of depressing. what if I dont?

807,"I'm staying at some friends' house watching their pets, and this morning, something inside the house started smelling like a skunk. It's not so strong that my eyes are burning, but you can certainly smell it. I know they have coyotes that come around this part of town, and I've seen tons of raccoons, possums (yeah, Arkansas) and sometimes armadillos around me side of town about 5 miles away, but skunks aren't very common in town. You rarely come across a road kill skunk in town.

The animals don't seem to be too bothered by it, but the dog was whimpering a little last night. He wasn't hurt and he's been acting like he feels 100% fine, but he's also the type of dog to whimper and act concerned when he hears a raccoon or something in the crawlspace. Thing is, I haven't seen any skunks around, and I know I didn't let one in the house or the animals would have found it and would have gotten sprayed. I'm wondering if a skunk got into the crawlspace (I'm not familiar enough with this house to know where that is), but it doesn't seem likely that it got into the back yard. I've tried sniffing around the air vents and tried to see where the smell is coming from, but my sense of smell isn't very good, so I have no idea where it's coming from.

I can't figure out where the smell is coming from. You can smell it a little outside the front door, and in one side of the house.

Yes, I know I need to tell the owners of the house about the smell, but beyond that, is there anything I can do to get rid of the smell? To me, it's somewhat tolerable, but it doesn't go away.

I really don't want to bother the people who own the house because last time I watched their pets, one of the HVAC units went out. I let them know about that, and they called someone to get it fixed.

810,"So, I'm 18 years old, I've been under my helicopter parents since I was born, and I've developed a mental barrier that makes me unable to say stuff that goes against their will, because they would always blame me and speak to me like it was extremelly stupid to say that, because ""they know better"". 

If I say something they don't like, they get impatient and demand stuff, and I'm very sensitive that I almost freeze and just do what they want.

They treat me like a child, and this constant parenting actually made me anxious and I don't know how to handle some adult situations because of it. 

Now, I have a boyfriend, he's 18 too, we've been together for almost a year now, and my parents still doesn't let us in my room with doors closed. They don't let me go to his house if his mom isn't there, even if i'm just going there to have lunch and go back to school.

I know they do that because they think it's the best, and because they are worried ""something"" might happen if we get too intimate, etc etc...

But the thing is, that is just very naive and immature of them, to prohibit stuff like that is stupid, it is useless to try to have controll of that.  My BF and I are intimate, we have sex, I sleep at his house with him, and they don't have a clue.

I'm not confortable with that, but I have to lie to them in order to do what I want, and to do what they have no right to put into their own hands, as if I were a kid.

I don't know how to talk to them and make them stop, I don't want to make them sad, but my boyfriend gets pissed of with them picking on everything, and he gets very angry at them, but never said anything to them.

Like, recently I was very sick, my bf have medicine at his house, he messaged my mother to tell her what happened and that he was treating me, but the first thing she asked was ""is someone else at home"". See? That's absurd.

I want some advices in how to deal with their controlling and bossy behaviour towards me.

812,"I (23 year old F) recently got engaged and my fiance (24 year old M) and I are looking for our first place together, but the issue is, right now our places of work are a good distance apart. I just got hired at my place and I do like it (and I'm not too eager to go back into the job hunt) and he's extremely happy with the place he's been working at for the past two years. Neither of us wants to quit or make the other quit, but this is definitely making the apartment hunt a bit difficult, there aren't very many options open that we've seen and most of the ones that are open are usually closer to one of our places of work, meaning the other would have about a 40 minute commute to work. We obviously want to avoid this but I'm not sure if there's much we can do about it, we have found a few places that would be good enough (around 35 minutes for each of us) but they don't have any openings and there's no guarantee they will have an opening when I have to move in June. There is still time but Im just wondering what we're gunna do if one of the places we want doesn't open up when we need it to. What should we do?",09Mar2020,1
813,"Hey Everyone, so... Im kind of in a tough spot right now with my girlfriend and I don't know what to do or say. I'm also just kind of confused by what's going on. Yesterday was my Girlfriends sisters 16th birthday. I asked my girlfriend if it would be alright to skip the dinner because I wanted to go to the gym and hang out with my friends after for a bit, she said it was okay. ( I had just got back 1 day ago from vacation with my girlfriend and we visited some her family, not her immediate family but still ) Last night she called me and everything was chill, we were laughing , talking n than randomly she started saying she was upset that I didn't come to the dinner and I let her and her sister down. She was like ""it doesn't seem like you want to be around her family"" and she started crying and getting really emotional. I haven't talked to her the next day because I don't Know what to say... I feel bad that I didn't show up, I legit didn't think it would be such a big deal but at the same time I'm kinda confused because she said it was okay if I didnt come and she didn't show any previous signs of being soooo upset about it. We never fight and have a really healthy relationship , that's why this has caught me so off guard. What do I say ? do I apologize to her and her sister or what ...? Somebody HELP !",09Mar2020,1
815,"So I recently caught my child who’s only 14 smoking on cigarettes! He has shown no remorse and I did not raise him to do this though I party take the blame. This has sent my head through a bit of a whirlwind because I have 3 other kids who are older and it makes me wonder how many of them are smoking behind my back? I run a very conservative Christian household, no drugs, no smoking, no violence etc etc.


The worst thing is I caught him in my backyard! I was watching my programs then I got up to go get myself a glass of water, as I was pouring the glass it smelt like a barbecue, I went outside to take a look and there he was in the tree behind my yard, I took the cigarette off of him and he looked like he seen the Holy Ghost, I tried to shout of him but he clearly ignored me and the next day I tried to talk to him but he completely shut me down!. This is the last straw. I’d like to invoke my ancient rites to trial by combat.


I wish to invoke my ancient rite to trial by combat, these rites are granted to me by my Celtic warrior ancestors before me and for my son to cowardly run away from me instead of accepting my challenge just goes to show how much he truly believes in his debauchery. Winner takes all. 


The weapons can be as follow and he can choose to use a shield:


1. Sword


2. Spear or halberd 


3. Mace or cudgel


4. Axe


You can wear a steel helmet but the rest can only be clothing, you can also carry a backup dagger incase you drop your primary weapon. I’m 100% serious and I want to do this. These are my ancient rites and I would like to see proof that they weren’t granted to me, I’ve already talked to the state and they’ve told me personal combat is allowed. I wouldn’t mind your opinions though at all.",09Mar2020,1

817,"I used to be very active in my church community as a child and teenager, mainly because of my scout troop belonging to our church. I didn't really go to service and I don't think I was ever a big believer, but all my friends were there and we helped out with a lot of the community activities.
As I got older, it got more and more difficult for me to just overlook the religious parts. I like the christian values, I just can't and don't want to believe in a god. Listening to their prayers and songs makes me feel really weird and misplaced. So I kind of dropped out during the last few years (also because of less time). Lately I've been feeling really lonely and I miss the sense of belonging to something. I really want to be active with the scouts again, but religion is a big part in that too. So I'd either have to lie or I have to come up with a way to explain that I don't believe but still want to be part of their community. Or I have to find something entirely new, but I live in a small town with little opportunities.
Any ideas on how to handle this situation?",09Mar2020,1

I live in Ireland. Months ago, I booked tickets to go and see a friend in England during the St Patrick’s Day holiday. I’m not intending to go to any parades, it’s just a good time to go because it’s a public holiday for me. 

A major regional airline just collapsed, so now my flight has been changed and involves a transfer at Amsterdam Schipol.

Coronavirus levels are pretty much the same in Ireland, England and the Netherlands. Am I any more at risk by travelling than if I just stayed at home?

827,"My parents are both in their early 60s and have been struggling to make ends meet for years, both working in dead end jobs earning barely more than minimum wage. They've always had shared finance, with my mum paying virtually everything into their shared accounts while leaving my dad to control the finances.

Recently my dad has been spending money like it's nothing. He bought a car for £4500, then barely 2 weeks later, he part exchanged it for a newer model at a £1500 loss. Now he's become obsessed with some flight sim game, bought £400+ flight pedals to use with the game, followed by over £800 of upgrades to his computer to run the game. And all that for a game that, based on something similar happening before, he probably won't play for more than a month.

My mum found out about the stupid loss he made on the car and was distraught, but he just shrugged it off because apparently it's his money and he can spend (or waste) it how he wants, but my mum and I both have no idea how he has money to blow like that when they're supposedly sharing their finances.

My mum doesn't know about the money he's spent on computer parts for this game, and I want to tell her, but given the way things exploded when she found out about the car, I don't want to go through that again.

Meanwhile I'm paying them rent which was apparently to help make ends meet, and he's planning to increase that by 50% until it's pretty much as I'd be paying to live on my own.",09Mar2020,1

Was I unintentionally being rude by not messaging her back in a timely response. I only message when I'm on the site, but I think she might have thought that I was being dismissive.

In the last few days the place where I live (Milan, Italy) is being seriously threatened by covid-19 and my 81 years-old granpa (her husband) has a medium-high tenperature (38.5 Celsius degrees) and We don't know what the cause of that temperature is (it might just be due to the fact that He stayed out of his home without a jacket when it was cold but We are still unconcerned because It'll be hard to get cured properly at the hospital)

It already sucks, but on top of that my grandma starts to forget her stuff, forgets words and today called me with the wrong name (then She realized though and corrected herself)

My concern now is that She might be developing alzheimer's and I want to know if You think it's happening just because of the stress (that also might be an option since the situation is very stressing for Her) or the stress just made those red flags more evident.

She will be brought to her doctor tomorrow anyway so that We'll get a proper diagnosis, but since I feel like fainting right now I want to know what You think about it, thanks in advance

He makes blueprints of electronics, not bombs I don’t think and draws this logo and has drawn it hundreds of times. It’s really cool and a bunch of people are curious but when our teacher asked him he said it was nothing. He seems really different, not sure if it’s in a bad way or not yet.

I left the job on a good note. I have a great relationship with my former supervisor who said she would help me talk to our leadership about my wanting to come back... but she said she thinks I need to give this new job a chance. In fact, everyone I know thinks I should give the new job a chance. My reasons for wanting to leave immediately are as follows: they didn’t tell me everything about the job and I don’t like some of my responsibilities, I went from my own office to a cubicle, the cost of living here is much higher so I have less money to save or spend.

The reasons I left were dumb really. I didn’t like some changes that leadership made and got pissed enough to apply elsewhere. I was surprised when I got the job since I didn’t really want it but figured it was a better title and slightly better pay so I should go for it. Now I regret that so much.

836,"Hello, sorry for the edgy title

I've been struggling a lot in the past 6 years after a move to a new country (from Israel to Germany so a big big cultural and linguistic shift). My first 2 to 3 years have rather isolated me as I couldn't communicate properly without harsh language barriers.

I'm not in contact to my mom or her side of the family and my dad is someone that's very difficult to talk to, so at home I never had much of an outlet and mostly just served as someone who'd listen to my dad. Friend-wise I also struggle as I still have some language barriers that hold me back from properly expressing myself and therefore make it hard for others to listen to me (this is a speculation).

I don't mind being quiet among my German peers but I've noticed it left an impact on how I view my online friendships or my relationships (all of which are in a language I'm much more comfortable in). When I talk to those specific people I'm relieved to be able to speak easily but then I get much more irritated and hurt when I'm being talked over. We have a D&amp;D campaign going on and my boyfriend (who runs the campaign) and I have been trying to have them interrupt each other less as it's frustrating and there hasn't been much of a difference. Last session I blew up three times as they'd all literally speak over each other and it was impossible to get a word through. After that session when I tried to express what I'm feeling about the campaign my partner shut me off.

I go to therapy for a weekly session of actually being listened to. This is the only time I feel someone would care enough to let me speak for once. Everyone around me seems to fail at either listening or even letting me speak to begin with and I'm struggling not to blame myself as it can't be everyone's fault. This issue is starting to affect my life heavily as I'm breaking friendships, lash out of frustration, and lose a lot of motivation for things I was once passionate about.

I have no clue of how to tackle this and I desperately need some second opinion. Is it my fault I don't speak loud enough? How can one contribute to a conversation that's made of overlapping voices?

I apologise if this thread is confusing, I'm writing this out of a very emotional state.

Fucking rotting. 

To cope with this heavy weight on my shoulders, I distract myself with being on youtube, playing pubg, cuddling with my dog, watching dramas, dancing but never going outside. Only if I have the sudden urge and sudden courage and confidence to buy groceries.

I dont talk to anyone to cope with this, neither my family, my dad, my brother who hates me to the point of not talking to me at all for 11 years or my mother who's out of the picture. I just handle it by my own... I want my dad to help me but hes too self absorbed and is not clear minded enough. He would just blame me, compare his life past life to mine, giving me shitty advices that narcissist parents do so that the kid would just shut up. He now hates me because I'm now nothing but a burden, a problem to him. I dont fucking like him anymore too. 

When i get to socialize, eventually I would just get ignored and get labeled as the quiet one. I would get jealous of some people, the fact that they can do 'that'.

I’m so worried I made the wrong choice but i also don’t want to move backwards?",09Mar2020,1
841," 

I'm having trouble making a decision, so naturally I'm turning to Reddit.

Here we go...

**A little background:** I (23 f) graduated college in August 2018 so I moved back to my home town &amp; currently live with my parents to save up money so I can move to a bigger city where there are more opportunities to do something I love. I was struggling to find a full-time job relevant to my degree (Communications), but I found something part-time (social media/marketing related).

**Now:** So I've been working part-time (25 hours a week) doing something I'm good at, relevant to my interests and don't necessarily hate, but it's not my dream job. Since it's only part-time, I've had a lot of free time to do a lot of fun freelance projects (also social media/marketing/events related) to make extra money. I've been doing this for about a year now &amp; it's been pretty fun &amp; I've been slowly building myself a small presence as an Independent Contractor helping local/small businesses. The only problem is the pay is low/terrible &amp; there's no benefits.

**The dilemma:** So, I just got a job offer from a fortune 500 company to be a ""talent sourcing specialist"" AKA a recruiter. My dad works for the company so he told me about the opening/encouraged me to apply. This isn't what I want to do with my career, but the starting salary is OVER double than what I make now and I'd get to work from home. I've been trying to find a full-time job relevant to my interests that pays well for about 6 months now (there's not many opportunities that interest me here which is why I'm moving), but this is the first job offer I've gotten. I'm not sure if I'll like it &amp; I'd feel kind of guilty accepting it knowing I'm trying to move to a different city within the next 4-6 months. Also, I don't want to backtrack my resume with switching to a career that doesn't interest me... if that's possible?

**BUT...** Since I've been staying with my parents &amp; since I've been saving money since high school, I have a decent amount of money saved (over $15k), but at the same time I want to save as much as I can, especially since I want to move to a bigger city where the cost of living will eat up my savings in about two months or less. I also want to be able to afford to do recreational activities &amp; enjoy my life.

**To sum it up:** Do I take a job I might not like just for the money/benefits, even though I'll probably leave after 4-6 months? Or should I stay doing something relevant to what I want to do so I can keep it on my resume?

847,"It's a long story, spanning over years. So if you can read till the end and advise me - I'd really appreciate it.
I have been chatting with my friend over the Internet, let's call her San, for 9 years now, who was in the same class as me when we were in school. We rarely talked in class (but chatted a lot, a lot on the Internet), and after we graduated high school - we have still been chatting over the Internet.. having met once, or probably twice in the last four years of our college.
Recently I've been dating girls to get over her but I just can't move on. Every time I am with some other girl, I don't feel the way I feel when I'm chatting with San. I have realized that I have feelings for her for almost four years now. 
In conversations, San has even told me that she always wants to be single, and is never going to get together with anyone in the distant future. She has always been like this. She is strong, independent, and have trust issues. So today, I finally told her about my feelings, mostly to get it off my chest. I also told her that I don't expect a reply from her - to just acknowledge that and still be friends. 
She replied to me by saying that she had known about my feelings for some time now and her feelings do not reciprocate towards me. She told me we can continue our friendship and also told me not to have any kind of false hopes of getting together with her or something.
This crushed me a little because I still had a little, a little hope inside of me about getting together with her. But that's okay - you can't get everything you want in life. That's the way it works. But I needed some advice on how to actually get over her? Should I break the friendship and stop all kinds of communications with her? I've been trying so hard to like other girls, focus on my career, and indulge in my hobbies - but each night I end up thinking about her. 
I know it's a small problem compared to what others ask here on this subreddit but still it's a problem no matter how little. Any kind of help is appreciated.

849,"I’m stuck. I don’t know what to do or how to do it. Don’t get me wrong though. I’m grateful to even have the opportunity to go to college and I’ve narrowed it down between two schools. One is in Italy and the other one is in Idaho. I started to have a niche in learning the Italian language about 2 years ago, learned the basics of the language, and the next thing I know, my dad gets a job at a community college in Idaho and takes it. I’m currently in the Midwest finishing high school with my mom and after I graduate, we’re relocating to Idaho to reunite with my dad. Anyways, when my dad took the job, they offered an Italian class and I could take it basically free because my dad worked at the institution. So, I decided to take the class and I’m currently in my 2nd semester, but my Italian is getting past the beginner stages! After I started taking the class, I decided to apply for an English speaking University in Italy and I got in! I recently visited the campus and I loved it. The people, the location, and the many opportunities that go along with attending an international university. The only problem is that it’s expensive to attend. I have to pay about $17k tuition a year plus room and board. So it’s probably around $35k-$40k a year. The other option is attending an in-state public institution in Idaho where it would be cheaper, but the opportunity to attend a university in Italy is always in my mind. I feel like every leading up to this moment has me attending this university in Italy. I find it funny how everything aligned and I don’t think it’s luck or chance. I go from having an itch to learn Italian to having the opportunity to attend a school in Italy! The issue is that it’s expensive and I’m wondering, what do you all have to say about it?

859,"Hi!

I've read some posts here and felt like this could be a good place to maybe get a helpful perspective. 

I am 32 years old and all choices that I have made so far in my life were driven by insecurity, anxiety and need as well as longing for approval. My biggest weaknesses are consistency and the ability to get massively excited, that plummets almost as fast as it rises. 

I am an ENFP (look up ""MBTI"") and during my entire time in high school my main interests were making people happy and wanting to be liked. I am not clumsy, but I acted like I was to give my classmates a reason to laugh. I wanted to see them smile, even if I had to pay for it.   
I excelled in Sports and English and I had no love left for math - my primary school math-teacher ridiculed me in front of the class when I barely 8 and in the past I sometimes wondered whether that messed with me somehow.   
I cared little about grades, as my main focus was **a)** having fun and **b)** good relationships. I was very lazy and I hardly ever did any pre- or post-prep. I was indeed liked by most students as they were always happy to see me and I was invited to most birthday parties etc. and I was also bullied by those classmates who were less popular as they gave comments like ""look, the education-gap is coming"" and quite a number of other events. All those comments stung and some girls told me to defend myself, because they noticed those harsh comments. I never defended myself, because **a)** I was afraid **b)** I didn't know how, because I was conflict-averse by nature. 

**I was 18**. I knew about my bad grades and I was massively embarrassed because of that, but I still didn't focus on studying but having good relationships. I compensated by working out and I noticed a massively growing interest on how the body works. Anatomy, physiology were my thing. Over time  still during High School girls would start notice a change in my physique and guys sometimes stared at my arms. I was far away from a bodybuilder, but I was more muscular. 

Towards the end of High School some classmates would ask me ""so do you want to become a fitness trainer? \*snarky chuckle\*"". In that very moment this option died for me, because according to those classmates a fitness coach was nothing one could be proud of.   
I was like a leave in the wind - dependent on the thoughts, comments and judgements of others. I neither knew how to make decisions for myself now how to be responsible for myself. 

I graduated from High School with two things:   
**1.** with barely any preparation at all and   
**2.** without a slightest amount of self-esteem

I've always had a deep and loving relationship with my parents, but I never shared any of the events that happened at school. I was a master of ignoring acting like everything was fine. *(Where those character traits come from is another topic of course, but I want to be as objective as possible here.)*

**At 20** years all I knew was that I had to study... like all of my classmates. I decided to study sports science and I trained for a month, 6 days a week, several hours a day. I went to the local pharmacy and asked for legal drugs to help my body recover faster. I qualified for studying sports, but my GPA was too low to get accepted in the same year.   
I decided to pick a different subject, because not starting a study in the same year was not an option - to much peer pressure in my head. I picked a major that completely antagonized my character -  it was the only option I found. I had to move far away from my parents and while it was frightening in the beginning, I started to enjoy it after a few weeks. I quickly noticed that my major was nothing for me, but I liked to live on my own terms so I neither quit nor did I tell my parents that this major was a bad choice. I lived in the moment until my circumstances at college forced me to quit. 

**I was 23**. I felt bad for quitting, although I knew this major was a torture for me.  
I didn't want to go back to my parents and at the same time I felt like I had to make up for the lost time by picking a major that would let me shine in a supposedly good light. I wanted to redeem myself. Again... I didn't think about what would be good for me, but I looked at myself through the eyes of other people.  
Sport Science popped back into my head. In my head Sport Science wouldn't give me the credit I felt like I needed to redeem myself from my High School-failure. I decided to go for Sports Medicine, but I had to wait a few years to get accepted into the program. I was hellbent on following that road, so I successfully became a registered nurse in the meantime. 

**I was 27**. I wasn't accepted into the medical program and I still had to wait. I was running low on finances and I detested the work as a nurse. Not the work itself was the problem, but its societal reputation. It didn't give me the alleged prestige I needed to regain my self-esteem which I was still longing for. I decided to try a completely different industry. I started working for a service provider that produced blueprints.

**I was 29**. I still wasn't accepted into the medical program and I decided that it was enough. I had waited 5 years, received nurse training in the meantime. I moved back to my parents and almost decided to do Sport Science, but I didn't. Also during those years I met a number of software engineers who told me about their work and how many job offers they receive on a regular basis. That tempted me.   
So I decided to study informatics. Futuristic stuff had always fascinated me and I thought virtual reality is cool. I watched and read a lot of material on software engineering and I prepped myself with tons of speeches the one from Steve Jobs that said ""programming teaches you how to think..."". 

During the first year I noticed that I didn't enjoy it. Learning programming was tough! It still was fascinating to me though and I buckled down. I passed, but I still didn't get hooked. Programming made me feel smart, because of all the seemingly cryptic languages. I felt like this could be something to make up for my failure and dump reputation at High School.   
Sometimes I would meet people who said ""he is an IT guy"" and it made me shudder. In my head I said ""I'm no IT guy, I'm a Sport Scientist."", but I didn't say it out loud.

**I was 30**. I continued with my study, because I didn't want to quit again and I started feeling depressed. I didn't want to get up in the morning. I didn't want to smile. I didn't want to meet people, which was completely contrary to my nature. When friends asked me how study was going and how I felt I said ""Oh well, I'm good. Study is going alright."" while thinking at the same time ""don't ask me about my study."". 

Only very few people in my life are able to see through my cloak - my always smiling persona. As a little kid a teacher would ask my Mum how it was possible that I was always happy. I actually was happy, because I was backed by my parent's unconditional love. I am and always will be utmost thankful for that, way beyond words can express. Being more true to myself, my emotions and letting more people in is something I've been learning continuously.

**I was 31** and whilst I kept studying and feeling down, I started reading, watching and listening to anything that had to do with motivation, life-purpose and entrepreneurship to push myself out of the depressed feeling. I wanted to stimulate myself so I read Elon Musk's, Steve Job's, Jack Ma's and Richard Branson's biographies. I also started reading about stock trading, forex trading and online advertisement.  
I dove into those topics, because **(a)** of interest **(b)** to distract myself **(c)** to regain my happiness, which is basically **(b)** as well and lastly **d)** to find out what else was out there.

On a positive note... by feeling depressed, I encountered a whole new world in terms of business and entrepreneurship. Thanks to all that self-imposed input, I learned a lot about myself and that academia is not the only way to financial opportunities.  
Side-note: I grew up with the notion that a college degree is inevitable.  


...it's crazy how my High School memories still knock on my door and I have to be vigilant to not get caught up in them.   


**If you read until here I salute you.**  

My feelings of depression come and go. I am still studying and working part time. I have lost a considerable amount of hair, because of stress and worries. I sometimes feel like I have aged fast-forward because of that. I still live with my parents.   
I can't imagine working in the IT industry longterm and I can't help but thinking about Sports Science. Since I've been diving into the world of entrepreneurship I am also keeping a list of projects that I'd love to put into practice. I keep conceptualizing and some ideas seem to be good enough to me to turn them into an [mvp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product). Recently I found a college that allows me to do a 1 year bachelor in Sport Science, because it takes into account my precious education in nursing.   
A whole lot of scattered thoughts and ideas.

My current study will still take me about 1,5 years and I've been thinking about quitting to turn towards the subject that I've been wanting to do since I was 20. In order to sustain financially I considered going through a coding boot camp (despite what I said a few lines before) so that I can work as a developer while studying part time.  
If the 1 year Bachelor pans out, I'll be done when I'm 35-ish. I could even imagine doing a PhD some day, because anything sport-related gets me hooked. I want to be a sports coach to other people and I want to raise awareness concerning physiological health.   
It hurts my brain when I think about the fact that it took me over a decade to accept my innate interest as worthy and valuable and to grow over that remark by my classmate over 12 years ago. It's almost ludicrous to think that such comments can cause emotional trauma that in turn can have such long-lasting influence on decisions. 

On the other hand I feel like I had to go through all those feelings of depression to deal more with myself and to become aware of my characteristics and personality traits. Today I know how important conflict is, how benefitial arguments can be, how important emotions are and that it's equally important to not ignore emotions but to go through them and to face them.   
Honestly... if I didn't know that my parents loved me as much as they do, I'm not sure how far I would've made it.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have advice or thoughts concerning turning my fragmented thoughts into a viable roadmap, please feel free. I'm not hoping for a specific answer. I want to let people grant a look inside my head and listen to their general advice.

 I am 25f, he's 22m. I have PCOS and anxiety/depression. We've Been together for 4 years, have been friends for longer. We rented a place together for 3 years before moving back with my parents temporarily. We work at the same company, but different departments and hours (I go in at 6am-7pm/He goes in at 8am-5pm). He's also taking police academy at nights after work(6pm-10pm), and I'm holding off nursing because we are planning on moving in the fall to another city after he finishes. Our families love each other, we have a future plan together, our friends claim we're perfect for each other. Everything is going so great.

Drama:  
Monday night he comes home late(2am); when he's lost in thought, he likes to drive around to clear his mind. We briefly talked on the phone before i went to bed. Next morning, i see him at work and we  chat, kiss and then continue on with our work. 2 hours later, He suddenly texts me saying he feels depressed and detached, I asked him to explain and he said he feels we shouldn't get married, he doesn't feel attracted to me on some days, and so many other contradictions to our plans. I get worried, so we meet up during our lunch to talk. He basically just tells me he doesn't want to be with me because he's selfish, stressed  and doesn't want to do this anymore and i deserve better. My heart literally breaks, but we're at work so I'm trying to maintain composure. I tell him do what he must and then i go back to work. In my mind, i was thinking once we get home we can talk this out. We have a rule that we always talk it out and never go to bed angry. Well, He ends up leaving work early and moving out of my parents house to his moms. I come home to see his stuff gone and it hits me hard. I ask him to come over and talk but he claims he's sleep deprived, so we can talk tomorrow. Ok, whatever. Next morning, i try texting him good morning , thinking it was a bad nightmare and he shoots me down. I still beg to have him talk to me in person later, and he agrees. Im feeling sick to my stomach and can't eat. I realized I had been nauseous for few days, so i took a pregnancy test. SURPRISE, its positive. I feel happy and grateful because this will help bring us back together, so i wait to tell him later. We meet up to talk, and he looks guilty asf. I ask him what happened and why he's being like this. He admits, he kissed another girl two week ago at work. It didn't mean anything to him, he just wanted to see what it would feel like. We both had previous relationships, but we were each other's firsts. He claims that what if he's not ready to settle down and have kids, and maybe he wants to date around or just see what's out there because he's young. He is very goodlooking so of course women flirt with him, and his coworkers are older men giving him ""advice"" that he shouldn't marry early cause he could regret it. He admits to being attracted towards other women, and doesn't want to hurt me. My heart is literally shattered. Yet, I admit, kissing is not that big of an offense and willing to forgive him. He's literally part of my life, and i cannot imagine it without him. Plus with the baby, i just wanted him with me. I beg him, and he still denies. Finally, i tell him about the pregnancy test and he does a complete 180. He says this changes everything and he wants to be with me and he wants the baby. I give him a couple days to think about it. During those couple days, I can't eat and I experience extremely heavy bleeding. We meet up again at night and i bring him dinner i had made. He eats it and breaks down saying that he misses me and he's miserable and made a mistake. We makeup, agree on therapy if needed and get back together. He moves in his stuff and we act like nothing happened. Yet, it did happen. Im so glad he's back with me, but i feel paranoid and upset still.  All those things he had told me about myself are replaying in my head and I'm constantly thinking about them. Ive never felt so low in my entire life. I ended up losing the baby a couple weeks ago and he's been super supportive, i don't know how i would've gotten through it by myself. But i don't know what to do with these thoughts. I chose to forgive him, but my anxiety is at an all time high. What is your take/feedback on this?

I’ve had 5 jobs so far, all office based. Most of them have been ok and I’ve only really left due to relocating. All jobs have had similar pay (£9 an hour) 

In the last few years I’ve moved out and have lived on my own since. My friend lived with me for over a year and paying bills etc wasn’t so bad when you had someone to split them with. 

But now, I’m on my own and I’m struggling a lot to pay rent, bills, a car, food etc. I can only just manage but I have to put myself into debt if I need to buy clothes or if I want to go out with friends on my days off. I can’t even save or buy furniture. 

The thing is, I LOVE the job I’m currently in, I get to do so much more than just office based things and the people I work with are the best. I feel so comfortable there and I would hate to leave. 

But - I barely have a life outside of work because of my lack of pay... obviously personal life is more important than work life but I don’t feel like I’d get that lucky with a job again.

My only real family left are my parents, so I don’t want to cut them out, but I had to scream at him to just give this up.  That ended it but for fuck’s sake, I shouldn’t have to reason with a person like this.

867,"
I went to my friends house the other night, him and I have been friends for the better half of 2 years now. We are close, but not extremely close. When he was upset I’d stay with him, and he would listen to my never ending list of complaints. He was a very touchy feely person, always has been. Always wanting to touch, or put his arm around people. He hasn’t been in a relationship for over a year now, just does one night stands the occasional time. 

But I went round to his, to do coursework. When I got to his we had our laptops out for about a while 10 minutes before deciding that we were definitely not doing any more work. We decided to order take in, and I paid because the last 2 times we met up he had paid for the snacks. So it was only fair and we sat beside each other on the couch. We ate beside and once I had finished I slid down the couch and got sleepy. We had agreed that at 6:30 we would start work, so we watched some of a movie on Netflix. 6:30 came, and I got up to grab my laptop. He wrapped his arms around my belly and pulled me onto his chest and wouldn’t let go. So I confided, lay on his chest while he ran one hand up and down my back, and played with my hair with the other. I had fallen in and out of sleep at that point, waking up at one point where he sniffed my hair. We lay like that for 15 minutes, and then I kind of rolled off the side so I lay by his side. We were close, real close. He kept rubbing his nose against mine, and kept rubbing my face and our lips were fanning one another. I was half asleep at this point so didn’t question it.

Then he sat up, and just looked into dead space. So I had asked him what was wrong, and his response was, “This isn’t how normal friends get on.” And I reassured him and told him that I would cuddle a few of my friends. Most of them being girls, or my gay guy friends. He then argued saying that it wasn’t with a heterosexual male. He got awkward over that. 

We then got to talking, talked about our issues for about an hour. Then went back to the way we were before. He said about how he missed being in a relationship, and how he might go back to his ex in the meantime. He got awkward again and turned so we were lying back to back. I moved more towards the edge so that we didn’t touch because I was afraid it would make him more awkward, then he turns around and puts one arm under me and one around me. 

I just don’t know what’s happening.

When we left it was awkward and silent. But clearly neither of us wanted to go. He kept hiding something, kept saying something would pass tomorrow and that he was already too vulnerable around me.

I just wanted to stay home and play videogames since I haven't been able to do that in forever. She was pretty upset about it and I told her I would come over tomorrow(which is now today). But I still don't really wanna hangout. The reason is, is that 1. I don't feel that good I ate something for lunch and it didn't settle well. 2. I have a lot of homework to do because we are going on a 12-day trip and so I have to do all the homework before I leave. 3. We are going on a 12-day trip just us two and I would like some time alone and do stuff by myself before we leave.

869,"
I live in a very diverse, middle-upper income area in NJ. My neighbors’ children are involved, but I have friends who have stayed away due to feelings of anti-Semitism, sexual abuse, etc. 

My friend told me several BSA troops in NJ disbanded due to bankruptcy—stemming from abuse. I checked our “den” and ours wasn’t impacted. 

My son is in kindergarten and I didn’t do Girl Scouts so I don’t really have much knowledge of the organization, besides what the news has said/others have told me. 

What are your thoughts and experiences?",09Mar2020,1
870,"Gay male here. 

Let it first be known that I do not catch feels easily. By and large I do not date, and if I do it's never random/a hook up, because if I'm dating dating it's either with the goal of finding friends or because I have been talking to someone and feel a legitimate connection. And even then, feeling a connection isn't often enough for me to catch real feels, which have probably occurred 3 times in my entire dating life, none developing to love aside from my first post-out puppy love story. 

So real feels don't happen too often as a gay twenty-something young professional in a small/med city. 

Problem is, on the rare occasion that I do connect with someone and meet them and I like them and they say they do me, I will right after monitor myself so closely and even not follow up because I'm waiting for the text back for THEM to follow up. 

I think it is a result of a romantic trauma I had my sophomore year of college where a guy I considered a very very close friend and I ended up having a romance right before school broke, and he'd told me that he wanted to continue after we came back. I really really liked the dude, he said he did me as well, we had already had so many memories and good times as friends and I trusted him.

Anyways, over the summer, even talking at all was like pulling teeth. I wasn't clingy, I was just operating under the assumption that he was where he had said he was, concerning us. Long story short I spent an entire summer sending the occasional text which would either be outright ignored, or responded to partially/ once and then left on read. Again, this was not a constant thing, once I realized the vibe had changed at the beginning, I scaled back and would only try to engage in conversation once or twice a week. After a month of this, I tried talking to him saying ""it seems like you're not interested, and that is fine. I'd just like to try to talk to sort things out so we can go back to being friends.""

Never had a reply. It hurt. Got back to school, and he ghosted me and my friends whom he had hung out with all year before. That hurt a lot. I tried approaching him once and he straight up ignored me. All of my friends were incredulous at how he had changed like a light switch flipped, and it really broke my trust for people saying they like me. 

We had been friends for two years, hung out almost daily for a whole year, and shared life. So when he told me he liked me too, I trusted that, but was then just completely stonewalled. He never tried to tell me why, nor wanted to recuperate the friendship. Even went as far as taking to our friends (who to their credit reported it back to me because they didn't like how he was acting) about how I was pathetic for not realizing ""this is how gay friendships work."" That cut me deep. I know it's not true, but it ficked me up. 

Anyways.... now the second I like someone, I feel like if I try to further that like and build off it, they'll think I'm annoying or pathetic, despite every piece of evidence to the contrary. So if I meet someone I like, I end up self-sabatoging and monitoring my/their every word for subtext unless they actively reaffirm their feelings, which is not healthy at all, and CAN get annoying. 

What can I do to get over this?",09Mar2020,1
871,"I was in a relationship with this lovely lady for about 2 years after being the closest friends for 3 years. There was a mistake on my part i did after our first year together that was pretty inconsiderate and just said some things out of anger at the worst possible time. for 8 months, she kept thinking about it and before she knew it, she felt numb and her feelings toward me disappeared and she decided to break up out of nowhere.

Of course, that was the beginning of the worst time of my life so far. I went to her city the next day (we live in different cities) and asked her to meet with me so we can talk and understand better what the situation is. There was no way around it, she was confident she lost her feelings and was not convinced to give it more time although spending time with her that day was bittersweet. I fell into a horrible depression with some dark thoughts, i got suicidal many many times but at least i had friends to distract me and my feelings. I kept trying to convince her again and again but she left desperate and hopeless. She still let me stay a friend, we would occasionally watch or play together and it somehow made me feel happy but of course i wanted more than that.

A few weeks later, i met an old friend in my hometown and i just kept venting and venting to her about the situation and telling her how much i loved my ex and how we had this thing linking us together. things escalated with her and we were cuddling and it made me feel like i was healing, like the pain was decreasing, but only during that moment. we planned on meeting again some days later, but the unexpected happened and my ex contacted me and told me she was ready to give our relationship a second chance, she felt that her feelings were burning up again and realized i was the only one for her.

That brought up a surge of emotions in me, i was so overwhelmed and kept crying and i was genuinely happy. However, the next day, all that happiness went away, i felt just like during the break up, my feelings were very confused. Things between us felt unnatural and kind of forced on both sides and i started wondering if it will ever become like how it was, if our relationship will even work out. And that's when I would make the biggest mistake of my life.

That girl i hung out with to vent and cuddle asked me if we would still cuddle next time we meet and my stupid self thought directly about healing from this pain and told her yes. However i kept thinking about it and i could not keep up with the plan, i got back to her and told her that we should not do this, that i would hate myself, that this isn't right, this isn't who i am. And so nothing happened. I had a talk with my girlfriend about my confused feelings and she was very understanding and let me have some time on my own to heal. 3 days later i was sure of my feelings for her and ready to give her my everything.

Starting from that moment, it felt like a real proper relationship to me. We had amazing time together and some wonderful dates and things were looking up to be fine. But little did i know.. My virtual friends (who i considered my closest friends) all knew about that exchange of talk, my ""intention"" to cheat. that girl told everyone, as means of jealousy or just to ruin my life, i'm not sure. they kept it hidden while interacting normally with me, until a month passed in my restored relationship and they told her and showed her the screens. Even people i would have never thought would betray me, did. She took badly, her illness makes it so that her emotions manifest themselves physically on her body and that was the worst one she had ever got.

People treat me like i have in fact cheated on her and they all blocked me and gave up on me and spread the rumors to everyone else. However, she 'understood' as she says and still decided to stay with me despite what everyone is telling her. That was really awful of them, they basically bullied her to break up and even brought up articles about the Stockholm syndrome being the cause for her staying. But the next day, she apparently thought about the situation clearly and could not handle it anymore and asked me to never contact her again and blocked me everywhere.

What do you think about this situation? Did i deserve it? Was that really as bad as cheating? Was it worth getting rid of 5 years of very good friendship? I am certain that if i was in any other situation i would never think about going to another girl, but i feel that being in that case where i was going through a tough break up then we get back together and that cancelled intention happened at the very beginning of it is something to consider right? Am i making sense? Despite everything, i have heard worse with happier endings and i believe there is still a chance, but i do not know how to proceed or when.

I have lost all my friends and i can't speak about this to anyone.

Long story short, my friend decided to go to graduate school for the same field as me. I was supportive of his decision until recently when he went to my boss and asked for an internship to which he agreed. My boss told me that my friend said he wanted to become his ""right hand man"" and wanted to buy the business in later years.

I'm extremely upset with my friend because he never once asked me how I'd feel if he were to work at my place of employment. I also feel like he went behind my back to push his own interests trying to become my boss's ""right hand man."" I feel so betrayed by all of this.

875,"Hi. I'll try to keep this as short as possible. 

I've spotted this cute girl a while ago near where I work, and as per usual, I instantly developed a major crush on her. As in: I cant stop thinking about her. It's as if I'm 15 again. I don't even know if she knows I exist, but thats just how my stupid brain works. Cute girl = Love of my life.

I can't just talk to her. For some reason I get very scared of talking to the opposite gender. I don't even have to be interrested in them:

Cashier at the store: I stutter.
Secretary at work: my throat clenches.
Cute girl: Brain dead and all of the above.

So, I can't (and will probably never) talk to her or anyone else, if nothung changes. 

I never had a relationship and I need love and attention too... 

I guess I might be terrified of a negative outcome...

But the worst part is: I'm SCARED that I will eventually start self harming again. I did it in the past, got over my depression and lived a happy life for about 3 years, until this stupid crush started damaging my self esteem so hard that I feel like i need to punish myself for being a garbage human being. 

Am I a failed person because I cant socialize?

It was a nice childhood and one part of my family is from there.
I haven't been back for 20 years but moved back two years ago as my last relative was sick and eventually died during my care (older woman with terminal cancer).

People had a hard time recognizing me but i came back rather 'special'. I lived in several foreign countries, did college, travelled a lot and don't have the best career but i am happy.

People obviously find me strange and alienate me generally. I don't talk much about my private life as small village people generally tend to twist the truth way too often.

I have a childhood friend who is important in this village due to his business. We meet up often and he accepts me how i am as he is open minded and due to his job travels a lot.

I don't go out often and don't frequent bars much as they bore me anyway. I rather stay home writing or painting or watching tv.

The few times i was out lately i started to experience almost hate towards me. I get very bad general comments, threads to be beaten (which never happened) and obvious talks behind my back.

I have experienced this in my youth, as i was quite the flamboyant teen between goth-emo-scene kid and a wanna be fashion victim, but that happened in the small city.

Now my question is how i should continue to behave. 

It started to be rather unpleasant to even do groceries. I plan to do them around lunch when there r less people around. I refrain from going to one of the two village bars and stopped having fun anyway.

That only friend is pretty popular but the people who are around him literally detest me when i am around and whatever i do it is wrong.

My husband (24M) is not white. He's Mexican and Italian. His dad was undocumented for a long time and finally got his papers after a very long drawn out process. My husband is also bisexual but hasn't come out to my family. 

My family is conservative Christian. They are not Trump supporters but they think that it's fine that kids are in cages and that all illegal immigrants are murderers and rapists. They are also extremely homophobic.

We've just been staying quiet during this trip. It's for my cousin's wedding and it should be about them, not us. My husband said something about pronouns yesterday afternoon and my dad told him to shut up. And then we all watched Knives Out as a family, and they all cracked jokes about the immigration issue.

Its just so embaressing and i always have to turn people down when they invite me to walk to my local Wendy's or park. I wish I could just have some independence.

896,"Hey reddit hope all is well.

For the past 10 years of my life I have been apart of the online service industry (SEO, SMM, Web Design, and Software development)

My mother was diagnosed with lung cancer 9 months ago and passed away last month. Being an only child it was my responsibility to take care of here during the 8 months she was battling cancer.

Of course I went through the denial stage, the anger stage and every stage in between.

So many doctors misdiagnosed her and told her she had acid reflux by the time they found out it was lung cancer it was too late.

While I was taking her to the hospital and doctor visits I got to speak to many doctors. During this time I thought to myself why not take my skills in web design, and marketing and turn it into something helpful for everyone.

I started doing research in 23 and me, ancestry, and every other dna company. I found that with the right software you can create a platform where people can find out way more about themselves from the same at home DNA test.

Things like: **Alzheimer's disease, Ulcerative colitis, Heart diseases, Stroke, Chronic Kidney Disease, Vitiligo (Skin Cancer), Breast Cancer (Braca 1, Braca 2) and the list goes on.**

So I decided to begin coding. I created a software that takes your raw data from ancestry, 23 and me, and a bunch of other DNA providers and analyzes it, and gives you a full report of over 700 health related answers.

I've also been in touch with a network of labs that will provide DNA testing kits, and clients raw data for my genealogists and software to analyze.

I guess my question is do you think people would be interested in learning more about their body? Things that they're predisposed to and how to prevent them from coming about?

He has called me out before and said I'm overthinking and in that moment I realized, I was. That's all it took. I can't express enough how much he's helping me, by just talking to me about most random things. 

So, what's my problem? He has a gf and occasionally I (sometimes he) unintentionally say something that could be considered flirting. It's my personality, I'm like this with everyone I meet. I've made a post on this and people have pointed out that that is not okay. And eventough I have asked him before to call me out, if I cross the line, he hasn't. I've also been told that I should ask him if she knows about me, what we talk about (btw, 99% of the time it's just random convos, getting to know each other, 1% or probably less is something a little bit flirty) and even if she is enough for him since he flirts back. But again, this (flirting, if it even is that) is something I would never even notice IRL, but when I re-read messages I think ""was that flirting?"" I know I should clear some stuff with him and ask about this (again), but I just don't want to ruin anything. This year has really been shitty, I'm drained and depressed, but getting 1 message per hour helps me so much. 

Am I an asshole for not pressing more into this asking him about it? I feel like I'm being very selfish but at the same time I don't want to ruin anyones relationship. 

P.s. Please don't be too harsh. I don't want to harm anyone, that's why I'm asking for advice.",09Mar2020,1

904,"I don't even know where to begin. I got this job at a nonprofit organization that I'm really passionate about. I accepted a position that I'm over qualified for in an effort to get my foot in the door. 

I've been with the organization for 7 months now. Since I've started, I've seen how the flow of communication is non-existent. For example, we have a surprise observation from the state due for any day this month. While our supervisor has known since early January about this observation, we weren't notified until February 29 and are expected to prepare and have everything ready before the surprise visit.  That's just one example of many. 

Anyway, this supervisor never tells us anything and rarely comes into the office. They are always at our other office and typically unresponsive to email or calls.

I've been applying for other jobs within the organization but all internal applications need to go through your supervisor. After sending the internal document several times with no response, I finally got to talk to my supervisor on a rare and random day that they decided to show up in our office.

TLDR: I applied for an internal job a month ago that pays *a lot* more than my current job and is actually in line with my degree. I was told just last week to contact the hiring manager for this position. When I did, they basically said they got my application a long time ago but there was no follow up from me, so the position has been filled already.

I'm fed up with my supervisors lack of communication and can't decide if i want to go to HR about it or just start looking for a new job. I can't help but feel like she sabatoged me to keep.me around for this surprise visit this month. :(",09Mar2020,1
905,"So where do I start. 8 years ago I was 13 and met an amazing girl whom I really liked. We 'dated' for 3 months until we ended things because I kissed someone else. We remained friends tho which was great. Let's call this girl A.

So fast forward to last November. I was in a long committed relationship of 4.5 year (I'm 21 rn) with girl B. But since me and B have different views on our future we broke up. I always held contact with girl A and she was always really supportive of my relationship with girl B and helped us stay together long before last winter. 

So when things ended with girl B I talked to girl A as she is my best friend. She invited me over and we went out and got drunk, nothing happened. A week later I invited her over since she is always really kind and needed her to get over my break up and we kissed that time. Since then we text eachother every day. As we invited each other over more and more things got a bit messy. We fell in love with each other and she even invited me over to a family dinner. But I struggle with the situation as my heart tells me to go for girl A rn since we really hit it off. But my head keeps telling me to slow things down since me and girl B just broke up. My family doesn't really know about all this and I also struggle to tell them about all this since they don't seem to be over my ex. What should I do with all this?",09Mar2020,1
906,"I know this is a first world problem. We are all lucky to have jobs. I have a great one. I'm self employed. I make close to 150k a year. However, I've been feeling unmotivated for a while now. I would say the past 6-9 months. I also feel a high level of pressure and anxiety.

Although I love doing the process of my job I hate other aspects of it. I love being creative and working from at home. 
I hate networking (talking to fake, social climbers gets to me)
I hate being on social media (it always makes me anxious but I have to see what's trending in the market and what my competitors are up to). 
I hate having to suck up to higher companies in hopes they will collab or shout me out. 
I hate dealing with my employees (I employ a few part timers to help me out but obviously I'm not paying a ton. I pay 12 an hr and min wage is 8.75 here. So some of them are unreliable and have talked back to me.
I hate dealing with rude customers. They sometimes get to me. I'm human and make mistakes and I have had people be so incredibly mean about it. Which I understand they're upset but still..
I hate having to constantly create. I love creating don't get me wrong but I have to show people new stuff 1-2 times A WEEK. On top of that, only creating what will sell, not exactly what I want to.

So I dont know what to do. Maybe I should work a little less so I dont stress as much. Maybe start another venue and do this on the side? But it's my entire money maker so I dont know...
The hours I put in directly correlate to how much I make so I can never relax. I always feel like I'm wasting time if I'm not working or thinking about work 24/7.

My particular self destructive actions are being someone I’m not. The source of my sadness is in the fact that I have little to no value to anyone.

922,"[Vent]

I really love my mom. I really do. But we keep running into issues.
She has those strategies when we are arguing, and everytime I bring that up she uses other strategies and the end result will always be that I’m paranoid and selfish and I’ll feel so guilty. For example, she’ll start crying and say “I’m always the bad one” (and I don’t know, I’m just feeling like I’m always the bad one?). Or she’ll say “okay, whatever, you’re right, I’ll shut op”, making clear by the tone of her voice that I’m definitely not right. Or she’ll cry and say how guilty she feels and that she’s so scared that our (me and my siblings) mental illnesses are her fault and then I’ll feel even guiltier. When I was younger she kept telling me I’m selfish over and over again. That she’s doing so much for us and we never give back. This is true, but the thing is we’re not capable of doing stuff and my parents will always do them and regularly the suddenly start yelling at us about how horribly egocentric we are, before going back to doing everything for us again. They don’t care about other things, though. I can do what I like. I can smoke weed or not come home at night or cut myself or do whatever I like (might use it against me though if the situation demands it).  

Anyway, back to my mother. I was/am very jealous of my little brother because he gets all the attention because he’s mentally disabled. She kept telling me “he’ll have such a hard life, so much harder than yours, and you’ll have to take care of him, you’re so lucky” etc. Everytime I got incredibly jealous they told me “your violin classes etc cost us so much, we do care”. 

The problem is that I feel like the worst because they are so nice. They drive me everywhere (which makes me feel awful but I was always scared of taking the bus when I was little and now I’m scared to drive myself). My mom is so nice to me, especially since I spent ten weeks in a mental hospital bc of suicidal ideation. She always praises me, “we do love you, you don’t have to get straight A’s, we are so proud of you that you wrote a book”, we have insider jokes and everything. This makes me feel even worse. Because in between there are these fights. 

For a long time she didn’t take my mental struggles seriously. Said I was lazy, didn’t exercise and enough, etc. She still says those things, but at least she acknowledges my depression, but apparently “depression is not good enough for me and I want more”. She often hints at me being an attention seeker. Like I struggle a bit with my weight (because I want to lose it, I genuinely want to be thin and yes, it’s to get validation from the outside world aka attention, but I do genuinely crave weight loss). When she’ll see me trying to get on a diet again, she’ll say “do you really want to eat healthy or do you want to be anorexic again?” Even though when I first went on a diet she tried convincing me that I have an eating disorder. Now everything I’m doing when it comes to eating is attention seeking behaviour.

Meanwhile she always speaks to me about my brother’s depression, like “look your brother is so depressed, I don’t know what to do, did you know your brother is depressed, by the way you’re brother is depressed”. And, I don’t know, I just feel like his problem is “better” than mine, once again? They’re not forcing him to go see therapist or even in a mental institution (I like therapy now but I didn’t like it before), because he didn’t want to.

Also once my mother told me that if I got really drunk and then s_xually a_s__lted, she would feel very sorry for me but I had it coming. Am I overreacting about this? It kind of hurts.

But then, I feel so guilty because she always tells me that she feels guilty, and I know she means well, but am I really such a bad child?
Once she said I should put on makeup for professional meetings (book publishers) bc it would just be polite, and I got offended and we got in a big fight where she turned my words into something that they weren’t while telling me I was the one doing exactly this. This always happens. When I have a complaint, she’ll have a complaint about me as an answer. “Well look at you, you’re not better, you’re doing this and this and this” etc. As a last resort, she’ll bring up the argument that I should move out of the house if I don’t like it. But I don’t want to move out because I love her because she’s so great, but aaaah ... it’s complicated.

Recently I brought up the courage to tell her about the urge of destroying my eyes which I’ve had for years now (honestly I think this comes from my inner belief that disabled people are better than anyone else and that I would only be able to love myself if I had a “real problem” myself). She just started crying again and said she couldn’t deal with it if I did it and that she’d have to break up the contact with me. Which made me feel incredibly guilty again, of course. (Also she has a way of talking about my self harm behaviour, where she pulls a face and looks like she’s about to throw up which makes me feel even more like shit - she’s not doing it on purpose but I can’t with it-)

Or what happened these last days, for example. We had a dog a while ago who helped me a lot after being released from the psychiatric hospital and we all loved hin very much, but he died in November. Recently I made it clear to my parents that I needed a dog around me, and they were talking back and forth about it, my mother would show me cute pictures of dogs that needed to be adopted (but if I wanted to adopt them there were millions of excuses why we wouldn’t do it). We agreed on the fact that they would only show me dogs if they were seriously considering adopting them. So that’s what they did yesterday, I was eating calmly in the kitchen and suddenly a dog ran in, and they said he was perfect for us and he would stay for a period of time to see if he was fitting. Naturally I was very happy and grateful and happy. But then, of course - OF COURSE - my brother said he didn’t want a dog so they brought him back this evening. I am so upset about this. It feels like they are playing with my feelings. (And if my mother tries to hug me from behind and I push her away bc I hate it and she screams, of course I get blamed bc “that’s not good for the dog, you know”).

I’m so angry right now ... Anyway, I wanted to get opinions on this. Is it really always my fault? Am I the bad one? Or is she kind of manipulating me sometimes? I don’t know, I really don’t want to be the bad one ...",09Mar2020,1

We both are 17 and have been best friends for four years and despite having other two best friends I am closest to her . It was all great until our sophomore year . At first she started showing jealousy.  She used to get all frustrated whenever I tried to talk about things I am passionate about . I decided to ignore that and despite this we grew even closer in next two years . But since the start of our senior year she has been trying to copy me and if I tolerated her jealousy it was because it did not effect me that much but when someone copies me , I just can't stand that person and now I don't know how to kick her out of my life . I can go for making her understand that I am not okay with her doing this but I am not good at all with confrontations.  She even once mentioned that if I'll take astronomy as a major in college she will do the same which is quite illogical since she loved interior designing and she was sure that she will go for that . She talked to her mom about letting her study in China if I am going to college there . I should mention that before I told her about my plans of moving to China she had never even talked about China . 

And then there are everyday things she does that I do . She  puts up same story on instagram as me . She does her best to learn sketching because I sketch and If some guy tries to talk to me , she will  text him too . Plus she never wants to leave me alone with our other friends . If someone wants to spend time with me she immediately develops hate for that person . 

I really like this  guy from the college , he's my brother's friend  and I am well aware of his huge crush on me but since I told my best friend about his crush on me , she has been trying to talk to him on instagram and when I asked her why, she said she needs to check if he's good enough for me . That was a ridiculous reaosn since she has no need to do that . I decided to not talk to him because I am afraid that she will eventually mess things up . 
I really do love her like sisters . And I do not want to hurt her but she is getting on my nerves . I don't know how to talk to her about this but I honestly want this to stop . Any advice on how should I get rid of her or this situation?",09Mar2020,1

926,"I'm a college freshman in my second semester at a small, private school. To say college has been difficult is an understatement. I was never very good at high school, but my life outside of school was so hectic then that I assumed things would be different when I left home. Unfortunately, I still struggle to find the motivation to get out of bed most days let alone keep up with my classwork. I've done much better this semester than last, and have been surprisingly on top of things, but my anxiety &amp; depression makes my life here difficult. I'm a charismatic person and generally have never had trouble making friends, but as with all things in my life lately finding motivation to leave my room has been a major handicap.

I took a year off between high school and college to save some money and pay my way through therapy for a few months, but frankly I still rushed into picking a school and was never really sure that this was the right fit for me. 

Now, I'm flat broke and generally a miserable shut-in. All I can afford to eat is the mediocre cafeteria food. I live in a constant state of indigestion. Unsanitary living &amp; bathing conditions have given me athlete's foot twice now, our building is constantly ridiculously hot to the point that I've got a rash from sweating so much while I sleep, and my acne is back in full force because I lost my facewash in the shower and can't afford to replace it or any of the other basic skincare products I used to buy. I'm in a rough place already, and feeling this disgusting all the time is seriously demoralizing.

I've driven a little bit with UberEats to make some money, but recently it's been a struggle to put gas in the car so I can work and even making my own hours it's hard to make money in the time that I'm not doing homework or in class. 

I'm looking at transferring to a larger state school to figure out exactly what I want to do with my life in an environment with more options and a different culture, but I'm not sure if that's right for me either.

My mom is already helping pay for my tuition and I can't bring myself to ask her for any more money or help than she's already given me. That also makes keeping up with everything a lot more pressing. It's really not just my money at stake and she doesn't have a lot to spare already.

So, TL;DR college is hard, I'm poor, I feel like a miserable sack of shit.

Any tips on ways to make a little money on the side with the limited free time that I've got?  Recommendations on ways to find a career or degree program of interest without wasting too much time or money? Or even the types of schools that would be a good fit for that sort of thing? Alternatives outside of college? Really any advice at all. Other people do this. I don't know why it's so hard for me.",09Mar2020,1

931,"After a long and prolonged battle it has finally broken me. For as long as I can remember I have been a nervous and empty person that always jumped to false conclusions and someone who isolated myself out of fear of rejection. When I was in high school things really started to go downhill for me but I had one thing to be proud of, my education. With what little energy I could muster I did my best academically but always did only what was required never anything extra. I had few friends though my highschool years because I usually just hung out with the same circle I had had since elementary school. Eventually I whittled my number of friends down to just one, and finally I managed to push him away too. Completely alone going into college and mentally I was on a knifes edge. Once I moved into the dorms I actually became somewhat good friends with my roommate but I craved more. Finally I decided to go to some recruitment events for the fraternities on campus, and got accepted into one. I thought that this would be the fix, these guys could lift me out of myself and turn me into the man I always wanted to be. I now realize that this was my job, but I have always loved to delegate my problems to others. The euphoria I expected to come out of the college parties never came, the pit in my stomach was still there even though I now had more friends then ever. I got desperate and turned to drugs to try and escape. I started with alcohol and drank heavily but eventually realized it wasn't enough, I needed more. Then I turned to weed hoping that maybe what everyone said about it was true and it would forcefully make me ""just chill"" but all it did was make me even more paranoid. Strike two, but there was one more drug I had access to that would make me happy without fail apparently: cocaine. Every time I could get my hands on it I would do as much as possible and wait for the euphoric burst of life to kick in. It never did. I would just be jumpy, incredibly paranoid, and still empty.  What the fuck why won't it all stop. I even managed to stumble into having sex a few times in college in my drug induced hazes, I felt nothing every single time and just went through the motions. By my second semester sophomore year I had had enough and drove up to local secluded river and decided to end the nightmare by jumping off the bridge. I sat on the railing for three hours then got back in my car and drove home and drank myself to sleep. My friends wanted to help but I never let them because somehow I knew I deserved all of what I had got. Midway through the semester I dropped out and my parents came to get me and drove me home. I stared blankly at my mom she cried and my dad screamed about how much of a failure I had become. Now I work at a goddamn grocery store making fuck all and I've had enough. I can barely get out of bed anymore and every day is like a bad dream where I wonder how it all went so wrong. Reddit has been an escape for me for years and I want to thank you guys.",09Mar2020,1
932,"Okay so a teacher at my school got a new turtle as a class pet, which is cool, but is keeping it in a ~10-15 gallon tank. (I think it's a red eared slider, either way looked too small).

937,"23, live in a big social party city. Used to go out a lot but I’ve slowed down and now I like to keep it pretty low key 

I go out with a lot of different girls, one because I meet a lot, two because the girls I do go out with never want to see me again 

Most of the girls I hang out with tell me I’m a one night stand kinda guy. They have fun clearly and have nice things to say but most of the time it’s “Pretty face and a big dick” as multiple have put it but this makes me feel like shit. If they do hit me up again it’s just for sex 

There was a girl I liked and she just told me she’s not tryna see me again and I’m honestly really bummed because this happens so frequently 

Yes I could easily go find another girl to hang out with but I’m tired of repeating the same cycle over and over again.

938,"My ex friend and I were friends for 11 years, we were like sisters. Well during highschool she kept saying we weren't friends anymore and within a month or 3 she'd text back apologizing saying she missed me and it was hard seeing me in school and not talk to me. I was like ok sure we can still be friends. This happened 3 times throughout our 4 years of highschool. Her doing this so many times lead to me resenting her a little bit.

When we were out of high school she still completely ignored me for a month or two and came back acting like nothing happened. I told her it wasn't cool, I'm tired of her doing this. She'd always get mad at me saying she was super busy. But she had time to go and hang out with her other friends. She wasn't too busy, she just kept me on the back burner...for another 2 years. We still hung out maybe once every 3 months and all she did was complain about her life. If I told her my problems she would brush them off saying ""wow"" and move on with another story. I got sick of this happening after the last....probably 5 years. So I would tell her listen if you don't want to be friends with me then tell me. She told me I'd know if I wasn't her friend anymore. And she would also get upset if I even tried to have a civil conversation about how I'm tired of it. I told her I'd like to hang out and do something other than talk about her life. She told me to grow up and quit being a child and realize that other people have problems in life than just me. This shocked me because I didn't say she couldn't talk about her life anymore, I just wanted to go out and have fun....like she does with all of her other friends.

So I got fed up with her, I just didn't text her for 2 weeks. I deleted her off of all of my social media but FB. She texted me back saying I'm acting childish for ignoring her and she was busy and had a really rough few weeks. I was done, and she only texted me because of course she was asking for a favor....after I turned 21...

I texted her saying I'm done, I wish her a good life and still care about her but can't be treated badly anymore. She didn't say anything back. But I found out she went to an event with the person I hate most in my life. Two weeks after I was done being friends with her she went and hung out with the girl who my boyfriend emotionally cheated on with. (I'm not going to go into detail about that, but my boyfriend and I have gone to therapy/are past it).

But only two weeks after I texted her that, she's hanging out with the girl who tried to get with my boyfriend for 3 years. And still tried when we graduated from highschool. My ex friend was there for me when this was happening, she stuck up for me and knew how bad I got hurt from this situation. I know she did it to hurt my feelings and it did. It hurts a lot. I'm having nightmares about my ex friend and the girl being my friend and then making fun of me behind my back. Or I have dreams about confronting my ex friend about why she did it. Every day I want to ask her why she is doing this. It's eating me up inside and making my really sad.

How do I get over this? How do I push past that she's hanging out with my enemy? Should I try to text her and ask why she's doing this or leave it alone?

951,"Like an AITA, only this time I know I was the asshole and need some help in figuring how to convince my best friend that I'm worth her time again. Buckle up, it's gonna be a long one, but I left a tl;dr if you want to hop right to the point.

Here's the setup for this story:  I am (F, 18), my best friend Katie (F, 19), second best friend Will (M, 19), a third best friend Lina (F, 20), and another friend Tom (M, 19). I've been friends with Katie for 7 years, Will for 4 years, and Tom &amp; Lina for 5 months. We all live in the same town. (All names are fake, I don't know if they'll know my Reddit.)

So about 3 days ago, I had received a message from Katie that expressed how much she, Will, and Tom missed me and how we haven't properly talked in a very long time. Will piped up and mentioned how he missed me a lot too and missed the dynamic of the group chat. We'd expressed our warmth for each other, and they continued on about how much they were hurt by my silence in the group chats. Katie expressed that they felt like Chopped liver, Blockbuster, An oboe, the Dare lion, windows phones, and many other things that had similarly been abandoned by the world. Due to the seemingly jokey atmosphere, it still hadn't clicked for me at this point just how much they missed me and how I'd affected them. They weren't asking for anything unreasonable either, literally only saying they wanted some time with them every now and again and how I was basically nonexistent in their lives for a good long time. I expressed immediate pity and sympathy for having abandoned them and told them I never meant to leave them behind like that, and how I really do love them and had hoped they'd just known. Then it was mentioned that Katie felt as though they were all getting replaced by Lina, because she seemed to be much closer with me and got all of my attention. Their primary worry was that Lina had reached their status of being a close friend in a lesser time than they had taken and they felt forgotten and small. I assured them they were of higher status in my life that was unattainable by others no matter what.

I later felt weird about how everything transpired, mostly because it felt wrong to make Jackie seem lesser to them in any way, and I wanted to address the unnecessary  jealousy felt about Lina. So I messaged Katie privately and reminded her that she didn't need to worry about anybody else taking her place in my life because she came first and meant beyond the world to me.  I mentioned how I'd had some similar jealousy about Tom because I felt as though he was replacing me as her best friend, and how I learned that I didn't need to feel the way I did because I know and understand the role I play in her life. I'd meant it to be reassuring, relatable, and a soft conclusion to what I'd presumed to be a minor issue. Her response was something I didn't expect though. She said ""If you felt that way about Tom, it deeply concerns me that you neglected to discuss that with either one of us, then go as far as mistreat him on those grounds. That's not fair to any of us. Denies you the wholeness of the situation and truth, and him decent treatment....we all fell victim to similar mistreatment or ignorance on account of your silence.""  I genuinely was speechless, because it was becoming apparent to me that this was much deeper than I'd thought. Beneath all the earlier lighthearted and goofy messages was a foreign pain to me that I really couldn't understand. There was more, but it continued with concern about how little I let them into my own mind and how much damage my absence caused them. But for the life of me, it didn't make any sense that I could mean so much to them that they would get upset that I hadn't texted a full conversation with them in a month. In my mind, that wasn't enough time to be damaged in any valid way, and any hurt experienced couldn't have been to any large degree. I genuinely didn't understand where this had come from, and it felt completely out of nowhere considering nobody was telling me how my absence in the friend group had affected them before. With that in mind, I got frustrated that anyone was trying to have me take blame for anything I didn't understand. So I gathered all my rage, and dates that proved her wrong, and essentially told her she had no reason to feel the way she did and was wrong to make me feel bad for having a life. I explained how she shouldn't be trying to speak for anyone but herself and how we'd been friends for too long for her to have these concerns in the slightest. Saying things like  ""So no, even from a close friend perspective I haven't been absent enough for this to be deeply damaging in any way."" and ""The fact that you would even as far as to call yourselves victims is exaggerated and inappropriate. You're not a victim, none of you are, because at the end of the day I haven't been gone long enough to cause that"" and further on ""I'm not going to help any of you pretend I as a  ghost the entire time..."". Once I was done, and wrapped it up by telling her that I was over this and was moving on and couldn't wait to enjoy some time to catch up with her later that didn't involve painting me as some awful abuser. I had it read by my boyfriend, and by Lina, so they could confirm I worded everything exactly as I'd intended to. I had thought it was done by then, and in my mind believed I was showing her how silly she was for having these seemingly intense emotions when they didn't make any sense to me. 

Katie became incredibly upset and expressed her deep hurt and disbelief that I could claim to love her or any of my friends then actively attack and invalidate them the way I had. She said something that still hasn't left me and is now my fuel to try and fix this. ""You fucked up this time and I won't let you try and shift the blame to me."" and I immediately was frustrated again that she couldn't see how ridiculous it was that she was getting so bent out of shape over my minor absence where I texted them when I could and reached out whenever possible considering college, my job, my role in a play, my other relationships to maintain, and etc. But I wanted to wait and process everything this time. And it hit me finally that I was diminishing emotions that I didn't even realize were present. And even more important, that I wasn't even bothering to understand. I told her that feeling i couldn't comprehend didn't matter rather than making any tangible attempt to help her heal from them.

Soon after, Will reached out to me and expressed how he felt about this. An important thing about will is that at least between him and I, he doesn't readily express emotion other than anger/frustration/passion around me, and I carry a similar vibe back. He doesn't often tell me how he feels until it's so deep of a feeling that it consumes him. So to hear how he was feeling about my lack of communication with him was earth shaking for me. He explained how overwhelmingly full his heart was to hear me in the chat again, and just how much he missed my role in the group. He was hurt that I wasn't taking responsibility for the damage I'd done, and wanted me to know he understood I was busy but that the fact I could so easily brush him and the others aside like that was sad. At first, I responded incredibly sympathetically towards him and apologized for making him feel unloved, unimportant, and second best. But then I slid into telling him to respect the time that I had so little of and that I couldn't always be able to respond to him. Looking back, I realize that where I thought I'd taken responsibility for my wrongs in this situation, I actually had been making excuses and stepping behind them to hide from personal blame. I was unwilling to admit that I just hadn't tried hard enough and that I was wrong. 

Yesterday, I decided to send Will a follow up message on Snapchat telling him that I wasn't responding to his courageous attempt to show me my wrongs in a respectful way and didn't do him any justice with it. I asked him if we could call or meet in person today in the afternoon, and told him I owe him the apology he deserves in the way that would mean the most. He agreed, and told me he's okay with calling around 5pm today (I'll provide and update after no matter how it goes) and I felt a sense of relief in getting to admit to my idiocy and possibly mark a new era of our friendship where I'm not toxic towards them ever again, and we can all actively communicate.

Unfortunately, I went about it very wrong. I should've messaged Katie first, seeing as my response to her was most cold, aggressive, and unloving. By sending Will the message and not Katie first (knowing she would hear from him that I did), it came off as though she meant as little to me as she thought. Today, She blocked me on 3 different apps, and might've blocked my number. I have multiple other ways to reach out to her, but I'm not sure if that's the best idea considering how I treated her and how she might be feeling about what I said to her. I sent her a message on Skype anyways, right before she signed off seemingly for good and hoped she'd eventually see it and at least be willing to allow me to genuinely understand and validate her emotions at this point since I hadn't tried to before and now understand how much I fucked up.  I'd told her how this was the biggest mistake I'd made in my life and I don't ever want to treat her the way I have ever again. I went to the group chat where she, Will, and I were all there and it turned out that she'd left it. I'd found that I was no longer her friend on Snapchat either, which was what startled me the most because it was hitting even harder the effect my message had on her.

My boyfriend said I should wait until she's comfortable again and she'll decide if this is worth putting anymore effort into. I realize now that this might've been her final attempt to show me how my actions had made her feel, and I feel ashamed because I should've been there for her. But I was put at such a severe disadvantage with this being the first time I was hearing about how my absence from their lives damaged them, and how my decision to not reach out to them whatsoever impacted them. How else can I mend this situation and prove to them that I know I'm the asshole and don't want to ever treat them this way again? 

&amp;#x200B;

In a couple of months, my grandmother will be getting total hip replacement surgery. I've sat down with her and spoken with her about her options: length of hospital stay, the time she may spend in a care facility, and the possibility of her going straight home after surgery. 

She eventually to me that the doctor performing the surgery is allowing her to leave the hospital after only one day. After which she'll be sent straight home where she has yet to set up a plan for in-home care. 

What's worse is her shortlist for potential caretakers is down to 2 people; me, and a friend of hers. Personally, I took care of my father for two straight years until the day his cancer took his life, and I'm unsure of my ability (psychologically speaking) to take care of my grandmother. 

What's worse is my grandmother seems to perfectly happy spending only one day in the hospital, and as much as I hate hospitals she's going to need 24-hour care to make sure there aren't any complications such as blood clots, pneumonia, etc. 

And to give you folk an idea of how my grandmother handles surgery: not more than a year ago she had surgery on her two toes, and I was part of a small group of people who would make sure she had someone around to help her go to the bathroom and roll around in her chair for exercise. She would literally have a panic attack when she had to move from the couch to the office chair, and the same thing would happen while moving her back to the couch. 

I don't mean to sound selfish, but that bunion surgery she had seemed to take more out of everyone else than it did her, and now that she's about to have total hip replacement surgery... I don't know what to do...

I guess my question/s is this:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Am I wrong to insist she stay in the hospital for 3-4 days, then transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a month? 

\-If she ends up forgoing my advice and decides to go back home a day after her surgery, what type of complications could she be looking at, and what can be done to keep those complications from arising?

\-Is it normal for doctors to allow 72-year-old ladies to go straight home 24-hours after total hip replacement surgery? 

\-What is the average amount of time a 72-year-old would stay in a skilled nursing facility following total hip replacement surgery? (Keep in mind, when my grandmother's peers had bunion surgery, they were able to wheel themselves around as if it were nothing, whereas my grandmother was completely debilitated)

So 2 years ago me and her became good friends. We were going to the same school and we had the same social circle. We did many things together and talked about everything. One day she admitted her feelings to me. Unfortunatly I didnt have the same feelings and just loved her as a friend. Because it was a VERY desperate time for me I continued meeting her. We ended up kissing each other and I even admitted that I'd like to sleep with her just for the sex. She agreed but it didnt happen. We continued normally our lives and didnt speak about it anymore. Couple of months later she asked me about having sex again. At that time I wasn't ready and told her that I didn't want it right now. After that we were still friends and doing stuff together. Time passed, she got a boyfriend and I went travelling. After half a year I came back and learned that she broke up with him months ago. I started contacting her again.

So here I am, very horny and thinking about sleeping with her everyday. I still don't have feelings for her. What do you think should I do? It is wrong to ask her although I know she had feelings for me?

“We have not had any building wide issues with the fobs. We had 3 residents key fobs expire last week. We gave them new fobs. When they expire they stop working midnight. All the new fobs expire ‪01/01/2025‬. We are not able to provide additional fobs.”

What recourse if any do I have here? Can they charge me the $50 replacement fee outlined in the lease? Can I get some sort of compensation on rent given that I don’t have access to the apt? Is there some other remedy I’m not thinking of?

980,"Sex with my husband (25f) is no longer making me happy. And it's not due to a lack of performance or libido, it's because I got a horrible back injury 2.5 years ago, and it just hurts too much to withstand anymore. I (25f) don't like it anymore when he touches me down there, I don't like it when he touches my breasts, or gets any more intimate than snuggling. It makes me so sad because it's NOT AT ALL a lack of desire for him, it's the fact that I am in so much pain that the thought of having any sexual action with him makes me nauseous because I'm in that much pain or in fear of being in pain. 

I miss being intimate with him, I miss being touched, I miss all of it. And I'm so upset that my brain rejects the idea before I consciously get a say in it.

There are times where I will push through the pain because I desire him so deeply, and then I'm stuck in bed for the rest of the week.

I guess I'm asking, what can I do to make this less difficult on the both of us? How can I rekindle my part of the flame and not be afraid of hurting later? We've only been married for 7 months, and I feel like we are missing out on the entire ""newlywed"" stage because my body can't and won't let me be intimate. 

Also, yes I'm in therapy, physical and emotional. I am starting EMDR in a few weeks to try and help push past these fears and past trauma as well.

And no, my husband isn't in any form whatsoever forcing or coercing me into having sex with him. He asks, or will start feeling me up and when I say no he stops.

982,"Hi,

I do not usually ask for advice so here goes my first time. If you have questions, feel free to ask. I'm going to try my best to explain the situation.

I (21F) have a younger sister (17F). We have always been close our whole lives and love each other very deeply. She is my rock and my best friend and I would do anything for her. 

My sister is a very loud, outspoken, sensitive and extremely crazy (crazy like as in unpredictable, spontaneous, silly). She is definitely a lot. Most people think she is the most hilarious person alive and some people think she is annoying, if that gives you an idea of what she is like. She tends to show love by mercilessly teasing, even if it is about something you're insecure about (maybe she only does that with me though). She is witty and clever. 

My personality can be described as logical, ambitious, quiet, silly and I can also be described as sensitive. I love all people, it is extremely hard for someone to make me hate them. I tend to forgive and forget pretty easily and I let people walk all over me. I do my best in my friendships and relationships with my family to be supportive and loving. I am always the one asked for advice or to just be someone somebody could vent to. I hate saying mean things about people and if I lightly tease someone im close to I always say ""just kidding"" and try to make it abundantly clear that I did not mean it even if it was the littlest thing and I guess that is what sets me and my sister apart. 

My sister used to be really aware of peoples emotions and was very keen on making sure she wasnt overly mean or did not step over the line. However anymore she has become critical, cynical and resorts to embarrassing me in front of friends. She always calls me fat even though I'm very insecure about my weight and I tell her that and more recently she has resorted to toxic behaviors.

For example, today she asked me for a ride from school, which I usually come and get her but sometimes I'm tied up with school or work so I cant. I do not live at home with her so it happens sometimes. Today happened to be a day I couldnt and she resorted to guilt tripping me by saying ""oh that's ok I guess. I guess I'll walk in the rain..."" 

Anytime I calmly confront her about her behaviors and ask her to stop and use ""I messages"" she still goes on full defense mode and tells me to ""stop being a bitch"" or tells me that I am being rude or that I'm crazy and dramatic. She will shut me out and continue to throw it back on me. She does the same even when I'm more firm and stern with her about it unsurprisingly. My parents just shrug about it and say ""it's just *insert sister's name here*"" 

I seriously am starting to not want to be around her and I avoid her when we are at events together to avoid being embarrassed and told to shut up when I'm talking to her. I'm not sure if she is being a normal teenager or if she is starting to pick up unhealthy behaviors. I do not like avoiding her, I love her and I want things to go back to normal. I dont know how to fix or approach this situation because the confrontation part is not working well even when I use the calmest, safest method I know. Any advice would be great, I just want my sister to understand that she is being harmful and for us to be okay again.",09Mar2020,1

988,"I(24M) think I might've hurt my ex's(23F) feelings, now I promise I didn't mean to but I need your advice.

First of all, my ex is an amazing person, even though we're not together she'll always be a great girl in my eyes.

A little backstory, my ex (G) and I broke up our 1.5 year relationship a bit over three months ago. There were multiple problems in our relationship that caused us to close it off (I'll come back to this later). I was (as you might expect) very heartbroken over the situation and took distance.
About a month after the breakup we went to the same party where we chatter, danced, drank and overall had a good time, we decided to go to the movies the day afterwards. At the movies I realised that seeing her was hurting me a lot, my feelings were confusing and uncomfortable and I didn't understand why I couldn't let my negativity go. After the movies I told her again that I needed distance.

The reason I didn't want to continue the relationship was because I telt like I was the only person putting effort into the relationship. G moved away to a place that was difficult for me to reach. The place she moved to was closer to her uni but taking it meant we wouldn't see eachother as much, she chose the appartment close to uni and told me we would work it out.
I traveled to her appartment as much as I could (about three times a week) but she told me it wasn't enough, this would be a big aspect of our breakup. 
Not seeing eachother enough is a reason to be upset, I get that, but the reason I feel let down is that she didn't do anything to see me more. I was the one doing the traveling and scheduling my life around her plans but didn't get a fraction of that effort back. Now all is forgiven but my heart is not done with it.
I'm still rather dissapointed because of this, wich is the reason I haven't initiated contact yet. 
I'd love to be friends with G but it feels like a facade to build a friendship on negative emoticons.

Last week G contacted me about some of my stuff she still had, she ran into them while deepcleaning her room and wanted to give them back. I asked her to hand my stuff over to a mutual friend but she stopped by my appartment to hand it over (I wasn't home so my housemates recieved them). She also told me she'd be going to a concert of a band and wondered if I'd be present (the band is a group of very close friends of mine so of course I'd be there), I told her I was planning to go.

At the concert I arrived with some friends, we were planning to see their show and then leave to a party afterwards.
G was at the entrance of the show, I said hi, asked how she was doing and went into the building.
During the show I had a great time with my friends and didn't see G at all.
Afterwards my friends and I were getting ready to leave, we had a smoke outside while waiting for the rest. While waiting outside G came up to me to talk, but my friends were ready to go. Since I was the one driving I couldn't leave later but when I told G I had to leave she got sad, it looked like she was about to cry and walked away.

I felt like I had my shit together when I decided to break contact for at least a while, it felt like the right thing to do.
Now that I made her sad I feel like a terrible person, I wasn't expecting to be in this situation and feel like I acted childish.

Should I say something? I don't want to hurt her so what can I do?

I feel like shit most of the time, my mind feels fuzzy, I have no energy, even taking a bath feels like a chore.

991,"I've ran into quite a dilemma. For the past 5 years, I have been working in and been trained in IT. I have worked for the military, a defense contractor, NASA (contract), and now for whatever reason a Manufactured Home building company. I have always loved computers and technology but I am tired of this job. I am tired of the cubicle work and dealing with the terrible people/users (not everyone). The only thing keeping me in this career path is the pay and the the fact that I am a 25 year old man, I feel like it's to late to change careers. Now I have thought of this before and have wondered what I would do if I could. I have always wanted to be involved with animals. Whether it be a veterinarian, zoologist, any type of biologist, I just would love to help them in any way and make it into a career. Now here-in lies the dilemma. I already have 1 year of my bachelors done in IT, but I am not currently enrolled in school. I want to start school again but what do I go back for? Do I get my bachelors in IT, continue with my career, hate my life but make really good money? Or do I throw away everything I have learned, start over on my degree, and work with animals but only to not make as much money? 

Now I may be wrong but I feel as most people would say to give up working in IT if I hate it and money shouldn't be a factor into my happiness. I will be honest and say that I am motivated by money. I want to be making as much as I can so I can support myself and my wife. Any advice, someone convince me why this decision shouldn't be that hard.

Some things to consider:

I have a TS/SCI DoD Clearance so working for some type of military or govt. is easy to get into in terms of money and job security.

I have my Post 9/11 GI Bill to use for my degree and would not want to waste it to only have regrets.

If I don’t support my family, then my mom and sister will have to go back and probably me too, because my dad isn’t going to be helping them. Our roots are in America. We don’t want that. Just looking for some opinions maybe there’s something I’m not seeing. I’m sure I forgot something or something is unclear.

994,"With only one semester left towards my architecture degree, my university withdrew me for owing $5,100 from fall semester.

999,"Basically the title.

I can’t drink water.  Never could.  Even when I was a little kid, it would make me really sick.

After drinking water (doesn’t matter if I drink a couple sips or a couple glasses), I feel nauseous, and bloated, and often my head will start spinning.  My throat will usually hurt too :/

Don’t get me wrong—I also hate the taste of the stuff.  But I’m also a very “mind-over-matter” kind of person, and I’d be happy to drink if it was a simple case of “I don’t like it”.  I can’t afford to drink it, just to end up with my head over the toilet, heaving.  I don’t have time for that crap lmaooo.

Anyway, since I can’t drink water, I get my hydration from milk (I used to also drink juice, but it has too much sugar for me nowadays).  Thing is, though, I’m going on a self-imposed diet, so I need to stop drinking so much milk.

I don’t know what to do.  I’m thirsty as heck, but I can’t drink milk (I already went over my calorie limit today), and I’m scared to drink water.

Anyone else deal with this?  Advice?",09Mar2020,1
1000,"So I was recently leaving a friend's house, and turned onto a busy highway. I had a greenlight. I made a left-hand turn, about two hundred feet after completing the turn, I felt someone hit the back of my car.

I got out, immediately checked to see if they were okay. It was a 16 year old girl. She's fine, I'm fine, the hit wasn't very bad, but there is substantial cosmetic damage. Mostly to my car. She's shaken up, she calls her dad who is at a funeral. She says he wants to talk to me. I tell him everyone is okay, both cars are still drivable.

I get off the phone and the girl asks ""Now what?"" I tell her it's not a big deal, to try and calm her down, and because it really isn't.

I then make what turns out to be the dumb decision of telling her we don't need to involve the police and that we can exchange insurance information and phone numbers. We do that, and go on our way.

The next morning the father calls me and leaves a message just saying ""Hi (Me) this is (Him), call me back, you caused the accident last night."" I call back and explain that I did not, he is calm and says he's on the line with my insurance and he'll call me back. I immediately call his insurance and file a claim.

Later I get a call from MY insurance asking for my side of the story. He told them that I slid through a red light. Keep in mind I was turning, something that you can't do that easily when sliding, as well as the fact that she REAR ENDED ME.

They tell me they're going to deny his claim. They also ask if I'm aware that he owns an autobody shop. I tell them that none of this information means anything to me.

Four days and multiple check in calls from myself to their insurance later, I get told that I'm also getting my claim denied because there was no witnesses and our stories clash.

So now I have to pay up more than $3k in damages to my own vehicle because I thought I was being nice? I take full responsibility for that dumb decision, but do I have any recourse?

I have called my insurance to have them talk to their insurance about this, but they told me, and I'm not making any of this up, ""they didn't answer when we called."" Seriously. They told me that twice.

I am very annoyed.

Some other minor details. 


I live in Ohio if that matters. 

The 16 year old texted a few days after saying ""I'm grounded because you lied thanks. I hope you can be honest and tell the truth cause this was ur fault and you know it."" I kept the message and did not respond to that insanity. 

This happened a few weeks ago, I've been extremely busy with work and a new born.

My insurance is through Safe Auto and I have no problem switching after this. 

No one else was in either vehicle.

1001,"I’m a high school senior and I’ve recently met this awesome girl. I first started texting her when she and I shared some Valentines Day chocolates, and she said “oh no these are from my friend I don’t have a boyfriend.” So I took that as a chance to ask for her social media, and we’ve texted pretty much everyday since then. But while we were in class, a guy mentioned something dumb one of his friends did and she said “this is why I date girls.” So then I thought she was a Lesbian. I was pretty bummed out because I thought we were hitting it off.

One day I offered to teach her how to drive stick-shift and she took me up on it. That day we had a lot of fun, and ended up going out to eat. On the way back she told me she was bisexual and was into guys who aren’t fuckboys. We got into a pretty deep conversation about our families too. 

So we kept talking about deep stuff after that, and we started walking with eachother every day after school to our cars (she asked me first if I wanted to). Then we started walking together every morning as well.

One day after I was getting out (not having walked with her because I had to go to a club meeting), she sent me this picture of her with only her underwear on (she’s 18 so don’t stress about CP). But it was a reference to an inside joke we have. 

The next morning I sent her a shirtless picture referencing the same joke. That day she told me she was going to “play” with her girl friend after school as it was her friend’s birthday. The weekend after, she told me about how she’d had a threesome with two other girls. 

Now I’m super confused as I thought the pic she sent me was obvious she was into me, but now I’m not sure. Today we were walking and shaked pinkies, but she held on and I kind of pulled my pinky out. She looked pretty disappointed after that. I just want to ask her to hold my hand, but a conversation we had about how “guys just want to have sex with her, and can’t be friends,” keeps ringing in my mind.",09Mar2020,1

1007,"I(17f) was supposed to travel to NYC for a school trip this week. I was super excited and everything but now because the coronavirus, my teacher had to cancel with the travel agency. It really sucks but the thing I'm most worried about is that I don't think my parents do insurance. The trip cost about $2,000 and while my teacher said he will do everything he can to get some of our money back I don't think we will be seeing much of that money back.

I feel upset obviously because I won't get to go, I'm a senior so this was my last chance but I feel even worse about possible puting my family out $2,000 bucks. I work a part time job at a restaurant and while I kinda hate it, it is a nice starting experience and I do get paid decent enough. I want to pick up some extra hours to help get back that money but my mom keeps telling me not to worry and that she will pick up some time, she is a nurse. Even if I go ahead and pick up some time my mom will probably just tell me to save my money for things I want/college. Well I want to help but I can't convince her to let me.

I know paying off $2,000 with a minimum wage job is hard but spring break is coming up and school ends in a couple months meaning I will have the time to put in. I right now work two days a week because of school and make about $9-$11 an hour and have almost 2,000 dollars in my bank account.

I’ve also found that I just don’t enjoy things like I used to. In fact, I really haven’t experienced happiness since returning from a trip abroad in January. I’m a sucker for nostalgia so I’ve tried to go back and find joy in old favorites... favorite video games, favorite books, favorite YouTube channels, but I don’t feel anything. I’m always bored but I have no motivation to do anything that requires thought, like homework or college prep. Basically, I do nothing but sleep when I’m home.

1022,"Here’s a little dot point summary of why I want to leave:

- I’ve suffered with a lot of depression since a young age and through therapy it’s become fairly evident that my experiences throughout my childhood with my dad (which I won’t go into) have been quite traumatic for me

- my therapist says what I experienced was domestic abuse but I’ve been conditioned to not think that’s true and to think that everyone just doesn’t get it and is wrong (by my dad) 

- he tried to scare me away from getting help with my mental health, medication, going to hospital if I felt like I needed it... 

- my dad has always been very controlling.. I struggled a lot trying to feel like I had any sort of freedom or control over myself and this played a huge part in the decline of my mental health alongside the trauma I’d experienced

- at a young age he’d read my texts and have saved PDF versions through a software I don’t know of... all I know is that he has them all... he can access everything I type as long as it’s on our wifi network (I’m pretty sure - all I know for certain is that he can read them and it’s not off my phone) he’d then confront me about them... I didn’t have any privacy at all, I felt like I couldn’t live like a normal kid because he would never let me go... he was quite literally always watching or reading, I had no autonomy at all

- for a long time I was (and still am) scared of him because his emotions flick like a switch and when he’s angry he appears violent... he’ll act happy and then suddenly he’s mad and it’s fucking terrifying

- I spent all of my teenage years waiting for my 18th birthday because to me that represented freedom for me to take control over my life... mainly because while he wouldn’t loosen his grip over me I could move out or find a way to get away from him and legally there’d be nothing he could do

- recently he’s had security cameras installed all around the house... before leaving us all to take a trip to America on his own. he showed my siblings and I the software but we all knew it was his way of showing us all that he could see and to make sure we knew that he’d be always watching us. He gets alerts every time we walk out to the backyard or into the garage or leave the house and he’s always replaying the footage of us. There’s even one in the kitchen/lounge room/dining room and none of us feel comfortable just doing normal things in our own house because we know he’ll be watching it.  He acted like it was for surveillance but the way he showed us was clearly manipulative and he told my brother that “now no one could do anything behind (his) back” 

- he’s overall just narcissistic and manipulative... he portrays an extremely fake image of a happy and fucking great guy to the rest of the world but his family sees the other side of him. It makes it even harder because no one will ever understand or believe us. My mum recently moved out after they got a divorce... she said if she was here she wouldn’t let him do all that shit with the cameras and the other night she realised he had access to her texts too. 

Before the cameras I felt like I couldn’t live my life or even express myself because of how controlling he was. Not only did I feel like I couldn’t go out with friends or do whatever it was I wanted to with my life, I also felt like I couldn’t physically be myself. Like I got a pixie cut and he had something to say about it, he tried to control the style I went for or how short it was, I went and got a couple piercings without telling him because if I did he would have stopped me. He never stops saying how much he hates it and makes me hide them from him. I talked about wanting tattoos and he said that people only get them to appear strong but I like the art of them. He’s always told me I’m too sensitive and doesn’t actually give a shit that I’m severely depressed, he just tells me to move on... I can’t do this anymore, I never could, but before I felt like I’d be okay when I turned 18. My mental health fucking plummeted as my 18th approached and I think it was because I knew nothing was changing... he’s just so controlling, and on top both narcissistic and manipulative. He’s had us all believe how fucking great he is our whole lives and now it’s really hard to see him for who he is without doubting it... since they got divorced my mum moved out... she could only afford a two bedroom apartment, but she has three kids. My brother is 14 so he goes back and forth between houses. My sister is 20 and I’m 18 so we get to decide where we go and how we do it. I’m starting to think about living at my mums full time. It really isn’t a great life there and I’m much further from my friends and partner, but perhaps it’s all worth the autonomy and privacy. I once heard a quote that said you can’t get better in the place you got sick. I think I can’t get better till I escape from my dad. Thing is, my cat lives at my dads. We bought this cat for me when I was 13... (my dad actually once threatened to kill him - as a manipulative tactic - so there’s something to vouch for his personality) I don’t feel like anyone in this family but me gives him the attention he deserves... I left for three weeks and came back to find him hiding under my sisters bed, since I’ve been here for about 6 days he’s been out of there, sleeps in my bed and hangs out with me a lot. I just feel like when I’m not around he’s quite lonely and no one treats him the way I do. But for my sake I know I can’t keep living under my dads microscope. I can’t take my cat with me to my mums and while he isn’t shown as much love from anyone else as what I show him this is still his home and he isn’t in any danger, I think it would be a lot worse for him to move anywhere else so I am definitely not thinking about giving him away, I just feel like I’d be ditching him but maybe that’s what I need to do?

I’m struggling here. The ideal situation is to move out alone but I’m 18 and do not have that kind of money (let alone money at all) so it’s either live in a decent house and be under a microscope and heavily controlled with no autonomy or privacy, or live in a fairly small apartment which is unfair on my siblings because then there’s only one other bed for them as they come and go, but get some space from my dad.",09Mar2020,1

1024,"I’m 17, and I feel too old to really learn anything new or complex and get good at it. Let me elaborate...
Throughout high school, I haven’t been involved in any extracurricular activity. In middle school, I was active in volleyball, softball, and track, but I left it behind due to my crippling lack of self confidence. After I moved, which was quite recently, I decided to take up ice skating because I wanted to play a sport, but I was too shy to participate in any extracurricular activity at school, and I have no friends at my new school. I’ve been skating for a little over six months, and, while I have made improvement, I feel like I’m never going to be at the level I want to be because I didn’t start young enough, and I’m too old. There are other things that I’d love to do like learn the cello or learn German, (I’m taking German at the moment but have had to put it on the back burner due to other classes being top priority) but I’ve always heard that if you want to learn a stringed instrument like the cello, if you didn’t start at a young age, you’ll never be any good. Same thing with language. I’ve always heard that you can learn a foreign language, but you’ll never be able to really speak it truly fluently if you didn’t learn it at an early age. I feel like everything I’d love to learn wouldn’t be worth it because I’m too old, and I’ve almost quit skating because of it. I just can’t shake the feeling that everything I do is a waste of my time because I’ll never get any good. I don’t know what to do about it, but I’ve just been but in a place where I don’t find much worth in trying anything new anymore.",09Mar2020,1
1025,"So I’m a young girl. I have terrible anxiety. Examples: 

1: In class, my 6th hour, today we were asked to read with the person next to us. Now I don’t know this person so I politely ask to read on our own. (I have a lisp and am a terrible reader out loud. Makes me more self conscious) So he agrees as he doesn’t like reading out loud either. I turn slightly and act like I’m reading out loud and the teacher comes up to me (I’m a well behaved student in her class) and says “Why aren’t you reading to him? You’re supposed to listen to directions, you need to do as I tell you” and I freak out and sputter out, “oh shoot I’m sorry” and get back to reading out loud. And then she gives the whole class a lecture on how to follow directions. It made me feel sick and I wanted to cry but like that’s just my anxiety. I should have listened but reading out loud isn’t my cup of tea and I was already stressed. 

2: Someone on my bus is very controlling. She is my friend I guess? Not really. Anyway, she has a thing for hurting people. She’s popular and can get away with anything. So today she was getting back at hitting me, this time it really hurt so I looked at her and told her to stop. She laughed thinking it was a joke so she hit me harder. I leaned over to her and hit her lightly and told her to stop again. I go back to my seat and she gets up and starts pounding on my back. I’m almost in tears because one, I used to get hit a lot as a child, two, I couldn’t do anything about it, and three, she wasn’t hitting me lightly she left bruises on me. I got home and had a panic attack. 

I have no idea how my anxiety got this bad and I don’t know how to cope with it. Hell, my anxiety is so bad I can’t talk to my therapist about it. I try to but I feel like she thinks I’m dumb for what I say. Is there anything i should do to help myself?",09Mar2020,1

1029,"Long story short, I, along with friends A and B had planned a trip to Paris since January, set for March 25. Friend A is living in Milan (unlike me and B) and from what she has told us, it is very unlikely that she will be able to travel with us. 

B booked our hotel room and we split the price in three. I already transferred B my part, but B had asked A to give him her part in Paris so that B could spend it/have cash in the city. In other words, B has paid for 2/3 of the hotel room. Not sure if it matters but B is currently the most affluent out of the three of us because unlike A and I, B already has a job, whereas A and I are still in uni, jobless.

What is the most diplomatic way to solve this issue if A cannot come with us anymore (which us the most likely outcome given the most recent update)? Should B and I now split the three person hotel room in two? Please note that it would be a cost that I had not anticipated and would definitely affect my budget for the trip severely... Of course this is not meant to gain sympathy— just to put my own financial situation into perspective, as I had already set aside a budget for this trip. 

Should A still pay B her share of the room even though she won’t be using it? Obviously it would be unfair to B to pay more for the room, and also to A who will no longer be using the room. 

None of us are responsible for this outcome so I can’t hold anyone accountable for this. I haven’t spoken to B about this so I’m not sure how he wants to solve this.",09Mar2020,1

1037,"Hello,

Apologies in advance, this might turn into a lot of text. I'm 25 and have been living with my parents for the last year and a half after I graduated University and I'm feeling extremely torn about something I've been planning on doing for ages now- teaching English overseas. To start, today is my first day of not smoking weed, I've started to realize more and more recently that I have a problem with it and I've been trying to stop. Not only this, I'd NEED to stop well before going overseas, as the country I was planing on going to Korea and they will turn you back at the airport if you fail a drug test.

I've been feeling really overwhelmed in general recently and unsure of what I really want to do with my life right now I guess. I've been trying to get a job overseas set up while also equally pursuing jobs in the area I currently live, just to see if something more interesting might come along. I've had a few interviews but nothing really leading to anything other than the process I've been going through to get set up with teaching in Korea. And now I KNOW a part of me that just stopped smoking weed is contributing to this, but I've also felt extremely unsure in general about wanting to go since I started pursuing it basically. 

On one hand, I'm going to be going to school to be a teacher in the next year, which basically means I have some time to kill anyways and things in the area I currently live don't really seem to be going anywhere as fast as I'd like them to. I know it'd be great experience, and I'd be able to make and save money, but on the other hand I worry that I'm just doing it to prove that I'm not lazy to my parents and my family and that I'd end up disliking it once I was there.

I guess what I'm looking for is opinions and similar experiences if anything. I'm going to continue abstaining from weed for the next month while I continue to think it over but its seriously been driving me crazy and I just want to make a final decision. Whats your advice, r/advice?",09Mar2020,1

That’s another things, his boss has been supporting him for all his time there, and then we come to find out tonight that he is a lying bastard who has actually been hiding his mistakes, trying to get rid of him.

I’m really upset for her. I was super close to her and her family until she started ghosting our group. 

She said she’s been studying for her LSATs lately but that turned out to not be true. She even said she’s been too busy studying and couldn’t give me a yes or no on a beach trip I wanted to take just with her. I reached out to her mom who didn’t know she’s been lying to us. She moved back home and her mom is taking care of her (she is a really good mom so she’s going to handle this delicately).

I talked to her boyfriend after seeing all the pics of her were deleted from his Instagram. He told me that she dumped him and he is trying to get through to her to get help, but she was really volatile and is angrily texting back and forth, the same thing her ex actually did like two years ago. I don’t even know if he knows she didn’t graduate, because when I hung out with them both, she was talking about how she was in college. I just don’t get it. 

I messaged her about wanting to hang out and that I love and care about her and I didn’t mention anything about what I found out (didn’t find out until later when I talked to her bf and then her mom). She hasn’t responded, but I know she read the text. 

I’m not disappointed or angry or pissed. I’m just really, really worried. 

I really want to be there for her. Honestly this has so many red flags. I worry that she’s going to do something drastic. I know she probably has a HUGE sense of shame right now.

1049,"I hate the way I look. Like *hate* it, and I’m not desirable to anyone. I’d like some tips maybe on how to fix some shit about myself. I’m just going to go through the list of the major ugly things about me and what I’m doing about them. Please give me feedback. 

1) My fat. I’m not actually overweight. It’s just that I’m fat. Super chubby around the middle. I’m trying to workout more often. I run a mile and then work a muscle group. I’m hopping to see results in a month or two. How often should I workout? 

2) my acne. Honestly, my acne is what makes me look absolutely horrid. I’ve tried everything for it: Diet changes, OTC meds + topicals, prescribed meds + topicals, home remedies, etc. When I tried Accutane it sent me spiraling into a really long story, which resulted in (years later), crippling depression and PTSD. I’m afraid there’s nothing to be done, but it is really debilitating. Even though I change all my clothing every day, I have it on my back, arms, face, neck, and chest. It makes me want to cry. I have big pimples all over my arms and face. I’ve been teased about it most my life. It just hurts. Is there any way out?

3) Scars. This is probably tied with the acne. My self harm scars cover my body (chest, stomach, butt, thighs, arms, calves, back). Some will fade more with time, but others have been present for years. It means I haven’t really swam since 2016. :-(

4) How do you dress nice? I’m dressed kind of hoboesque until I get out of my current situation. The horny  boys at my school sexually harass people a lot. I’ve been sexually harassed wearing just sweatpants and a baggy shirt (and I’m not even pretty). And if you aren’t harassed, you’ll be bullied because you look like shit. I’m hiding out until it’s over. But once it is, how do you look presentable?

5) My hair. I used to have a pixie cut, as I was, once again, scared of being sexually harassed if I looked feminine. Now that this chapter of my life is coming to a close, I’m growing out my hair. It’s gone from an okay pixie cut, to an untamable 3-inch-above-the-shoulder mess. I can’t ever comb it down. The bangs are growing out and look super weird. It makes my face look super long. It is even less feminine than the pixie cut. I am trying to wear hats all the time. Any tips?

Also, don’t tell me “you’re pretty” “don’t be so hard on yourself” “learn to love yourself”. 
You don’t know me. I am actually very ugly, and I’m not being hard on myself. Just ask literally anyone I’ve ever met. I will never really love myself, so who gives a fuck about that. If you say anything in that train of thinking, I’m going to brush it off as BS.

TL;DR: I babysit two kids, 9 and 7. 9 year old has a lot of work thrown on him and tells me his dad yells and is sometimes violent when he doesn't do things right. I want to keep my job and make T happy at the same time. What should I do?

Hello everyone! I am in desperate need of advice here. I am 16F, 17 in May if anything legal counts, and I babysit two kids, who I'll call T and M. T is 9 years old, 10 soon, and M is 7. They are both second generation Chinese-American immigrants, with their parents coming from rural China and Hong Kong, which I do think factors into this. I babysit them twice a week, once just after their school and once to watch them while they do a violin lesson.

Well, I don't want to come off as racist, but as a lot of people know, many Asian children, especially those of first generation immigrants, face a lot of work in and out of school and get punished when they don't do extremely well. I think this is coming off on T and M from their parents. Their dad is from a rural part of China and their mother is from Hong Kong. On the day I babysit after school, they come home and start doing their HW to get it out of the way. T's homework includes:

\- 20 minutes of violin practice

\- extra homework (english/reading textbook, usually 4 pages of worksheets)

\- extra homework (math textbook, usually 2 pages of worksheets)

\- extra homework (Chinese work and textbook, which has readings and worksheets)(they only have this once or twice a week, not everyday)

\- school homework

M's homework includes:

\- 20 minutes violin

\- extra homework (two pages of english and two pages of math)

\- school homework

For M, his work usually takes an hour since he likes to get distracted. However, T's homework can take up to an hour and a half or two hours if he's in a bad mood, or around 1 hour if he's in a good mood. I'm on my phone or cooking them dinner during this time, but recently I'm also spending a lot of time consoling them and trying to get them to complete their homework. It's really painful to watch them cry over how much work they have, and the amount to me just seems ridiculous. They get it done fast, but it's just an insane amount of problems and questions to answer in my opinion.

This has come to a boiling point today. Their mom just came back from Seattle a couple days ago, so she was working from home upstairs on a semi-self-quarantine, and still needed me to watch the kids until their dad came home. I picked the kids up from their after school camp, and walked them home. We planned on going to a deli up the street for a special treat since it was so nice outside today, but on the condition that they had to do their homework first. M only had one page of schoolwork, which he completed in about half an hour, and went outside to play. T, however, saw that he had more Chinese HW to do, 4 worksheets of drawing symbols and writing, and had a giant temper tantrum. Their mom tried to calm him down, but he was inconsolable. I tried asking him what was wrong, and he could barely choke out that he was frustrated that every day he  came home to do work, and when it was done he had to do violin, or math, or chinese, or something else. He was really, really upset, and I'm sure he had been holding it in for a while, because I've been watching them since September and he's never been so angry before, just frustrated. 

His mom was trying to console him, and said that once he finished he could go outside to get a snack at the deli, but he was having none of it. I went outside with M, and since the window was open we could hear him screaming and yelling at his mom for a very long time. His mom took him outside so he could calm down, and she was genuinely confused as to why he was so upset. I took them both up to the deli, and he calmed down a lot. I think he was glad to not have to do his work for a little bit. 

I talked to his mom for a little while, and she told me that his tantrums have gotten a lot worse lately. She said, and I quote, ""what do you think it is to make him so mad? Puberty?"" and she laughed a little bit. I laughed a little too and said ""I think it's stress"". She looked so incredibly confused. She said, ""stress?"" in a very disbelieving voice. I told her yeah, he has a lot of work for a 9 year old, he goes to school for 8 hours then gets a little break at camp, but then comes home to another two hours of work. I said that it would be a lot for even me, and I'm much older, so I couldn't imagine what he's going through, and that maybe he should get like a day's break. She laughed a little again, and said ""yeah, but childhood has to have studying. didn't you do the same when you were a kid?"" I said no, I was actually outside for most of my childhood, and I got really good grades. She seemed very surprised, and said ""oh, that's...good."" I then left after a little more talking about other things. 

I am very worried about T. He gets a lot more homework than M because he's older, but it's draining for him. He never gets a break. I live in an extremely affluent neighborhood, in fact it's one of the top 10 richest zipcodes in the United States. I myself live in only a 600K home, while houses around me easily go in the low millions. T and M's father is a banker/investor, and his mom is an engineer. I think they're putting too high expectations on the poor kid. He's only 9, but he's expected to live up to his parents. He's even mentioned to me that his dad will pull his ear or pull him to the floor, he's thrown an orange at him that exploded, and yelled a lot at T in the past few years whenever he does something bad. However their parents are both young and two of the nicest people I've ever met. 

I don't know how I should go about helping T. I don't want to involve police, because it's not to the point of abuse (their father only yelling at them once a month or two-ish), but it's clearly taking a toll on T. I want to keep my job and I want to help T at the same time. I don't know what I should do, because from what I've heard from my asian friends this is standard and normal everyday life.",09Mar2020,1
1054,"I've never really had a drive to do anything, as a kid I would just do what my parents told me, like to to the gym or do my homework, but I'm an adult now in University and I just don't have the motivation to do the work. I think part of the problem is that I still do well enough at everything? Like I'm still technically doing well at uni, and I'm technically healthy enough, but I'm not happy and know I could do better.
I don't know what to do, I've felt stuck and depressed for a long time now, I'm out of ideas.",09Mar2020,1
1055,"To avoid my step-mom keeping all of the money when he passes away, my Dad wants me to take a life insurance policy for  $250,000 that covers any death besides suicide. Any suggestions on where to look?",09Mar2020,1
1056,"I’ve reported the subreddit and others have too.  I’m not sure how long this takes.  But there is a subreddit dedicated to the bullying of a Tiktok creator because they find his content “cringy”.  They comment and make fun of him for his weight, body shape, his legs, his voice.   Literally anything he post is downloaded and posted on the SubReddit and they make nasty comments about him.  They feel tiktok is for kids when in fact there are lots of us “older” people on there.  I’m in my 30s. As someone that was bullied a lot, I just hate to see others bullied.  

Other than reporting it, is there something else that can be done?",09Mar2020,1
1057,"So I'm 13 and I have been started talking to girls and this one girl and I have been talking a lot so I asked my sisters advice on how to ask her out and my 16 year sister said ""no you are a baby you cant date"" and my 21 year old sister said ""no girls have cuties dont do it"" so basically they are trying to dismiss me by making me feel like I'm 9. I dont know what to do. I know if I do ask this girl out and she says yes there might be problems. Any advice?",09Mar2020,1
1058,"It just look so fun to me. I want to have fun with people in practice, have fun in bus rides and pasta parties, and race. Yet, I am slow and couldn't make it on the team. And everyone hated me for tryout out because of how slow I was. I am just so sad right now because I will never get to experience what cross country is like ever again in my life. It is hard to wrap my head around the fact that something will never happen in my life.",09Mar2020,1
1059,"So a few night ago my friend and I were hanging out. We're both in high school so that is when feelings get confusing. We were on drugs that led to us both saying how we felt about each other. She said I was a good person and different than everyone she lets into her life. She grabbed my hand, laid on my lap, and I held her for most of the night. At one point she was saying maybe that this is what love is like and that she really wanted to kiss me. Later on we put on some music and I decided to grab her and kiss her. She kissed me back and said it felt right. We decided a relationship is too much but being friends is not enough so we would stay in between. HOWEVER, at school today she avoided me and I heard from a mutual friend of ours that she doesn't believe me when I say I'm okay with not having a relationship. We had i conversation and I told her that honestly I felt something more than friends but I wasn't going to put her in an uncomfortable situation if she didn't want that. I just don't want anyone feeling weird. I still want her in my life as a friend either way. She then went on to tell me she doesn't want anything romantic or sexual at all between us. I will respect that. I'm just confused because in the moment she seemed really into the idea of us and she was making more moves than I was. She even said she thinks I'm her soulmate. But now she is being so distant. I don't know what to do. Anyone have any advice?",09Mar2020,1

1064,"Over the weekend, I (23M) was dealing with a family crisis so my girlfriend (22) was there to help support me. It didn’t go well, so we all got drunk. While drunk, she broke down crying and confessed that she had been sending nude pictures to one of her friends. She told me she never meant to hurt me and that she would never do it again. She also said it didn’t mean anything to her, it was just for “self-esteem” or something along those lines. I don’t understand why she would need validation from someone else. I always tell her she is beautiful and wonderful and all sorts of things like that. Anyway, I just asked her today if we could get together tomorrow and talk about it. I told her I needed answers and I wanted to talk it over. She completely understood and agreed to talk about it. I don’t know if it’s even worth trying to save the relationship. I love her so much and she is such a kind person but I don’t want to get hurt like this again. Should I break up with her? Should I at least hear what she has to say? What should I bring up in the conversation and how do I deal with it?",09Mar2020,1
