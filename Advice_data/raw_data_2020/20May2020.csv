1,"On the outside, I'm part of a privileged and a well-to-do upper-middle class family, living a life with lots of material possessions and opportunity. Recently, though, my relationship with my dad has been deteriorating more and more. There's rarely been *physical* abuse in the house, but it's mostly yelling, verbal degradation, etc. My dad, ever since I can remember, has been absolutely *obsessed* with complete and absolute honesty, and a focus on schoolwork first and foremost. Sounds healthy right? Well, ever since I turned 18 it's gotten to the point where he's been a lot more commanding. Not allowing me to leave a room he's in until I've been ""dismissed,"" reminding me constantly that he is my ""maker"" and that I owe him my life for everything he's given to me, calling me an ""SFT"" for ""stupid fucking teenager,"" and similar interactions. There are moments when he's a lot nicer, but I don't genuinely enjoy them anymore because I know it's only ephemeral. He constantly expects me to talk to him about my problems, but berates me with comments about how ""immature"" my reactions to said problems are every time I do, and tells me that if I don't like his reaction then I can live somewhere else.

Well, that's what I'm doing. I know my dad would lose his shit and boot me out the house the instant I told him that I wanted to leave, so I'm not telling him and leaving at 4 am. A close family friend recently reached out and said I could stay at their place that's a 3 hr drive from where I'm currently living — I'm taking some clothes, a laptop I received for my birthday, an iPhone I've had for two years, an escooter, and my guitar. I'm on this forum asking for help/advice on how to live independently, since my dad's maintained a grip on my life by neglecting to teach me certain fundamentals of living in today's society. For example not helping me learn how to drive (though I have my permit that's expired and can get my driver's license once I'm out on my own), how to do taxes, how to pay for college, how to budget living expenses, etc...

I've had a job working for a few years now and have \~$3,000 saved in a JOINT savings account with my dad — I plan to meet with the bank and transfer it all to a checking account soon so I can use that, but when I move I'm not sure how to handle it beyond making sure not to spend too much and keep working at a reasonable rate.

I ALSO have plans to go to University in the fall, but with the looming threat of COVID-19 still in the air, I'm considering forgoing my first year of college altogether and saving up some money. My dad's been threatening to send me to the army for a while now, but now I'm thinking that it might be a good idea given I've got very little money and a mediocre high school transcript that barely got me accepted into university this year... is it worth it?

All things considered, could y'all please help me out with a quick run-down of how to live independently, as I want to try and do things on my own? Anything from tips on how to do laundry to how to file a W2 is helpful — and thank you!",20May2020,1

4,"My younger brother is drunk again and i'm so fucking pissed. My mother and i just had a long talk with him about him drinking. He went on a 3 day binge and only spent one day sober. He's 25 years old and hangs out with people who want nothing but to drink from morning to night. He's a smart guy and i dont want him to end up like his friends. I try so hard to pour my heart out to him about how i feel and at the time he sounds sincere and says he's sorry, regrets it, and says he'll stop but goes back on his word every fucking time. I think i've said everything i can, i spend hours trying to find the right words to say to him and its not working. I just want to beat the fuck out of him and call him a piece of shit but that'll only drive him further away. I can't just let him go and hope for the best because thats what my mother did to our father and he's still an alcoholic bum after 15 years. i fucking love my younger brother. I don't want him to end up like our father. Old, homeless, and living for the next bottle. He's a hard worker but me and my mother cant always be with him to keep him from drinking.

5,"TLDR: brother is depressed, parents want him to jet a job but he doesn’t even try to get one, I’m worried he will stay at home forever and hold himself back 

This is going to be a long one so bear with me. I (27F) am worried about my brother (21M), let’s call him Bro. Right now we both live at my (narcissistic) mom’s house because we are both going to university. 

So my parents split up almost ten years ago, at that time I wasn’t living at home and I didn’t really feel affected by it because my parents were terrible together. However, I know that it was really really hard for Bro. He has struggled with depression and a lot of self confidence issues over the years but has finally started taking medication as of this last year. He seems to be doing a lot better but still slips into depressed states which is to be expected, there is no magical cure. I completely understand this because I also have anxiety and depression and have been taking medication for a much longer time. 

Anyway my brother is in school, he’s freaking brilliant, he has so much potential to be whatever he wants to be but I feel like he holds himself back due to the depression and self confidence. Recently my dad mentioned that he is failing all of his classes. My dad is also pushing him really hard to get a job, which would be good because he hasn’t ever had a job. 

I tried talking to Bro about how he’s feeling last week. He said that he feels really depressed and doesn’t have motivation to do anything on top of being a procrastinator. I tried to talk more but he really hates talking about feelings and really anything serious so he avoids the conversation or leaves the room. I haven’t tried to talk to him about his grades because I feel like that’s none of my business. I haven’t bothered him about jobs but I have showed him job openings that I think he would like, but I don’t know if he ever applies. The more I talk to him about his feelings the more it seems to push him away. 

My mom (narcissistic) has been really mean to Bro about getting a job and is constantly nagging him about it. I feel like this makes it even worse and I don’t think it is going to help Bro get a job. However I also worry that if no one bugs him he won’t get a job. 

Bro makes me nervous because sometimes I think that he is going to let his depression and self confidence issues get in the way of succeeding in life. He has so much potential and it makes me sick to think about him giving up on school or never leaving home. I want to be encouraging and supportive to him. It’s not the end of the world to fail some classes, and if he wants to take a break that’s fine too! Also, degrees are not required to do well in life so if he never wants to go back that’s okay too! 

As for getting a job idk why he avoids that. I assume it’s because it’s new and scary and the lack of motivation holds him back but it would be good for him to start getting some work experience under his belt. I started working when I was 14, so for him to not have a job at 21 I worry about him. Maybe this is more normal than I think. I’m not sure. Maybe it’s just a late bloomer thing. I’m a late bloomer, I didn’t start on my undergrad until two years ago. Right now he seems to use video games to escape how he feels and escape life basically. There is nothing wrong with video games, I love them too, but I kind of feel like he is using them as an emotional crutch. 

I know that in the past he has really wanted some things and worked his butt off to work towards goals but they didn’t come to fruition and this may have dampened his faith in himself.  (Even though the outcomes were out of his control and in no way a judgement on his abilities or character) Like maybe he is feeling like there is no point in trying because everything sucks anyway, or he feels like he won’t be good enough? I don’t know because he won’t talk to me about it. 

Both of my parents are using tough love with him which has never worked with him. I don’t know what would work but I really want to connect with him and show him that he is loved, he is worth it, he is good enough, and that I’ll always be there if he needs help. 

I love my brother so much, I literally can not relax I have so much anxiety about him. I want to help him but I don’t know what to do. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, especially if you have been in a situation similar to Bro.",20May2020,1
6,"Hi there. I really need help. 

I wont say much about myself but im M(22) and the girl i like is F(19). Im an introvert and i spend most of my time playing games or work. I’ve never had a girlfriend. Im pretty shy guy but i get along pretty easily.  

The thing is, my manager(26M) is far more good looking than i could ever be. Hes got a girlfriend but hes hooked up with every girl i know and he just uses them. There is a new girl(19f) at my work and shes pretty cute. My manager was talking about her already yesterday. How hes talking to her and chatting and how hes planning to take her out and do what he did to every girl he met. I dont really interfere in other people’s personal life but im very frustrated that he can take her out and she will say yes but my manager is not a good person. When i started working, the first thing he told was “ look at that chick, she hot? I got my juice in her and dumped her “. 

Sorry for my bad English but help me out here guys. What should i do?

10,"I'm currently a (20M) at a university here in the states on the West coast and I became friends with a (20) girl this year.  She's very nice however, she seems to have opened up to me more than anyone else. Letting me know alot of personal things about her. She seemed to want to spend alot of time with me while we were at school and a bit now due to our online courseses. 

She has a boyfriend that goes to another university a bit far from where we are. Shes told me that she absolutely loves him and I'm happy for her. However, when we have school work or she's having emotional issues she tends to talk to me. 

It gets to a point where I ask myself the question of why is she coming to me instead of her boyfriend we're all the same major. That being sociology. I'd also mention that she knows alot more people besides me however, when she needs help she comes to me.

Sometimes  I think why not have your boyfriend help you with your work or emotions I feel like that would help strengthen their relationship.

Also she wants to take more classes together but I feel like this is only because she knows I do all the work and reading that she tends to not do. 

 What I'm worried about is that she's just using me to help her with her classes. As well as showing me the more emotional side of her that she might think would be a Hassel for her boyfriend to deal with. 

Tldr: Afraid girls just using me for Academic and Emotional support.",20May2020,1

However, I'm unsure whether to get a corn snake or a royal python  (ball python ).

While corn snakes have mostly cons, from what I've seen they're more likely to escape a d run away from you.

Overall I think ball pythons are cuter and I'm more than happy to go the extra length to keep up humidity and work with its feeding habits..

14,"Hi.

For some context, my name is Jaiden/Jayden and I am bisexual and genderqueer. I know it's very common to doubt yourself by asking yourself ""Will people think I'm just doing it for attention?"" In my situation, it's always yes, and I guess I'm learning my lesson.

What sucks is that I know I deserve it. You see, I've always liked attention. I've told many, many lies and still continue to do so, and getting attention is always half of the reason. It's always been to the point where even when I tell the truth I feel like I'm asking attention. I don't even know the borders between ""good attention"" and ""bad attention"" anymore. It's like the concept of ""talking back""; even as I'm writing this post, I feel like I'm just telling a lie.

So many times I've drafted posts for ""attention"" on Reddit. All I'm doing is ruining people's reputations. Why can't I just be a bad actor? I'm messing with so many people's feelings. I feel inclined to lie, and it's just automatic that ""Oh, I'm doing this for attention.""

I get my fair share of attention at home. Maybe not enough, but it's understandable, considering my parents are busy and wouldn't have time for an attention-seeker like me. I've even told them I was lying when I was telling the truth, JUST FOR ATTENTION.

Why do I want this mysterious attention so bad? Why is it that whenever someone suspects I'm lying, I immediately know I'm doing it for attention? If I got all the attention I wanted, I wouldn't like it anyways.

This has become such an important part of my identity. Some of the lies I've told include:

\-Telling my classmates that my mom smashes things in my face and is abusive

\-Telling my classmates that my dad is sick

\-Exaggerating whenever I can

\-Fake-crying and pretending to be moody, then actually being moody afterward

Someone please make a list of all the lies I've told and make them real so I can finally learn my lesson.",20May2020,1
15,"This may appear to be a stupid question with an obvious answer, however I have trouble over-analysing these sorts of things, so I will ask anyway:

Quite a few years ago when I (male) was at University, I became acquaintances with someone who I shall call Erin. We met through a group project that we and several others worked on, however I dropped out of Uni and we went our separate ways. Now, I didn't tell Erin this, but I was (and still am) quite attracted to her, and at the time I considered asking her out, but never had the nerve, and plus it wasn't a good idea since it would have made working on this group project very awkward if I had asked her out and was rejected, or if I made a fool of myself, or whatever - which would have additionally been exacerbated due to the nature of the project, which I can't go into without revealing too much. So, I did nothing, and when I dropped out of my course and moved home we mostly lost touch.

At some point during the time we were in regular contact at uni, I discovered Erin had a tumblr page, and I ended up following her there. Not too long after I dropped out, I noticed Erin had posted a rather sad lamentation of a post. As I was a bit tipsy I wrote her quite a long-winded, cringey (with sober hindsight) message to try to console her (but not revealing my feelings for her), and sent it to her on tumblr privately (not anonymous, she knew it was me). We were never all that close, and so I later apologised for this message and tried to forget about it.

For the first time in years I decided to take a look at tumblr today, and scrolling down a bit I came across a number of recent posts where an anonymous user had sent a number of messages to Erin after she had posted a picture of herself in lingerie. The anonymous user was trying to convince her to start using OnlyFans to make money from her... assets, and that they would support her financially if she did. Erin didn't seem to be offended by this message, but she politely told them this wouldn't be feasible for her due to her career. A few messages go back and forth, and the thing is the anonymous user reveals that they:

* know Erin in person,
* haven't seen Erin for a while,
* think she's attractive,
* had never told her their feelings,
* don't know what Erin would think if they revealed who they were,
* and to top it all off when Erin asked who the anonymous user was, they didn't reveal themselves, but they referenced something that I might be likely to reference (I can't go into any more detail without revealing too much).

Basically, a ton of things that also happen to apply to me, and this has *freaked me out*.

Here is my worry - I know I am a socially awkward person. Due to the aforementioned cringey message I sent her on tumblr years ago, she is well aware of that. While I never said anything about my feelings directly to her, I get the impression she probably had at least an inkling that I liked her. And, given I'm awkward, I have no trouble imagining Erin thinking that I am the one posting these anonymous messages. Just to be clear, I am *not* the anonymous user - I would never encourage someone who is doing so well at the beginning of her professional career to start using OnlyFans which could potentially jeopardise it. (Not that I have anything against anyone who would decide to do this - I don't think it's morally objectionable or anything else, I just don't think possible future employers would necessarily think the same)

Basically, I don't want her to think I'm a creep - especially because I've been considering talking to her about working on something in the future, similar to the project we worked on together years ago. She's good at what she does, and I don't want her to rule me out because of this weird situation that I have not instigated.

Would it be at all advisable to message her and say, ""Hey, I just spotted these posts on your page - that is not me."" - is this a bad idea? I can appreciate that this might raise further suspicion, or that denying it is me might make her think that what has been said by the anonymous user also applies in my case - which is in fact true. Or, do I say nothing, and have her think it could have been me, when it never was?

I don't know what to do. Any advice will be gratefully received.",20May2020,1
16,This lockdown has really brought up issues that i (22M) never knew i had. Maby im just old school but i never really needed to used my phone. If i wanted to talk to someone i would go talk to them. This all means that I got good social skills but sh*t texting skills. Now this would be fine in the small town i grew up in but I recantly moved to a city. And now im finding it hard to adjust. I have made a few friends here. Now before the lock down we would hang out all the time so not texting wasn't a problem. But now that texting is the only way to stay in contact they have started to ask why im not texting them. And im worried that they will think im avoiding them. this is also effecting my ability to date seeing as most people here are using tinder and im just here not knowing how the hell to keep a text convo alive. Am i just weird? Is there something I could do to learn this?,20May2020,1
17,"So this all started a couple of years ago when a random girl from school asked to meet up with me at her house to watch movies. Me, being a naive 15 year old, blindly accepted. Long story short, the evening ended with her stealing my first kiss quite forcefully and out of the blue after grinding on me for about an hour. I was dumbfounded and I’m not really a forceful person when it comes to that sort of stuff so I was just sitting back a bit confused about the whole situation. We sort of drifted after that.

Fast forward two years and whenever I think of her, I’m aroused despite her not being physically attractive to me. I eventually got back into contact just to see how things went but I didn’t feel any sort of romantic attraction to her. I liked her platonically and sexually but romantically there was nothing. After around 6 weeks of becoming friends again I told her that I wanted to have sex with her. Just telling her how I felt and explaining that I didn’t expect anything. We were still friends but I would tell her how I felt every now and again because I thought that being transparent about it would help build a healthy friendship. 

Lockdown was getting to me a bit and I was feeling lonely so I popped the question that had been on my mind for a while. ‘Would you like to try friends with benefits?’  I thought it was logical to ask that due to both of us being single but me not being romantically attracted to her. Based on her previous actions towards me I thought she might feel similarly but apparently she didn’t, which is fair enough and I told her that while trying to explain why my mind care to that conclusion. All while I’m explaining how I feel, she’s taking screenshots. She said she was pissed off, and felt used, and that I’m a shit person for being annoyed at her taking screenshots of our private conversation. Idk what she did with them but my gut told me she was sending them to friends to either mock me or explain how shorty of a person I am. 

She blocked me before I could say anything else

There’s a couple things I’d like advice on:
1) am I a bad guy for doing what I did
2) I’m scared that if she sends the screenshots around social media, new people that I’m meeting will already dislike me before hearing me out. Potentially ruining my already pretty bad social life.

21,"!!SEXUAL ASSAULT TRIGGER WARNING!!

Long story..

In high school I had this friend who had a crush on me, he used to creep me out but as he was mates with everyone I hung out with I just put up with it. In the early years of high school he used to bully me a bit I was a goofy 11 year old with wonky teeth, non straightened hair and obv no makeup. Soon as I started to wear makeup and bother about my appearance around 13 he added me on an instant messenger (msn) and kept messaging at how beautiful I looked today but about 50 times a day. It went on for ages he would put love hearts on his name with my name on it. I wasnt interested what so ever I mean yeah this bit is innocent cos we was kids. I used to shower and see 50 missed calls off him from his home phone. I used to have to appear offline as he used send me hundreds of messages even if I didn't reply. I was always kind to him and let him know I wasnt interested nicely. After about a month of this he finally got a girlfriend she was one of my friends.. I was so happy for them but also happy he was off my back. (They are actually still together now) well fast forward to 2007 I was out at our local park drinking with my friends being stupid care free teenagers. And he came up to me and told me that him and my friend had broken up. Next thing I know he stuck his tongue down my throat and I laughed it off and tried get away. I sat on a bench with my friends baring in mind I was drunk as hell (stupid I know) next thing I remember is him putting his arm firmly around my neck and saying please come talk to me up here, I've always been a people pleaser and felt sorry for him considering he just broken up with his gf (and I was drunk). He then took me into a forest I can't remember what exactly happened but I know I said no but I was too drunk to care or give consent. He lay me on the floor had sex with me shoved my head down there and did things to me... I cant remember if he finished or what happened all I can remember after is stumbling off home with no underwear on. I felt weird when I woke up the next day I had never been interested in this boy at all he used creep me out and surely if I wanted him I would of done it before. I wasnt the kind of person to sleep with someone like that randomly especially as I was only 14. I just felt sick and when I saw him in school it just made me feel so anxious and nervous. I never told anyone as I didnt want to be the person who split up our group. I didnt want him to get into trouble?! He told his best friend and bragged about sleeping with me but I just denied it as I was so ashamed. I really didnt want to. I've always put myself down repeatedly thinking I'm a horrible slut over this and its something that's affected me for YEARS. I see him now dropping my kids off at school and I get that same feeling. Was this rape? I have had very bad depression/ocd/anxiety and this is one thing that keeps me awake at night still. I find myself constantly questioning if it was assault or not as I didnt run or shout or noone would believe me because I seemed to act as normal as I could to him for the rest of my high school life. I've always thought that we was just kids and he didnt know what consent was?? Please help me. I just want to sleep.",20May2020,1

28,"I need help...I’ll try and keep it short
So basically I’ve had two roommates for six months. One works overseas and is around only once a month so we don’t see her much( I’ll call her Ana), she’s also the landlord. My other roommate and I (Beth) have been pretty close, got along well and never had any problems with each other. About a month ago a new roommate moved in (Kait) who is also friends with the landlord. My close roommate, Beth hated  the idea of her moving in and would ignore her around the apartment. Just three weeks in, the new girl and Beth started gossiping about our landlord, Ana. I think that’s how they bonded and it’s so upsetting to me! They have all of a sudden become so close, they hang out 24/7, they give each other money, work out together and share deep personal stuff and it’s only been 3 weeks, it blows my mind!!!! It’s almost like I’m invisible to her now. I can’t even share anything with her anymore because I feel like she’ll tell the new girl and I’m sure they talk about me too. It’s so upsetting how this new girl came in and changed our whole roommate dynamic, she’s so manipulative. I’m trying to find a way to avoid them without being passive- it’s been hard pretending and smiling at them. The new girl is loving this by the way",20May2020,1
29,"I've been in therapy for a few years, progressively working my way through anxiety, episodes of depression and in the last year occasional panic attacks which obviously didn't get much easier with quarantine and continuos news of death and uncertainty.

At the same time I am in a healty relationship, i have a good job and overall i am working my way through my issues (mainly very profound fears of not being good enough fueled by old experiences that trigger automatic reactions - procrastination, rage and depression - that i really want to get over with); i've been learning how to accept anxiety and sadness, reset and work my way through self improvement with meditiation and sports.

The problem is that in the last year and a half i had occasional pains or ""bad feelings"" and i can't understand when they are real or just triggered by my emotions. Sometimes they are principles of anxiety or panic attacks (mainly pains to chest and arm, those are AWFUL but i learned to accept that they are just false and i will be ok) sometimes they are real pains (weather muscle related or only discomfort after an unconfortable position) but seem 100 times worse than they are because fueled by paranoia, sometimes they are real pains that could actually be a signal that i should take into account. 

This gets problematic because i have a real issue with my blood circulation (basically extreme varices to mu legs) and i know that eventually i was going to get an operation. I should be ok for a few months while i wait for the pandemic to get better but i started having pains to my leg that made me freak out thinking about thrombosis or some sort of veins blockage (which are a possibility). Still, to get an examination and double check i should go to the hospital for a radar examen (ecodoppler) and i really don't want to do that, the healt system here is collapsing and extreme caution (first of all just stay away from hospitals as long as possible) is paramount.

Some days i really freak out, not knowing if my pain is about paranoia or something that really should make me worry. I contacted the local doctor and he told me to go, but i figure he cannot tell me otherwise to protect himself in case anything happens. I sincerely don't know what to do.",20May2020,1
30,"I typed all this out on my phone so please be nice about grammar errors. :c

I'm a 24(F) and I live with my 25(M) roommate and the apartment lease is going to end in less than a month. 

I moved in with him at the beginning of March because I got a promotion with a pay raise (or was supposed to). Before moving in with him I was struggling financially and had little to no savings because I was living paycheck to paycheck. I was living with someone but they moved to a different  state. With this new job I was going to be working a guarantee 40 hour work week with a big pay raise. Things finally seemed to be looking up for me in the first time ever. 

But then the pandemic hit and I only got to work 2 days until my job closed down for 3 weeks. I never got to have the sit down meeting to discuss my pay but before moving I was told an estimated number. Then they reopened and I went to work coughing alot so they told me I had to be checked out by a doctor before I would be able to come back. I did and the doctor suggested I may have covid-19. So I did get tested but it came back negative and I just had bronchitis. But I did miss work for another week. Then I was told I was being furloughed until further notice. I haven't heard anything from anyone at work since then because they're not allowed to talk to me. I'm really worried I'm going to get laid off completely. 

I filed for unemployment but got denied, so I tried to reapply. Still waiting on that. But I haven't had an income since basically March. Working 3, 5 hour days really isn't much. And again.....I barely have any savings. My roommate is paying for everything and he said he doesn't mind that much. I'm giving him what I can but he says he feels guilty about me giving him money. Well the lease ends next month which I knew before moving in with him. We were planning on getting a bigger and better apartment together. But now he's wanting to move back home to his family. Which I don't blame him at all and I'm not mad.

Just....I have absolutely no idea where to go. I left home right when I turned 18 because I was being physically and verbally abused. My parents have already told me several times that I'm not welcomed back anyways, that there is no place for me. I don't really have much family to begin with. Also....I don't have any friends....at all. My roommate is literally my only friend and the only person I talk to. Even if I'm not laid off my hours would be shorten and it wouldn't be enough to live by myself where I moved. 

What are some suggestions or advice, I'm kinda desperate.",20May2020,1

32,"Hi all, new to the sub. Here's my situation:

I've been working at my current company (a credit union) since August of 2016. I had no experience in finance and have a music degree so I had no idea how it was going to go. Clearly it's gone at least pretty well because I've gone from being a teller to now being the legal aid for Collections which is a job I really enjoy. I love my boss and most of my immediate coworkers, plus my health insurance is really great.

My big complaint however is ALWAYS other employees.

There are so many people who are just completely nasty for no reason. I left my last department because two of the higher ranked people (I was on equal level with them) we're just grossly incompetent and lazy as all hell, and when I brought up to my supervisor at the time, she just kept making excuses and then would comment that I seemed stressed (because I was doing all of the work). She KNEW and admitted they were like that but she just wouldn't do anything about it. 

So now I'm in collections. Most of my coworkers are fine but this one woman drives me NUTS because she is bossy and demanding and recently snapped at me (for the second time) because I asked her to fill out a log on Excel (she's working from home so she cant fill it out manually, she just wants me to do it all for her). She doesn't know how to use it, and wouldn't even try. 

Today, our separate building where collections is was close to flooding from the rain, but there were only 3 of us because everyone else is working from home. We dress casual in collections. I got moved to the main building and someone called and complained to my supervisor because I was wearing shorts.

It's at the point where I am getting so depressed because I know even if I go to another company there will always be people like this. And frankly, I'd honestly rather die than deal with bullshit like this until I can retire. I dont know how to just accept it and move on like other people do. 

I'm in therapy so I'm trying to talk through it but there's SO MUCH TO GET THROUGH.

34,"I’m 24 going on 25. I dropped out of college twice due to problems with mental health and family issues. I’ve tried multiple pills and they didn’t help or made matters worse. I’ve talked to therapists - I just started a few weeks ago talking to another.

I’ve read self help books. I’ve attempted creating new habits. I’ve thought through everything I possibly can to try and get things going in a direction I feel passionate about but I haven’t gotten anywhere.

2 years ago I finally made a decision to move away from home to make changes. I saved up money and bought a used car straight up. Now I have a couple grand in the bank and plan to go back to school in the fall. I have a girlfriend of a couple months who cares so much about me and I care for. I have family that supports me. I’m relatively healthy.

On the outside things seem like I should be okay. I should be appreciative for my life and the opportunity to be where I’m at. I’ve practiced gratitude. I’ve thought of the good in life. I’ve tried to take things day by day but at the end of all of it I just feel completely overwhelmed.

I don’t get how people do it. I can’t make a decision to save my life. One day I think I know what I want to study and the next I’m not sure if I even want to go to school. One day I’m thinking about how great a career would be and the next I’m doubting all of it. Because how do I know any better? If I know anything it’s that I don’t know anything at all. I’m young and naive and most - if not all - of what I “know” now I’ll see was misguided or misconstrued or flat out wrong. I just don’t know any better and don’t have the self confidence to pull the trigger on anything.

What am I missing? How am I supposed to do this thing called life? I’ve thought of every which way and it just seems like I’ll be going from doing one thing to the next until I die. I know that’s a bit dramatic and not exactly accurate. I know there are plenty of people out there who have good, rewarding lives and are trying their best. There are others fighting to get by. There are many not as fortunate as I am. Yet, I don’t feel lucky. I don’t feel like my life is all that great.

I want to lead a good, noble, virtuous life. I want to help others and see the bright side of things. I just don’t know how to tap into that or which direction to go with all the options. I’m going to regret doing whatever I choose because with each choice there are consequences. Sure, I could dedicate my life to a career but lose out on some relationships and family and possibly money. I could follow family and relationships but not have a rewarding career. I can search for balance in all things but feel like I sold myself short on certain aspects.

It’s frustrating. It’s taxing. I just want to live a good life and feel good for once about my future. How do people do it?",20May2020,1
36,"There's this girl at work who is really getting on my nerves, she's the sort of person that dominates the conversation and when she makes jokes at my expense she usually misunderstands what I'm talking about and won't allow me to explain myself and I guess because she's the charismatic one everyone laughs along with her and I come across as the idiot despite being the one who's been misunderstood. I don't think she does it on purpose but it does really get me down. I've tried avoiding her but she always seems to butt into the conversation. An example today me and a friend were talking and he said he had an en suite growing up and I said lucky we all had to share to which she interpreted as my whole family had to share a shower at the same time i thought what I meant was obvious but when I tried to explain she wouldn't listen and it just ended with everyone laughing at me, stuff like this happens all the time.

I’ve been texting him last week. We were talking about something he was like “You have to win me over”. So now I don’t understand? Why would he say the he want me to be his girl and then say that? I don’t even know how to respond? He would always be the first person to bring up marriage and kids.

48,"For context, I'm 32 (I think he's 60). I love the guy, but we've had a rocky relationship over the years. Frankly, the only thing we can talk about are video-games; the moment the conversation veers into anything else, things typically go sour.

We used to always play MMO's (online games), so it would give us plenty to talk about. Now, though... not so much. The few games I play, he's not interested in, and I've tried to take an interest in the games *he* plays, but he's bored with everything and just plays WoW (which I got bored with)

He calls every other day now (sometimes in a row), and there just... isn't anything to talk about. It's weird, because I know he's just bored and looking for something to do. The problem is, well, we *don't* have anything to talk about.

So what usually winds up happening is either A) we sit on the phone, literally just listening to each other breathe (he's usually watching TV or something when he calls me), or B) he starts poking around in my life.

That's when things get tense; I love my dad, but I'm 32, and he is a largely negative influence. I don't hold it against him, he had a rough life, and I understand where his negativity comes from. But he can't help but start butting-in to my business, and I don't even think he realizes, but he just passively puts me down.

Tonight he called, and I just let it ring. I believe we just talked yesterday (although I'm bad with time, and it might have been the night before). But he often calls me, basically just hoping I'll have something to talk about to entertain him, and when I don't, again, it's either ""we just sit on the phone not saying anything"" or ""I have to end the conversation before it winds up getting into bad territory"".

Is there a polite way of just saying ""Hey, give me a call *if you actually have something to talk about*""? Because it's honestly kind of exhausting to constantly have these weird ""calls"" where we literally don't have anything to talk about.

Would it be terrible if the next time we talk, I just said ""Hey, feel free to give me a call if you read any cool news or have anything to share, but otherwise we can probably catch up over the weekend""?",20May2020,1
49,"I have arguments with my mum every night and it’s incredibly stressful for my mum and sister (I’m 17). 

Today it was after my mum asked me why I was up in my room playing games. At 3am saying I woke her up even though there was no possible way that could’ve been the reason. I then proved her wrong and she went on to say that because I had so much time she would give me more chores to do and how I should start learning to drive and how I’m lazy, how I need to find a job for next year/start doing more hours. 

I then made the point that it was quarantine rn so I couldn’t learn anyway and she started telling me how arrogant I was and how I always know what’s right etc.
This is kinda rich coming from the woman who has job hopped for the last 4 years and when forced to work at a car wash last summer, stating how she was going to ‘take our Prius car with her each day to make sure they knew she was capable of more’. Like seriously how more of a superiority   example is that. Don’t get me wrong I’m a teen so I’m bound to be a bit narcissistic but I am definitely still a very empathetic person, possibly the most in my friend group! 

My mum then brought up the fact I ignored her trying to get me to finish my coursework which ended up being handed in incomplete and how that makes me arrogant because I ignored her advice. I have immense issues concentrating and not zoning out which I wanted to get a test for ADHD because of, along with a list of symptoms that I have 100% experienced my whole life. Even though we could get sessions with a therapist on my dads insurance my mum still went on about how it costs thousands of pounds.
She retorted saying ‘that’s just an excuse because you’ve become lazy, last year you did well the whole year’. Christ, after summer of 2019 I had a 4 month breakdown type thing where I got permanently anxious that I was developing every mental illness known to man, withdrew from my friends loads spending lunchtimes and after schools ignoring them, having multiple anxiety attacks a weeks. This ended in January where I failed all my A-Level mocks after doing no revision because I was convinced I was becoming schizophrenic and complete withdrew and felt depressed and lacking in energy. I went to counseling but that didn’t really do much, which ended in my counselor prompting me to get assessed for ADHD which I have procrastinated since because I was too anxious that I would be wrong and I would just look like a self obsessed dickbag. 
The best part is my friends don’t even know about any of this because I have epic trust issues. Lmao in the past month I’ve even been the most confident I’ve ever been, it almost feels like my anxiety is muted. I used to be a super nervous guy but I’m the past year I’ve started standing up for myself more and in general have become more confident and mature and as a result I clash with my controlling mother more than ever before.

I got upset because my mum shut the bedroom door on me after I told her that me and her have a toxic relationship and we should get counseling so the whole family can get on better and can coexist without the stress of us arguing. 
The reasoning for this is my dad is on anti-depressants for his stress and I don’t want him to get depressed like his alky father did. I recently joked with him that he shouldn’t beat himself up so much, which he replied to saying how ‘it seems to be what he’s best at’ in a way that sounded like I’m he was about to start crying which complete tore me apart.

Anyway I decided to go for a walk without telling my parents at 1am because my sleep schedule is screwed at the moment and I wanted to cry about the fact it feels like I have no connection with my female ‘role model’. I got into my town area and ran into a police car who were doing random checks. Thank the lord I’d stopped crying by this point but because I was 17 and my parents didn’t answer they were forced to take me home. I had to wake my mum up stand she was cheery with the police officer at the door although she made it clear she wasn’t fine with me being out in the first place. As soon as the door closed she told me ‘got o bed, We’ll y’all tomorrow’. I didn’t day anything. To the policeman but I think my mum is peed off.

51,"Hello. My sister (27) is requiring a place to live by the first. She has a history of anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. She has moved from home to home, many times getting kicked out, throughout her entire life. She has a difficult time agreeing to any sort of therapy or treatment.

Given the current stay at home orders, she cannot work or afford rent. My dad has been paying her rent the last couple of months. She wanted to move back in with dad, which he wanted as well, but my stepmother and two brothers who also live there do not approve as they do not get along with her. He is considering buying a mobile home for two reasons: 1.) She has a dog she’s not willing rehome and has a history of receiving noise complaints. An apartment is not an option. 2.) He bought a condo for her years ago, and she could not keep up with the bills. Instead of paying the bills she stayed with my mom “temporarily” so she could get back up on her feet and pay her debts off. Eventually it was found she had no intention of paying her debts and planned to abandon the condo and make her way into permanently living with my mom, until my mom kicked her out. My dad was later forced to sell. We are both aware that she’s most likely going to abandon the mobile home but she will not have to worry about noise complaints. 

Kicking her out and letting her learn on her own is not an option. SAFETY is first, and she is not mentally capable of learning the “hard way”.

Given those circumstances I would like some input from those who have experience on other options can be considered. She cannot live with me as I have a child and am not willing to expose my child to the environment she will bring about.

Again, from people who have experience, what kind of plan can we put in place for her to commit to a long term therapy if my dad finds her a home? I was previously a psych nurse and believe inpatient is best for her, but I know it would be too much for her and she would not commit. I am looking into outpatient long term therapy.

—My first post is submitted early today and now that it’s evening, here is an update. She moved her belonging into my dads house after he denied her request (she has the garage password). My dad respectfully stated she needs to pack her things or he will call the cops to have her leave. She threatened to shoot him with a gun and destroy his businesses. I don’t know if she has a firearm. She eventually left. I am telling my dad to call the cops to make sure her firearm is revoked and most likely legally mandated to have treatment. I asked that he changed his password, which he did. Currently he is contemplating that decision as I know it is difficult for him. I am reminding him that safety is first as well as establishing strong boundaries. I am doing my best to support him now.

Thank you. ❤️",20May2020,1

So tonight, I was I’m my backyard with my dog (a golden retriever 1.5 years old) he was not barking or making any noise, but was sniffing along my fence line.

Alt account cos I'm going crazy.
My new job role currently does not actually keep me too busy,
While I expect it to pickup towards summer/winter for the time being for the most part I'm stuck at work doing fu k all.
I love my job, and dont mind busy time but for the first time in my 15 year working history I've got the opportunity to just sit and do nothing I.e. just be available.. 

I've do everything I could stretch to do, 
I found myself on facebook. It's a killer, great for seeing distant friends and family, and for sending occasional messages but despite my positive outlook I've took a dive online I found myself to be quite the troll.
Humanity on Facebook pains me. And I hate people so easily there. It's almost like I vent or rage at anything random on fb, and i go there to get hooked into some lame pointless comment strings lol.
I need to cut facebook from work, if I'm honest theres just that and reddit, I can do reddit for about 15 mins before I'm bored again. But facebook can steal my entire shift if theres no work. 
It's the adverts, or the fake news, or the groups. Weather they stir a response or not I'll muster some sarcastic hopefully funny slander, nothing personal or targeted but nothing constructive either. 
I need advice.
I could just go round doing other peoples jobs, in the past I've always done that and have at long last recently learned not to do that else I find myself forever expected to do other peoples ever increasing amount of work. With no bonus. So this is not improvement.
I want to clarify, I dont want to put my hand up saying I got no work, I'm done with managers giving me pointless jobs, or other peoples work to do to kill time. 
The energy I put in me comes from the same wage I get that others get for doing their share of equal work.
Hope you understand, and I'd appreciate any comments or opinions or experiences as I'd like to do something constructive or at least venture online for something better than bloody book face cos I'm bored as hell.

It’s all a joke and shit everyone’s cool with it so we’ve just kept it going and it’s all been fine. 

I didn’t think anything of it at first, but then she DM’ed me for the first time sending a picture of what I think was that pic of two black guys kissing, and said “this could be us but you playin” I didn’t really take that as anything special but I think it kinda set the seed. I relied with a joke and the conversation only lasted a couple minutes.

We sent memes to each other like every other day revolving around our ‘relationship’ and the whole rapey uncle thing. And then just under a week ago I think, we had a proper conversation like it wasn’t just memes and jokes. It still wasn’t anything too big but it lasted like an hour and was mainly about our parents and relationships with our family, grades and religion, cause she’s Jewish, kinda. But it was the first time either of us ‘opened up’ to each other and we both acknowledged that we did so, but we were both cool with it anyway.

And In a new gc, we’ve become more of friends than 2 people joking to each other I feel, even though that’s all we do. Like she seems like a genuinely good person and Over the last like week or 2, she’s started talking about relationships more. Like what she wants and shit. She hasn’t broken up or something recently, or at least to my knowledge, and I don’t think anything has ‘sparked’ it, and cause I’m a teenage boy going through puberty who’s never been in a relationship, I think it’s cause she has a crush on me.

But the thing is, I don’t really see ‘us’ working. It’s pretty much only cause she lives in New York and I live just outside of London, so it would be a pretty big long distance thing with no real in between to meet. Like I said, I’ve never been in a relationship, or at least a proper one, and dorm what she’s told me, she’s only had hookups. Not like sex or anything, but like ‘one night stand’ type things. Idk America and England culture are pretty different so idk what the norm is over there.

But like, if it weren’t for the distance, I feel like we could work, but it’s just, a long distance relationship being my first and it being with someone I don’t even know if I have feelings for just doesn’t seem, doesn’t seem like the right way to go for me.

Any help is appreciated, thanks",20May2020,1
58,"I'm 16 and a junior in high school. I have a lot of trouble with school work. At the beginning of the year I started to make a turn around, was getting 80s and 90s but ever since school closed down everything has gone downhill again. I was mostly staying afloat by mindlessly filling out my work and getting a lot of help from teachers and classmates anyway, so having to do all of it myself now is nearly impossible or so it would seem. 

I find it incredibly hard to stay motivated when I'm studying a topic that I don't find interesting, when I do find something interesting I can drive headfirst into it and be the most knowledgeable person in the room on the topic, the problem is not many things interest me. Sometimes it isn't even a matter of motivation or forcing myself to just do it. It's like my mind refuses to process things sometimes if that makes any sense.

I have tried to learn a trade through a program that our school offers but I hated that just as much, I didn't fit in (I don't really fit in with anyone honestly), and I didn't like the work I was doing. I wish I could just study a few topics that I want to be good at and then get my high school diploma but there is no way around this. I don't know how they can expect me to juggle so many different subjects especially when some of them don't interest me in the slightest.

Most of the jobs I would be interested in require me to go to college. I can't go to college if I can't even pass high school. I don't know what to do. It feels like I'm expected to do all of these mundane, poitless things instead of pursue my passions. Its like I'm forced to either try and make money doing something I hate or try to pursue what I like but be setup for failure by all of the unnecessary extra shit they make me do on the side.

What am I supposed to do? It feels like I've tried everything, I've been given just about every version of the ""if you don't do this you won't be successful"" speech and I still can't figure my shit out. How do I find something I want to do for a living without being expected to juggle 300 other things on the side?",20May2020,1
59,"Everyday I walk around like nothing is bothering me but deep down I have all this rage and anger bottled up. I’m pretty calm laid back person but when I get mad I bottle it up.

Maybe 8 months ago I got into a fight and I never felt so good in my life after. Even though I got hit a couple of times. It was as if everything that was bothering me was gone and off my back, I never felt better after that fight. Fighting is wrong in my opinion and should only be for self defense. I wouldn’t want fighting to be a coping mechanism for my frustration because that’s not good. I lift weights and it helps a-little bit but not much. So that’s why I’m here for some advice!

65,"Why don’t good guys get what they want from a girl. 

I look above average. I am a super nice guy(I’ve got references lol) 

I never get anywhere with any girl. 

I dated one girl but she later told me she had extremely low self esteem and goes through major depression so just dated me because hooking up and being cared for felt good to her. But she never loved me apparently. 

I don’t know when Or if I’ll find a girl I’d love. 

I already did find someone I’d want to be with. She’s my best friend and I’ve been into her for over a year and asked her out and told my feelings thrice so far and she has always said she sees me nothing more than a friend. 

I’m still friends with this girl and she keeps dating other guys and I can’t handle it anymore and she’s literally my only friend lately. 

I had other friends but since I moved to this country recently not possible to stay in touch with overseas friends coz distance makes everything harder and they start to give up right. 

As for friends in this country, I couldn’t make any. The few I made moved to different cities and states and not in touch anymore. 

Now I have no way to make good friends. 

I basically feel depressed and I want just want to die. Literally I just want everything to end. 

Because I can’t handle rejection any longer. I know it’s not worth it and people say I’ll find someone else. But I keep seeing tons of people around me including my crush/ best friend who keeps finding dates every now and then and has her fun. 

I’m already in my late twenties and I don’t want to wait any longer just hoping I’d find someone amazing. 

Because think about it even if I find someone after a year or two or maybe after for years what good will that do. She will have slept with tons of guys already and what’s the point of me being with such a girl anyway. I’m not being a sexist. I don’t like the idea of sleeping with random girls and and having time pass girls in my life. I’ve wanted serious stuff in my life and my best friend and I are perfect for each other but she just wants to sleep with random guys. 

I don’t like that about her. I don’t want that. I want her to be with me. 

But again I can’t be with her coz she doesn’t want to. But why wouldn’t she?

I’ve been nothing but calm confident nice intellectual flirty helpful thoughtful and all the good things that a girl would want I have it. 

I don’t know what to do. I really want this girl. And I’m not able to handle this anymore. There’s literally no one I can talk to about these things. 

Someone please help me. I need to know. I want her. But she doesn’t want me. I’m going crazy literally. I can’t eat can’t sleep can’t work properly. I want to end it all because no one will ever love me.",20May2020,1

She’s been in a relationship for most of the time anyway so neither of us ever made a move on the other.

But recently, we were both added to a gc by another friend, and we’ve been talking a lot in that. She’s constantly jokingly insulting me and I either insult her back or turn it around and make a joke. It’s all fun though and we both like each other. But like, she really only ‘targets’ me in the gc, like she never goes after anyone else. Tbf she has known me the longest and only knows me and one other person in the chat, but she sent a pic of her DM’s and showed that she talks to at least on other person from the chat outside of the gc.

We’re in another gc together with completely different people and nearly whenever she sees that I’ve seen the messages she tags me and says hi but that’s about as far as our conversations go in that chat. We did used to play roblox with each other every now and then but I was really busy at the time so I could never really join and now she doesn’t invite me anymore.

My room is a mess, everything feels like a chore, I’m putting on a bit of weight, I’m hardly going outside, I’m becoming anti social and I just can’t be assed to do anything.

I’m a bartender so my job is still locked down at the moment, I’m finding it hard not going out and seeing friends and the gym is closed, I guess that’s the Covid related stuff. But even before Covid I’ve just always been so lazy, and I can get myself to do something good one day and then I just let go of it.

Next year I want to start a degree, I think it’s something I’ve been thinking about for a long time but have always been scared to try something new and it’s an industry I’m extremely passionate about and after speaking about it to my mum and partner I felt very certain it was something I wanted to pursue and put my life into. But I can’t even get myself to work on a portfolio for it at the moment. I’ve been to university twice before, have no problem with the knowledge or passing tests or whatever, it’s doing the work and keeping up attendance that screws me over. I’m just scared of repeating this again with this course.

Also recently it’s come to the point where my mum has been relying on me to swim the dog, usually we will drive down there together but I don’t drive so I walk her which I usually don’t mind, but I just feel shit and don’t want to go all the way there, I’m unfit when it comes to running and shit but I’m more than fine with walking however long distances, but I just don’t want to and I’ve just been taking her around the block the last few days just so I can get back to bed quicker. It’s getting to the point where people and my beloved dog are being neglected by my behaviour.

How do I make myself a better person?! I have all the ideas in my head, I’m not stupid, I know how I want to be, and I know people say just do it, but it just doesn’t work for me.

73,"Huge story I’ll try to compress it as much as possible. 

I’m in the military, during my job school I had the highest scores in a few years. People thought I had a “bright” military career ahead of me in my field. Disaster struck as soon as I got to the fleet. 

It’s been a couple of months and I barely started doing my job. Division, the “top top” guys, have liked my work I guess. They started to push for me to become an NCO. (Promotion in rank) 

Me on the other hand, I really don’t want to. I have a couple of reason. 

Remember the disaster? I was diagnosed with epilepsy a few months back but it’s been going for about a year now. My mental health has been deteriorating rapidly ever since. My chain of command has been so crappy regarding my heath issues. Like most days it’s legit hard to get out of bed or do anything. How am I going to be an NCO? On top of that, I feel like if I do get promoted they’re gonna hold it up against me to try to be like “don’t make us regret it” and as is, I’m already majorly depressed how tf am I supposed to get my shit together?

Another thing is, I didn’t earn in. I’ve been in the fleet for a years and out of those 12 months I barely started doing my actual job for about 3 months because division finally gave us the green light for me to do 65% of my job (the other is impossible to do without clearance which I cannot get with epilepsy) 

Then, I’m already getting separated. I’m on LIMDU which means I can’t do the CFT, PFT, swim qual, rifle or pistol qual, literally anything. How tf am I gonna pick up like this?

Everyone wants me to pick up NCO, my ssgt, gunny, my cpl, other cpls at the shop etc which is why they’re making me go to this NCO promotion panel. (Amongst other things) I keep telling them I don’t want to pick up cpl but they just keep shoving that rank down my throat. 

Tomorrow is the thing and  people keep telling me different things. Some day I don’t have to go, others tell me it’s negative paperwork if I don’t go, others say “maybe” like holy shit",20May2020,1
74,"After my mom died in 2009, my sisters and I moved a state away with my Great aunt and Uncle. My grand aunt (83) was always very controlling when it came to how me and my sisters looked. We didn’t have ANY say when it came to how we dressed or how our hair was done. It was always a “my way or the highway.” Our home was always full of arguing but we also had some good times too. My aunt opened up savings account for me, and each of my sisters. And of course fed us and clothed us.

While I appreciate this, she claims “no one else in the family would’ve done that for you all”, like she’s some sort of God sent. After I had a miscarriage in December 2018 which ended up with me in the hospital a month and on life support twice, she’s held it over my held to this day. There have been countless arguments about my hospital stay. 

I’m suffering so deep from it and she just talks about it like it was such a hassle to come visit me (I was in a hospital 2 hours away and she had to get her cousin to drive her). Had I not been “screwing” I wouldn’t have ended up pregnant, then she goes to say how she waited for years until she was married to have sex. 

She also compares me to her granddaughter who is a couple years younger than me. She tells me that she works two jobs and has a car of her own (while I do not). And it has made me loath my cousin because I see her as being better of an adult than me. Some people tell me just to go in my room and shut her out but I’m not allowed to keep my room door closed because I don’t “pay bills.” 

My aunt has been my “mother” since I was 10 years old, and had done everything for me and now at 21, I’m over this emotional torment. I feel horrible that I feel this way and that I’m calling her “toxic.” It’s not point in even discussing this with her because she’ll say if I don’t like it I can leave.

79,"“He smiled understandably. Much more than understandably. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in live” -The Great Gatsby

I was scrolling threw my pictures and this is one quote I sent my friend, let’s call her X, that I really really cared for. We were reading this book and school and I felt it related to her. I would send her poems and journal entries I wrote about her. She was honestly the reason that I was motivated to get up and go to school everyday. (18F. We met in junior year when we were 16). She told me she was one of my closest friends. We both opened up to each other about so many things. I felt important and cared for, the way she looked into my eyes and everything she said to me. Even simply having her there to listen.

I’m straight, but honestly, I’ve debated whether or not I had some feelings for her because I thought about her 24/7...so with her not responding at all, not caring (she did this to another mutual friend who viewed her as really close), I was obviously deeply upset. She literally puts no effort in. She barely talked to me once we weren’t in the same class anymore, except when I saw her and approached her.

It deeply upset me. But still, I valued her time so much. I saw her as a true friend. It is rare that I get that attached to people. But she got me. Or at least I thought she did. She listened to all my philosophical questions, my curiosities. She gave me so much confidence in myself and brought so much joy and gratitude to my day.

Anyways, I was so upset with her not responding to me (this has been going on for months btw, and I know it’s obvious that she does not see me as a friend), that I just said you know what screw it. It’s quarantine, we’re leaving next year for college, and knowing her I’m never seeing her again in my life because she won’t ever try to. I sent her texts saying that she was one of my closest friends and that I missed her and that it honestly felt like a huge loss to me. She responded very simply a few times. Then I said “I think I may have maybe liked you as more than a friend. Maybe that’s why I care more than you do” or something along those lines.

By the way she opened up to me about liking girls and etc. She admitted that she flirted with me earlier on when we were friends and talked. Anyways, that’s not to say she ever liked me or I liked her. Because she didn’t. And I don’t think I did but it’s possible. Basically she never responded and it’s been two weeks. It felt like a huge let down. I spill myself out to her, I give her my all. I can be so caring and invested. And it’s like talking to a robot who responds rarely. It’s like talking to someone who’s there, but isn’t anymore.

I feel angry. And I feel stupid. Also, I’m starting to feel a similar level of emotional attachment with my therapist (in terms of thinking about her a lot, imagining me telling her things/her reactions, wondering about her life). I worry about when I lose her in my life (I’ve been seeing her for about 6 months, but going to college in another state next year). I feel ashamed of having this level of attachment-it started recently-like during quarantine. And I honestly think that it’s partially because I’m very bored, and also because I’ve opened up to her more about very personal stuff. Also I just love her personality.

But I know what’s happening. I’m getting attached. And it’s similar in a way because she’s my therapist-I feel connected to her strongly like I did to X, but there’s a boundary there-a distance. I feel like I will never find someone who genuinely cares about me and is so very close to me and who I actually enjoy talking to. I do have a boyfriend and a best friend who are very close to me, but for some reason I don’t feel that level of emotional connection with them and I’m just kind of “used to them”. Whereas in these situations, I feel like I can’t exist without them, and that they are my motivator and purpose for the time being. How do I deal with this?",20May2020,1

83,"Hi, I needed some advice for my decisions when it comes to college. I am a transfer student. I currently live in NYC and there aren’t any colleges with an animal/equine science major within my state. I was accepted to DelVal, the University of New Hampshire, Becker College, and Cobleskill. Let me start off by saying that I’m very anxious and scared of going to a school out of state. I’ve never been away from my pets and my family, we have a very close knit family. I received a scholarship for all of the schools except UNH. I have horrible social anxiety and it often destroys any prospects I’d like to have in the future. One of my pets offers a lot of emotional support for me but I will be unable to bring her unless I rent out an apartment near the school, which is obviously equally as terrifying because I’ll have to find a way to get to school on time in an area that’s not familiar to me and I’d have to get used to living by myself.  I’m afraid it’s going to take an enormous toll on my mental health as well. I am going to list some pros and cons for each school and I’m hoping someone can suggest some ideas for me so thank you in advance. 
UNH is my top choice, I like the majors and the gen ed requirements for this school. It’s big enough for me to blend in with the crowd. The only cons are the school is about 4 hours away from home, the snow might be an issue, and I am unsure of how the capstone requirement works. According to an email I sent out, I was told that “completing a senior thesis is required for all Honors students but completed by many other students who engage in research/independent projects)” but when I had watched a video entailing all the details of the college, they said the capstone requirement is required for all students. Another issue would be housing, I’ve heard that the dorms are insanely tiny, expensive and that it’s hard to get any sleep at night due to the fact that it’s somewhat of a party school. If I were to dorm there I’d probably get a single room but as I’ve said, I’d rather take my cat along with me but that’s not allowed so I would have to find some off campus housing. The other issue is the size of the campus, I’m unsure of how I’d be able to get from an apartment to the campus and two, I’m worried about the sheer size of it because as I said I wouldn’t know how to get from point A. To point B. I was never able to visit the school due to this whole pandemic. However, it looks like my only choice is to try to get an apartment since nothing is available on campus.
Delval seems like an amazing school, it’s very close to home, and I got a scholarship for it. The cons for this school are the general ed requirements and the E360 requirements which makes me feel a bit uneasy. I’ve already taken a gap year off due to family issues and I’d like to graduate as soon as possible without having to take a multitude of courses that aren’t related to my major such as speech classes. Also, I applied to this school with an equine science major but I received a letter in the mail telling me that I had to take a video of myself riding as an requirement. All the stables in NYC are closed due to this pandemic and I missed the deadline due to this as well. The school is a private institution and it has a 14:1 ratio when it comes to students to teachers. I’m very nervous about the overall size of the classes considering they’re very small.
I received a scholarship for Becker but I’ve heard that it’s not the greatest school out there and if anyone has any other things to say about this school, please do let me know.
I received a scholarship for Cobleskill as well which isn’t as close to home but as I’ve said I’m very unsure of this school as well.
I’m sorry if this is all over the place and if it sounds a bit pathetic and/or if I sound very picky. I’d like to be close to home, have nice options when it comes to dorms or apartments, and have a program that suits me. Any information/advice regarding the schools or the animal science major for any of these schools would be very helpful! I apologize in advance if I’ve made any grammatical mistakes. I have less than 10 days to enroll in a school and I am running out of time. I’ve already posted this in another forum on a college site but I’d like more opinions on it. Once again, thank you in advance. I apologize if this posted on the wrong thread.",20May2020,1
85,"We signed into a farm land mortgage together about some years ago.  I wanted to buy solo but was pressured into buying it together with my brother.  The family was having a hard time watching our rented ground disappear forever and wanted buy up everything we could afford.

I am starting to feel like I can't work together anymore.  Years ago we did not see much of eachother, but now that my parents are trying to take a less active role in the business we work together a lot more.  Oftentimes when I think about working together I get so stressed out I start uncontrollably dry heaving.

I don't know how to do anything else and would like to buy him out and go independant, but I fear the ongoing consequences down the road because I will not be involved in the main part of the family business.

Does anyone on here have experience working on a multigenerational farm?  with siblings?

89,"I know what you might be thinking. Lazy? A bit. Not with work though. I left college because i was forced to do a course i didn't want to do. I wanted to leave to do an apprenticeship and complete my GCSE maths (which i failed first time). The only qualifications i have are GCSE's Btw. The college wouldn't let me leave so i faked being depressed so they would actually let me leave and let me do what i wanted. So i did. Got an apprenticeship in HR and it payed a fortune for an apprenticeship. I was told i was doing well and i was well on track for getting my CIPD level 3. The office was small and could only fit 2 people and that was the whole of HR for all of the UK which had 6 offices full of people. over 250+ total and i had to keep that up plus assist on reception since the receptionist was part time. The reports i got were great with only minor things to change plus i was doing well at college. One day i got pulled into the financial directors office who isn't even my boss and he fired me on the spot. Gave me no reason for why i was fired nor did i get did i get an actual reason. I went to the college and told them and they said to me that in the reports i was "" Aggresive, Didn't listen, Not interested "" Which was NOT in my original reports. I went and claimed for false dismissal and got denied because i was fired before my 6 month period. Which basically means they can fire me at any point however they require a reason for it. Their reason i found was not legal therefore they lied to the college who recieves the funding for my apprenticeship and let me tell you they were useless. They actually fired me to replace me with someone else in the office instead of moving us to a larger office. I was untrained so obviously i can't do a lot of the things my supervisor could and it held her back. So instead of giving us a bigger office they lied to the college and fired me to replace me with someone else already in the company. How do i know this? BECAUSE I INTERVIEWED HIM FOR THE POSITION. Under the impression we were getting a larger office. I was lied to and thrown out and couldn't even claim any compensation for it. Ever since i haven't returned to my local college because they force me to do subjects by saying they are full even if i apply early and the nearest college that is good is over 17  miles away and i don't drive.

I have no qualifications, no job, a massive stomach and nobody to talk to outside of family and GF. I've applied for jobseekers allowance so i can at least have the money to get a haircut when i get an interview but i don't want to be thrown into a job that i'll either hate or has barely any progression. I found that office jobs btw are absolutely terrible so im not going for one of those. Don't get me wrong but ""Take what you can get"" are not the words of wisdom im looking for.  I want a future i can enjoy and i don't even know what im good at. Its been slowly eating away at me for months and i can't take it anymore. How am i meant to get a job when this is over?

As time went on we started getting really invested in it, starting factions, waging wars, making non aggression pacts, creating and breaking alliances. 

Today one of my good friends and I had a bit of a squabble after I killed a wolf he was trying to tame. We'd been playing for twelve hours at that point (something I would never have dreamed of doing before quarantine as I'm a more casual gamer) and he got really heated. As a result of an ongoing dispute between our faction and some of my crazy dutch friends, I had to go looking for a guerilla fighter in the Nether. My friend stranded me in there and threatened to kill my pet chicken if I did not say s statement in which I would apologise and ask him to kill the chicken. 

I refused and eventually made my way back, after promising to open the gates for another group made up of my British friends who had been raiding us, and  made my way to my buddy's other dog.

Now the problem here is, I don't get any money in quarantine, the financial situation with my parents isnt that good either, I offered to get a job so I could help but I was denied, they said basically finish hs and then do whatever you want. The internet is like a safe place for me and I have been really stressed ever since my laptop broke. I don't know if I can handle another month or two without it, I don't have anything to do in the meantime, didn't really had the motivation to do anything either. Should I repair my old crappy laptop instead of buying the new one? I would have something to play on but like I said, it's a bad laptop so it can't run most games, I would also probably be stuck with it for many months to come. On the other hand I could just try to suck it up for 1-2 months until I get the 150$ for my new one, I would have something decent to play on and I wouldn't have to worry about stuff like not being able to run indie games and what not.

97,"Context: Im currently 16 years old and I’m going into my junior year of high school. I live with my Mom Dad and sister who are all religious and believe in God. Me however doesn’t believe in God and am an atheist. I haven’t confronted my parents about my atheism because I’m afraid of how they’ll react. On top of that, I like listening to a lot of music that have explicit lyrics and once again I haven’t told them about that because from experience they get genuinely disgusted from hearing those type of lyrics and bad words in general. I also tend to use profanity when I’m not around them as that’s how I choose to express myself and communicate but I got in trouble one time where they told me this was a profanity free household and that no one in the family should use vulgar language. I constantly feel a sense of fear that one day they will find out about this other side of me that’s very different from how I act in front of my parents. I’m naturally very humorous and always love to crack jokes but my family aren’t always accepting of my humorous personality and whenever they’re in a bad mood they’ll shoot my jokes down and it’ll always put me in a bad mood. I always here that in order to achieve happiness, you should cut out all the negative people in your life but I dunno how I could do that with my own family. Now don’t get the wrong idea, they don’t abuse me, they still feed me and put a roof over my head and I can tell they still love me which makes me even more confused as idk if I’m just being selfish or what.

99,"I want to know if I'm justified in ending this friendship or if I should try to work thru the issue. 
Friend K stated her family member M wanted her to come visit out of state , K stated M was supposed to buy a plane ticket for her but COVID hit and since M worked in a hospital K hadn't been able to contact them. K was very upset stating she had to get to M right away or M would be upset. K asked me for the funds and said when she spoke with M next she'd have M reimburse me.
At the time this was happening I was very sick and admittedly not in the best frame of mind to be making decisions like this. I have lent money to friends before and for larger sums like this I usually ask for a written agreement to be signed. I did not in this case, too sick and stressed to think straight. I lent K the money with the understanding that I would be reimbursed later that week. 
K gets on the plane and instead of going to M she goes to another state to visit a friend. Red flag. The week passes and I ask for an update. K is stating she can't get ahold of M. I ask again the next week. K stated she and M had a fight and M doesn't want her to come now, M is upset K flew to another state and took the risk of exposing herself to COVID instead of coming straight to M. K states she thinks she may just come back home. I ask for another update. K states she's trying to get a personal loan as she's still fighting with M. I'm beginning to understand that I wont be paid back and beginning to question K's story that M wanted her at the house on a certain date but didn't bother ensuring a ticket was purchased. I dont speak to K for a few more weeks. I ask again about the $, she states she's waiting for her stimulus check now and will use that to pay me back. I have no hope of getting it back and I'm okay with this. What upsets me is that at any point K can just own up and say ""I cant pay you back, what can I do to make this right"" but hasn't, I'm concerned she may have lied to me and that M never agreed to purchase a ticket for her and that K duped me. I'm feeling suspicious because K had a falling out with another family member before she left, the family member accused her of stealing (this came out after I sent her the funds) I'm unsure if I should drop the friendship or talk to K about what I'm feeling and try to salvage our 5 year friendship.",20May2020,1

103,"So my girlfriend and I have been together for a little over a year at this point, and we’ve been friends since high school. We started hooking up, and then eventually decided that we wanted to be a real thing. Before we started hooking up, she hooked up with a few guys, did some shit with some others, sent some nudes, all that stuff. And even when we started hooking up she really for the most part stopped doing stuff with other guys, physically all the way. Now when we first started getting together this stuff really didn’t bother me, but as we went on it started to get to me more and I find myself constantly thinking about it at the worst times. What makes it worse is that I know a lot of details, I ask questions and they got continuously more like specific and she’s open and honest and wants me to feel better so she tells me. So I always end up picturing it and knowing that other guys have had those experiences and can say that they did that with my girlfriend gets to me. Especially because one of the guys I hate and we went to high school with him. She always tells me I’m definitely the best she’s had in bed and reassured me whenever I need it but I still find myself picturing it and just imagining it. It comes and goes in waves but I can never seem to just get rid of it and it sucks, and it’s not like I WANT to think of these things, they just show up randomly. It sometimes got to the point where I couldn’t even watch porn without being like “damn she did that with some guy”. I don’t know why I do it but I do. Does anyone have any advice on this? I’ve researched every where and just cannot seem to figure out anything that helps. If anyone has any questions please ask, I’m willing to do anything to stop this.

104,"To start out this story and/or vent, I have Aspergers and ADHD. One of my most notable qualities of both of these is I have hyperfixations, special interests in simpler terms. When I find something I like i can REALLY get into it to the point where it absorbs part of my life and becomes another source of feelings. 

In the past it would always be one specific thing but as I've improved with my mental disabilities, I'm able to have multiple hyperfixations that are kept in a strange balance, where some are greater and some are lesser, and the greater and lesser interests can shift between each other, so a greater interest can become lesser even if it's more recent and a lesser interest that may be from longer ago can become a greater interest again.  


Now, to the issue. Not so long ago one of my lesser interests started to move up to the greater status, that interest being Cookie Run, a mobile game that has grown pretty popular in the U.S. I've been playing it for about 3 years now, and I have some of the korean comics, it's my only merchandise for that interest and I'm happy to have it, even if I can't understand it as I don't know korean. Since Cookie Run has been growing more popular, they've been putting out more merchandise than can now be directly shipped to the US, and recently, they announced a t-shirt event where the most voted characters would be given shirts! This went well and they were released on the official shop on the 13th, and were announced to only have pre-orders open until the 19th, which is less than a week.

Another one of my symptoms attributing to my ADHD mainly is I'm not very good at scheduling or remembering dates, so today (the 19th) I finally remembered that I wanted one of the shirts for my birthday, which is next thursday. Even though the shirt would arrive a few weeks after as it would be coming directly from korea, I would still be happy with it, especially since I can't celebrate my birthday with anyone this year really.

This is where a big downside of the sale comes, they only gave a *date* to when the sale ended, but never a time. Devsisters, the company that created Cookie Run, is a korea based company, so they obviously run on Korean time zone. However, there's also a few more time-based issues with this, which includes; **1.** The shirts were only shipping to the U.S. because of the coronavirus pandemic. **2.** Cookie Run has also used GMT and UTC time zones to post update times for the game. Considering all three of these issues, I decided to contact them on twitter to ask around what time the sale ended, as they were fairly active on twitter at least daily, I figured it wouldn't be hard to get an answer. I never got one. Around the time I asked them, the shirts were still on sale. The reason why I didn't order one THEN was because my mother was ordering it for my birthday and couldn't order it from work because she was busy, so we agreed to order it when she got home. 

Devastation struck when that time came though, because when we got on to order, the had pulled the shirts off the shelves suddenly. Neither of us were expecting it and she felt bad that I wasn't able to get one, but I simply put on a smile and said they may sell again someday. However, I'm truly wrecked over this, I even cried a bit too. I don't think it's that I missed out that bothers me, I think it roots deeper to the special interest and that even though I have merchandise, a shirt is sort of different from what I already have, a shirt of my special interest means I can present to people that ""hey! I like this thing!"" which isn't easy for me to say with words. 

Basically, from what I can at least put together myself, I'm feeling an invalidation of my special interest because I wasn't able to get something I truly did want for it. I may be wrong, maybe you guys have a better way to word it, I'm kinda an emotional mess right now so I'm not the best at figuring it out myself.

110,"Hi.. 

So about 1 hour ago I got into a physical fight with my girlfriends best mate. I’ve known him for 3 years and I would consider myself actually being best friends with him too. I’m gay and he is also gay. We do sometimes slash at times but we do get on.

Anyway.. long story short - tonight we got into a ‘physical fight’ he probably could have forced himself a lot harder bearing in mind I’m 5ft1 and he is 6ft.. but it was more or so a hands of neck and a bit of shoving and I think I grabbed his glasses.

But it was intense and emotional because the three years we have known each other we’ve never had such an intense argument or even laid a finger on one another.

The fight was essentially about me disagreeing with some form of terminology that existed within in the gay world and I said about 2 times that I was not dismissing that it does not exist (bcus I’m fully aware that it does.. btw it was about this idea of a top and Bottom). I was just simply saying I didn’t agree with the terminology Bcus there’s so many meanings. I don’t know what the hell happened but there was drink involved and they just KEEP assuming that as soon as my opinion is different to there’s they act as if I’m some sort of devil and get really aggressive and patronising. It’s almost like they don’t really listen to me willing I had to repeat myself 2 times and they still didn’t understand the fact I DID understand top and bottom was indeed a thing. 

Anyway.. yeah I’m a bit weirded out about the whole thing. I went for a walk afterwards to cool down and my girlfriend was worried. I expected her to be really angry when she got back but she was acting more loving towards me. But then we discussed it and started disagreeing again bcus she kept assuming I was ‘disgracing the gay culture’ which I wasn’t at all. I just simply didn’t like the wording for it. Which I feel i have every right for an opinion for???? Surely?

She eventually went to bed and said we’d talk about it in the morning bcus she was shattered.

But I can’t just help sitting here and going over and over the whole thing in my head Bcus that’s never happened before. We are currently in the process of all trying to find a house together for next year and I worry he will turn round and not want to live with me and my gf (which means I was the problem in their friendship) but at the same time I’m not a MASSIVE fan of wanting to live with him. He can be negative !

We are in lockdown together for another 4 weeks and I don’t want it to be toxic. I also don’t want to ruin my girlfriends friendship with him. Yeah.. maybe his and mine friendship might be ruined a lil bit but honestly I just can’t be bothered anymore. I just don’t know. I’m just a lil confused. I’d appreciate any form of advice / wisdom.

111,Does anyone have any advice on how to get through this weird time? I just “graduated” yesterday and I have nothing to do while being stuck in a tiny house with my overbearing parents. I’ve been done with school for about three week now and I’m going nuts. I can’t find a job that isn’t retail that is willing to hire a teenager just for the summer. I want to move out so bad.

113,"My mom told me the other day that she’s never met my brother’s MIL, FIL, or anyone from that family. In fact, she doesn’t even know any names, phone numbers, addresses. My brother isn’t allowed to tell her why she can’t know them beyond “my wife is a private person” and “her family is kind of conservative”.
...
MIL and FIL didn’t go the courthouse when they eloped, and my mom thought she’d finally meet them then. This was not something any of us thought was going to be a condition of their marriage, but my brother isn’t doing anything about it. He and I don’t talk very much to begin with, but my mom sounded really sad about this, and this really rubbed me the wrong way.
His wife married into our family. I know it’s not my marriage, but it’s my mom. I know there are things about my family that a super conservative family maybe wouldn’t like, but she chose my family.
Should I try to get to the bottom of what’s going on or should I accept that this is just the way it is? How would you approach it?",20May2020,1
114,"Hi y'all. My first post here, so I apologize if I put it in the wrong category or something.

I'm a junior in college, and this semester has been really tough, for more reasons than just classes. My grandma who I was really, really close to passed away back in February, and the start of the semester was two days after she passed. In one of our last conversations, she told me to go back to school regardless of what happened to her. So I went back,  even with my other family members like my grandpa, aunt, and mom saying that they weren't sure if it was the right decision. I began the semester taking four full credit classes and three weekly quarter credits, plus the first job I'd have in college that I had worked really hard for. And then a little over a month into the semester, my campus closed because of Covid-19. I went back to live with my single mom again because of this.

Between my extracurriculars, the new job, the immense pain of losing someone who I loved so much, and dealing with the new challenge of juggling online classes and my responsibilities and close proximity to my mother, I've been having a really hard time. Long story short, my advisor who is also my professor, suggested I withdraw from her course, because I fell behind on some assignments and didn't finish the second half of the midterm. We worked out that if I could get two assignments done by a couple days from when we talked, I could stay in the class. Unfortunately, I didn't have it in me to complete the assignments, especially because one afternoon I was so taken by grief I couldn't think straight. So, my professor said I should withdraw or I would get an F in the course without a completed midterm. SO, ultimately, I withdrew on May 1st.

The problem is that I have yet to tell my mom that I've withdrawn from that difficult course, and I'd love your help on how to tell her. Some background on our relationship is that we get along fairly well, and I do love her a lot and I know she loves me. We laugh and enjoy doing similar things. However, she's prone to being angry in many ways. When we got in a bad fight in 2018,  I went to the college counseling services, and two of the workers there believe her to be emotionally abusive.

She cares a lot on how well I do in school, and she thinks my GPA of 3.4 is too low for her liking. While at home, she's wants to know my assigments in each class and over all wants to know what I'm up to with my college. That's all well and good, but it's when she sort of crosses the line that her wanting to be involved gets to be a problem for me.  When I was struggling in a math class last semester, after a while she called up the chair of the math department because she thought the professor of my class was making things too hard. But that's another story. Any way. I'm a 20 year old in college who shouldn't have her mom involved like that. But my point is I'm frankly terrified to tell her I withdrew from the class. I always hear her on the phone bragging about how well I'm doing, and I know that she'll both be extremely upset and then angry at me for both withdrawing and not telling her sooner. I've put off telling her because I'm so paralyzed by fear of what will happen. It's finals week, and grades will be out soon, and she'll want to see mine. She'll see a Withdraw for a grade where that class should be, and I'm not sure how to handle that. I know she'll be upset that I've lied to her and I feel so guilty.

Thank you so much for reading. Any advice is appreciated, specifically if it's how to go about the situation or about how to word my telling her.",20May2020,1
115,"I think I need some advice.. or guidance. I'm lying in bed at the moment and truthfully.. ugly, dark thoughts are crossing my mind. I know and recognize that they're a very extreme reaction but despair is an abyss that doesn't obey sensibilities. 

Edit: upon writing all this, I realize I wrote a bloody lot. The melancholy I also felt when I started writing this has also subsided a bit.. I'm thankfully able to bounce back from sad thoughts readily. Nevertheless.. I still do feel lost and can use some guidance.

So some background information.. I'm a 31 M, living in Ontario. I live with my mother and sister in a pretty decent house and money isn't TOO much of an issue. I'm pretty introverted so I'm fortunate to say I have a good social circle. I'm also employed as a screening officer at the airport so I make decent money (though I'm laid off atm)

All that's nice.. but perhaps the weight of existentialist reflection is setting in and, with that, a feeling of unavoidable inferiority. In short, I turn 32 in a few weeks and I feel like I haven't achieved *anything*. This stems from the fact that I spent the first half of my 20s fumbling through a B.Sc. in Biology with nothing to show for it.. I underwent my first (and extremely toxic) relationship, and my father passed away from cancer during my first undergrad. I barely graduated with a skiiiin of my teeth and felt caught in a catch-22 of having graduated with a degree.. but not having a GPA needed to do anything further with it - especially it being Biology, about as vanilla as science can come. 

So I spent the rest of my 20s contemplating what to do while going from job to job.. nothing serious, and no movement up the career food chain.. KFC, Walmart, Cell phone retail. In my mind, I've always been academic oriented - I've always wanted to succeed academically and do something meaningful with a field of study.. so I never focused on moving up in companies.

Fast forward a couple years.. 2 years in college and 3 years more of university to the present day.. I've completed my second B.Sc. in Chemistry this month. This was gonna be it, my ticket to a graduate program and then a well paying job and career that I could support my family with and finally begin building a future towards..

.. and my grades fall flat. 2.9 GPA, not enough by many schools to get into ANY graduate programs. And I tried, by god I tried and broke my back to study.. I dunno if it's all in my head - I know I over think like hell and I must not have employed the right study techniques to really study chemistry (hell I feel like I remember none of it). At this point now, I feel like I have two useless degrees with nothing to show for it. No field experience (apart from a small coop position I had in college), no work experience to bounce back on. I feel like I wasted 10 years of my life to be back at square one of trying to figure out what to do.. only now I'm in my 30s and life is a LOT more serioud 

On top of that.. I'm seeing a girl (same age) for about 5 months now.. but she's hesitant to put a title on us and pursue things seriously.. because I dont have anything going for me. Her parents think she's wasting her time on me (not to mention a cultural bigotry..) and a part of me feels like they're right.. I'm not in a position to support anyone or begin to think about marriage and settling down. I like her a damn lot (I've told her shes it - the 'one') but I cant help but feel like I'm only wasting her time

Additionally, my mom has been suffering from a decline in mental faculties for the past few years.. dementia is starting to creep in. I can't afford to continue more go-no-where schooling at an undergraduate level. I feel like my future is really up in the air and it's become hard to shake the really destructive feeling of just wallowing in self pity and feeling sorry for myself. 

I've been applying for jobs every day and I did apply anyway for grad school. My pessimism tells me it won't go far.

Maybe this reddit post was more for a therapeutic venting than anything constructive.. I dont know what I'm seeking to come out of this. If you read this far.. thank you. My mood is pretty in the dumps and at this point, I just want a way out of this rut. I know I'm intelligent and capable of so much more than what I am.. but I feel like a curse is over me to underachieve and never go nowhere. 

Does anyone have any advice.. words of wisdom, similar experiences to share? I know this isn't the end of the world but.. I'm just tired of not truly achieving anything. I know GPA doesn't dictate ANY thing about an individual but the reality is.. this is how our archaic school system works.

i still have no idea what was in that pill. my suspicion after doing research is that it was a shit ton of lsd, perhaps mixed w DXM. i’m gonna send it to a lab to get it tested.

so here i am. it’s been about 5 days since i took what i thought was ecstasy. the intense, sickening visuals were the worst for the first 2 days. now though, everyday i get up i feel like total shit. the acid-like visuals are gone, but i just feel like i have a fever. i’m weak, my body aches, i have zero energy, and my reactions are delayed. i’m still able to hold conversations/drive, but i feel totally detached from reality. i feel like i’m living in slow motion, and when i look at things, everything just looks... off. people don’t look right. sometimes it feels like things shift/morph out of the corner of my eye. things are very hazy and it feels like everything i look at is alive, in a really strange way. sometimes i start feeling so sick that it’s like the world is spinning and i just need to take a break. i am less talkative and i just feel like an outsider. 

i’ve been eating well and getting plenty of rest. haven’t done any drugs since and i never want to do drugs again after that terrible experience. haven’t even had coffee! 

it’s important to note that i was convinced i would die the night that i took that pill, and i feel lucky to be alive. it was the worst thing i’ve ever experienced and i honestly think i’m scarred for life. 

i also have had anxiety, which i haven’t felt in years. i just always feel like i’m going to die. when i go to bed, i think i’m not going to wake up. i feel like i’m not safe. i’m very emotional. i will cry for absolutely no reason. i am super sensitive to light, sound, and pain. 

for example. yesterday i stubbed my toe. normally, i would’ve said “oh fuck” and kept on going. but in this new state of mind, i cried and dropped to the floor, curled up in the fetal position, and had an uncontrollable panic attack. it’s like my body can’t handle stress. 

i just want it to end. things are good in my life right now. i’m surrounded by love in my family and i am at peace with myself and the world around me. i’m not sad about anything. i just have this shit holding me back from enjoying everything in my life. like when people have conversations with me, i have to try very very hard to stay engaged and my reactions are delayed. 

it’s like i’m living in a shell. a shell of who i used to be. and i can’t even tell anyone. please help. if you read this, thank you so much for your time.",20May2020,1
117,"This is a long one, but please bare with me.

My wife is pregnant after about 8 months of trying, I've a good job and we're making our house into a home. The trouble is I am shitting myself about a couple of things, I've split them down to make it easier for me to explain.

1) My wife is roughly 7 weeks gone, we've been trying for 8 months to get pregnant and we are over the moon but we were in this position 5 years ago and suffered a miscarriage and it left us heartbroken. We are trying to do it properly, healthy eating, no stress and she is off work until July with all this shut down stuff so isn't lifting bags of ingredients (she's a baker so is lifting bags of stuff all the time). I'm just worried it will happen again

2) Im the main earner and started a new in February, a decent wage and an enjoyable place to work with an interesting work load. But I got put on to the furlough scheme in mid-march (I'm in the UK, the scheme is designed to avoid companies laying staff off by the government paying us 80% of our salary via our employer, who claims it back from the tax office), the company is only small and is losing customers at a fast pace. Being the last member of staff to join there is a good chance I'll be shown the door first. We only moved into our house in October, I get worried that I'll be out of work soon and we'll be struggling. We have roughly 3 months worth of outgoings saved up (mortgage, car payments, utilities and a balance allowed for food etc) but I still get concerned that we'll struggle. I like my house, we intend to raise our child here for the next 10/15 years. My wife gets a good wage but when she goes on maternity leave this will nose dive sharply so we can't rely on it to keep the roof over our heads. Since this pandemic stuff started we've re-done our budget and managed to cut £280 worth of stuff monthly which is going into savings. I'm an welder by trade but have also completed a degree in mechanical engineering recently so I would be confident I could get a job, but I may not be entitled to any sort of paternity benefits.

Family, friends and wife have been really supportive with me but I still worry. I don't know what to do with myself. I've been to the doctor who has offered me treatment via antidepressant drugs but I don't want to go down this route. I am speaking with a men's support network but I'm struggling like hell.

119,"I barely ask for anything because we already have enough things at home. I have memories of being a kid and hating to go clothing shopping with her because I felt like I couldn’t say no to something without feeling guilty. If I’d say I didn’t like something she’d go on and on about how pretty it is, how it’s something she would’ve wore when she was my age, if I’m sure I don’t want if, etc. I’d cave and say yes but later on she’d get mad that I don’t wear the clothing.


Same thing with grocery shopping. I’m not a fan of coffee, sweets(gives me a headache and makes me nauseous), am allergic to nuts, etc but still buys those things(as an example)When I don’t eat them, despite saying for years and years and years that I’m allergic to something or just don’t like a certain food, she’ll act like I’m ungrateful and it’s hurtful. I just don’t understand it. She buys so much stuff without asking herself if I, or anyone else in the home would enjoy what she buys and if we don’t, we’re made to be ungrateful.

120,So i’m 19 and am on summer break. I am taking two classes over the summer to get college credit for college. The past 3 summers I had worked at my school district doing outdoor work such as mulching and general landscaping type of work 40 hours a week. I enjoyed it because it was a pretty easy job and some of my friends worked their too. They weren’t hiring again this year because of budget cud’s due to covid so I decided to try and find another job. I wanted a part time job because of my summer classes so I decided to look for a similar job to what I had before and got a landscaping job for 12.50 an hour. I’ve only worked 2 days so far but today was a 9 hour day and i’m working again tomorrow. I know it’s only been two days but I feel like i’m already burnt out from it and I feel like I can’t go the rest of the summer like this. My classes haven’t started yet so it will only get more difficult when I have those as well. I have another friend who wanted to work there so I guess he could take my place but I still feel really bad about quitting. I feel like pussy for not being able to work a real job and I feel bad about the company owner for going through all the trouble to hire me just for me to quit. I don’t exactly need the money but it’s definitely nice to have to pay for college. I also feel like it would be almost impossible to find another job right now with the current economy.

124,"As background, I'm currently a sophomore in college majoring in Exercise Science. Since 5th grade I had wanted to go to medical school to go into orthopedics. After each semester it dawns on me more and more that realistically, I'm not sure I have a shot at getting in. I've also been wondering if it's something I really want anymore. In terms of not getting in, although I tend to finish my semesters with one or two As and one or two Bs, resulting in a 3.1 GPA thus far. But, I have had to retake 3 different classes which has really killed my morale (mainly math, I've never been good at it), along with my GPA. My worry is, I have yet to take the harder sciences (Organic Chem, physics, biochem) and realistically I'm not expecting myself to excel in those classes. The only subjects I've ever been naturally great in are anatomy and medical courses (I'm EMT and Phlebotomy certified). Otherwise, I have to work harder than the average student, and even then I tend to fall short. Coupling that with my decreased motivation and that I'm not enjoying the school I'm in just have really deflated my morale and outlook on everything. Anyway, to the point.

I'm still staying on the path to medicine, but I'd really like to have backups in mind. I know I have time, but I am someone who thinks ahead quite a lot and if I don't have plans in place it stresses me out. I've looked into tons and tons of various careers. The ones that popped out were careers like athletic training and exercise physiology. However, especially for AT, after much research, you work very long hours for not that much money. My problem is that some form of medical career has always been my focus. I've never been interested really in business (besides some investing on the side), math, computers, law, etc. I've always enjoyed learning about medicine and it's what I'm good at. That's where I need advice. I was hoping to try and have as many career options thrown at me as possible. Bonus points if it's good quality of life and nice salary.

I have of course dream jobs like opening a bar on a beach, but that's pretty unrealistic. I've also looked into working on cars and such but I've only recently gotten into that and it could really just be a phase. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I know that maybe on the surface this sounds kind of ridiculous but it's something that's really been a big stressor in my life, especially recently. Thanks in advance.",20May2020,1

127,"First time poster and on mobile.

Lockdown has been really rough so far, as one can imagine, and my parents, mostly my dad, have not been making it easy. I won’t say that I’m an angel, everyone makes mistakes of course, but I feel like I’m being punished for stuff that I either didn’t do or wasn’t a big deal. Mainly, the restrictions placed on my gaming. 

I don’t consider myself an addict by any means. I don’t spend every waking moment talking and thinking about games, nor do I game all through the day and night without pause. I just enjoy games a lot. They don’t see it that way. A few weeks ago when things were really bad and they kind of paused school for a bit to figure things out, I was playing games with my friends and siblings. The short version of what happened was that I would be on my computer all day doing school and then switching over to games when my work was done, whereas two of my siblings (10m and 6m) would play and beg to play games (mainly fortnite) every second they could. Parents did NOT like that and basically banned all games until further notice. They did lift the ban for any brother’s birthday, but after that it was back to the same. I tried talking to my friends for advice, and told my dad that my friends don’t think I’m a horrible person, but he just waved it off with “Your friends are dumb, I don’t want to hear anything about them.” 

This is not the only grievance I have with them either. My parents are the kind of parents who don’t believe in privacy until 18. They constantly pick at my faults and berate me in front of the rest of the family, they even have one of my sisters (14f) in on it. I share a room with my two aforementioned brothers and am not allowed to have my phone or any other electronic gadget in there at night. My MP3 player has even been under some scrutiny, and it doesn’t even have internet connectivity. My desktop pc that I built and paid for with my own hands has to stay downstairs on a desk that can be seen from all angles. I can’t have it to where my parents would have to walk around to see what I’m doing, it can only be where they can see and access it at all times. 

Did I mention the trackers? They’ve put that stupid porn filter thing Covenant Eyes on there (the one that can’t be uninstalled without generating a code and alerting them) and I’ve discovered that a new feature it has is taking screenshots of everything you do and scans it for “explicit content.” They put that on my phone and computer, and I’m not allowed to have any “unsecured” devices.

Now, I’m not saying I have a clean slate with internet stuff, but anyone who knows me knows that I’m not one to have a bunch of porn or even suggestive content in front of my little siblings. I don’t swear at all to anyone, clean language all around. But alas, I also happen to be something of an artist. And with that comes anatomy. They did one of their “raids” on my stuff and found some sketch practice of... shall we say, female torso anatomy, which didn’t go over well. They searched everything and found some other art tutorial things that were suggestive in nature but nothing too extreme. They deleted it, lectured me, all that stuff. They think I’m some pervert because I wanted to draw the female form correctly. 

90% of the hobbies and interests I have, they don’t approve of. When I get upset and call them out on their actions, they start justifying everything, getting defensive, and saying “but we still love you.” Because THAT makes everything better... Their favorite excuse? “Because we’re the parents/I said so/ you’re a kid.”  I’m 17 and am treated like an infant. 

I’m not diagnosed with anything that I know of, but I can tell you that I get really anxious when it comes to risqué computer stuff. Anatomy, drawing digitally, reading Reddit, everything I do they can see and track. And I hate it. I feel like I can’t draw the things I want to or connect with the people I want to when they, their software, and their pressure are always over me. It’s burned me out so much that my motivation for drawing vanishes when anyone comes up and says “whatcha drawing,” or “what’s that?” It seems stupid, but it’s like some sort of trust issue. It’s like I’m being repressed from being anything other than “the perfect little son.”

The conflicts and such go on and on, but now is not the time for that. 

My question is, how do I put up with this or get around them, if I can at all? Can I show them that I’m not a minion to project their shortcomings onto or something? Is it possible to get rid of the guilt the force on me to keep me in line?

Please help and let me know if there are clarification issues, I’m cutting YEARS of stuff down to fit here.",20May2020,1

She was two years younger than me, and we played  r6 siege along with another friend who had known her for a while. We played siege and whatnot for a few days, and I eventually asked for this girls Instagram, solely because I like hanging out with her and wanted an outside way to talk to her. My friend gave me her Insta, and I requested to follow her. She never accepted it, and right after this stopped hanging out with us. I think I may have scared her by attempting to follow her Insta, because we had not talked for very long. I also happen to have a pretty deep voice, but I still sound 14. I think she could have also stopped hanging out with us because I was really awkward in some conversations, but I don’t think that is the reason. I understand that it is much different online for young girls than it probably is for me. She didn’t have a problem taking with my other friend who introduced me to her in the first place, who has a deeper voice than me. I guess there is a possibility that she just didn’t wanna hang out for outside reasons, but idk.I don’t know what to do. I want to continue hanging out with this person, but when/if they join the party, they usually leave pretty quickly. I will also mention that I have a third friend who was really loud and obnoxious whenever she joined, but that did not seem to be a problem. What should I do?",20May2020,1

135,"Help!! I have very bad OCD and anxiety and they only thing that helps is being with animals. I used to have 4 cats and 2 dogs and my life was perfect with barely any ocd. Then one by one they died and it’s been a year since the last. But luckily I could still go to my horse riding barn and see horses so I was doing ok,, but not the best. Now I feel trapped and alone because in quarantine there are no animals and I want to die. But my parents think that since my brother is afraid of all animals under the sun, despite never getting hurt by them and having pets before and wanting to be a zookeeper, that his comfort is more important than my life. I need a pet. But they just dismiss me and say I’m faking when I say it’s worth my life. How do I make it so even though my brother is scared of animals that I can get one so that I don’t end up farther from life then anyone else. Please help!!

137,"As the title suggests - my wife and I are thinking about taking jobs in two different cities. We both received offers on the same exact day and we are now hit with this decision. When it comes to salary my wife would be making 3X what I would but the job opportunity would still be big for me. Part of the problem is that we have a toddler and I would have to be away from them many days out of the week. Additionally, both of our jobs would be incredibly demanding from a time perspective which could introduce obvious issues.

143,"So, I've recently read Death Of A Salesman by Arthur Miller. **Spoilers ahead for the play (even if it's like 40 years old)**, but essentially, the main character is named Willy. He has spent his entire life chasing riches in the sales industry, only to waste away his life. He cheated on his wife, Linda, which caused his son Biff to drift away from him. Willy also believes being well-liked is the key to the American Dream he so desperately wants, so he bases everyone off of that standard. Willy also looks up to his late brother, Ben, and lives his life regretting not going to Alaska with his brother. In the end, he is fired from his job, his dreams are ruined, and he commits suicide since he realizes he is more useful dead than alive.

I felt super uneasy after reading this play. Like, more uneasy than usual after reading a book. I couldn't pinpoint why but I think I have it figured out. **I am the literal reincarnate of Willy Loman**.

The resemblance (to me at least) is just uncanny. Both Willy and I have big ambitions that are unachievable for most. I have based my entire life off of being something *big* and getting a lot of money since I grew up in a really humble background. I'm not 100% on the route I'll take to get there, but all I know is that's where I wanna be. And while Willy thinks a person being well-liked is important, I've thought something similar. I've always thought that, if someone is persistent and charming enough, no matter what their field is they are bound to succeed eventually. I mean, it's just the way industry works, isn't it? Another big thing is that Willy constantly contradicts himself because he is so confident in his choices, and I've recently found the same. I normally go into an argument/conversation with someone with a very solid set of beliefs that I believe in. But as soon as I find that they heavily disagree with my beliefs and viewpoints, I backpedal and contradict myself to remain well-liked. It's like I'm so unconfident in my beliefs that I'm unable to fully stand behind them without backing down at the slightest hint of resistance. In fact, like Willy, most of what I've been taught came from my brother and I look up to him heavily, so I am especially prone to back down in any arguments on beliefs with him (he taught me many skills like guitar and programming, along with his philosophical views). Willy is also a bit of a womanizer, and while I'm nowhere near such, I can't see myself settling down with a family and setting my dreams aside. Just like Willy refuses to fully settle down at home with his family, and continues traveling as a salesman to chase his dreams. And finally, I'm sort of concerned that at certain points of the story where I was clearly *not* supposed to be impressed with Willy, I was still impressed. For example, when he is shown for the first time with his mistress, AKA ""the Woman"", I sort of thought he was successful at least in that way. I mean we're constantly taught that money and sex are the most important things to have. Not only was he making a mediocre living off of making sales (enough to support a family, sort of), but he was also able to charm girls on the side? Obviously it is immoral to cheat, especially Willy cheating on someone who stood by him for so long, but I couldn't help but admire some of Willy's qualities and that really scares me. I've always been a person with big dreams, that's all I've ever been sure about, but this story has made me question everything about myself.

TL;DR: I relate very heavily to a character in a play that ultimately ends up depressed, alone, and decides to off himself after every single dream he had was crushed due to his actions and beliefs as a person. I'm *really* scared that I'll end up just like him later in life, but I have no damn idea what to do to fix it before it gets to that point. I know I have a lot of time to fix it since I'm still a student, but I don't even know what to do. This is the first time I've ever felt myself experience a true personal crisis and fall into a bit of a depression. I know this may sound silly but the reasoning behind the play is very sound, and all analyses of the play attribute Willy's personality and behavior to his downfall in life. I *need* to fix something and I *need* help to know what to fix. Any advice or support is greatly appreciated!",20May2020,1
145,"So, I just wanted some input on this situation that I'm uncomfortable with. I think this probably calls for the whole backstory, so I'm sorry for the long post.

My mother has been married to my step-dad for 6 years. There was no sign of any physical abuse, but plenty of red flags. I'm 26, so I never lived with both of them, but I've been around them regularly because I'm close with my mom.
I noticed throughout their marriage that he was getting increasingly more controlling and verbally disrespectful. This became such a problem that we eventually could not get through a dinner without him cutting her off or trying to shut her up as she talked to us, her kids. 

It escalated dramatically when a few weeks ago, during an argument, he managed to break a few bones in her neck. She managed to call 911 and the police questioned my step-dad, but he lied and they believed him. They let him follow her to the hospital. The nurse, however, told him to leave immediately (thank you, kind nurse).
She called me when she got to the hospital and I took her back to my place when she was discharged.

She has been adamantly saying she will never go back to him and does not want to. However, he has been sending her messages non-stop about how sorry he is and that he knows he has problems. Over this past weekend, she has suddenly done a 180 and is open to giving him another chance conditionally. He must go through therapy and respect whatever boundaries are set in the process.

Today, she had their first video chat session with him and a therapist who specifically deals with abusive relationships. No other therapy session has happened for either of them. Now, she's telling me that the therapist gave them ""homework"" where they are supposed to have 2-hour face to face sessions twice a week that can be in the privacy of their own home.

That just sounds crazy to me. She hasn't stepped foot in their house or even seen him since the night of abuse. My mother said she was happy that the therapist said they cannot mention the possibility of her moving back in during these talks. However, she doesn't feel strange about going to their home alone to talk face to face.

Does this sound normal? Am I being crazy for feeling like this is insane?",20May2020,1

148,"I'm ending my junior year of high school rn. A couple of months ago, some dick at my school thought it would be funny to take and spread a pic of me looking at my crush's Insta. It didn't spread to the whole school, but it did go through a good number of people. A lot of people laughed at it for a week before forgetting about it and moving on. I was personally embarrassed by it for a day or 2, before letting it go and moving on as well. I didn't think much about it because I was too busy working hard in school and working towards getting my license. 

However, lockdown gave me a lot of time to really think and ruminate over what happened, and I'm frankly pissed off. Tbh I can see why that kid didn't mean anything bad behind it, but rather simply thought it was funny and decided to share it. Ik this because I was guilty of this too, as at beginning of the year, there was this video spreading of these 2 girls breaking out into a fight in the middle of the hallway, and I decided to share the video (I never took it, someone sent it to me) with a couple of buddies of mine because it was extremely funny, though I never meant any harm towards those girls. Anyway, that kid who took it, as well as other kids, told me that it was just a funny joke that didn't have any meaning to it. That kid who took it also told me that people take pics of him too, and its not that big of a deal. But whether or not he meant anything bad behind it doesn't matter, because I was offended by it since I was still embarrassed by it, and that embarrassment wasn't caused by me. Plus it made things really awkward between me and that poor girl (she is graduating this year, and I'm long over her now, so that part doesn't really bother me).

This wasn't bullying necessarily, because this only happened once, and was never a repetitive or ongoing thing, that kid didn't routinely do mean stuff to me, and plus the kid didn't actually have any bad intention behind it, but nevertheless it was a complete dick move. 

As I thought about this deeply during lockdown, I felt extremely pissed. This kid is smaller than me, and I have no problem breaking his nose, shoving him into a locker, or kicking him in the balls once quarantine is over (which may be a little while, but its gonna happen eventually). Or maybe find a way to get a nude pic of him and post it all over social media so that his life will be ruined forever, and will give him a taste of his own medicine. Plus this kid is in the same grade as me, and is gonna be a senior next year as well as me. Should I?",20May2020,1
149,"So this girl I’ve known for years and we recently been “dating” lost her grandma yesterday from complications of Covid. She’s been in a slump even before that because she’s recently “finding god” and she’s beating herself up over things she thinks she’s done wrong in the past. Then things got worse because we ended in a serious talk last night about our situation which I should have been smart enough to know that it was more to do about her grandmas passing and have not continued with our personal relationship argument. Today I tried to comfort her. One minute she’s ok, the next she doesn’t want me touching her. So I back off and let her sleep the day away. She wakes up feeling bad and I am not sure how to approach her or make her feel better so I just keep a bit of distance and try not to enter into another heavy topic. Well, this ends up as me “not caring” and she leaves. I’ve tried texting her to make sure she’s ok because she did text “you don’t care about me or care that I die”.

For some background on the situation, last semester, I (18F) met my friends at college, as I was a freshman. One them I met thru my new friends and seemed pretty cool, although he was a junior. We’ll call him Eric (23M). So it was all going well and stuff and then he asked me out, which was chill I just said no, I’m not into him. We hung out a little over break (we live about 45mins apart, so pretty close) and it just felt awkward. But whatever I can live with it. What made this situation very awkward is that he texted me (study abroad) that he liked me and if I ever change my mind let him know. And I said no again.

153,"I'll try to summarise this as short as possible, my friend who's now 19, dropped out of Sixth Form in year 13 (i don't know America's equivalent, high school?) and only has GCSE qualifications. During year 13 he stopped concentrating in class, said he would stare at papers and wouldn't know what to do, and feels he can't to anything else. Since dropping out he wouldn't complete courses/apprenticeships because the second it got difficult or he losses interest he quits, and says its because of his autism (he has mild autism, you wouldn't notice unless he told you) and his ADHD. Now, I partially understand, but it's getting to a point where he has just stopped trying to go for anything, at all. He has no prospects according to him, and i don't know what to tell him. He says he has no passion in any field, and that he can't work for a business that he doesn't find interest in.

He also claims he has anger problems, for example if he worked retail and had to deal with a rude customer, he'd knock them out and he couldn't control it. The only way he can control anger is the presence of his dog. He also says therapy doesn't work, for whatever reason.

What can he do, surely he isn't the only person in the world who's dealt with this, because that's what he feels like. He's been essentially self-quarantining himself since November 2018.",20May2020,1

I've also paid for pet insurance, vet bills, to be fleed and wormed - and I'm also paying for her to be spayed when she's old enough. In total I've invested many sleepless nights and a lot of money in this adorable little fluff ball and I love her to pieces. 

When I brought the cat back, it was never specified who was keeping her when I move out but friend assumes she is after only buy cat food once.

157,"A friend of mine left her toxic significant other a couple days ago. They were never married. The information I have from her is that They had purchased a vehicle together in Nevada from a private owner, and on the bill of sale it has both of their names. On the vehicle’s insurance it just has my friends name, and not him at all. After purchasing the vehicle, They then traveled to Illinois to get a place together out there. Apparently things went bad after arriving to Illinois, and my friend decided to leave him.

When my friend left abruptly a couple days ago, she said that her ex had swiped the title of the vehicle and signed his name on it claiming that if she left, he would report the vehicle stolen and she would get arrested. (Why the title wasn’t signed at the time of sale, idk.) But my friend took off with the vehicle, left him at the hotel they were at, and she is driving it out of state to stay with her family. She does have the bill of sale with her and of course has her proof of insurance.

She has been getting multiple threatening messages and phone calls from him demanding that she come back with HIS vehicle, and that HIS vehicle has now been reported as stolen. I believe he is acting out of desperation because to my knowledge he has no other form of transportation.

In a case like this, would her ex really be able to report that vehicle stolen since he took the title from her, or will the police say that it is a civil matter? To go to court? I told my friend That she should be able to replace the title once she gets all settled but I just want to make sure she wouldn’t actually get in legal trouble for taking off with it.",20May2020,1

Actually my daughter does not seem scared but instead seems excited and enthusiastic to visit. This is strange to me. Do you find this normal? My daughter seems to find the idea of her mom having to wearing a uniform, sharing a room funny. I wonder why she would think it is funny. My wife says bring her if she would like to and my daughter says she would like to but I don't know if it is a good idea. She hasn't gone yet so we can still discuss it together.",20May2020,1

Now is a good time to mention Sophie is constantly overwhelmed and talks to me with the things going on in her life. Lately, Sophie has changed. I made a joke and she got so defensive and sensitive and I was so confused. Today, I saw a post by someone we’ll call Khloe and she commented something that Khloe said in her post she was tired of hearing, and so I texted Sophie saying that, and she immediately got defensive again and said that I wasn’t seeing the whole picture.

Do you guys think it’s acceptable for my parents to control my phone time?

I am 16f. I absolutely hate people controlling my actions, including my parents. Because of this, I’ve always made sure to study hard (I have a GPA of 97%). I avoid the stereotypical “rebellious” teenage behavior. I don’t do parties, sneaking out, or boys. Basically all I do is just study for school, my SAT tests and play on my phone. These are my choices (not my parents) and I’m happy with them so far. I’ve always tried to stay ahead of the game just so I can avoid my parents telling me to do these things before I do them.

The thing is, since quarantined started, my sleep schedule went off a bit. I stay up until 2am and wake up at noon. I’m a night owl and that’s just how I am. 

My mother hates this. She says it’s unmotivating to have me sleeping in, she thinks I’m procrastinating my work and she wants me to be on the same sleep schedule as the rest of my family. She wants to put parental controls on my phone so that she can manually shut it off at 12 at night, and control the times I can access my phone during the day. (No phone until I finish all my schoolwork.) She also says if I don’t wake up by 9:30am, she’ll take my phone for the whole day.

I think that it’s very controlling for her to want to do this. Every single assignment I have is ALWAYS turned in on time by the due date, so why does it matter the time I do the work at as long as it’s completed and good quality? I have a lot of schoolwork daily, and my method to deal with it is to take five minute breaks on my phone every ten minutes or so. It’s an odd strategy, but I don’t think that I have to justify it to my parents since it’s proven to work for me through my good grades.

I know that hating people telling me what to do is a flaw I have, so I’ve tried my best my whole life to avoid it in the best way possible. But this just feels controlling—regardless of my dislike of controlling. So I’m going to take this anonymously to you internet people for advice and your stance on this issue!

I am F18, and I live a fair distance (one hour) away from my friends.

As a result of everyone living in self isolation due to Corona right now I have been unable to see my friends in person (because I'm staying home) in over two months. This doesn't bother me as long as my friends and I can stay connected socially online. Hence the problem.

In the last 9 weeks I have not had a single conversation with any of my friends unless I initiated the conversation first and we only discuss movies or something. NEVER our personal lives (which kind of drives me crazy). 

Because I can't always be on my phone my ""friends"" have barely spoken to me. One even forgot my birthday which kind of sucked when we had been discussing hers for weeks.

178,"Hey everyone! Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this. 

My fiancé and I have been together since 2012. We started dating high school, moved away for college together, and then after graduating moved across the country to California. 

My fiancé proposed in 2018 and a month later we faced a life altering situation when the town we lived and worked in was destroyed in a wild fire. It was traumatic for both of us and my anxiety has just started significantly improving this year. We continued wedding planning even with all of chaos around us and chose 4/4/2020 for our wedding here in California. 

Well, we get SO CLOSE and then end up having to put everything on hold because of the current situation. After talking to our vendors we postponed to Halloween of this year. Told all of our guests and mailed out change of date cards to everyone. 

Now, I really wish we would have just cancelled. I’m worried that travel still won’t be possible and about 90% of our guests would be flying from the Midwest/East Coast to attend. 

I feel really bad canceling now though when we already sent out change the dates to everyone. Maybe I’m afraid people will think I’m crazy? I could wait until July/August and see what the world is like then but honestly I just don’t want to. We would still get married just with a private elopement instead of a big party like we had originally planned. 

So, my question is: if you were a guest would you be mad/annoyed/think I’m crazy if I cancelled the wedding completely only 2 months after postponing?",20May2020,1

183,"So while in lockdown, I’ve had time to think about things going on in my life. I’ve started to realise just how unhealthy my lifestyle is. I’ve started talking to this amazing girl who has a good lifestyle that completely opposes mine and when we are out of lockdown I’d like to be better and have changed from the current shitshow. 

I was always aware of my poor diet and sleep pattern but now that I’m stuck at home, I can’t justify eating shit as “a quick lunch while at college” or “snacks throughout the day”. 

While I’ve been at home and had limited opportunities to go to the shop, I’ve realised just how much junk food I’m eating and how often it is. I will go do the weekly shopping to help out my family but while I’m there I will buy loads of chocolate and snacks with the intention to make them last but they will be gone within 2 days. Its like I’m an addict who is spending all my money on a fix and then using immediately. It sounds exaggerating but that’s what it is. I haven’t been to the doctors for a health checkup in god knows how long. Literally years. I could have diabetes and I wouldn’t know. I’m even convinced that I actually do or that I’m on my way there. Fun how now the doctors office is the worst place to go right now. 

Why do I eat? Simple. It’s comfort eating. It always has been. It’s literally that quote from Austin Powers “I eat because I’m unhappy and I’m unhappy because I eat.” Yep. It’s just been years of being unhappy and then temporarily disabling that with food to the point that it becomes habit.

I’ve been drinking a lot more too. It started as a couple gins at social events which is basically Zoom quizzes and when my family decide to use our pizza oven- which is rare seeing as flour is fucking extinct in the U.K. right now. Even before lockdown, I would drink when I was worried or stressed but especially when I was unhappy. One time in October or November, I was having a bad week while working on a big college project and stressing about what a girl I was dating was doing. I bought a huge bottle of vodka on the way home. Arrive home, drank a third of it within 20 mins and when my mum launched a surprise attack in my room she lost it with me. 
Getting back to the point, I’ve realised that I drink now because I’m unhappy and it’s relieving stress and worry but I don’t want to make it into a habit. I say that as if it already fucking isn’t but yeah. 

Finally and least importantly is my sleeping pattern. For nearly 2 months I’ve been sleeping 4:30/5am to 1pm. I do this to get rid of half the day because I hate being awake and dealing with everything. I’ve had trouble sleeping for years, going to bed at 1:30am to wake up at 7:30 on school days since I was 14. I hate it but I can’t change. I eat sugary stuff, have too much energy to sleep, feel tired when I wake so eat something bad to wake me up. 

So in conclusion, I know I do all of this stuff and it’s a problem. I’ve been trying to change for years but always given up. 

For anyone who has managed to change something in their lifestyle or even people who haven’t- What are some ways I can keep motivated and stop myself from falling back into this awful routine and get myself better? 

TLDR: I have a shit unhealthy lifestyle but can’t stay motivated to change it so it gets worse. Need tips and tricks to turn it around.",20May2020,1
184,"I’ve (F27) always been a girls’ girl and had lots of female friends, until my last relationship. My ex (M31) and I had dated for nearly 3 years, and during the last half of our relationship, he became more and more insecure. I think this is because he put me on such a high pedestal, and he eventually came to the conclusion that he wasn’t good enough for me.

So instead of leveling up, he made me feel insecure by flirting and talking to other females. However, these females that he was talking to were also my good friends. At least they said they were my friends and said they loved me. But looking back, I think they felt threatened by me and took any opportunity to make themselves feel better than me, including sleeping with my boyfriend, if that makes any sense.

I’m really not tooting my own horn. I don’t think I’m that great.

So now, to protect myself from getting stabbed in the back, I have socially isolated myself from having friends, in person and online. It’s hard to trust people again, but I still feel the pain of loneliness and seclusion. Even before the quarantine and social distancing, I now have no friends.

193,"**[Long post]**

For as long as I [24F] can remember I’ve had “weird” relationships with friends. This is mainly due to my people pleasing traits, lack of boundaries, and codependency that stem from childhood (I’m in therapy now). I’m also an introvert that can be social at times so I feel that this confuses people.

Over the years I’ve attracted very selfish and manipulative people in my life that would use me in various ways. I recently cut off 2 friends and changed my number a few months ago after 10 years and only gave my new number to a select few. I’m working on bettering myself but there’s still a sense of self doubt..

Before I cut off these 2 friends I was already emotionally stressed after losing my income to COVID-19 and my brother’s recent diagnosis with cluster headaches. I could no longer take the negative energy I received from these 2 friends. One friend, my bestfriend of 7 years, let her co-worker/friend disrespect me in her face. 

Me and my bestfriend’s friend had gotten off to a bad foot on accident and I did everything I could to apologize and mediate the situation even though it wasn’t my fault. My bestfriend’s friend still proceeded to throw jabs at me while my bestfriend didn’t say anything. I didn’t want a confrontation or to escalate the situation further so I felt it wasn’t worth it to try and snap at her back. This was also not the first time something has happened with one of my bestfriend’s friends.

Prior to this situation, I’d already been contemplating ending the friendship because my bestfriend was extremely dependent on me for emotional support and would influence me to push off my goals to come hang out and smoke with her. She also couldn’t take criticism and would get defensive &amp; make excuses whenever you mentioned anything geared towards bettering herself. There were also many times when she would change the subject when I was venting or would quickly get off the phone with me if I didn’t sound like I was at my happiest. But she expected me to always be there for her.

The 2nd friend I cut off was someone I went to college with. The relationship began good but after time I felt she treated me like a sidekick. I began to suspect that she got close to me because I had a lot of business &amp; marketing knowledge (this was my major) and started a business while in college. My friend has dreams of starting a business so i would share the resources and things I knew about. I’ve also been through a lot in life so I was able to help in that aspect as well from a woman’s perspective.

Don’t get me wrong my friend was cool to hang with but I’m not really a social person to begin with. But still I would go to some stuff with her when she wanted someone to go with. We almost became roommates at one point.

I started looking at her different when we went to a college event together. At the event I guy came up to me flirting and making comments about my butt. He then made a comment about my friend’s outfit. I cordially defended her but I don’t remember what I said to him. Afterwards another guy that we knew came and grabbed my butt in front of everyone. I was so embarrassed especially since this isn’t the first time he’s harassed me before. When it happened I froze up and felt powerless. I also trigger because i have a part with sexual harassment and abuse. 

I told my friend what happened and how I was ready to go (she drove us) because I was uncomfortable. I must’ve said it 4 or 5 times. It’s like she was frozen. She didn’t respond at all. When we got in her car I told her what happened once again. She apologized and said she couldn’t hear me. I tried to let it go because I thought that maybe she really couldn’t hear me. But this often sat in the back of my head.

Recently my friend called me and we were talking about our sorority. I’ve distanced myself from it since now that I’m older and I realize all of the toxic stuff they put me through that still affects me. Long story short, while we’re talking her mom eavesdrops our conversation (she’s also in the sorority) and basically tells me that despite all of the toxic stuff and bad treatment that I should get on the anniversary call they were having the next day. My friend then proceeds to ask me what I think and if I’m going to the do the call despite me telling her how I felt earlier in the call. This really upset me because I really don’t care about sorority/ college bullshit anymore now that I’ve graduated and I’m trying to heal from my trauma.

At this point in my life I’m really just trying to focus on my finances and business goals. Also, I felt my friend was wrong for not putting her mom in her place and also because she switched up trying to persuade me to do the call when her mom got involved, when the only reason we got on the subject was because she was complaining about the sorority herself.

The next week she calls me but I don’t answer. She calls me a week later and doesn’t mention what happened. I tell her what my issues were with our last call. As I’m talking I can hear our other sorority sister get in the car. She’d told me at the beginning of the call that she was on the way to taking her somewhere but she didn’t tell me she was about to get in the car at any second. I wasn’t sure if I was on speaker when she got in the car so I paused with my speech when I heard her get in. My friend ushers me to keep talking so I wrap it up what I had to say. I just want to note that a few months ago is when I started taking my mental health really seriously. I started therapy and also changed my number after having it for over 10 years. 

The sorority sister that got in car mentioned something about me not texting her back. This made me uneasy because it put me on the spot about recently changing my number when i wasn’t ready to talk about it yet because it surround my mental health. I didn’t want her to feel i had a problem with her as to why I didn’t give her my number. We just weren’t really close and hadn’t talked in months. We didn’t even have a relationship when we were on campus. I only gave it to those that I really talked to and I felt where there for me. I didn’t know how to feel at the time and suspected I was overreacting so I went along with the convo and ended the call on a good note.

After thinking about it for a while I noticed a pattern with this friend. I felt she was sneaky and self centered. I put out way more than I got back in this friendship but after doing it for so long i guess I couldn’t conclude how to stop it without being mean. Whether it was intentional or not I knew that their energy didn’t help my mental health. 

I decided to block her without explanation. Before this happened I tried to take the method of distancing myself but with quarantine in place it made it hard to ignore people when they know you’re stuck at home. With this friend she would sometimes mention how we were close. She did this when I told her off about what happened with her mom. She would also do this after not hearing from me for a couple months which wasn’t really intentional, we live in 2 different states since i moved after college and she stayed in our college town. I also began working full time and freelancing again so our calls weren’t as frequent as before.

Despite her treating me bad I would feel guilty for distancing myself when she said stuff like this because at one point we were tight. With my bestfriend I at least sent her a farewell message before blocking her. I hate feeling like a fake friend but I had to do what was best for me especially since both of these friends lacked a bit of self awareness.

Although these people were toxic I felt it was in my best interest to take the methods I chose because I was already emotionally exhausted and i feel i did as much as i was capable to do. My anxiety has never been this bad. I feel better without them in my life but it makes me think that if I keep cutting people out of my life that I gonna go crazy from ending up alone.

TDLR: Recently cut off 2 friends. I feel happier without them but I’m concerned that if I keep cutting people off I will eventually go crazy from being alone. Do you think that I’m the common denominator or is it that I hold onto people way longer than I should thinking they’ll change?",20May2020,1
194,"I left my job and then coronavirus happened, I got kicked out of my house and got sick, and spent my savings on hotel rest to recover. My parents house wasnt safe to be at, and with nowhere else to go and not much money left, i went to a 14 day homeless shelter program.

 While I was here, someone (19 m) started talking to me. He asked if i meditate, then i said yes. I started talking about my spiritual beliefs. At this point he said, most people dont talk about these things. He started asking me about my intellectual opinions, but the more i talked the more he almost looked pissed that I had suddenly revealed myself to be an intellectual person (i am very stupid in other areas as you are about to see). he said that i was way different than his other friends, who are largely part of a way of life that is just not nice, he had been in jail before but he wanted to change. 

He was showing me pictures of puppies and babies and genuinely seemed like he just hadnt had anyone be an example for him or give him guidance, so I talked with him throughout the day, having been to college. He told me he wanted to turn his life around. I revealed where im from, which is a pretty rich neighborhood, though my parents are by no means safe and neither is their house, hence why i am homeless currently. 

There are mentors at this program already, and someone working there was bothered that he was kind of wanting to talk to me more than them. 

By the end of the day we had hung out and talked all day. He started mentioning things like, what might happen after we were out of homelessness. At this point i realized he wanted some kind of friendship or more. And also, that i might be so different from his usual crowd that i might stick out like a sore thumb and be difficult to forget. I realized how stupid it was to trust that person and really had no idea what happened to me. 

He seems like a nice kid, i didnt mean to give him the wrong impression by being nice, that we would be friends or have much contact after the program. I am concerned about how to set this boundary with him, and how he might respond. Especially since he knows my full name and the town im from.",20May2020,1

196,"This year was my freshman year in college, and I struggled a lot. My first semester I had a 2.6 gpa and dropped a class, and my second I failed three out of five classes and dropped two classes. Next year I've already decided to be home for college and try dorming some other time, but I'm also worried about my financial aid being affected by this year. I've been seriously considering a gap year.

A huge reason why I struggled in college is that I never developed time management skills. Ever since I was a kid, I was running for the bus, not turning in my work, and putting everything off til the last second; I've never had intrinsic motivation. So my gap year wouldn't be for traveling or partying (we don't have the money to travel anyways, and I'm not a partier), the goal would be to develop the habits that I never developed. I would also be working and saving up my money so that I can pay the extra tuition I'll have to pay due to my underperforming freshman year. 

So, my plan would be to learn on my own different things that interest me, such as coding, that'll help me to work on my study habits. I also plan to read a lot of books and work on self-discipline and habit making. I plan on getting a counselor and meeting with them to help with my progress. I plan on learning how to make and stick to routines. And this way, if I struggle with teaching myself any of this, I won't be jeopardizing my gpa and wasting my college money. And, the stuff I'll be learning and teaching myself will be fun, so it'll be something nice to practice with before I step into a class that I don't enjoy and would most certainly procrastinate on the way I am now, such as English class (writing essays is not my forte). 

So that's my reasoning behind it. Idk, is it dumb? Am I in over my head? Is it smart to take a gap year next fall?",20May2020,1

200,"Me and my sister are 2 years apart. I'm the oldest.

Most of our lives, we didn't get along. We pretty much hated each other. Ever since I moved 4 hours away from home for college 2 years ago, we were able to rebuild our relationship. We're like best friends now. 

My sister has always been a very smart girl. Ever since she was very young. She is much smarter than me and it always reflected in her grades. However, as of recent, she fell into a depressive spiral. She was diagnosed with depression and started taking medication for it last year. Prior to her diagnosis, last summer she was catatonic. It was a very sad time, she slept all day everyday, and wasn't able to do anything. Ever since that happened, things have never been the same for her. She still is that same smart girl on the inside, but she fell off. She lost all drive and motivation. Her grades plummeted. She procrastinates. She quit her extracurricular activities. Her antidepressants haven't helped her so much yet, but she's still better than she was last summer. 

My parents are particularly harsh on her. They don't exactly believe that depression is a real thing and that it's the reason that she is the way she is now. They think she's just lazy. Albeit, she's always been lazy, but I know that her depression is the reason it became substantially worse. My parents aren't bad parents, but I would be lying if I said they weren't toxic to her mental health. Because of their disbelief in her depression, they want her to go to a local college and live at home.

As of recent, she got into the same college I currently go to. I was so excited for her. I showed her around the school when my family came up to visit. She ended up enrolling. I was so happy for her. 

The only issue with this is that my parents don't believe she should move 4 hours away to go to college. They think she should stay at home so they can baby her for the entirety of her college career.

I can say with almost 100% certainty that if she were to move to college where I am, that she would learn to thrive. I know it would help with her depression. I know she has it in her to succeed, that she just needs the right environment to do so, and home is not that environment. I truly believe that if she were given the opportunity to experience life on her own without my parents hovering over her, that she will do amazingly. I explained to my parents how excited I am for her to be going to college with me, and that I would love to be her mentor, show her the ropes, teach her how to succeed in college. I am now going into my junior year and have maintained a 3.5 GPA. I know that I can help her get into the right habits so she can truly apply her wonderful brain again and succeed.

My parents don't buy it. They think she would move away to college and fail. They tell her that straight to her face. It breaks my heart. I know my sister, and I know that this is her best chance at success, and her best chance at survival. I'm scared that if this opportunity to be on her own is ripped away from her, that she will take her own life. It wouldn't be her first attempt. They keep threatening her and telling her that they will make her rescind her enrollment. 

I'm really just looking for some help getting through to my parents. I know that this is what she truly wants and needs, but they don't, and they don't think that she can make it to the light at the end of the tunnel. Help please.",20May2020,1
201,"I'm 18f and I found out (through some searching) that the guy I've been online dating for months is really 28 and not 25 like he initially told me. I did confront him and he ended up admitting that he did lie and didn't tell me out of insecurity because of the possibility that I would reject him for being the age that he is. He said he was meaning to tell me, but didn't know the right time to bring it up. He was extremely apologetic for the whole thing and couldn’t stop saying sorry to me. I forgave him. But I am still not sure how to feel about this. On one hand, I can get where he is coming from. He generally doesn’t really have a good image of himself self-esteem wise and does have some insecurities that he’s been dealing with his whole life but on the other hand why would someone start off a relationship with a lie and not tell me about it as soon as possible, and it was only until I suspected something was up that he ended up telling the truth. 

Besides this, he is really great otherwise. He treats me well, loves to love bomb me and spoils me even when I don’t ask him to. But he appreciates me in ways that makes it show how much he cares about me and would go the extra mile for me if it meant that he could make our relationship strong and happy.

I’m wondering is this still a red flag? Or am I making this out to be a big deal since it's only 3 years he cut off from his age and his insecurity just got the best of him?",20May2020,1

yesterday night i decided to try self-harming out of morbid curiosity, because i always wondered why people would willingly hurt themselves. of course, right after i was done, i realized that it was indescribably stupid, and that it really hurt. like a lot. and i did it for no reason.

i have no idea whether it's better to tell my parents or not. if i don't tell them and they find out, it's probably worse because they'll think i've been doing it for a while.

if i tell them and even explain multiple times that it really hurt and that i'll never do it again, it's probably worse because my mom has a mental illness and many people in her family are mentally ill &amp; suicidal (i believe atleast one of her relatives commited suicide), and she'll probably think i have suicidal thoughts, which i've never had.

TL;DR

curiosity killed the cat, i self-harmed for basically no reason, and if i don't tell my parents they'll probably find out and be very sad and worried, and if i tell them and explain why i did they'll probably be very sad, worried, and  really confused.

While she was alive she often talked about how her mom didn't care about her &amp; that she didn't like her family. No one knows why she's keeping it a secret. There is no obituary or memorial. All her socials are still up but were made private. I have debated contacting her mom to ask her why but I'm going to lose it. I don't care how ashamed or embarrassed you feel. That was your DAUGHTER. What are they going to do? Forget her? Pretend it never happened? It's not fair to her or the people who actually cared about her. What do you think?

212,"Parents at our local high school have a Facebook group to facilitate sponsoring a senior who will not have graduation/prom/awards this year due to the pandemic. The sponsor puts together a surprise bag or basket of goodies to encourage or celebrate them.  You can sponsor a family member, or a friend’s child or a stranger who doesn’t have a sponsor.

Not gonna lie, it’s grotesque to me the way parents are posting their kids’ achievements and accepting multiple sponsors. These kids are already fine as far as resources, skills, grades and such. What I suspect is that there are kids who won’t be posted because they sort of “can’t compete” or had bad grades, invisible disabilities or whatever. I would like to sponsor a more “forgotten” kid who wouldn’t put him or herself out there (or parents wouldn’t) but who deserves to be included. Basically, a kid who needs it more than these kids for whom this is just more of the same attention they always get. 

HOW TO WORD THIS? “Looking to sponsor a X Senior.....” what? I can’t say underachievers or socially challenged. I don’t know how to say it gracefully. 

I don’t want to come off critical of the thirsty parents promoting their kid (I do understand the impulse to rally people to celebrate) so I need to make my point without being provocative.  I’m being raw here but the wording needs to sound “soft” enough that people will take me up in the offer.

These relationships can become rather sexual as well, even when he was younger. I really only know this since I've walked in on him a few times having sex with his girlfriends. He's popular both in our nearby middle &amp; high school as well, which gives him access to the age group.

I've tried a few things to get him to realize that he should date people his own age, but he won't listen. I've told my mother in the past and she shrugs it off saying he'll get over it eventually. These are pretty much the only reasons he gets away with it.

I really, really want this position (its an internship) and I am qualified for it, but I've been getting rejected from a lot of places though I'm not sure why.

230,"It's been a year+ since I've been celibate, not because I can't get a girl to have sex with me, but because I wanted to stop paying for sex or having sex with ""sluts"". I wanted to be in a real relationship first. I've never been in one. I don't hate girls because of this, so I doubt I'm incel. But I'm also not really into getting into a relationship anymore, because as a quiet, loner person, I think and observe a lot, and being a realist; I simply don't see why a lady would genuinely be with me. So I'm celibate and fine, not looking to get into a relationship, not against any gender, I'm cool with just having a genuine friend I can relate with, and I hate (or want to hate) anything involving sex. I wish I was genuinely asexual, because as I said; I think and observe a lot, and I believe being sexual/having libido clouds ones judgements, takes up time, and simply has no benefit except an orgasm or temporary solution to insecurity. I'm on nofap, skip any romantic ""lovey-dovey"" scene and music I come across, skip sex scenes, etc. Like I said; I wish I was asexual. I don't mind being single for life, I pretty much believe I will, if not I'll end up being heart broken, because love really isn't real. I think media and libido has made it seem like it's a necessity for a human being. I've looked into physical and chemical castrations, but wouldn't do any because of the side effects.

Okay so I’m a thousand miles away from friends and family, after I moved to where I am by myself for work, I was fortunate to meet a very friendly guy who is separated from his marriage and courts are closed or his divorce would be finalized already so the ex wife is already out of the picture.

Well, both of us were laid off, so we have pretty much spent all of quarantine together hanging out, watching movies, playing video games, drinking and smoking in massive amounts, and eventually we started having awesome sex.

When we first met I had a lot of my own issues, and he has his so we were both in the same mentality of not dating each other and just hanging out like actual hanging out Netflix with no chill involved, if you get me.

Well now there’s a ton of “chill”, and I trust him, and we have essentially been living together. It’s pretty awesome.

In fact, any lady would be lucky to have him, and I’m mind blown how anyone would want to lock him down. He’s an intelligent, pleasant, good natured individually who is actually kind of a badass, and I get butterflies from the way he looks at me.

Thought I would play it cool and not say shit, and just let things be the way they are...and then he said something about how the first thing he wants to do when things open back up, is take me to a salon to get my nails done.

I’m now crazy about him, he’s an amazing man and I feel lucky to be around him. 

Not sure if he feels the same way, I have a hunch he does, but I’m not quite sure and I’m afraid to say something for fucking everything up, but for what it’s worth his soon to be ex wife repeatedly calls me his girlfriend and he’s introduced me to his kids, and the ex wife is even cool with me because his kids like me a lot. It’s been pretty nice.

So how do I bring it up without fucking things up or do I just stfu and wait for him to handle it?",20May2020,1

237,"my (16F) Boyfriend (18M) has only had sex twice, with one girl who he just saw from visiting his cousins, all around when he was 14/15. 

this shouldn't bother me, and it wouldn't have bothered me before, but I've been raped multiple times and never had consentual sex, I refused to even consider any sexual encounters with people and I didn't know if I'd ever be able to, until I met him. slowly I opened up and he is truly the only one I would be open to having sex with, who I want to, he's made me view it as such a better thing. 

he's always been very understanding and amazing, he's never asked for nudes, he lets me initiate all sexual messages or absolutely anything. he knows about my past and if at any point I get uncomfortable he's completely fine with it and just makes sure I'm ok. he's amazing.

and I don't know exactly what it is that makes me feel like this, like I just wanna throw up. part of it is being so self conscious, I feel like now I have to live up to some expectation or I need to have sex with him like it's expected even though I know it's not. it scares me a lot that maybe it's just sex to him, it's not just sex for me. it's so much more it's this intimate thing that has taken me over a year of being together to even decide I'd want to. it isn't just sex. I've talked to him about it but I hate to, I feel like it makes him feel bad for not being a virgin  and he hurts knowing it's in my head thinking all of that.

242,"PREFACE: I’m NOT trying to sell my guitar on reddit, I just need advice.

Hi, so, I don’t know if this is the right subreddit to ask this question, but when I was in middle school 2012(?) my parents got me an acoustic Yamaha Guitar for Christmas; that I’ve just now learned is an F325. They expected me to teach myself how to play, and my neighbor said it was easy to teach yourself, so I was down with it. The first day I tried it, my dad laughed me, and I’ve never touched the guitar since then.

It’s been over 7 years, and I genuinely don’t have the courage to pick it up again, so I figured I’d sell it. It’s practically like new, and I still have all that it came with except the original box, so I figured it’d be fair to sell it at or near the original price point. I remember seeing the receipt saying somewhere around $300-400, but when I google it only says about $150. So I’d appreciate any help figuring out the original price for the guitar. 

TL;DR: My parents got me a guitar around 2012 that I’ve never used, and I need help figuring out what to price it at. 

Info: I don’t have the receipt (it’s been like seven years). They bought it at a Guitar Center in Los Angeles County, California. Comes with a strap, picks, a tuner, a DVD, extra strings, and some other stuff I’m sure I’m forgetting.",20May2020,1

It’s not that I hate children or anything, but I’ve just never really been drawn to them like I see a lot of women are, especially babies. I’ve never changed a diaper in my life so being so up close and personal to this stuff is kinda new for me. 

So anyways I’m married and we have a pretty active sex life. I have bigger breast myself, so of course my husband has always gone crazy for them. Lately I just hate it though. Him playing with them has always been a turn on for me but now it instantly brings babies and my friends to my mind and I’m instantly turned off. It’s especially bad if he puts his face anywhere near my chest. All I can think about is breastfeeding and it just completely ruins my sex drive.

248,"Hello! I was looking to complete a summer finance internship/co-op this year in corporate finance or investments for experience before my senior year in college. However, with everything going on with COVID-19, most opportunities cut positions, cut the programs, or just never got back to me. It’s been really defeating. I’ve gotten 1 internship offer: A retail banking position. Basically, I’ll be doing customer service and counting cash and coin--nothing that will give me any relevant experience. On top of that, pay is only $11/HR (which is minimum wage in my state), which is pretty lackluster real finance internships in my location are $15/HR or more. The only benefit I see from this is that I add something new to my resume (experience is experience?) and I say I worked at a bank, just with the wrong experience.

The reason why I am not to keen on taking this internship is because the other option I have is keep getting unemployment. While it sounds lazy, I am currently making DOUBLE off of unemployment than I would at the internship. When thinking about costs, I'm only going to make $2,000 off of this internship, compared to $5,000 off of unemployment. And if I don't take this internship, I can claim unemployment through the end of the year, which would be $13,000!! And if the $600 benefit gets extended to the end of the year as well, I can make almost $30,000.

This is money I can save money for a new car, grad school, etc. So I don’t really know what I should do. Interning will get me out of the house, maybe meet friendly people, and will let future employers know I worked at a financial institution during an economic. But it’s not the relevant experience I need, and I don't know what employers will think of that. I've been mulling it over for the past month, so if anyone has some advice, it would be very much appreciated.

TL:DR - The internship I was offered offers no relevant experience and little pay. I'll make $2,000 from the internship. If I stay on unemployment, I can make $13,000, possible $30,000 if benefits are extended. I don't know what the long-term consequences of not taking the internships are.",20May2020,1
249,"I have some bad insecurities that have arisen within the last five or so years in regards to relationships. My main insecurities revolve around girls leaving me after we date for a while. The rational part of my self tells me it's not my fault, but my gut tosses and turns and makes me anxious and depressed about it. 

To give some context, I don't have trouble attracting women, but rather them staying and the effects that has on me. The three major girlfriends I've had have all said that they loved me and wanted a future with me but have all left me in one way or another.

My first girlfriend broke up with me because she had volatile mental health issues and was constantly trying to get me to play a game of cat and mouse with her. She was toxic, physically and emotionally abusive. While I do have physical scars from dating her, she said so etching truly horrific to me that still causes me issues to date. She told me that ""she'd rather what have happened happened, then give me the credit of saying I'm a good person"". She said that to me after our school found out she was raped at a party and I talked to her about it a few weeks after. She called me that night crying and asked me to pick her up, but screamed at me to go away when I drove there to pick her up.

My second girlfriend and first love was very immature and said lots of things that made me insecure. Her and her family would always make comments about me smelling like smoke because my parents did ( nobody has ever smelt smoke on me before or since). She would also constantly lead me on only to make fun of me.

My most recent girlfriend had mental health issues and ghosted me without a goodbye shortly after quarantine was declared in my country. She told me she loved me and wanted to spend her life with me, then she ghosted me and removed me off of all social media.

I feel hollow inside some days and I struggle to sleep at night, always wondering if things were really my fault. It's one thing to get into a relationship, but I seem to struggle to stay in one. I've talked to therapists, but they've all told me that it wasn't my fault and it was terrible for me to experience those things, but it never helps.

253,"To clarify some things about the title to this post:

1. I know not caring what other people think AT ALL can be a bad thing (for example, not caring what people think to the extent of hurting others’ feelings, being an asshole, etc.). 

2. The title itself to this post may sound as if I’m the one being judgmental.

To elaborate on why I’m asking this, here’s the backstory:

My (28F) fiancé (36M) has voiced to me how he feels insecure about himself, and I feel as if him caring so much about other people (specifically on social media) is a reflection of his own insecurities, that also FURTHER make him insecure about himself as he compares his life, appearance, etc. to them. It’s no one in particular, just people in general he’s met and is connected with via Facebook/instagram. 

He’ll spend so much time on social media just scrolling through other people’s lives...and then he’ll find something to either compare himself to and go on some kind of rant to me where he’s bragging about himself in some kind of attempt to affirm his own worth i guess, it’s not even like he’s wanting to have a conversation with me it’s more like him just trying to reason with himself that he’s “better.”

Or, he’ll see something on social media, or someone, that makes him jealous of who they are or their life, and he’ll get so worked up he’ll post a status basically bashing what that person posted (without calling them out). This behavior to me is the equivalent of what you hear how bullies act. People say that bullies who make fun of and ridicule others do so because they’re unhappy with themselves. This is exactly what my fiancé seems to do (without actually confronting the person, he just makes a general post talking sh** about whatever he saw that was posted). He has also told me he used to be bullied growing up, so I can see this behavior as learned behavior or a defense mechanism from his past. He claims that he’s just annoyed and wants to “put them in check,” but I’m like, “why do you even care so much?” Except, I know why he cares, he cares because he’s jealous or insecure about himself and whatever that person posted struck a nerve in him. 

So, back to my question, I believe I know WHY he cares so much about what other people are doing, but I would appreciate advice on how to talk to him about this. I know that me, personally, wouldn’t give a f*** about what other people are doing to that extent because...well...I have my own life?! Lol! That’s how I see it anyway. I just don’t know how to talk to my fiancé about this without him getting defensive and/or offended. He’s very hot tempered.

P.S. this is my first post to Reddit so I apologize if I have mistakes in my post or posted to the wrong place. Also, I really hope this entire thing doesn’t sound like I’m being judgmental myself. Thank you.",20May2020,1

260,"I inherited $52,000 five years ago. My plan was to buy a small house in a shit neighborhood that I could pay my bills with my disability check. My dad instead decides he's going to buy me a monstrosity of a house in which I can't afford the bills for because the neighborhoods I could afford weren't safe enough. I protested, he won out.

So I made lemonades out of lemon and installed some roommates to pay the bills. It was going great until he decided that since the house was in his name, so was the liability and he kicked out all of the roommates. He also promised he would pay all my bills once he did that.

Fast forward to now, my bills and my disability check are almost the same number. My dad wants to stop paying my bills because of a slight improvement in my condition due to a medication change. He has decided I can work. 

I've been fired from 4 jobs and tanked 5 at home businesses. He still thinks I can work. 

He also throws a fit every time I buy clothes or fishing stuff for myself. He thinks since he's paying my bills every spare dime I have should go to him. As we all know, in a capitalist society, everything costs money. He's trying to set me up so I either work or pay bills and watch TV all day. My doctors told me to stay active and literally gave me a prescription to go fishing because the sunlight + physical activity + mental stimulation + it's the only enjoyment I get out of life = making it the only thing keeping me somewhat sane. 

When I got fired from my construction job for having no ""pep in my step"" my mom rightly assumed it was my medication making me lethargic. My dad said it's because I'm not used to working and to find another job. He acts as if I don't have one of the most life altering mental illnesses you can have.

Other guy that’s getting picked for the job was high school teammates with the boss. Only things he has going for him is he is older and better at the sport. But in my opinion, you don’t need to be a pro to teach 4-10 year olds tennis. 

Right now, the plan is to just quit. Let me know some of your thoughts. Thank you.",20May2020,1

265,"I would like to start by saying I have adhd, and very bad adhd at that. I am 16 and more than capable of deciding what’s best for myself while following my parents rules. I was on Ridellan a very similar drug to Adderall when I was younger but decided I didn’t need it and went off of it ( if your thinking about taking adderall remember that withdraws are not fun and depending on the person can last weeks). But I could never sleep and I thought it was due to the ridellan. Well I am off of it and I still can’t fall asleep very well and I cannot stay asleep either. I average 3-5 hours a night and I’m always tired but can never sleep. I don’t want to talk to my mom about it because I’m not sure what she’ll say. We’re very close and we are fairly open but I feel like she won’t believe me for whatever reason. Also I don’t want to take any medication for it because I personally have loved ones that have gotten addicted to drugs from similar situations and I am against it because of that.

So after taking this acting class outside of school for a term, I only started talking to one of the girls after it was over, messaging her on Snapchat. It always feels like I'm leading the conversation, but she hardly ever ignores me or waits to message back like some girls do. 

I'm a bit afraid to ask her out, cause I really don't know if she is interested in talking to me.

I just really want the chance to actually go on a date with her irl, cause I know that I'm so much better at developing a relationship that way.

267,"I’m a 22 y/o college male home for the summer once again. I have 5 younger siblings ranging from 10 to 20 and 2 parents all living in a house we outgrew 15 years ago so everything is heard. It is obvious my parents do not love each other anymore the way they used to when I was younger as my my mom sleeps on the couch and there is usually bickering between them about the smallest things and I cannot remember when either of them made the other one smile. Add to the fact that one of my siblings is being yelled at for something or other constantly including the whole house being woken up while my parents interrogated my sister about finding alcohol in the car. I work full time at 7 am everyday so this certainly does not help my sleep and my heart races and my anxiety shoots up whenever there is the slightest sign of conflict or a raised voice, I hate it. Do I stick it out for the next 3 months or look into my options such as living with my grandparents who live 30 minutes away? TIA",20May2020,1
268,"TDLR at the end: My little brother has disgusting language and has recently been swearing alot. He learns it from the games he plays on the Playstation where it appears he plays live with other older kids who say crazy things when they get frustrated. Now, whenever he gets frustrated or surprised or even if someone tickles him, he says AH FUCK YOU or FUCK and other horrible things.

My parents have quite a “progressive” method of parenting. I didn’t realise it growing up because I didn’t really need to be parented..? I was a good kid and didn’t need disciplining often. When I tell them about it and how badly these games are affecting him, they say “Well we’d rather him swear in front of us and us be able to pick him up on it rather than swear behind our backs.” 

He doesn’t really get along with other children his age either because he is very aggressive and trash talks and is just difficult to play with. So another one of my parents arguments is “Well he can’t play with other kids his age so what else is he supposed to do?”  I think he’d get along with kids his age  in the first if he wasn’t learning such anti social, disgusting behaviour and language from these games! 

On the rare occasion that the play station has been confiscated for a long period of time, his behaviour improved drastically. Then, because he’s being so good, my parents reward him with the playstation. And then the cycle begins again.

I’m getting so frustrated because part of me is like “How much can I actually blame the kid when he’s not being parented right?” I don’t have the authority to take the playstation away, but if I did, it would’ve been thrown in the bin months ago. This is not a matter of me wanting to punish my brother for swearing. It’s a matter of concern that he’s just becoming rude, antisocial and that one day he’s going to pick at the wrong person and get his ass handed to him. I’m a big believer in kids just being kids and not growing up so fast if they don’t need to. Maybe it’s different because im not a parent, but yeah i just don’t know what to do about this anymore.

TDLR: My brother has behavioural issues stemming from online games and my parents don’t believe in stopping the problem at its source.",20May2020,1
269,"Hi so! I’m 19 years old I’m in the military (Air Force) I’ve been with my husband(he’s also 19) for roughly 4 years now, married for almost a year. I love him to pieces. He’s honestly amazing. We play video games together, we cook together, we hang out and joke and laugh. I love it. 
Except he sleeps a lot. Like all day. 
We moved from our home state of Cali to South Carolina this past March and it’s been a little rough. He sleeps all day, and I get it because he probably misses all his friends and family and I miss them and mine as well.
The issue is, he doesn’t like to clean all the time. He doesn’t help me take care of our fur babies as much as I’d like. And I come home to our house after an 8-12 hour day to dog poop in the home because he hasn’t taken our dog out all day. Or Benji (our dog) was in the crate ALL day. It makes me upset because Ben is my baby boy. He just turned two. 
My husband stays up until like 9 am playing video games and sleeps until 8pm. 
It’s a little frustrating. Idk what to do. I love him. 

TL;DR: My husband sleeps all the time and played video games nonstop and I’m kinda worried and feel like he doesn’t care about our home/pets.",20May2020,1
270,"Apologies in advance for the ugly mobile text/typos. I tried asking this over on relationship_advice but didn’t have much luck. My ( 29 f ) girlfriend ( 25 f ) has been incredibly distant lately. The first excuse was school/pms which I totally understood and gave her space - last week she deactivated twitter without warning me, and I woke up in a panic wondering where she went. It took her forever to get back to me but she finally did with a message or two every night explaining she wasn’t doing well mentally. Understandable, I personally struggle from anxiety disorder and PTSD, so I know how hard it is when you have a bad day, but I’ve told her endless times to warn me before she just disappears, and she never listens. 

Here’s where I’m absolutely worn thin and am questioning whether or not I should continue in this relationship or if it’s becoming too toxic for me to handle. 

She reactivated her twitter tonight while I was gaming, sent me a message on discord that she deleted, and when I asked what it was she acted sorta flippant. She told me she was dissociating and it doesn’t matter, but then acted pissy no one was giving her attention since she had reactivated her account ( it had only been thirty minutes time and like I said, I was busy and assumed she still wanted some space ). 

I reassured her no one resents her ( she assumed this since no one was paying her any attention ) and she simply replied with “ k. “ and hasn’t spoken to me since. 

Shortly after I went to turn on my nintendo switch only to see she had removed me from her friends list. 

All of this silence is making my anxiety so bad that i’ve not slept since friday. Am I overreacting or is this toxic behavior on her part? This isn’t the first time she’s gotten mad at me for not replying to her immediately when she’s taken days to respond to me sometimes when she gets into “ moods. “

I should add she has BPD and isn’t medicated, and I try to be as understanding as possible because I know it’s a hard illness, but I feel like I’m being treated unjustly and there’s little to no remorse on her end.",20May2020,1

I live in a different state now so we don’t see each other face to face often but she literally only messages me to make fun of me?

I’m not exaggerating. There is really nothing in between. I have another younger sister who is 16 and while not as “accomplished” she is much nicer, fun and more mature. I told my other sister tonight I did graduate online despite what she thinks (while having a baby) but I just don’t know how I should be handling this behavior anymore.

279,"My dating life hasn't always been the healthiest..So now I think I'm in something healthy, and it feels weird. 
I'm used to..well, basically obsessing over the guy I'm into, and them never showing me enough attention, or there's always this weird power dynamic with it, seeming like they have all the power. 
So Idk I normally think about the guy all day, and try really hard to get to know them, and make all the attempts to talk to them. I know I chase after dickheads, and I'm not healthy about how I go about these things either. 


But this guy, I've never been so comfortable with someone so soon. It's only been 3 weeks but feels like everything is just working. And when I'm not around him, I'll think about him a bit but not so obsessively like I'm used to doing. 

That's the feeling I want to know about. The feeling of not really thinking about my boyfriend at all during the day, maybe once or twice, but most of the day I could almost forget he exists. Not like my normal obsessive way of thinking about them way to much. Imagining conversation, daydream flirting, and so on.

I don't know what a normal amount of thinking about someone is. I know when I'm with him he's got my attention. And I'm so glad he's there. And I'm cuddling or fooling around with him and everything is good. Then he leaves and I don't see him for a day or 2 and it's as if he never existed. Not that I forget him but, that's the only way I can describe it based on my usual thoughts on someone. 

He's much simpler than a lot of exs. He's minimalist and keeps to himself. Not a social butterfly like I try to be. And I really enjoy when he's around, but it's just so odd this indifferent feeling when he isn't there. Like I don't have to worry if I'm doing enough, or if he really is into me. I believe him when he says so. I usually never trust that, but with him I just am so confident and sure that he does in fact -like me the way I like him-. 

Sorry if I'm rambling on. I just don't know how to put it all into words. I just want to know if it's normal to not think about someone all day long when in a romantic relationship. I'm sure it sounds obvious that thinking about them all day is probably not healthy, but it's what I'm used to. And wanted to hear other opinions",20May2020,1
280,"My (F24) sister (F24) has PDA, High functioning autism and schizophrenic traits. She's niave, gullible, very easily persuaded and very quick to lash out and use the emergency services such as the police and ambulances on people improperly and often causes people she doesn't even know to have a problem with her.

She messages strangers constantly and argues with them because she doesn't understand so many things about the world and she gets really nasty so quickly. It's not always her fault but she is the start of it all and she's also constantly putting worrying statuses about suicide etc that people keep getting upset over.

Important to note - she lives in secure housing with care workers 24/7 and is often on suicide watch so when I say how she puts these messages up etc it is serious but I know she's being looked after.

She puts herself in danger repeatedly and she's hurting so many people, plus she keeps screenshot ting conversations with anyone and posting them.

But my passions tend to coincide with my logic, I've been thinking about which colleges to apply to as of late and I'm seriously considering fashion school. I'd love to be able to double major with business as well, just to have something 'safer' thrown into the mix. I believe that a job should have a bit of your passion, but more of something you can bear doing. Like, I don't love washing the dishes but I can handle it and it's not a task I dread...but with fashion school, there are two things I fear. For one, I don't want to waste my time chipping away at a passion that might eventually fade. My second fear is that I'll fail. I understand that the world of fashion is extremely turbulent and competitive and one of my biggest fears is that I'll fail and it'll all be for naught. I don't want to be left with a degree in fashion unable to find a high-paying job just because I was stupid as a teenager and chose to follow my dreams. I apologize for my cynical tone, but these are very likely outcomes. I feel like going to a regular college and getting a degree in something more viable like business would allow me to get a steadier job... I have faith in my talents and myself, but that doesn't matter if other people don't have faith in my talents, right? I mean, I'm obviously gonna be applying to other schools anyways, but should I get accepted, would it be a good idea to go? I plan on only applying to most prestigious schools as a way of 'playing it safe'. It's quite an ambiguous path, really, and I think that's what I fear the most. On top of that, nepotism often dominates creative industries...which is another thing to fear. Well, either way the path to success is rocky and often foggy - even so, is this a good idea?

We have our shift bid coming up next month and I finally have the option to work second shift (2PM-10PM) if I choose too. The hard part of this decision comes down to my wife... We both hate that I'm not able to be at home with her at night and she often gets scared being by herself. We don't live in the best city.. I am certainly tired of working the night shift and miss being able to go to bed with my wife every night. BUT... Going to second shift will take away a lot of the time I currently have to spend with her in the evening after she gets home, as well as on weekends when she is off. I currently have Sundays off so it's nice having that full day together and being able to have dinner and chill time for a couple hours every night. But she gets so sad when I have to leave and it really does take a toll on me every week seeing her like that. I have asked her what she would prefer me to pick but she will not give me any advice as to what to do. I just know that whatever my decision is, she will still be alone at times.. either all night during the week or pretty much the whole weekend and when she gets off during the week. It's been really bringing me down trying to come up with a decision and I don't know what to do since she won't tell me her thoughts on it. We don't see either shift as being ideal but it's my only two options right now because I don't have enough seniority to pick the morning shift..

I was an awful friend, I treated they more like a therapist and a friend and I regret it so much. I always asked if they were in the right headspace my rants but they said they were worried about my reaction. And I feel awful for not noticing it sooner and for not doing something about it.  
       
       I have so many regrets and I just want to make it right and apologize and be friends again. Which I know I’m not entitled too and I wouldn’t blame them for not wanting to speak to me ever again. They said it was just a break but I’m worried i might have lost them for good. They asked for space so I’m obviously going to give it. I apologized but it doesn’t feel like enough. 

        I really care about them and I want them to be happy, and if me not being in the picture is gonna do that then I get it. But I’m just not sure what they want. And I just want to make it right. 

        Is there any to fix it? I just want to know if I can or if there is something I can try. I would like to know if there’s things I should do to work on myself. I started journaling so I don’t have to vent as much. But I want to be a better person for not only myself but future friendships and if I can save this one, for them.

Extra info that is probably important:
- we dated for a little bit, about four months. I struggle with identifying my emotions so I don’t know if I’m over them quite yet as it was a few months ago. In hindsight I should’ve given myself more time before diving into friendship but

286,"I [16M] have been dating my girlfriend [16F] for 7.5 months. I really love her. She has told me in the past that she feels her parents neglect her. She also doesn't have many friends.


I was cuddling with her in my bed. I gave her a kiss, stared into her eyes, stroked her hair back, and told her ""I love you *gf's name*"". It was the first time I've told her that I love her. She gave me a choked up I love you too. I asked her what was wrong. She told me that me saying that, how I said it, that I said it while holding her close, and especially the way I looked at her made her feel more loved and cared for than she has ever felt. She then started crying. She said she can't remember the last time someone has told her that they love her. I told her that I'd make that up to her by telling her I love her again and again for all the times she deserved being told that but wasn't and that I love telling her how I feel about her. This made her cry harder and she told me she just wishes her parents told her that more often.


Later when I was thinking about it, I was worried that me telling her I love her makes her sad about her parents. Like when I told her that I'd say it again and again  she immediately brought up how she just wants her parents to say it. That makes me think I shouldn't say it as it makes her feel bad. Don't get me wrong, I love her a ton and want to say it. It was really hard holding in those words for so long when I thought it was still too early to tell her.

288,"I am 15 right now and going to be 16 later in the year. My dad is British, but I was born in America and have lived in America my entire life, although I have been to the UK many times to visit family, and know lots of people there and like a lot of things about the UK more than the USA. I have a US passport, but in the past 6 months - year have realized I can apply for a UK passport because of my dad. The only hurdle is my mom. You see, my dad doesn't really care either way what I do, but my mom seems to not support this.  

The main reason I want to apply for a UK passport is because I like the country a lot and while I am very young, want to be able to live there at some point. The other reasons I want to apply specifically now is because right now since everybody is at home and theres not much to do, this is the perfect time to do this because I know my parents won't have time to help me or give me the documents at all when things go back to normal, so I want to use this window to actually get it done before it becomes significantly harder to track down all the documents. Not to mention, If I wait until I'm 16 my passport will cost more because it will be an adult passport. And if I wait until I'm an actual adult (18+) then it will be much harder to get my parents to help me send the supporting documents.

At random times during this past 10 months or so I have asked my mom to assist me but all these times she just tried changing the subject whenever I told her any of this and when I would actually ask her if we could do it, she would just say that it is useless. I was annoyed that she didn't care about this but I sort of understood at the time she was in an immigration process so she would need the documents and would have too much on her plate. However now that she has been done with her immigration process for 6 months and is working completely flexible hours from home I would hope she will understand and help me out, but from her reaction when I tell her that I want to apply for it in the next week or 2, it doesn't look like she will.

I can't lie because I am a little frustrated because every time I ask her if we can begin the process soon, she ends up saying that its useless and says something about her thinking it will make me not American anymore. I have literally put research into this and told her many times that I'm not getting citizenship, I'm getting a passport, and that since I have been a citizen since birth it will not affect anything. I have done so much research on this because of her that I find it kind of strange that I know so much about UK passport and citizenship by descent law. I secretly kind of think her dislike of the UK when she lived there has some effect on her decision making.

A couple solutions could be possibly waiting until I'm 16, because then I could get an adult passport, although I'm not sure exactly if I would be able to apply for this myself because while its an adult passport I am still a minor. Alternatively, even though my dad doesnt really like to get involved with this type of stuff, I could just tell him anytime in the next 6 months - year that I'm considering going to university in the UK and need a UK passport to avoid visa fees and whatnot, which isn't really a lie considering that I am thinking about going to the UK to study, but it could be hard for my dad to believe because he would consider it weird that I wouldn't want to stay in the US.

293,"So I’m a teacher doing zoom classes right now, and my students have an experiment today where they learn about how plants grow. I was supposed to have soil and seeds to demonstrate what a plant needs to grow. I forgot to buy soil, so on my way to work I decided to just scoop up some dirt with a cup. I got to work and was going to put the seeds in, when I noticed like 100 ants in my cup.
           THANKFULLY there’s a lid on my cup, so I don’t think the ants can get out. But I can’t use this for my experiment, so I need a way to kill the ants. I considered using the microwave, but that seems like a bad idea since there’s no ventilation in the cup. It’s a clear plastic cup, and I can see a whole civilization moving around inside.

I got in my spot and the oldest sister called me a prick. So I called her a little bitch. And she said it was a dick move and she didn’t even realize what happened. As if the nuisance didn’t take my spot just to make me mad. And the proceeded to get back up and get in it again. She then called me a weirdo for dragging me off the couch. And stormed out and two of them said violence isn’t the answer and wanted me to apologize. In short, I have someone purposefully being annoying and a sister who literally called me a prick, dick, and weirdo when she didn’t even know what happened.

298,"Last March, I got into a school others would kill to go to and I was very excited and I thought everything would go smooth. My plan was to get a nice GPA, have a good college life, get into medical school and bop the rest of my life would go pretty clean. 

But this did not happen. I made a regrettable mistake earlier this year and I stole from my campus bookstore and got caught. At that point I pretty much gave up on medical school as no medical school in their right mind would accept someone who did something like that. Since this incident, I haven't really been happy at all and I have been ashamed of myself every day. The only moments where I'm not thinking about this are the few seconds after I wake up and then I'm hit with the harsh reality that I fucked up my life. Then it became worse a few weeks ago. 

I had a writing assignment due along with midterms and I got super stressed out. I asked my friend for him as a reference so I could finish faster. In the midst of all this craziness, I ended up copying pretty much word for word 2 sentences onto my 10-page report and submitting it. My teacher is very meticulous and probably found it and is known to wait the whole quarter to hit those who commit such things with an ""F"" and report them for academic integrity. 

I wouldn't have cared that much if it was just me who will get fucked over by this but its also my friend. My friend is extremely hard working and really wants to go to medical school, much like I did before my first incident. However, this incident will also go on his record as an academic integrity violation and he will most likely be forced to retake the class, therefore, making his competitiveness for medical school drop significantly. I haven't told him yet with hopes that my teacher will have missed it and since there's nothing I or him can do about it. The anxiety from knowing that I fucked over my friend is killing me and I've found no escape from it. My head hurts all the time, it's hard to get sleep without getting high, my stomach is constantly in knots and my other classes are suffering as well. I fucked up the good life I had and I would kill myself if I didn't feel like I have this obligation to help my friend get into medical school since I fucked his chances at his dream even though I'm not sure how I can help him. 

 I don't know what advice one would give on this situation since no one is stupid enough to do all this when given the opportunity to succeed as I did.",20May2020,1
299,"My dad is an alcoholic. Has been since I was in high school. Whenever he drinks, he's emotionally manipulative and verbally abusive. He's only gotten physical a handful of times... but those times have scarred me likely for the rest of my life. There's a lot more to the story, but I feel like it's not relevant and I'm not looking for sympathy. Just advice.

Throughout the ups and downs of his alcoholism, I haven't really considered leaving the house. I've spent a lot of time away thanks to work and college, but I still come back for breaks and on some weekends (I work as a percussion tech at a local high school and it's easier to spend Friday nights at home to cut back on gas for competition weekends).

His most recent month in rehab, which happened to partly coincide with my state's quarantine, was the most peaceful time I've had at home in a while. I wasn't worried for myself or my family. I was able to sleep. I didn't have to spend time taking care of everyone. But when he came back, things went downhill for me mentally, and now that he's relapsed again, I'm not sure how much more I can take. Despite all the strides I've made to better myself now that I'm more independent, he continually brings me down.

**So this is where I ask for your advice.**

I've considered reaching out to friends in the area to stay with them, even just for a few days, throughout the remainder of the summer. Maybe just live from house to house. I don't know. But I worry that this would be a burden on them, and that's the last thing I want to do. I also worry that taking such action would put a strain on my mom, since she relies on me a lot whenever my dad hits his low points.

Of course it's also possible that my ideas are entirely delusional and I'm setting up unrealistic expectations. In which case, I just need guidance for where to turn next. This, again, is why I'm asking for advice.

Thanks everyone.",20May2020,1
300,"My cousin and I use to be super close we basically grew up with each other and after years we became inseparable. She became the sister I never had. My graduation and prom came around and she decided to work instead of showing up for me and that really hurt my feelings especially since I would never do that to the people I care most about. She was able to take the day off but decided not to so that added fire to the burn. On top of that none of my family members showed up for me except my mother everyone else had excuses. 

I really expected her to come this day meant a lot to me. Shortly after our relationship fizzled out because I felt like she didn’t value our relationship as much. We stopped talking for about a year and a half and then my other cousins wedding came around and we were forced to bond since we were both helping to plan .


Our connection was still there and it was amazing it felt like things were back to normal. Shortly after she asked me for help shopping . We spent the day together and continued to rekindle. Things were great it felt like the good old days but then she wanted to hang out again this weekend. 


As I started to reflect on things I realized how offended I really felt especially since I never received an apology. I’m not sure that I really want things to go back to the way they were because of how bad I felt after that situation. 


However I’m not sure if I am over reacting or I should feel entitled to feel offended. Anyway I wanted some advice on what to do 


Should I forgive and forget and hang out with her on the weekend OR

301,"I was talking to a friend on the phone and he started telling me how I'm not getting any younger ( I'm 29 ) and I need to get married and have kids. 

And then he said "" the rate you are going you not going to have kids until you are 40"". I felt insulted by this and got mad at him.

Thing is its not like I dont want to get married or have kids its just I haven't met anyone that likes me back and we are actually comparable. I feel really bad about this already I had no idea I would end up 29 and not married I can't force love and sometimes life just takes you by surprise.

302,"Im not sure if im a bad person for feeling this way but anyway

Im not sure what to in this situation and i would love some guidance from you amazingly helpful people, im going to try to make it as short as possible 

I went out with a guy (lets call him steve) in my young years in high school and we both were infatuated with each other, we dated on and off for 7 months cause we were young and didn’t understand relationships but we ended it shortly after the several months. But we kind of always knew we still had something. It was weird, we would make eye contact or just have a simple convo and its like we both just knew we had matured and still had something. It was like this for YEARS (like 5 years) and I eventually got a bf (hes an ex now) but we dated for 2 and a half years and still always thought about steve. During that relationship i ran into steve at a party(i had not seen him in probably a year till this party) and again, hes just so easy to understand, hes the most charismatic man he makes people laugh and genuinelyhappy where ever he goes, we talked all night and i could tell he really wanted more but i wasnt single at the time and was very loyal. Fast forward a year and me ans my bf break up and a couple months later i start hooking up steve. The mood of those nights were like something we both had been waiting for for years (he even said so) , and everything felt right.. until he ghosted me. And it broke my heart. Let me say that ever since i met steve i dont think theres been one whole week i havent thought of him . Cause i truly loved him , so i thought at least. Its been 5 months(feb) since that happened and ive been dating this guy for a month (march) now who is truly an amazing guy, ive never felt more loved by someone ever and is warms my heart to feel that. But steve texted me about a week ago asking how things were and its like my whole world just stopped when i saw that text. And here we are today.

So i guess my thing is, 
I have been obsessed with this guy for about 6 years.. and i feel he has too. But i love my current boyfriend but its like i feel like i am meant to be with steve. I dont know what it is its so hard to describe the feeling i feel when i see him . 

What do I do? 
Is he maybe just looking for a hook up thing or do you think theres something there?",20May2020,1
303,"So I (26 F) was cleaning my backyard about a week ago. I stood up and turned around and there was this guy on his balcony with binoculars pointed right at me. I was wearing shorts and bending over to clean up so instantly I felt like he was creeping on me. I just stood there staring at him, giving him a dirty look and he kinda moved them a bit and then I waved at him and he immediately went into his apartment and closed the blinds. 

I was like whatever and kept doing the lawn. I look his direction a few minutes later and he’s out there on his balcony staring at me again! I make it known that I see him and he grabs a book and (I’m assuming) pretends to read it. 

I went inside and couple minutes later I check and he’s gone inside too. Which again makes me think he was just out there to watch me. 

Basically, any advice on what I can do about this creep? I don’t believe at this time he is doing anything illegal however my younger sister and I live alone and it is very unsettling to have this guy around. Especially if it persists.",20May2020,1
304,"Hello everyone!

I've been looking for a job recently after quitting my last job because of harassment issues. I've been unemployed for roughly 3 months now and have been living off of my financial aid from school. (I took out a bunch of loans so that I could quit my job). I recently accepted a job offer from this company that pays decent, but the work isn't necessarily what I feel most comfortable with. I've already accepted this job because I need the money, but I'm still looking for a better place to work in the meantime. I recently got a call back from another company offering me an interview over the phone. It's a similar workload, but more pay (not much more, but more non-the-less) and better scheduling from what I can tell so far. Today I had an interview at 1 PM. 

This past week the company has sent me 3 emails verifying and reminding me that the phone appointment is set for 1 PM but I should expect to receive a call anywhere between 1 PM and 2 PM. I cleared up the hour and made sure I was available for the call. At 12:45 PM, I receive the phone call. At that moment I was in the restroom and did not hear the phone ring. When I come out, I notice I had a missed call from an unknown number. They left a voice message saying ""Hi Y/N, we *had* an interview scheduled today at 1 PM, please email me if you'd like to reschedule."" I then received an email at 12:50 PM saying the same thing. ""we **HAD** an interview at 1 PM today, would you like to reschedule."" 

I'm very upset because they called 15 minutes early and from an unknown number so I couldn't call them back. I replied at exactly 1:01 PM stating that I'm available now. I didn't receive an email back for another two hours before they replied: ""I will call in the morning."" They didn't ask for my availability nor mention that they called **15 MINUTES EARLY**? I've asked multiple friends and colleagues if I'm in the wrong and they said that I'm not and that the company should be expected to be punctual as well as myself. *Please correct me if you disagree.* Because of this whole situation, I'm questioning whether I even want this job if I have to work with someone who is so willing to waste my time? At my last job, the hiring manager was the assistant store manager who I worked with on a weekly basis. I consider this very unprofessional and don't think I can work with someone so disrespectful. 

My main fear is that if I quit my current job I'll be stuck in a toxic environment of employers who don't care about my time and a similar situation to my previous job would take place.

So questions time.....
* Am I in the wrong?
* Is this job worth it given the benefits vs the cons?
* Am I overreacting? *Note: I know in the grand scheme things, the rescheduling is not that big of an issue as I don't have anything scheduled for tomorrow and am able to take the call, but it's the principle behind it that urkes me. They refused an interview and blamed it on me even though they called 15 minutes early, then had the audacity to reschedule to their convenience without consulting me.*
* Any additional Thoughts?",20May2020,1
305,"Hello! 
I have a good friend of mine who has many issues with her family life, and it helps her to vent her problems with her friends and recently I and another of our friend has been asking her to consider talking to our school councillor (we are in High School).
She says she’s not against the idea and is all for it when she’s in a bad situation, but when the day comes around she backs out of the idea and says she’ll just wait it out.
As her friend, I’d like to be able to be there for her in the best way possible, but I’m not sure if I should push her to seek help or just keep being there for her until she’s out of her shitty household.
And her household is not the worst in the world, but she’s constantly overworked, and her parents are neglectful, with her having to take care of her little siblings even if her mum doesn’t work, and has all the time in the world to take care for them. Which is especially troublesome now, as she has to complete her work at home because of covid-19.
What can/should I do?",20May2020,1
306,"This is my very first post on reddit. With therapist offices being closed and me having no one to talk to I feel like this is my only option. For almost a year now (we have been dating for almost 3 years), my boyfriends (M23) entire family, yes I mean ENTIRE family, mother, 2 sisters, 2 brothers, the brothers girlfriend, and the other brothers wife, have collectively decided to hate me. They talk shit about me to my face, as well as behind my back to my boyfriend. It has gotten so bad that I have had to sadly block all of their phone numbers, as well as block all of them on every social media. 
It all started when I graduated college and moved to where his entire family lives to be close to him and find a job (we were long distance in college). We had to live with his parents at first be I had no income. The situation was obviously not ideal, so the second I got a job my boyfriend and I both collectively decided to move out of his mothers house. Sounds like the smart thing to do right? Surely no sane person wants their adult son and girlfriend living with them forever. Guess again. His mother was so profoundly furious that we had moved out that she started creating scenarios in her head about me being controlling, manipulative, evil. I am being completely genuine when I say all I have ever wanted was his family to like me. 
I did not have a good family situation growing up so the very last thing I ever wanted was to go through what I went through again. I have bent over backwards trying to be loved by his family, but I have never kissed their asses, I am not a suck up, and I think that’s part of the reason they dislike me? My Bf has told me that his two brothers, gf and wife have always been major kiss asses when it comes to his family and since I’m not that maybe they aren’t used to it. 
Anyway so the mother decided to make up scenarios in her head about me, and then starts to push those false thoughts onto all of his siblings. Soon enough now they all think these things about me. There’s nothing I can or can’t say or do that will change their minds. I don’t even think my boyfriend is standing up for me, I know it is hard for him because (sidetrack) they emotionally abuse him as well, which I started to see once their whole issue with me began to unravel. I knew about a little bit of it before but not to this extent. And trust me when I say it is unfathomably heart wrenching to read what his family sends to him every single day. Guilt tripping him for having moved out of the house an ENTIRE year ago. 
They only want him back living there because they make him do all of their dirty work. Not to mention the mother basically forced her oldest daughter (28F) and oldest son (32M), whom ALSO has a wife and 2 kids, to move back into her house bc “she needs her family to be super close and they need to stay like that,” yes actual words from her mouth. It’s just absolutely insane to me. 
Regardless of that, I have never said anything mean or negative to them, have tried my very best to be kind and civil until all of this started. Since it started I never said one mean thing to them despite the constant harassment. 
What drove me to blocking all of them was the toll it was taking on my mental health, which I already have severe issues with on my own. What should I do. I really love my boyfriend but it’s killing me inside to know how his family feels about me, and the emotional toil that they are putting him through simply for dating me. I love him so much, but how can I live the rest of my life with him, knowing that they all hate me. Is the relationship worth it? :( 

I know this is an open forum but I would really appreciate only real answers or positive answers only, no extreme negative trolling or anything like that. My mental health is very low right now and like I said earlier this seems like the only place I can ask about this and get some honest answers. Thank you everyone.",20May2020,1

For a whole year, whenever me and my big bro have gone on a trip/adventure/ride out somewhere, I've picked up a rock. At the start he didn't notice, but the past few months (before lockdown, anyway) he'd ask why. 

I just responded ""shut up and help me find a pretty one."" And he did. 

Unbeknownst to him, I've kept every rock and wrote him a little note for each one, reminding him of the day and letting him know just how grateful I am that he's in my life and how much I love him.

It's his birthday next month and I have dozens of rocks and notes. Problem is, I have no idea how to present them all to him. Each rock has the date written on, so I was toying with the idea of putting them all in a box and letting him pick out random ones and just reading the corresponding notes.

I somehow thought it was a good idea to troll this guy by texting “she said it was small”. In hindsight, this was a v bad idea. It escalated with him asking me where I am and texting me “kkkkk thank you so much paid after you sit on my dick”.

Turns out another friend of mine snap texted me saying that one of her friends was added by the same guy and he texted the same message “kkkkk thank you so much paid after you sit on my dick”. Later she texted me that he was using my legal name. I saw a notification saying that I should turn add a phone # so i’m implying that he tried to login to my account.

312,"My brother is now 19 and in college for concept art and other art related things (I'm not exactly sure). I am 17(F) and worried he's going to become the classic man-child you see in media. 

First off I would like to say I love my brother dearly and would die for him. He is someone I've looked up to my entire life and I want him to do well in the future. But as we're both graduating high school and moving into a new phase of our lives I am worried about him. 

He is a classic nerd. He loves anime and has plenty of figures lined up in his room. He is also obsessed with cryptids and aliens. He's very good at most art especially monsters, buildings and anything non-human. He is also great a ceramics, jewelry and painting. But the one thing he loves to draw is anime characters and monsters. 

Now most of his monsters are great, creepy and well rounded but his characters are another thing. They are your stereotypical new artist characters. Very much sketched out, big heads, big eyes and skinny ass limbs. The characters you see middle school nerds drawing. But he loves drawing them and I don't have the heart to tell him they are bad. 

That's not the main problem though. My brother is not very vocal with his emotions and frankly I've almost never seen him sad or cry. But you can tell a lot about him through his art. 

Lately he has been drawing himself with long hair and he has been growing it out for sometime. Men with long hair doesnt bother me, what bothers me is the type of person my brother is combined with the long hair. It totally gives off the ""I'm 33 and live in my mom's basement and collect anime figures"" vibe. Which to be honest I really do not want to see my beloved brother end up like that. 

I've talked with some of my brother's friends and a lot of them have told me that he has never had any interest in love or relationships. This concerns me even more. With more prying they have said he never talks about being in love or having a crush on girls or boys when the subject comes up. I dont care if my brother is asexual or aromantic, I just want him to be comfortable with that. But again I have more concerns, these same friends have told me that my brother ""jokingly"" talks about being in love with fictional characters. Now I'm no stranger to this, but that phase ended for me a while ago, what scares me is that my brother is 19 and still acts like that. 

I don't want him to be made fun of for being like this. Not to mention that he fits the man-child stereotype even more because he has thick glasses and very bad acne. It breaks my heart thinking that people might make fun of him for being the way he is and worries me that he might become that man-child who is outcast from society. 

I am leaving my home state soon meaning that I can't protect him anymore. It terrifies me that there's a possibility he might become a man-child. I don't know what to do. Is there any way I can help? Would I just seem like a nuisance? Am I overreacting? 

I don't know anymore. 

TL;DR : My brother is becoming a stereotypical man-child and I'm afraid I can't do anything about it.",20May2020,1

There was brush all over the place. The cap to the well is a piece of rotting plywood that's not even completely covering the well. There was some sticks, leaves, and mugs floating around in the water, so I cleaned most of it out. Out closest neighbor is maybe 100-150 ft away. Our well is in a small valley, and their house is up the hill. I don't think they run off a well though. I walked by their house, and they has one if thos big black tanks, with the pvc pipe coming out the top. There are a few neighbors below us, and the closest one is maybe 200 ft from the well but theres a large hill between them.

316,"So I started off quarantine pretty positive and pushed myself to stay in shape by doing at home and bodyweight workouts and going for runs outside. I live in the dessert so now that it’s hit May, it’s around the 90s and hot as hell. Because of this and just how much I actually hate body weight workouts, I haven’t been working out lately and have lost a lot of muscle mass which I usually maintain at the gym. I don’t have any weights at home but have been using water gallons and water bottle cases alongside resistance bands to imitate it as much as possible but the weight isn’t heavy enough and can only keep my interest for so long. 
Recently my boyfriend who actually has a bench and weights at his parents place started working out again and you can tell he’s getting bigger. He’s commented a few times off hand my “fitness level” like on FaceTime saying I have a double chin or if I told him I was getting off FaceTime to go and work out he would be like “ you?! Workout?!” and I know he’s joking but I can also tell there’s probably some truth to it too. I usually just shrug it off bc even if I’m not working out I’m still petite and lean and a double chin was more a matter of angles on FT so whatever. Tonight he brought it up again and was saying how big his arms were getting and how he was hitting new PR’s and said I should probably step it up or I’m going to be the girlfriend that everyone questions why he’s with. And that just. Struck a nerve?? He followed it up by saying “I mean I personally don’t care either way but if you wanna be that girlfriend that’s up to you” and I was like alright I’m done with this conversation and hung up.

317,"For the past 7 and a half months there have been some odd occurrences happening in my house/neighborhood. My first instance was when I came home and my T.V. was on. This was weird because I normally don’t watch T.V. at all. I remember picking up the remote to turn it off and it was a bit greasy. I had to wash my hands after picking it up. 

My second instance was on a drive home from work. Spring Break had just begun at my kid’s school so I left work early to surprise him. As I was pulling into my driveway, I hit a massive bump. It felt like the back of my car nearly flipped over the front. I stopped and got out of the car to see what I hit, there was a decent sized pot whole where my driveway met the street. Looking at this whole I remembered I don’t even have kids, I was thinking I was the father of my brother’s kids for some reason. This was a weird feeling and I definitely feel like it was some sort of supernatural experience. 

My third instance was when I was taking a shower. I hate to admit it but I tend to cry in the shower, usually because I’m not a fan of how my life went, but also because it feels good. While I was crying, I accidentally knocked the shower head and it began to spray on the shower door. The water drizzled down into the shape of a perfect circle. I remember swiping off one of my tears and flicking it into the center of the circle. While I did that, the shower water weakened a bit and then went back to normal. This gave me the chills. I can’t help but feel it was some sort of supernatural experience. 

But here’s where things get scary, every night for the past two weeks, right as I’m falling asleep, I hear the kitchen cabinets open and close. I get spooked and I try to fall asleep again, but right as I begin to drift off, I hear my kitchen cabinets open and close. One time I went to investigate. Everything looked normal, no trace was left behind. I’m pretty certain my mind wasn’t playing tricks on me. 

Right now, I am laying in bed, fully awake. I am certain I heard a kitchen cabinet slam. I don’t know what it is and I don’t want to jump to conclusions. I don’t want to get the police involved. Someone just please give me advice, I can’t take it anymore.",20May2020,1
318,"hi friends! im going through it rn so help your boy out (please). i’ve been talking to this girl for the past month now and she is amazing, &amp; i know a month isn’t a long time but it feels like a lot when you text every day. she’s given some surefire signs that she’s into me, like we exchanged numbers through dm &amp; started messaging, snapchat every day, she calls me ‘b’ sometimes and greeted me with “hi cutie” before, the endless smileys :), etc. we even scheduled a date for lunch after quarantine and she seemed upset that it couldn’t happen sooner. i really REALLY like this girl, &amp; i don’t want to mess it up like how i did in the past by seeming too clingy through text or anything. the only reason why im a little unsure of if she is actually into me or not is because she isn’t the fastest responder &amp; sometimes i can see that she’s posted something on her private story and she hasn’t opened my snap or read my texts, but one time i made a joke about it and she said she just gets overwhelmed pretty easily with her phone and she isn’t trying to ignore me - which is COMPLETELY understandable, so idk why exactly im getting so paranoid and letting one small inconvenience trump every subtle sign she’s given me.

319,"Probably gonna hurt my ego here but fuck it. Me and my girlfriend were talking about having a threesome. Simply talking. No plans or anything. Anyway after talking it out with her I realized I don't think I could handle one, for sort of a petty reason.

What If the guy has a bigger dick? Dumb maybe, but, here me out.

I'm not insecure sexually in general. I have a long dick, amaze balls stamina (I can literally pick when I cum), and try to be an open minded attentive lover.

My one insecurity is my girth. My girth isn't bad but its also nothing special. That's always been a bit of an insecurity for me because I know that girls love that stretched out feeling.

When we have sex I need to warm her up before she can take me. My dick can also touch her Cervix. It's just once she's really warmed up and relaxed I sometimes feel like she could be stretched out more /use some more girth. She goes from tight to water after a while and its nice and easy to thrust in and out of her.

She even said she wouldn't mind getting a dildo slightly larger than me so I'm pretty sure she feels the same...

I should mention that I'm her best sexual partner. She has few and the ones she has had never made her orgasm. Not going to lie. It's kind of a turn on /sense of pride.

So if we have a threesome and the dudes dick is bigger (thicker tbh) I just don't think I could handle it. I would compare myself and wonder could I ever make her feel the same thing and yadayada. Would I still be her favorite?

Basically should I be worried about this ladies? Is a bigger dick just better? I know big dick can hurt too.

Girls who've went from a large partner to a smaller one, Do you miss the larger dick sometimes??",20May2020,1

I didn’t think much of it until it started to get annoying but I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it. The tapping is actually going on as I’m writing this.  They come periodically sometimes in the morning sometimes at night and it get really annoying because it comes randomly, like a person tapping on a drywall. 

In the first weeks, each room got a letter from reception/front desk and it was stuck on the gap in the door. As the weeks go by, I started to notice that the paper was still in the gap in that room that was making the tapping noise. Obviously someone could just put it back in the gap but why go through all that trouble?

Like I’ll see a ton of famous people on TikTok and wish I was talented, famous, or rich like them I want to make content like them but them concept of doing it for fun becomes clouded by fame and when I post a video and it only receives 50 likes or sometimes 0 I delete them and feel bad.

I see all these talented people whether it’s in music or on social media and wish I was that funny, that creative, that talented, or that lucky. I constantly compare myself which makes me feel insecure about myself. Like I dislike my appearance and voice since I have a cleft palate. These disabilities or flaws also stop me from pursuing what I want which makes me even more sad.

I think about my future and so many teens are fine with the concept of having a few friends, and a 9-5 career for their entire life, but I don’t want that and the fact that I’m off to college soon and will be living that life and not the one I will never get makes me upset. I’m so absorbed by the numbers and popularity to the point where it becomes toxic. Mixed with my social anxiety I’m usually alone with no actual friends and anything I try and do I feel constantly self conscious.

I know this is the stupidest, most first world issue and a lot of people will make fun of me or say that’s just life but I can’t live with the idea I will be nobody and that’ll die a mundane life.

I don’t want to not be talented, creative or successful and I know it’s not healthy to compare myself to others since some creative ideas or whatever could be one hit wonders or whatever but my brain never comes up with creative things and I feel so boring.

On my last post I explained my current situation with facts and less expression of my emotions and man did I get trashed. For one I feel like it’s because I’m a girl and people just expect us to be at people’s feet from the get go. Play the game like a man and everyone suddenly hates you. Idk maybe Im wrong. Hoping I am. 

I’ve given it some thought and my past relationship I was with someone who did me really really dirty. I’d see him all day- for the most part- everyday (worked together) and kept constant communication. Never was the jealous type, oh you’re going out with you friend., cool! Be safe. Never questioned or assumed who where what time who else would be there. None of that jealous non sense. Few months later I get a text from a girl who says she’s been in a relationship with him. They see each other every day and that they constantly have sex. I’m crushed. I put them in a three way call and that motherfucking mayo has the audacity to still! lie while being exposed. As if I didn’t learn my lesson enough, I take him back. Just to see more of him that is sex-crazed porn obsessed and condescending towards me having to forgive him  about the cheating. Instead of being compassionate like he wanted to work things out he made me feel worse for feeling betrayed in the first place. (Please Im young and no guidance in relationships, I try) We end up finally breaking up. 2 weeks later I find out I contract chlamydia from him because of his ex gf messing with other people as well. Great not only do I get cheated on but test positive for chlamydia while giving it to someone else I slept with after him. 

I know it’s a horrible excuse and which has got me thinking about my actions and when I cheated on this current guy I’m seeing. Now I see everything as a sign and over analyze it completely. Truly I want to be in a relationship but I feel like I don’t even know how to choose or trust myself to do so. Everything in my life is fine but this is where I can’t get right. I “cheated” but it was in a way where if anything he did went south I had the upper hand and felt less stupid for being loyal(which I can be even to a fault). He tells me a lot he tries to be a good guy and if he simply was playing games he would not let me get so invested and speak about me to his friends and let me sleep over and have me over as much as he does. And although I do understand everyone is different and what one past person did has NOTHING to do with how the next person will treat you it’s been difficult for me to recognize how immature I’ve been. I believe I’m a good person but when things like this happen I’m not too sure.

I’ve given him my thoughts on it, which had no affect. 

I, of course, am concerned with him potentially infecting me but additionally he works a job which is also deemed “essential” and is in close quarters with his co-workers, many of which are older and likely in a higher risk category of people. 

Should I be concerned? Am I out of line being frustrated beyond words to his behavior?

I would tell him I understand why he thought or did thing the way he did, then I explain what I believe otherwise. I'm not an aggressive person to begin with, so my tone is never pushy; but I'm also assertive in what I believe in, so nor am I a doormat type personality— I keep my tone and pace steady and rational.

Well the thing is, father is very much a sexist. (One time my mother was breaking down from all the chores she had to do along, he literally said ""Well women are supposed to do all the chores in a home."") Me not backing down immediately (like my mother always does) irritates him and hurts his pride. So no matter how I try to create a peaceful and equal ground of communication, he attacks anyway.Honesty I don't care if he ""wins"" or not. But every time I go through an unproductive argument like this, listen to his insults and put up with his unreasonableness hurts me immensely. 

To add insult to injury, he is also a respected professor in a prestigious university where I live, and my parents likes to tell people about our family affairs. I got to know this through one of his closest colleagues, his colleagues's son, his students, his friends, etc. (He used to walk into the bathroom knowing I was in there; one time I couldn't stand it anymore and confronted him. Somehow I got called immoral, don't know how to behave myself, and some extremely insulting and vulgar slurs. Later on my mother decided to tell my teacher at school about the incident, and some of my classmates' parents ended up knowing about this. Without context or knowledge of our 19 years of family life, they took the father/professor's side by default, and from these people who I once was friends with, I was hurt over and over again by their untrue accusations of who I am and condescending lectures.)

There has been so many times my reputation got unfairly ruined by my toxic parents. I don't care if they keep trampling on me in the family. But sometimes I fear their mouths will follow me wherever I go.

Some of the girls acted like they were down and the main person who I am focusing on in this post, I don’t think she even responded to the text.

You can choose your name, pronouns and if you want certain options on. ( Flirting, sudden click off, mini games, lore, Easter eggs, music.) It has multiple options and multiple endings.

- Do you touch it -Eat it raw -Cook it (only available if you clicked an earlier mini stove and kept it -Adopt it as your new buddy -Sit and watch -Not even mind it and walk away -Turn around and leave the forest?

Obviously the first few days hurt but we're still close friends and she's shown me that she's there for me when I need her. So, in reality, I haven't lost too much. When we were dating, I opened up to her about my problems a lot, and she helped me through some tough times (even when she didn't always know exactly what my issues were). It was pretty awesome and a huge burden off of my shoulders. 

Now that we're not dating anymore, I really just haven't felt as comfortable opening up to her. I still do sometimes, but not nearly as often (maybe one small problem since we broke up). Even though I know with all of my heart that she's there for me, I have all of these doubts floating around in my mind about whether or not she'll breach the mutual trust between us. 

There was one occasion a couple of weeks ago in which I felt that she genuinely disrespected my privacy on an issue, but that's the only concrete thing that I can point to. I brought it up to her, but she just dismissed me (very unlike the typical way she would respond to me bringing up a problem). It was an isolated incident, but it contributed to my doubts.

The bigger doubts that run through my head are the thoughts that she's given up on me. I know almost positively that it's not true, because she's generally shown that she cares about my feelings and wellbeing. But again, my worrisome mind keeps causing me to lose hope in her care for me. 

In a few months (depending on how this whole corona thing plays out), we'll be moving to different colleges on different ends of the country. She's one of the three friends in my life that mean enough to me to keep in touch with, and I honestly don't want to ruin that. My goal is for us to stay relatively close over the next four years, but I'm worried that my doubts will come in the way of us preserving our relationship and push us further apart. That leads me to my questions for advice. Answer one, multiple, or all. Whatever you think you can weigh in on. 

How do I get over these doubts to preserve our friendship?

Do you think the relationship is worth fighting for, or is this whole situation weird to you?

Is it worth the effort?",20May2020,1
354,"reddit, i'm asking for advice. i am feeling malicious and i never get this way.

recently, my roommate and i (shes 19 im 20) moved into our first apartment together, in a small town outside of the city. its a beautiful apartment, and everything about living here has been great, until we found the catch. 

the first night after we moved in, my roommate and i were listening to music in the kitchen around 1030pm while we're eating. we get a military knock at the door, we don't have a peep hole so i have to open it. its a middle aged lady (we'll call her Jane), probably mid 40's, she says, "" IT IS 10:30 AND MY SON IS SLEEPING. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING? I MANAGE PEOPLE'S PAYMENTS.. blah blah blah blah blah"" and i politely apologized and turned down the music- which was totally fine, we don't know this place and we need to be respectful.  the next day, i get the same knock at the door from Jane, but its at 830pm. 

this time after she finished yelling at me, i tried to introduce myself- i was going to bring up that city-wide quiet hours begin at 10:00, but she didnt even give me the chance. i asked her for her name and she said ""you dont need to know who i am"" and continued to bitch at me and get in my face - mind you, WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. like you should not be this close to me right now (especially w/o a mask) i closed the door on her and thought about how to handle this. she absolutely hates us. and it feels like shit.

i got a card for her, it said something to the effect of ""we got off on the wrong foot, and out of respect i would like to give you my name and number for any future purpose""  i dropped it off in front of her door. - also note: she gets up at like 545-6 every morning and is stomping around making loud enough noise to wake me up

didnt hear anything from her.

our other neighbor (lets call him John) he is probably in his 60's )) that same day told us we were being loud, but he was very nice about it and asked us to put felt on the cabinet doors- he said that his pictures/paintings fall off the wall when we close our cabinets because the walls are so thin. (which i dont know to what extent is true but whatever)

3 weeks pass and its 3pm this past tuesday (19th) and i get a knock from lady neighbor Jane upstairs. immediately she asks ""are you smoking pot?"" i said no, she proceeded to tell me how she smells it and it must be us (we werent smoking) i told her sorry, its not us so i dont know what to tell you. 

around 730pm i was getting ready to head out of the house, and my roommate and her friend were on the couch watching a movie. my roommate opens the door this time but i just listen. its John, and i look up and i see Jane in the stairwell eaves-dropping on our conversation, trying not to be seen. John is accusing us of smoking pot!!! saying that the smell of weed kicks up his asthma and he can smell it through the walls all the time, which is a load of shit because we weren't smoking - and also if this was a problem then why did nobody say anything before?? this seemed too coordinated  but i could be paranoid too.. he goes on saying ""i pay good money to be here, you signed the lease and there is no *marijuana* on this property"" blah blah fuckin blah. my roommate said sorry, kindly of course, and told him that we could exchange numbers for any future purposes, he was clearly angry and she was just trying to end the conversation, which in my opinion, is more than she had to do considering we weren't doing anything wrong. he responded to that by saying ""Im your neighbor why cant i just knock on your door?"" \*\*sidenote\*\*personally, as a 20 y/o female, im not trynna open up the door to 60-something year old john while im walking around in my underwear in my own home.\*\*\*\* but thats past the point.

did i mention he had his phone up like he was recording the whole thing? he said he has a meeting with the property manager this week. 

that conversation ended, guess who showed up next? cops. 

the officer was incredibly nice - he said ""listen, i could care less about this. weed is legal here so whether you are doing it or not just remember the neighbors don’t like it"" didn’t  even ask me for my ID or anything, i was really relieved. 

however i now feel extremely unwelcome here. my lease is up in September and i plan on leaving then, but for now - how do i interact with my neighbors? do i at all? is it important to get along with them?? i understand that i live in an older community but i feel like these people are trying to intimidate us or something, i feel like this wouldnt be the situation if i were even 25 or 30. i didn't want to not get along with them, but i feel like i do not owe them any kindness or respect. they literally called the cops on us and directed blame for the smell of weed towards us!!! i seriously want to fuck with them just for being assholes. every time we walk in the building John opens his door quickly to see who it is, never waves or says hi, just looks and shuts the door. its weird. im uncomfortable, im angry, and i think quarantine has begun to make strange people stranger.

He tried multiple times to fight me and even tried to steal things from me (like my ball and my bycicle).
What do his parents think about him ? That he's a normal guy and just wants to be friends and that we should play with him ....

 We are the same age but I'm taller than him and probably more muscular but I'm not a douche who starts conflicts for fun ?! 

 When I was like in 5th grade that fucker would come to my friends who I was playing football and would sit there and just watch and ask if he could play.
 
 After some time he would go and straight up try to steal my backpack .
 He would also beat a guy and some of his friends bc he called them idiots.
 Like ok he called you idiots you call him the same or worse , but you dont get him behind the tree and punch him in the FUCKING STOMACH until he cries (all of these guys were in 5th grade at the time and now we are all in 7th grade except the bully who jumped 1 year ).
  I knew this was a problem when :

1) I didnt really want to go out in the park to not meer with him 

2)When at a party that happened a few months ago I didnt really want to socialise with the older guys bc of him . These guys were also the kind of kids who want to be cool and put gangstar shit on their profiles and carry knives and knuckle dusters on them .

365,"Bout a month ago, this friend who I'm particularly close with contacted me. She was talking about how she read this scene in this book that had made her feel weird (it was Twilight). In the scene, this attractive male character was just engaging in intense visual contact with the female lead. She described her feeling as a ""fluttering in her chest"". Now, in this kind of stuff I'm **sorta** experienced. I know my stuff but I'm obviously no expert. She tells me there's a fluttering feeling in her chest, that could mean 1 of 4 things. Either fear, dread, love or just plain arousal. I asked her if she was scared or dreading something that was gonna happen in the future and she said no. I asked her if she had fallen for someone and she said no. So I told her that I'm pretty sure she's just horny, but she ignored that. Fast forward to the day before yesterday and she says that she has that feeling again. Not to the same intensity of the first time she felt it but enough for it to be a 'nuisance'. So I asked her when did the feeling come back and she said it was after a ""strange dream"" and she couldn't stop thinking about it. She also refuses to tell me what happened in that dream because it's too embarrasing. By now I'm very sure she's just horny or feeling something near arousal. She asked me how to get rid of the feeling. I told her to just masturbate and call it a day since that's what you do when you're horny and you don't want to be. But she refuses to do that too. I'm not a girl and most stuff works differently for them. What is she feeling and what advice can I give her?",20May2020,1
366,"So part of this is going to be teenager things, that people will be like “why would you do that” and then explaining the situation.

So, I have a friend, and she sings some and she posted a thing asking people’s opinions on her, through an anon thing, cause people seem to have them. So I responded to it giving her tips on how to improve, and the only reason I did this was because I’ve seen a lot of people back on her for it. I just said the I noticed how she sung and ways to improve and things to remember, generally positive. She asked if I said it, and I told her I did, and just generally my background because I’ve been in choir for the last 6 years, and a section leader for 3. 

So today I was waiting in traffic, and i posted one of the anon things just being like “I haven’t posted one of these in a while so say something ig” and someone said “why to you think you’re a better singer than everyone” and then right after she said something and put her name on it so i knew she said that one. Because of what we talked about the night before and the fact that they were done back to back made me very sus about it, and I had a feeling it was her. I made a response, and was pretty much just like “I don’t think I’m better than everyone I never have or would say that” and then my experience and why I would never say something like that. She responded to it saying “why would someone say something like that? 🥺” which, for me set off red flags. I responded and was just like “I don’t understand your point in saying that cause Ik you posted it” and I should also add the few people who say it before were 1) one of my boyfriends online friends who wouldn’t say something like that 2) was someone who was in a different choir at my school but we don’t know each other 3) a random girl I was in a gc with. They all wouldn’t have said that but i think she would at least have motive to say something like that. She had responded saying “no I didn’t.

I have a friend, I’ll call him T, who is a pretty close friend of mine and is in the same friend group as me but the problem is once in a while he starts these huge arguments and we both get heated and after two days it ends and we’re back to normal. I’ve usually just brushed it off but this time it’s gotten to a point where I’m considering just completely unfriending him. What happened was me and him along with a few friends were playing video games and talking on FaceTime when an old friend of his got mentioned and it’s known that I don’t like this old friend. (I’ll call him C). I said something about C and T then said that he thinks that I just say I don’t like C simply to be “cool” because a lot of people don’t like him. I told him that’s bullshit and he’s done stuff to me. He completely disregarded that and kept going. Eventually I got angry and I told him about a time when C bullied me really bad and that’s why I don’t like him and somehow T kept saying he thinks I’m just saying I don’t like C to be cool. I later send him a long message explaining in detail why I was frustrated and within ten seconds I get a response from him saying “Are you done crying” and another saying “call someone who gives a fuck because I don’t”. We went back and forth a little but nothing really happened after that. I really want to just cut him off but the main problem is that he is really close friends with my best friend. It’s this plus the fact that we used to sit together at lunch and we had classes together (before school got cancelled).

372,"Hey, so for context, I don’t usually do this sort of thing, like EVER. This is a first for me.

 I met this girl online(in a game) a few months ago and we seem to hit it off, one thing led to another and I agreed to give the whole long distance thing a shot. She only lives a few hours away from me so it’s not too bad, except I’ve noticed a couple things and I’m wondering how red-flaggy they are I guess? 

 I know to make a relationship of this sort work, a good amount of trust is required. I fully understand that, but recently I’ve kind of noticed some things and I’m wondering if they mean anything or if I’m just over-analyzing it.

 To start, she said she had a “fucked up dream” that might make me mad(for context she didn’t talk to me that night saying she was too tired, also randomly sent me 1-2 messages later that night). So what, it’s a dream. She said she was horny at her place hanging out with her ex and called me to ask permission to fuck, and I said yes(in the dream lol). Now it’s just a dream, but she said she questioned why she would ask me after talking about the dream and I just brushed it off like fair enough I guess it’s a dream? Later in the day she also said if she was going to hook up with someone it would be with someone she’s already slept with and I quote, “and the border is closed so you can’t come.” Hmmm???

 Ok maybe I’m just looking for a negative, I’ll give the benefit of the doubt since she says she hates cheaters. She also said today that someone in her team(she plays a competitive game) asked her how many boyfriends she has. I asked why, she said she didn’t know and laughed. Ok, a little weird but I won’t jump to conclusions. 

 Now that thing that kinda made me ask for advice, is she claims that she’s an excellent liar and she’s good at covering shit up. Now I myself am an awful liar and she laughed when I said it. She also is very flirty and has openly said she likes to flirt. 

My question is, do I just try and stop this before I get super invested, or am I looking too hard into this? I have been cheated on before for context.

Also I’m on mobile so sorry lol",20May2020,1
373,"Sorry for the long post. TL;DR at the end. Reading the whole post/any advice would be much much appreciated!! 

I am in a buying/selling group on Facebook for let’s say, Beanie Babies. 

The group’s rule is that you’re not allowed to sell the beanie babies for more than double of its retail price. 

I was looking for a specific beanie baby for my sister that is a Canadian exclusive. 

Someone reached out to me and told me that they had two available. I was ready to purchase it, but they told me they’ll get back to me 3 days later on how much shipping would cost. 

A few days later, I messaged them asking if they had a quote ready for me. They said that they sold the beanie babies, but will look for more. 

It left a pretty sour taste in my mouth since the seller kind of just screwed me over. 

I brushed it off, because eventually they found more. When I posted in the group saying that I was looking for that specific beanie baby, I mentioned that I was willing to pay retail price+tax+shipping.  

I assumed retail price was how much the seller was going to sell it to me for because we never got around to discussing pricing. 

The beanie baby retailed for $15 CAD (around $10 USD), and the seller was selling to to me for $25 USD. At first I didn’t think much of it, until my sister informed me about how USD is stronger than CAD. 

I was pretty irked about how much the seller was overcharging me, but I decided to buy from her anyway. In total she sold me 8 beanie babies, and she specially requested that I send her extra money to cover the PayPal Good &amp; Services fees that get charged to the seller. 

I was pretty nice throughout the whole transaction, and gave into all of her demands. After I paid her for 3 out of the 8 beanie babies, she asked if I could send the rest of the payments through friends and family so that she wouldn’t get charged PayPal’s seller fees. 

I was going to do so, but then I noticed that I was going to be the one getting charged fees since she’s intentional. Sending money through friends and family would have costed me more in fees than just paying her through goods and service. 

I told her about it and she said that it shouldn’t charge me a fee, and that she’ll send me an invoice. She sent me an invoice, I paid it exactly how she requested it, and it charged her a fee. 

The final payment that I sent her, she requested that I send her the extra fees that got taken out of the invoice (she messed up, and requested that I pay her for her mistake.)

I didn’t want any drama, so I sent her the final payment, the seller fees that got taken out from the second payment, fees for the current transaction, and shipping. On top of all of it, I got charged foreign transaction fees from my bank for each transaction I sent her. 

I asked her how much the PayPal fees were, so I knew how much extra I needed to send her. She told me it was 2.9%+.30 cents. 

I sent her exactly that, but the fees ended up being $2 more than she thought. She sent me a screenshot of how PayPal took more than she expected, and I told her that I sent her what she requested 2.9%+.30 cents. 

We left it at that, and she shipped out my items. 

I ended up reselling the beanie babies she sold me, and I guess she caught wind of it because today she asked me for the extra $2 that PayPal took in fees. 

My sister and my boyfriend told me to ignore her because she had already made so much money off of me. She made over $125 USD profit off of me, and I sent her around $300 in total for the merchandise. 

I’m pretty irked that she’s bothering me over $2 when she made $125 off of me, and she was the one who told me how much extra to send her in PayPal  fees. If I sent her the $2, I would have to send her extra to cover the PayPal fees that it costs to send the $2, and foreign transaction fees with my bank. 

I feel kind of bad though. Should I pay her? Or just leave her be? I know it’s just $2, but she already made so much off of me that I’m irked she’s going out of her way to request that I send her more. 

TL;DR Bought toys from a Canadian (I live in the USA), she was charging me $25 USD per toy when it retails for $10 USD. Sent her money through PayPal and she requested that I cover her PayPal goods and services fees, sent her extra money every time to cover the fees, she told me it was 2.9%+.30 cents in fees. Sent her what she requested, but PayPal took out more in fees than she expected ($2 USD more to be exact). After shipping out my items, she messaged me 5 days later requesting that I pay her the $2. She made $125 profit off of me, but is bothering me for $2. It’ll cost me PayPal fees and foreign transaction fees just to send her $2. Should I pay her, or just ignore her request since she quoted me wrong?",20May2020,1

Those few months were great, I truly helped myself out. I got back on track with school &amp; overall helped my mental health a lot. I don't have friends, so I was incredibly lonely.

My mother stayed with me to raise me (she had a job too and worked her ass of as well). Thanks to my parents efforts I was able to have anything I needed. My father eventually started to get very religious and became a mormon (this is how he was able to beat alcohol addiction). Fast forward, I finished my bachelor degree, and got a very good paying job in Romania, so now I live independently and I can say I have almost everything I want.

There were always tensions between my parents and it was very difficult for them to live separately. They only saw each other 2 times a year and when they did they always argued. Mom is sometimes a difficult person and dad is a very sensitive and they are both frustrated with life in general. When I was in my last year in university, mom left the country too and went to live with dad abroad. All things seemed well but dad picked up his old drinking habits.

My mom sent me these pics yesterday. This is what he drank in a couple of days. He became very irresponsible and started shoplifting for alcohol. He was caught, fined, and now has interdiction in Tesco. In a strange episode he wanted to burn down their neighbor's fence. He gets violent with my mom (yells, threatens, physical abuse) and he does not let her go to the gym and buy proper food because it's expensive. She wanted to get a job but she barely knows english and dad does not want to help her in that regard.

My mom wants to come back home but she can't because of the current COVID-19 situation. She is basically stuck there. I know my dad is not a bad person and I managed to get where I am partially because of his financial support. I want to help them both but I don't know how.",20May2020,1

387,"I'll get straight to it. I (19F) am a white-passing Hispanic (I'm tan but have blue eyes and I bleached my hair and to make things worse I sound like a valley girl.) I come from a wealthy family in an area known for its money. I admit that I have definitely had many advantages in comparison to others, but I do not consider myself to be a ""spoiled brat"". I work for all of the things I have including my clothes, food, and phone. As a college student, my parents only support me financially for school and my car insurance. Coming from a Latino household, my parents have raised me to be humble about my advantages, and that it does not make me better than anyone else. This is a motto that we follow strictly. 

I avoid talking about my parent's professions or my hometown since in the past I have gotten comments such as "" oh so you're rich then huh"" or ""I'm surprised that you're not a brat."" Obviously it is a subject that makes me uncomfortable because I often get stereotyped as self-centered and conceited, and I do not want people to judge me based on my socio-economic background. 

Recently, word got around in one of my classes that I am from said-hometown. It was not until a friend (a little more than that but it's complicated) told me that a few people were going around telling others that I was rich and spoiled.  Yesterday we were having a conversation about cars and he said to me that I probably drive a Porsche, or could if I wanted to. I did not want to get into the topic about money or luxury so I responded saying that I do not like flashy things and changed the subject. 

Obviously I do not want my friend (who comes from disadvantaged background) to like me for my parent's money, but for who I am as a person.

It is unfair for me to say that I am embarrassed, but I really hate that people think of me like that 'rich white girl"" 

What can I do for people to like me for me instead of my parent's money?

(Im sorry if I sound whiny or bratty, I know that this isn't that serious of a problem but it is still something that bothers me.)",20May2020,1
388,"Hello
I just woke up at 4:30am and opened my eyes to a weird whisper. I immediately saw a person at the edge of my bed, squatting like gollum lol. I was wide awake and it wouldn’t go away when I moved towards it to get a better look. I really thought it was real until I shone the light on it",20May2020,1
389,"So about 2 weeks ago some shorts turned up at my house (they were bearing the marks of an expensive brand but im presuming its fake), these shorts came with an eBay return slip, with details like who had returned it and for what reason.
Just today a hoodie turned up at my house with the same brand, a return slip and all.

The address on the front is my address and the packages say my name, so its not as if they are meant for next door.

Contacted ebay and they couldn’t have cared less.

Im wondering if theres something shady going on underneath?",20May2020,1
390,"I’ll try to make the story as short as possible. Basically I thought it would be a good idea for my therapist to have a chat with my parents since they always complain about not knowing how to help me when I have a crisis or I’m feeling super anxious and have depressive episodes. I took the computer downstairs to the living room because my mom wasn’t feeling good enough to come upstairs to my room and I went back to my room. 

The thing is, my room is right above the living room and if you scream in the living room I can hear everything. Instead of normal tone of voice, they both started screaming that whenever I talk about not wanting to live anymore (I’ve tried to kill myself before but I stopped in time to give life another try. My parents have seen the scars on my arms which look disgusting) I’m basically threatening them and trying to draw their attention, when the only thing I want is some support. My suicide thoughts are real and very scary. 

I feel so angry and betrayed, I hate confrontation but I also feel like they were so disgusting I should confront them about it. Should I tell them I heard what they said? Is it too late since it happened yesterday’s evening? Should I say nothing? I feel disgusted and last night I felt so empty I couldn’t stop the suicidal thoughts. I can’t believe they think it’s all a lie. I feel like I have nothing to live for anymore. 

What should I do?",20May2020,1
391,"I used to passionate about studying (I'm a student), but these days I find it difficult to study for more than 20 minutes at a time. When I try to make myself work hard, my mind just rationalizes my laziness and I procrastinate. I have no motivation to work. I do fairly good at school without much effort, but even making that little effort has become impossible. I don't get the point of working hard- we'll all die in the end anyway.

394,"This might be a little of a long post? Im assuming. Mostly related to school/life.
Sorry for any spelling mistakes or grammar mistakes im on mobile + im just so emotional right now I cant think.

First off this is a throw away account I just made this to ask for help or...I dont know. 
Second some things to know for context, i'm (20 f), Im lower-middle class, I just recently finished community college with a 3.9 gpa, Im an artist I love art so much it makes me happy and I can escape. Im going to uni in August to get my BFA in animation. I work part time even during the 2 years in JC, and I live in an mentally abusive (once physically abusive) house hold. I have chronic depression and cPTSD mostly childhood truama. I have 5 truama events total: Molestation by my step uncle (30+) (12 years starting at 5 ending at 16) to which he fled the country and brother(at the time 16) (raped for 2-3 weeks at 5 yrs old). Then being physically and mentally abused by my parents (mostly by my mom) and then heavily bullied at school my whole school life. Then finally when the person who evaluates you to see if your going to kill yourself because I remark that I wish I could. Threatening 6th grade me that she'll lock me away with the 'other crazy kids that'll hurt you, forever' and telling my dad who was there hearing that, that she was egging him on to be mean to me during the evaluation telling him she'd help him put me into foster care to get rid of me. 
I've never cut, I've never dont drugs, I've never commited crimes, im very by the book, honestly I have no idea how I havent commited suicide quite frankly even my therapist made that remark. At the end of JC I was so stressed, lack of sleep and food, I almost passed out in class to which everyone witnessed and was forced to go to the ER (my theory is that I kinda experience, 'karoshi' death by stress however im here so, I almost did) although apparently all my organs were fine blood sugar fine everything fine, yet eveytime i tried to walk and talk i'd almost black out and after that for 3 months I had speach problems, I slurred my words and still memory problems. Then by pressure of my parents despite them knowing my condition and my doctor telling me to take it easy and recover force me to get a job so i do.

Now that thats out of the way, with what I have been putting up with so far in my life. I'll be starting with my current issue which has stumped me and im at a loss.
Houseing costs for uni, now you're probably wondering why a 'minor' thing would make me be at a loss compared to the shit i've delt with, well I'll tell you why: my escape from my fucking life. Is going to uni. school is my escape. 70k in loans + intrest roughly 100k I assume, over 20-30 years, not exactly the smartest thing. My tuitions all paid for I think. If I live at home I'd have no debt. But if I live at school i'll have debt but i'll be away from them. I dont know what to do. I've talked about this with my parents since they want me out badly.
This is what they want/expect:
-Have a full time job with benefits right now.
-go to school at the sametime
-have perfect grades
-get rid of the 12 years of torture ptsd i have or at least I should have by now.
-Me out the house by August 2020 when schoom starts.
-Know how to drive
-Me to not be in debt with 100k because it's bad.
-They dont want to help with paying for school.
-They dont want to help me pay for food or basic shit I need
-They're not gonna let me use their car
-They're forceing me to practice driving yet when comes the test find a diffrent car.
-They dont want to help me pay for a car or get one.
-actively make it difficult to do anything. 
-they want to complain taking me places yet actively tell me to buy everything myself yet everything is far away.
-refuse to drive me to uni

What I can do:
couldnt tell you if I tried.

Everything is too much. Everything is too much. Everything is too much. Everything is too much. Everything is too much. Everything is too much. Everything is too much. Everything is too much. Everything is too much. Everything is too much. Everything is too much. Everything is too much.
I cant take it it's too much
They're gonna kill me.
I keep trying and it's not enough!!
It's not enought it's never enough

""why do you care so much about what they expect?''
I DONT KNOW I DONT KNOW I DONT KNOW IDONT KNOW

So far life has been mocking me with 'maybe you'll leave eventually lol' and im not stupid I cant afford to live on my own in cali, i cant even live with another person none of my 'friends' are reliable or will let me stay with them and i have no other family that isnt trying to make my life a living hell. Pluse were in a pandemic, because why not right? ""well just get help from your parents'' no. No they wont they've told me this. They refuse. And they're under no obligations to. It's expensive I understand. They wont help me get a car yet are forceing me to learn how to drive. I dont have money to buy one. ""but you have a job'' :) i live pay check to pay check i buy my own food I have to eat out alot other wise my parents will eat my food before I do, clothing, etc and save what i little i can for uni. im part time. Nobody is hireing because im going to uni soon and pandemic!!! :)))) 

The only thing free I get from my parents is living here in this fucking house yet I still have to fight them for even that. They want me out the house and off to uni. Raiseing me was a hassle apparently doing the bareminimum of being parents was too much! my dad insisted she get aborted because he already had fucking four kids he abandoned a 5th was too much. Neither of them wanted to be parents both of them fight constant my whole life my dad left twice with me yet kept coming back. Because he has nothing he's not the bread winner my mother is, the physically abusive narsisict. He's jobless, Then recently used to work for a popular transportation company. Before all this then had to stop bec he's a diabetic and the corona. Now he's getting money doing nothing. And dosent want to do anything not even basics around the house. Lovely.

It's always money money is the problem I dont have it. I cant leave because i'll be on the streets and thats logically not better than being in an abusive house hold.

They're expecting me to be a fully grown adult at 20 with no problems when they werent even that at 20 they expected me to be one when I was a child. My dad expected me to tell them I was being molested at 5. He always told me and they both joked saying they wished they aborted me to my face.
He called me a rapist, me the victem for eating frys. Fucking frys. Throws the word around like it's candy.
I can feel my heart plapatating 
im so stressed
i dont know what to do
Should I put up with this and some how get to the uni for the next 5 years(bec they only offer spring and fall so it takes a while.)
or get houseing there somehow get the loan to pay the houseing and probably be in 100k in crippling debt. If they even give me the loans for the 5 years to pay.

I hate the good times/not stressful days ya know when the abusers are not so active or even being nice.
because then you really miss it so much you get peace even for a moment and hate it when it's bad.

I lock myself away in my room but I can still hear their yells. The constant bickering. Fighting. It never stops.
my dog died in late feb. My only hope. My baby. My only relife. Gone since i was 9 he knew my truama he was there. Gone. Because I didnt have money I couldnt save him. Im so sorry. 
...
Im gonna try to answer questions i assume people will ask when i post this if they havent already been answered, because I thought this over a billion times to see my options, they're not good.

'how much is houseing'
+Houseing is 6-10k depending if you get meal plans or not.

""Why dont you wait another year to save up?''
+ I have a cal grant that pays my whole tuition that if I dont use it this 2020-2021 for the years i need to go to school they'll take it away and i'll have no way to pay for college tuition i'll have to then take out more loans + the loans for houseing and wait longer to save up to pay.

""did you extend it?''
+Yup. This is the last year. :))

''have you contacted an advisor?''
+ nope, because they havent put out all the information for loans and stuff so they dont even know. At least thats what they say when i've contacted the school's Financial aid.

+I've already put the 600 deposit down for the houseing to save a spot incase i do but now i dont know what to doAnd if i chose not to i can get the 43% of it back but whatever.

I hope you can see my deep frustration and general with feeling stuck.
Posting this is hard im struggling even wanting to post it but I really need help.
I dont know what to do.
Despite my efforts, despite me hoping and trying fighting pushing on my own.
I cant this time. I cant do this on my own.
I dont know what to do.
i really dont know.
I need advice
I need something
I need help
Im sorry

395,"TL;DR - Is it fair for me to help older brother get over a divorce if it means i need to give up parts of my young adulthood?

I am a 20 y/o college student that goes to a good college pretty far from home. I have 5 older siblings with various adult, successful lives. 1 of my brothers is married with 3 kids. 

The other night, his wife ended up cheating on him with an ex boyfriend. He confided in me and ive been there for him. we were hanging out and playing madden tonight to distract him but he continued to go on tangents about how he doesnt know what hes gonna do with the situation. 

he knows their marriage is over but realizes he might have to “play house” for the kids sake. on the other hand, he might have to go through with the divorce. this would leave him to support all 3 kids, his ex wife (who doesnt work), sell his things to make payments. he doesnt know how hell take care of the kids when he works. 

he’s scared and uses me as an emotional crutch to which i do the best i can. i try to give guidance but im afraid idk what im talking about. ive offered to watch his kids while he works but i have a life. i have summer school, i have a gf who lives around us, i want to drink, i want to play video games, etc. 

i want to be a good brother and help him as much i can but i dont want to give up everything i have. is that a fair thing to assume or am i being petty?

I woke up around 4am to use the bathroom. Usually when I need to go, I'll use my sister's (she's 18) since it's the only one for guests (me 26yo male). I see the light is on and before I make it to the door, I'm about 10 ft away I hear moaning sounds. Ok, I thought what the hell is happening. I get closer and all of a sudden I hear a guys voice. They're video chatting. She says you can't screenshot this, and then something like but I heard the click.

 She's not in a relationship. 

I am confused and upset. I feel like a failure of a brother. I do not know what to do. I'm angry. I went downstairs to my brothers room and woke up my brother (he is 23) and told him. He came up and listened and heard her say something like ""okay you have to venmo me"". Sounds like she is selling her body for money. 

Looking back, she's been waking up very late. I do not think this is her first time.

401,"I'll try to make this as short as possible, but it's important I try to describe this guy's behaviour/mindset. I'll call him Dick to make things easier. Part 1 is how I got to know him, and can be skipped. Part 2 is examples of his weird behaviour, you can definitely only read a few. Part 3 is now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 1**

Dick left one school at 16 to go to a more 'prestigious' one. I changed from my smaller school to the one Dick just left. He was bullied a bit (or so I heard). I got to know him from going out (drinking age here is 16). And when we went to college he shared a place with a friend of mine.

I'd say he wasn't really a friend at the time, but more of a dude who popped up often when going out. Obviously this happens when you have mutual friends, but as time went by it turned out nobody ever really invited him, he actually just popped up. He'd see someone attending an event on facebook (8-10 years ago) and he'd ""randomly"" be there.

A bit later into our college/university years and my best friend was getting along with Dick quite well. I had changed cities for studying, but was only half an hour away. Most of the time when visiting my best mate, Dick would be there too. Or we'd go to Dick's place. After this semester, my best mate left the country to study abroad, but I kept meeting up with Dick.

He's intelligent and quite fun to have semi-serious discussions with. You know, get high and philosophise; something I do enjoy. But at the same time weird stuff started happening.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2** (Read as many as you like. If you want to, I got many more)

* This one bar we went to had a pool table and it was only $1 for a game. The pool area had some couches and tables and chairs, so it could easily accomodate 3-4 social groups, but there was only 1 pool table. No worries, we have the tradition of putting down a dollar on the table and this means you're next in line. This wasn't really the place to do that, I mean it was a relaxed bar, not a poolhouse. So most people/groups would just wait until others finished their game and that was that.  
Enter Dick. There's a couple at the pool table, generally having a good time. The guy is showing the girl how to play etc, very cute. Dick goes up to them and asks if they're going to play a long time and the guy's like, ""well this is our first game, we'll probably play one after."" So Dick starts nagging them, saying shit like if everybody plays 2 games, it takes ages, blablabla. They give up the table after that game and I feel like a dick.

&amp;#x200B;

* When we'd play pool (8 ball) and we got to the last ball, I just kinda played, trying to pot the black or the last ball, no matter the consequences. He'd be playing as if it was the world cup final, thinking about how the balls will hit and not to line them up good for me. When I type it out, it sounds logical, but if you'd see him doing it at this smaller than usual pool table, you'd see the stupidity. Also, doing like super soft strikes so the white is right next to the black. Shit like that.

&amp;#x200B;

* We'd have this pool nights relatively often and for me it was sometimes a reason to get away from my girlfriend. Not that I really needed to, but when you live together for the first time it's good to have a breather every now and then. We did it once where both brought our girlfriends, but mine really hated it and said it was maybe best if we just had our man-dates. Sure.  
So next time he asks me to go play pool I'm like sure, but my gf wont come. She doesn't feel like going out. ""No worries,"" he says. I show up at the place  and he's brought his gf. Fuck me. So next time I try to be more specific and ask if he wants to go, just us. Sure he says, and he brings her again.  

* Playing pool with 3 is annoying, but not horrible. The horrible part is that they're kissing so much. Or like cuddling. In a bar. When you're out with 3. Not like I'm off to the toilet and come back to find them hugging/kissing whatever. But we're talking, he relates it to something in their relationship and they get close and giggle and kiss a bit. Like WTF, who does that?

&amp;#x200B;

* A friend of mine is a musician and he was going to have his first gig with a new band. I was going to go with my girlfriend, but she had to work. So I was going to go on my own, just check out the music. But Dick calls, asking if I want to do something. I till him of my plans and he's up for it. During the break I see a girl I had studied with. I saw that she was set as Coming on the facebook-event and told her I'm happy to see her, it's been a while. Cue Dick coming from behind me ""Facebook Stalker!"" She's taken aback, but she's cool so she just kinda goes with it. We chat a bit and he keeps saying weird stuff, so I just say ""Bye"" to her and leave her to her friends to save me from further embarrassment.

&amp;#x200B;

* There's football (soccer..) on and he asks me to come over. Sure. I never played myself, except with friends, but I know the difference between a player doing good and not being able to reach it, or a player fucking up. He doesn't. At bad passes he blames the player receiving, at lucky shots he praises them for their skill, at a fast counter he blames the defense for not being organized. Beyond annoying. Truly horrible. Especially if you start noticing this 5minutes into the game.

&amp;#x200B;

* In the later years what brought us most together was smoking weed and gaming. I hadn't gamed in a long time, but he introduced me to Paladins. It was free and I was pretty good at it, without having to play 20 hours a week. If you don't know this game, it's 5v5 and there's 4 classes: Tanks, Healers, Damage and Flank. Well obviously he's not going to play a supporting role. Not even when there's a healer, 2 damagers and a flank already. He's not going to tank. So he takes his standard damaging character, preferably a sniper, gets 20 kills on 1 death, we lose the match, but ""Hey, look at my scores!""

&amp;#x200B;

* He's very competitive all around, BUT only in stuff he's good in. I play better than average chess (against people that barely play chess that is). And I'll beat him 8 out of 10 times. Would be 10/10 if I actually cared about it. So he wont play chess anymore unless I say I'm not really feeling like it. THEN he'll want to play for sure. He doesn't like racing on the bike anymore, since I beat him everytime. But he'll love shooting with his air rifle, since I can't ever practice this and he can do it as much as he wants.

&amp;#x200B;

* My best friend and I loved to smoke weed and then go for walks. There's always adventures to be found. Even if it's just getting thirsty and trying to find a night shop at 2.30am. When Dick was along, he was always tired and paranoid. This is a guy that loves competition and being physically better at stuff than people, but hates walking 3km. Also, we're just 3 guys walking on a saturdaynight, trying to find a night shop. Really nothing out of the ordinary. We cut a corner through a park and he's like: ""Can we be here?"" ""Guys, I don't think we should be here, what if there's cops?""

&amp;#x200B;

* He grew his own weed - which was decent. But he'd always downplay how much he smokes. From the cuttings he made weed-butter and then cookies. Me and my best made shared one of these cookies once and were high as an SR-71. His girlfriend told us he eats a cookie a day just after work.

&amp;#x200B;

* We invited him to our housewarming and as my friends don't really get along with him, he was hanging out with my girlfriend's friends. They were all like: ""Who the f is he?"" as he was talking about the dangers of communism or how the drug policy is completely wrong, ayahuasca experiences and shit.

&amp;#x200B;

* I had(/have) a big interest in psychedelics, having tripped numerous times, and have a decent sense of the effects, both direct and longer term - or at least the effects on me. He studied pharmacy and obviously knows best. He dismisses my experiences (to a certain degree) and says: ""I saw this in UNIVERSITY and it's this and that and that."" He wanted to try psychedelics once and I was having so much fun, but he was just tired sitting there. When he eventually went home, he said he had a very bad trip. But still he knows best about these experiences.

&amp;#x200B;

* We went frisbeeing once and he's better at it than me, so say he can throw from 50-60 meters solidly, but I can only throw 40-50 meters. So I stand at 40 meters and we can throw it back and forth without fucking up, but he wants to stand further. So he doesn't back up himself, he tells me to back up. And when I catch it he tells me to come closer, otherwise I'll fuck up. I kept standing far and in the last 10m the frisbee completely changes direction. He was pretty tired at the end of it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3**

I've seen him maybe once every 3 or 4 months for the past 2 years, mainly because he moved to a shitty area in the middle of nowhere, because buying a house there is cheap. I can't ever invite him over if I have friends over, because they know him and all dislike him.

On the one hand he can be very chill at times, but when I'm hanging out with him his selfishness comes out one way or another within minutes and it annoys the fuck out of me. If he was at his chillest all the time he'd be a bit of a weirdo, but nobody would mind that. It's just his sense of knowing-all and having to be better than everyone else whilst being very selfish that's very very annoying.

I've been wondering this for years, but is there any point in telling someone this? I feel like it would cause a shock reaction, making him ""behave"" for a while, but I doubt he'd become fully chill. I also don't want to take any responsibility. I haven't heard much from him lately, but I dread hanging out with him.

Then again, I don't want to cut off our relationship completely as I do enjoy hanging out with him from time to time. Then again, if the cons outweigh the pro's, what's the point.",20May2020,1
402,"My girlfriend and I have recently been fighting a lot, and now our most recent fight was yesterday. On top of it all though, the main thing that has really shifted our relationship is the still somewhat recent fight about me being a little possessive and controlling. Early in the morning she came out only wearing a shirt and panties, and I quickly told her “Are you trying to impress guys in the neighborhood”? Ever since then she forgave me and things got better. Now though, we fought because of my desire to be sexually intimate with her and in response to rejection I became a little off and distant with her during our recent hang outs. I told her it was my fault that I was being immature and that I wanted to compromise on the idea of sexual intimacy for us. However, I very stupidly miss communicated about it and it just led into this recent fight, when I could’ve sat down and talked with her 1 on 1. Now I can’t sleep because I can very obviously see the disgust she has with me and now she’s contemplating breaking up with me, what do I do?",20May2020,1

404,"I'm not entirely sure where to start, but I guess I'll do so by saying that I'm not in a very stable head space at the moment. I try not to let that spill into my current relationship because I don't want to exhaust or bother my boyfriend, but I will talk to him about my troubles every now and then (admittedly quite often).

He's incredibly loving and caring, but I still feel alone in the relationship when I go to him for emotional comfort. When I want to talk about something that's bothering me his intuitive way of trying to help me is intellectually (i.e giving advice, telling me what he thinks). It's all very practical and pragmatic, but I end up feeling worse after because the needs I'm seeking to fulfill are more emotional (i.e I want to feel loved, supported, understood, grounded, and not alone).

I've brought this up with him numerous times and have outlined exactly what I need in times of distress. He listened to me and seemed to take my words onboard, however he still continues to try and help me in the same way that he had previously. 

I know that he's trying, and supporting me in the way that he knows how, but this is still a big issue for me. I don't feel like we connect on an emotional level in these times. I feel like we're speaking two completely different languages, which ends up leaving me more hurt and lonely. I don't really feel that comfortable talking to him about anything bad that's going on inside of my head because of this.

I feel like if he learned a little more about things like emotional intelligence he could be there more for me, but I'm not going to tell him that because I feel like it would be a slap in the face.

Any advice on this would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!

**TLDR;** I don't feel like my BF understands me or my needs on an emotional level. I tried talking to him about it, but he still seems to be having trouble with this, which leads me to feel hurt.",20May2020,1

408,"

I've discussed this with a few of my friends before and they're concerned about me, so I thought I'd ask for some non-biased opinions. Sounds silly I know but I wasn't sure where else to turn. (Throwaway to protect myself but I will check replies!)

A quick bit of context, I'm 24 living in the UK, living at home and work for the family business. In my area employment is hard to come by and after leaving uni 3 years ago, working for the family business was the only option I had as I had literally £7 to my name at the time. I also live with a Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, a condition that causes my joints to dislocate at random and permanent chronic pain.

Over the last 8 years now my mother's moods have become somewhat erratic, she goes from being a very friendly and nice person to be around, to someone who screams and shouts at you for the tiniest of things. She was diagnosed with severe anaemia, so I'm not sure if this is a potential side-effect of that but she makes life at home pretty miserable at times. Similarly, my dad has always struggled with his temper and does very little around the home, both of which irritate my mum and set her off starting a massive fight. Unfortunately, when they get angry at one another they often take it out on me as I put myself in the way to protect my younger brother (21).

In recent months my pain levels have become worse and I was discharged from my medical care due to a lack of funding - I am also on a waiting list for pain therapy and regular therapy, however, that waiting list is supposedly 6 months long (I've been on it since March 2019 and was told the earliest appointment I'll get is Sept 2020 - joy!) So some days I get really down and can be quite quiet which for some reason also irritates my mum.

When my mum asks what's wrong I either say a - 'nothing', which sends her into a rage or b 'I'm just in pain'. The latter usually garners the response 'Well get in line, we're all in pain. How are you ever going to have children when you can't cope with a bit of f***ing pain?' She tells me to cope with my pain and anxiety quietly, that I don't need therapy and should just get over myself. Which not going to lie, really hurts because it makes me feel as though I'm not allowed to feel down and should permanently smile.

She's told me on numerous occasions that I'm pathetic, that I do nothing around the house (which is not true, I spend every weekend cleaning, ironing etc), I'm unpleasant to spend time with, I'm lazy, that I should work out more because I'm fat etc. I've also been told that wanting to spend a bit of time alone in my room to read a book on a Sunday afternoon is a waste of time and anti-social. She also has a habit of telling me off for medical things beyond my control i.e. having to use the loo multiple times a day, being unable to run because my knee dislocated or having to stop work for 10 minutes because a shoulder dislocated.

My dad either backs her up or simply says nothing - not sure which hurts more.

I've looked into moving out but I just can't afford it. As previously mentioned I work for the family business as job opportunities are few and far between. I enjoy my job but haven't taken a wage in 5 months now as financially the household is in trouble so I've put every penny into bills and food, leaving me with hardly any money to my name, certainly not enough to be able to move anywhere.

A few friends have told me to get out of the house because they're worried about my mental health. My only concern is that I haven't got the funds to go anywhere, COVID has also slashed the job market in my area and other areas massively and my mum is getting moodier the longer we are all stuck together.

I guess I'm just asking for opinions/advice on what I should do? I don't think my mum is emotionally abusing me, I think she's just stressed out. It's all super confusing and I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Hope anyone who reads this is healthy and safe atm!❤",20May2020,1
409,"I started working for a massive organisation a little over 6 months ago. The job description when I applied was super vague, but the money was ridiculously good so I accepted the offer anyway, thinking it would be a good challenge.

Well, a couple months in and I realised the job was NOT what I thought it would be. I disliked it, but stayed because of the money.

Then COVID happened, my much-needed holiday had to be cancelled and I got diagnosed with cancer all at the same time.

It sort of put things in perspective for me and I realised that my health (mental and physical) has to be my number one priority. It also made me realise I don’t just dislike my job - I absolutely hate it, and it’s taking a serious toll on my mental wellbeing.

The problem is, I only came to this conclusion this week. I actually like my boss, and since I’m not the kind of person who complains when I’m unhappy, they were rightfully shocked when I came clean this morning.

I’ve now made my mind up that the only thing that will make me happy is leaving. I honestly dread going to work at the moment, but at the same time I feel so guilty because I know how lucky I am to be employed right now when so many others aren’t. Compounding my guilt is the fact that our team of three has now shrunk to two, and if I leave, it’s just my boss left. 

I’m fortunate enough to be in a good financial position, so if I don’t find another job right away I’ll be ok. That said, I still worry about leaving my boss in the lurch and leaving at an incredibly busy time. I feel like I’m on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

What would you do in my position?",20May2020,1
410," 

For background information, me and this girl have known each other since our junior year in high school. We were apart of the same friend group and at the time I had feelings for her, but didn't say anything because she was in a relationship. Her relationship was really bumpy and they had a lot of problems so a lot of the time she would come to me for advice. Over time we got closer and she broke up with her boyfriend and she told me she started to have feelings for me. We were never officially dating and things didn't work out so after about a month she told me she didn't have feelings anymore and we stopped talking as much. Throughout the years we've kept in contact, but never were as close as we initially were.

Fast forward to recently, we've been talking a lot more since she's transferring to the same college I go to and we're in close proximity due to quarantine and live in the same town. As we start talking more and more, I start to catch feelings again, but because she has a boyfriend I don't say anything. Similarily to her last relationship, it's really bumpy and shes coming to me again for advice. She ends up breaking up with him, so I think cool I'll tell her how I feel and see what happens. After about 2 weeks, I ask her what's the status with the EX to make sure I don't look like an idiot, she tells me that she hates him and would never go back. So, I finally gain the courage to call her and tell her how I feel. Here is where I feel like I might have made a mistake, I tell her that I like her and because I don't think she feels the same way I want to stop being friends as I see her as more than a friend. She doesn't really say whether she likes me or doesn't like me, she just says that she understands. After this conversation, she still tries to call and text me, but I keep telling her that I really can't keep being friends with her. After numerous attempts of her trying to come in contact, I give in and start talking to her again in hopes maybe she'll change her mind (I know stupid mistake).

After about a week of talking again, she posts a picture of her and her EX. This makes me mad, I guess out of Jealously? And tell her it was a mistake for me to try and be friends again and basically cut her off again. She then tells me that the whole time when she was saying that they weren't back together they actually were. Fast forward to right now, she has broken up with her EX again and is trying to talk. So this is where I'm trying to get advice. Do I go back to talking to her and see if it can progress into anything because I really do like her? Why would she lie about not being with her EX in the first place? Do I keep her cut off and just move on?

tl:Dr: friend that I have feelings for tells me she isn't with boyfriend anymore, I tell her I like her. She then says that they were together the whole time. Confused on how to move forward.",20May2020,1

413,"Some background story before I start:

I have 5 friends in my group. I'll give them fake names just in case one of them finds me here and their stories.

Jasmine = she got a online boyfriend who was manipulating her and guilt-tripping her by saying he will commit suicide if Jasmine doesn't do what he says.

Jane = she cut her left wrist a lot of times, and sent me a photo of her standing on the window with one foot out.

Carly = she told me that her parents don't love about her, and her mother is a piece of shit gold digger and her dad doesn't care. her dad cheated on her mom. she also stood at the balcony wanting to jump.

Emily = she was worried for Jane, and said she might be at fault for Jane's behaviour. she gave me picture examples of what she tried to do: standing on the window, and told me she stopped cutting last year. But then recently, like a few days ago, she told me she cut her herself.

Please keep this in mind that the fact that all of them, except Jane, is 14. Jane is 13. I'm also 14. And to be the one who has to listen to everyone of them being depressed is making me go insane.

This have been going on for nearly a year, and I have been trying to keep my myself together but in the end I failed.

Anyways, I'm closer to Carly because we have talks about these kind of stuff a lot. Before anyone comments down that I should leave them, I should clarify that they do make me happy, and all I want is them to get better.


So a few hours ago, I was talking to Carly and started to get emotional. She suggested that I tell it to everyone, which I did. I vented for about an hour, telling them how they are precious to me and how I'm so frustrated at the fact that they keep rejecting me. I voiced out all my complaints, I got mad at them, and told them everything. I told them I cried, and cried thinking about them and how they shouldn't cut themselves thinking it would fix everything. I told them that school counsellors exist, and I'm not a superman who can fix problems just because they trust me. I am also a human who has emotions, and I shouldn't be the one who they turn to when they need help. They need help from professionals. And I am not one.

I am just merely a 14 year old female, and I know damn well myself what I should not do and do. But what I don't know is that whether the fact that my outburst was good enough to make them realise and stop. Make them tell an adult, get help from professionals who is not me.

I have been giving advice, convincing them to not jump or cut to them everytime. It works sometimes, but then it doesn't. 

They don't seem to realise the fact that although I act as if I'm older than 14, I am still 14 at heart. I don't want to deal with all of this. I have my own problems to deal with already.


I love them, I really do. I want them to get better, but my words fail to describe my feelings. How can I show them that life is more than just suffering, and there's so much more waiting for them in the future?",20May2020,1
414,"I moved out of my parents place 8 months ago to study in university. The German government provides me with financial aid which together with my job was enough to live comfortably and get my own apartment.
I felt pretty secure at first because I could pay my bills, live an active life and even save money. The plan was to study hard, get a business degree and pay of the 50% of the financial aid which are a loan (without interest) right after university.
To summarize: I thought I had my shit together.

Everything began to fall apart when I stopped going to university because I felt like Business was too boring. At this point I thought I would simply change courses next year and keep my little financial plan.

I knew that many other people in their late teens/early twenties may struggle during this time as well - so I made sure to text all my friends and coworkers (40+) and checked up on them, making sure they’re doing okay etc etc. 

I then sent my closest 20+ friends a card, making it clear that I’m aware of how hard this all can be and that I’m there for them, even if it’s just a phone call or conversation they need.

Anyway, that was last week. And I’ve noticed looking back over the text messages that only one or two people asked me how I was doing. Apart from that, I’ve not had a single message or phone call checking up on me.

Please don’t get me wrong - I never sent out the cards or the text messages with the expectation of anything in return. It didn’t bother me much at the time that no one had checked on me, so much so that I didn’t even notice and actually went on to start making little gift boxes of homemade cakes to deliver to everyone.

 I am 18 just on the start of life, I have been searching for a creative direction but nothing is seeming to click. I've tried film making, painting, and even clowning among many things and nothing feels right yet. I am searching for a passion and since I am obsessed with listening to music, the logical answer seems to be that I try making music as my next attempt at a creative pursuit. However, for whatever reason I am very judgmental towards myself with making music. I would like to be a vocalist and I played the lead role in a musical recently but I still feel very self conscious and it seems so cliche to ""start a band"". Does anyone have any advice on overcoming this hurdle? I don't even want to bring it up to my parents or friends because it will be met with serious negative judgement in return. Do you have any suggestions on how to overcome this and maybe as to where I should even start? I am in contact with a drummer and guitarist older than me but I feel worried that I won't meet a good enough standard. Plus, while writing lyrics has never been a struggle for me, making a new tune for a song is totally out of my element and I can't even think of a beat that has not already been made.

Here's my story:

My dad is a wealthy man, but he tends to play with my temper every time I asked him to pay for tuition fees. Likewise, ever since I was a child, he promised a lot to pay for me whenever I wanted to participate in a class, and when the deadline come for the billing, he goes:"" I don't have money."", and smiling like he had tricked me into some kind of sick entertainment (yeap, I know this is weird).

Right now, the circle is still repeating, and I'm not sure I can make it till the day I graduate. May I ask for advice for how to get my dad to pay for the tuition fee without going into a quarrel or a fight to get things done?

448,"I’m not really close with this one friend, thus I don’t really know his background, likes, dislikes or really anything. So I was very much shocked when he talked to me about this. Our whole conversation started by me wishing him happy birthday, then it lead to him ranting about being friend-zoned and asking me what to do just about it. 

Then the suicide talk started. It always happens at midnight which ticked me off a bit because I was just about to sleep and I couldn’t think straight. But nevertheless, I tried to talk to him and try to make him I guess look at life in a more positive way, to look at his talents and ended up writing him essay long messages while texting him back and forth.

Thankfully at that time I’m pretty sure he didn’t have a laid out plan about the suicide or did self harm. And after 3 days things seemed to get better and he stopped talking about being suicidal. I told him that I’ll always be there for him and he could talk to me about anything.

Well I was wrong when I thought that it stopped.

He started sending me his online depression test results: moderate to severely depressed. He also started to send me his drawings of people committing suicide and said “I’m drawing these because you told me I’m good at drawing and because I’m good at drawing shit like this”. I kept on still talking to him but I was getting tired because at this point it seemed as if everything I told him went nowhere. I even told him about my past experience and how I “dealt” with it.

I did tell him I would always be there but I now feel restricted to do anything because I always have to be there to help him and respond to every text or he would spam me with messages. 

Then he started to poke his mosquito bite with needles and I told him to stop it and it won’t do anything. He told me to try it, that it feels good and satisfying.

I’m just so confused and tired of this any help would be appreciated.

Hello everyone, I hope you all are having an amazing day/night. 

At the start of the year, I’ve was talking with someone who doesn’t live in the same country as me, after 3 months, I felt there was something there from both sides so I decided to mention this “hey, I feel like these a connection so maybe in the future we could get to know each better”. He said “I honestly don’t have any intention in being more than friends”, I asked “why”, he said “I’ve been talking with someone and it’s getting serious this past month or so ” 

This felt like shit in the face because we talked about marriage, how many kids we want and our types, honestly we described each other. He would compliment me many times and say “I can’t stop smiling, thank you” when we would be texting, we texted everyday, even till late at 4am in the morning. Basically we talked about deep stuff with each other. He asked if I talk to other guys, I said “not like this” and when I asked him, he said “I can barely keep up with you” . Like he had many times where he could have mentioned her and he then tells me that she knows about me and don’t mind that him and I talk. How did I come up in the conv and she didn’t come
Up in our conv (his and mine). 

Now we are in May so it has been two months since I’ve mentioned that and moved on as friends (we still text), but I can’t help feeling like shit basically and thinking back in the situation, what could I have done ? Is he just a player ? Do I regret talking to this person ? Why do I hope that there will be something in the future and that’s why I continue talking to him ? Should I stop texting him ?

So I tried online therapy for the first time this lockdown and it was weird. I said some stuff that I couldn’t say in real life and for some reason it being online made it easier. She (therapist) said she can not diagnose me (it’s online so she can’t really study emotions and body language as easily) but because of some stuff happening, apparently I possibly have something along the lines of DID (different, I’ll explain rn). So what she said I possibly have is I’ve trained myself to stop feeling more than one emotion, but turns out I’ve split myself, so if I get triggered and go angry, my entire mindset until the next trigger is a person (3rd one) who has completely different opinions, outlooks, music taste etc. Usually when I’m upset, that person will last maybe 2 hours until I get angry. During those 2 hours, I have all my sad emotions I’ve bottled up since the last time they came out, just explode. Nearly ran away Monday because of how bad it got. Then immediately after I bet upset I become an angry person. So basically, I think, my main emotion is 1000% worse than it should be. I think if I train myself to just chill the fuck out or something, it should get better. If anyone read up to this point a) why? B) do you think it’ll work?",20May2020,1

Having the longing feeling to be close to someone or something in anyway and when the opportunity comes forward you shut off mentally/physically.

Feeling anger when someone shows even the slightest bit of care for you.  Often feeling guilty or unworthy of feeling any type of love from anyone.

Wanting to give/spread the love to others but feel that I don't deserve it in return.  Often like in debt to others while never having deserved it in return no matter how logically it would be (unsure if makes sense) even a little.

Pushing away with every ounce of strength at all times.  Never truly revealing how I truly feel or what I truly want.  Showing externally the complete opposite of what is wanted.

473,"FYI: I take *Cherifer PGM 10-22 with Zinc (and sometimes w/o Zinc if there's no available)*, for those of you who didn't know, this is a chlorela supplement that helps improve weight and height for mostly teens and children, it is also known to have many side effects.

I experience discomfort in the stomach after taking them, my doctor prescribed me to take it after meals, I've started it back in 2016 and stopped it after a year because I noticed that it doesn't really help me gain weight, the ones that helped me gain weight are milk and eating a lot per day plus exercise (*plus I experience stomachache*). But then this pandemic my dad suggested me that I should take them again because I need to boost my immune system, I became underweight as of now since I got stress from school a few months ago. But then as I take the supplements, I still feel the discomfort of the supplement, which is stomachache, I have a feeling that it doesn't help me that much since I'm 17 and nearly turning 18, I don't really need to go taller but I need to gain weight, should I stop taking them and instead do my thing again (*light exercise and eating 3-4 times a day*)?",20May2020,1
474,"So I'm pretty new to Reddit. I have been registered for a while but have only been actively using it for a  couple of months or so.  
I have accidentally posted something which I thought was original content sent to me by friends/acquaintance/family (one by my niece and the other by a friend). The first one I deleted once I realized it was a repost, but I was left with the feeling of perhaps looking sneaky. The second one I'm leaving up just to make sure I proceed with this one correctly. But I thought I'd ask first.

Also, why is the Reddit community so unforgiving and cynical about this particular subject? I've come across a couple of instances where people, myself included, have made honest mistakes where we are just trying to share something we thought was cool in good faith. When it for some reason crosses a tacit social rule in reddit, people are just so ready to downvote or leave cynical/sarcastic comments insinuating bad faith immediately, without even considering the possibility of it being accidental/unintentional.

It wasn't even anything irresponsible or dangerous like a conspiracy theory or false information that could have serious consequences. One was a little robot playing the T rex jumping game and the other was a cat eating papaya.

I understand that I should be wiser or careful about what I post, but that kinda counters the casual and fun nature Reddit and some subreddits seem to welcome and foster.

If I'm completely frank it's a bit of a demotivator. I really like the reddit community on other accounts, but this particular bit seems unnecessarily severe and just plain rude sometimes.",20May2020,1

Earlier today I sent her something via WhatsApp, but then I notice that she was last online at 1:40am on Monday. I ask her what she was doing at 1:40am and she said her mother was ‘checking her phone’. Her mother never checks her phone. Naturally I was afraid her mother found out she was bi. Luckily she cleared out her chats before her mother saw. Then she said that even if her mother did find out she was bi then she’d hate her. I was shocked. She never said her parents where even a bit homophobic. She then says it doesn’t matter and that things where happening at home.

477,"I’m training to be a teacher in the UK, and since school closures I’ve obviously been working from home. 

Every time I see something about schools reopening (here in the UK the idea for now is that schools will reopen on the 1st of June) or someone mentions going back, I feel sick. I cry. My anxiety is unreal. I’ve had panic attacks. 

I’m so anxious from a health perspective and thinking about all the social distancing stuff (there is almost no way of guaranteeing that we can social distance effectively in schools/small classrooms, effective cleaning, etc.). I also live at home with my dad who is vulnerable so I worry for him. 

My other anxiety surrounds the actual teaching. I don’t know what is going to be expected of me as a trainee, whether I’ll have to teach or just support. As a side note, I’ve been struggling with the whole teaching thing because I’m not sure if I want to be a teacher after all and the idea of teaching in front of a class during this whole thing just makes me feel ill. 

I don’t know what to do about it. It keeps me up at night. I don’t know who to talk to about it. I would talk to Uni about it, but they’re already aware of my mental health issues and are trying to get me to interrupt my study (which I don’t want to do, I just want the qualification), so I feel if I tell them anything more about my mental health then they’ll “make” me interrupt.

1. Do I need to lose more weight?

A big dilemma I keep facing is feeling like I'm still overweight and wanting to lose weight when everyone around me is stressing how I need to tone and not lose weight now.

I've been going to the gym and working out 4 days a week on average, doing abs 3-4 times a week in addition. Even now, in lockdown, I've been doing my best in that regard. And as you can see, it has been very useful.

If yes, I need to lose weight, then How can I go back to it? Since I generally eat very healthy and my portion is controlled, plus I work out. With all of this in mind, my weight has still been the same as it has been for the past three years.

481,"Hey,

Just looking to have a chat and get stuff off my chest tbh. When I was younger I spoke to a girl who was around 3 years younger than me (I was 16 and she was 13). We spoke sexually and even hung out from time to time. We never had sex however we did kiss. I did not know her age at this time as we had mutual friends so I believed she was older. I found out her age and I soon to turn 17 so I thought I shouldn’t continue speaking. We became mates afterwards and recently just stopped speaking as mates. I’m now 19 and she is 15 soon to be 16. I understand that I should of got her age at the time but I didn’t. Since isolation started my mental health hasn’t been great so I’ve got this idea in my head that I’m a nonce and that everybody is going to find out and hate me. I’ve spoken to her and told her I was anxious and didn’t like the age gap and regret what we did. She told me not to be paranoid. I can’t get this idea out my head. I feel guilty about what happened and understand I was in the wrong and not her. I’m not attracted to underage girls in anyway. I regret it.

I’ve had another incident to this recently but in this case I was 19 and I spoke to a 15 year old (16 at the time of writing) I believed to be older. We spoke but yet again not nude photos was exchanged. She put a snap on her story in a school uniform so I asked her age. Once I knew her age we stopped speaking plus I had a girlfriend (she knows about both these situations and we have spoke in detail). Not these girls have said they’re not gonna tell anybody. 

I regret what I’ve done so bad. I hate myself for it. I’m not attracted to young girls it is a case of thinking they was older. Any advice?",20May2020,1

485,"So I live in a really small town area where wealth is NOT prevalent in the community. Most everyone here is blue collar and not making a lot of money, some people I know work several jobs and terrible hours just to make ends meet. 

I had a job opportunity that is somewhat unique to this area as I'm able to work for a national scale private company and with that, came a higher pay grade for a younger person in this area. I make more than some middle aged adults in decent jobs.

I often find myself feeling uncomfortable when money is brought up by friends or family casually. When I know I have it easier than them because of the job I'm in and have chosen. I feel like, they're working so hard and they're not getting what I get, and that makes me feel depressed. 

Like, I feel this intense shame whenever I buy something fun I want when I know my peers would have to budget more tightly than I, and I just feel sucky about it. 

Does anyone else feel this way?",20May2020,1
486,"I'm sorry for the really long post, you can skip to the bottom if you don't want my life story :P

I've never been an angry person. My older sister went through some shit in high school and took all her rage about it out on me, starting when I was around 12. Every time she screamed at me I never said anything back, I always just calmly took it from her and cried about it later. But I've never really been an angry person. 

In high school things didn't go well for me. I switched schools and my second school wasn't any better than the first. I feel that I made some stupid teenager mistakes and the response was disproportionate. I feel that I've been wronged. I spent years in therapy and it only helped marginally. 

Even when I got to college though, I was sad, not angry. Some aspects of college have been amazing and so helpful, others have been terrible. Recently I found an incredible group of the most loving, caring friends I've ever had. They accept me completely, every part of me. They are supportive of me. They are nonjudgmental. They're the friends I've needed all this time. 

Yet recently, I have been so so so angry. It's been building up in me since around when quarantine started. Where I used to think ""oh, all these people who have hurt me probably had a reason, it was probably my fault, they just weren't right for me,"" now I am seething every time I think of them. I hate them so much. I blame them for all of my problems. And I spend a *lot* of time thinking about them. 

It's not just people, either. I hate the current state of the world. I've always wanted to be a mother, but now I feel that having a child is selfish. When I see large families, I get irrationally angry. When I see a family in a nice house, I immediately think that they are terrible people. 

Politics suck. I won't get into that too much, but watching the news pisses me off. I view all politicians as corrupt. I have no faith in the system. I don't think my vote will ever matter, and I'm disgusted at my options. Local politics isn't much better. I think the only thing that matters is how much money you have. If you don't have money, you don't get a say. I feel that I have no way to change this. 

I despise my addiction to the internet. Ever since quarantine, I spend hours and hours each day on Reddit and other social media. And I'm bombarded with misogyny, homophobia, racism, etc. I'm particularly losing faith in relationships very fast. I used to have this idea of the ideal partner. I wanted someone to care for me and respect me. Strings of bad relationships have changed that. Also, reading men's horrible views of women online every day makes me think that most men really don't respect women. I know rationally that it's a loud minority and not all men are like that, but it's hard for me to listen to the rational side of things.

Lastly, religion. I grew up Catholic. I wanted to be a priest as a child, until I got to middle school where I was told girls can't be priests. I was crushed. I went to confession and told the priest things that no young girl should ever ever be telling an older man. I despise religion for putting me in that position. I despise that when I was in high school, my theology teacher gave us a handout teaching why gay marriage was wrong. I despised the pro life club, who would self righteously wear tape over their mouths once a year to draw attention to how saintly they are for caring about unborn babies. I saw hypocrisy at every turn. And most of all, I hate that I grew up being told that my purpose was to serve my future husband, and that my body belonged to him, not me. 

I don't know why all these feelings are bubbling up now. I was a really happy kid. When things were bad, I always blamed myself. I was severely depressed throughout middle school and high school. Now, in the past few months, I've done a complete 180. I'm not sad, I'm pissed. I hate the world. I hate the way I was raised. I hate the people who hurt me. I hate myself for being so cynical and angry. 

I don't want to be like this. I want to be happy. I want to be an optimistic, positive person who loves life and has faith that things will be okay. But any time I try to have that mindset I feel like I am lying to myself. How do I change? 

**TL;DR** I've found myself becoming a very angry person. I'm angry at people, politics, the state of the world, religion, and everything in between. I didn't used to be like this, and I want to change.",20May2020,1

She has a son with the disgusting man who molested my sister and I help her take care of him almost every day. I bathe him, feed him, play with him, change his diapers, you name it and I do it. I even clean the entire house to help her come home to a clean environment. Whenever my mother gets frustrated with him she gets mad at me for not taking him away from her and care for him. She fights with me every day for no reason and insults me. Two nights ago, my older brother was bothering my little sister and he was hanging her upside down by her legs. I told him he shouldn’t do that because he could break her neck on accident. He got very offended and pushed me to the ground and proceeded to kick me twice. I bumped my head so hard on the wall that I don’t remember what happened while he was hitting me. I have two big bruises on my arms from that and my mother sided with him because “I have anger issues and I get violent”. After that incident I went to my room and started crying.

I’m still young but I have thus far enjoyed a mildly successful music career. I have received 2 record deal offers and had accepted 1, but eventually rejected it. It was for a solo career and I was much more interested in playing with a band. I formed one with other musicians, who I might add are very talented. We already are in talks with record companies and are having success in selling our first record. I can attest that everything is going well. There is however, one enormous issue. I play the guitar and sing and have done so for over a decade. I have played over 500 live shows and would consider myself very experienced. There is a member of the band who is a phenomenal guitarist and seems to come up with incredible riffs off the top of his head; he is the best lead guitarist I have worked with and I have worked with hundreds. The only problem is is that he wants to split lead singing with me. The only problem with that is he has never sung live. He is nothing special in the vocal department either and will not understand that. The other members of the band that have known him for a long time blindly support him. He can’t even play and sing at the same time. Unfortunately we are at an impasse. I have tried to explain to him that singing live is much much different than singing in the shower or at a fire with friends. He seems to believe that this does not affect him and that he will be able to get up on stage and sing perfectly. The record companies are interested enough that they will still buy the record even if he sings some songs, but I’m worried that if he sings too many any chance we have is out the window. 

These are other things he does on a regular basis:
-Refuses to change any of his ideas
-Ignores band members creative ideas
-Everything has to be his way
-Makes big decisions without consulting anyone else
-Says he will eventually “phase me out as lead singer.”
-Downplays the skill it takes to sing live

I don’t want to lose this band as the other members are extremely talented and his guitar work is exceptional. Half the band will leave if his is kicked out resulting in the end of the band and a wasted year of my life. There is record potential and labels have expressed that. 

The problem I need advice on is this: do I leave the band and work on my solo career? Should I present him with an ultimatum (if you don’t drop the splitting songs idea I am leaving kind of thing.)? Am I blowing this out of proportion? (Please keep in mind I have voiced these concerns to him very clearly at least 10 times.) Kicking him out is not an option as some of the other band members would leave as well. I have told him that for this first studio album it would make the most sense for me to be the lead singer as I have the most experience and as arrogant as it may be to say, and believe I recognize that, I have the much better voice. I have told him I am absolutely open to him singing some songs. Not splitting. It is my passion and I am want to sing and play, not split songs in a way that would be detrimental to the band.",20May2020,1

Hello Reddit,

hope you are all doing well. This is my first post so please be gentle. (lol)

Sorry for a long post in advance.

A little backstory:

I have started my current job at the Q4 of last year in a field I was very interested working in besides my previous work experiences from totally different fields. Don't really want to mention which field but if anyone is interested I can share. I was trained on how to do everything properly how to run reports, send emails to the client and all that stuff I was a little familiar with from before (only the client relationship part) by my supervisor since I was the one who is suppose to get of some of the workload off of him due to him being overwhelmed a lot. I wont lie working with data and making all work and learn how to use was not easy but I am glad I have learned something new and could work in a job I wanted. I am not smarties fish in the sea, but I am not stupid either just for clarification. Some things I can learn pretty easily but on some I need more time. Especially working with data where you need to be really careful and pay a lot of attention to detail which sometimes I am lacking.

So into the part I would love to hear some advice from you guys:

Every month I am suppose to send an email to the client with reports which I get from one system and then use an excel macro (made by someone else). This email is consists of data, graphs and comments of mine which covers performance of previous month. My supervisor taught me how to do it and was and still is checking these reports if they are done properly - checking if the data and graphs in them made sense and were properly exported (this was his part of the job previously and I took over and was my responsibility now). It is pretty complex but if you get use to it its not that difficult but you need to pay attention to all kind of things.

So I have sent this email to the client with all the data etc. and next day I receive an email from my supervisor with few comments on my email. If I find this and that strange on some specific graphs (total percentage on pie graph did not make 100%) and some other graph that was missing some data. Basically sometimes this excel macro works strange and does not get all the data properly. I have checked, if during some previous months I had this on my responsibility, was this report in similar shape and it was. Also errors of macro but no comment nothing from my supervisor. Some of those reports I am sending every week to my colleagues and no-one had a comment that something is not correct. I have checked these reports from the time, my supervisor was sending them and I have found the same errors.

Its not the first time since something like this, due to my lack of attention to detail, was sent and I was in trouble. Sometimes I have received a criticism when I sent an email to the client asking about certain stuff we needed to get from them, very politely of course and was told by my supervisor that this kind of email had no place and should not be sent but some time passed and my supervisor does the same thing I got criticism for. He is very punctual and everything must be perfect and if its not there is fire on the roof.

So basically this is my last chance. If there will be anything they will let me go.

How do I approach this? How can i say that this is an error of excel macro and this had the same issue last year?

Basically before it had the same errors and now since its my responsibility I can loose my job because of it.

How can someone show the other person that you have passion for the job and want to do it and you like it you just need some other approach from your supervisor when he was teaching you stuff?

Thank you all.",20May2020,1
510,"So when I was 10 a guy 1 year older than me sexualy harrased me and showed me some weird stuff. Well I took it really badly and didn't tell anyone until now. I told my friend when schools closed for quarantine and I need soem help explaining to her how I felt back then.
When that happened I got really sad and felt empty. I felt depressed and felt really badly. Of course like most peopel who go through traumatic events I felt like my life was empty and that everything was meaningless. I had suicidal thoughts like what would happen if and what if I cut but I didn't and I would just cry. I want to explain it to her but I don't really know how to express my feelings.
What happened to em was bad but I would never consider cutting or committing suicide I just thought what would happen if and part of me was thinking that if I didn't tell anyone I would die with guilt without anyone knowing and that I woudk regret it for ever.
I want to express myself to her so she understands it but as I said I don't know how. Any advice?",20May2020,1
511,"A bit of background on me: I'm 15-16, Male and play a few instruments and am learning to skateboard. Please someone read all of this I know it's long but I'd be very grateful. 

Around 6-7 months ago I purchased my first bass guitar. Everything was fine at first until I noticed that there was a loud banging on the metal fence followed by my neighbour (60's Female) screaming her lungs out and cussing for me to turn it down. I continued to play for those 7 months with my volume now at 1 and her constant screeching. I was playing WELL within my legal time limits for noise from musical instruments (9am-9pm). My mother even says that she can BARELY hear it if not at all. This screeching and cussing led me to play unplugged which is kind of a bummer in general.

It wasn't until the other night where I came home unsuccessful at 6:45pm from attempting my first ollie so I decided to practice in my driveway. No more than 5 minutes passed before I hear her screaming at me from her porch to 'shut the f\*\*\* up!' she got the best of me, and I couldn't help but yell back 'The time limit is 9am-9pm I can make as much f\*\*\*\*\*\* noise as I want' (stupid to swear at her, I know, was caught off guard by the sudden aggression) I thought it was over until she came up to me in my driveway and starting screaming in my face telling me 'You're a stupid f'ing kid', 'I don't bother you, so why do you have to bother me?',  'You touch me with that skateboard and I'll take you right to court, you little s\*\*\*!' (literally was just holding it in my hand, so I rolled it down my driveway so she didn't have that 'leverage') and 'stop trying to stand over me and dominate me!' (I'm 6'2' and she came up to intimidate me, so a bit confused on that one?) This went back and forth where I couldn't even get a word in.

My mum eventually came outside as she thought someone was about to be killed it was that loud. My mum tried to diffuse the situation by telling me to calm down and be quite to which I did and she calmly asked my neighbour what the problem was. My neighbour stormed off as soon as my mum spoke to her and slammed the door back into her house. My mum wanted to check our rights in this situation so she spoked to the police and they recommend that they send some guys to 'mediate' the situation. They spoke to us first, and then went to speak with her. As soon as they start talking to her we start hearing her yelling at the police telling them that I 'dominate' my mother and that she's a terrible parent. The police explained to her that I was practicing a trick on the skateboard and that I would keep the noise down over the next couple of days. The police came back to talk to us and told us she was an 'actress' (lmao) and that I'm best to be quiet for awhile as she's ready to have another go. She ran out into our driveway as the police were leaving to bail them up on how 'terrible and controlling' I am and how my mother 'doesn't know how to take care of me.' 

When the police eventually left, she started cursing me from her front porch and screaming at me for around 5 minutes until she went inside, started smashing stuff in her house while continuously screaming. She burned out her car in the driveway and sped off down our road the FASTEST I've ever heard a car go ever and she left for around 30 minutes. She came back once again, screaming and cursing my name it's 10pm by this point and I'm getting ready to go to bed. She continues screaming and banging on til around 10:45pm and I think it's finally over, my mum has gone to bed, the lights are off and she's FINALLY quiet. I'm going to bed when out of NOWHERE she bangs three times as hard as she can on the metal fence next to my bedroom and the driveway. I NOPE out of my room and tell my mum that I'm sick of how childish and petty she's being. Mum calls the cops again, they say if she continues to harass me, they'll send some guys to talk to her. That was the end of that for the night.

After the 6:45pm-11:00pm I have been EXTREMELY paranoid in my own home, I'm hearing sounds that aren't there and feel like I'm constantly being watched and observed by her. She's stated to mum how much she hates the neighbourhood kids playing in the street and this really makes me feel uneasy. I am afraid of what this woman is capable of. I think it is extremely childish and immature for her to try and stand over a 16yo kid. I believe that she is VERY unreasonable and would not have a conversation without a screaming match. I should not have to change my hobbies and the things that I love because of her intolerance. I don't even feel comfortable opening my curtains. What do I do?

523,"Hey everyone—so im going into my senior year of high school and naturally Ive been putting a lot of thought into college majors/career paths. Philosophy has become my main passion; there are other things which peak my interest and that i find meaningful; however, none of them really match my love of philosophy. For that reason, Ive put a considerable amount of heavy thought into majoring in philosophy and pursuing a master’s degree in that field (possibly even a PhD).  The problem is im unsure which career paths I can pursue with such a degree. Whenever I search for possible career paths, the results are abysmal showing a negative job growth among other things. 

Anyways my question for those of you who have majored/pursued higher education in philosophy, what career paths did a philosophy degree open for you? Is getting a decent paying job in this field really as brutal as people make it out to be? Is there any general or specific advice y’all have for me while I try to figure out what I should pursue? 

Thanks for reading this far :)",20May2020,1
524,"I’m dead serious.

To start off, let me make it clear that I wouldn’t want to be friends with someone who is racist and forms an opinion of me based on my country. That being said, I believe many people do have certain opinions about certain countries and that makes it very difficult for me to be proud of where I am.

I’m not going to reveal where I’m from as I don’t want to annoy people who are from the same country, but growing up, I never actually liked associating myself with this country or some elements of the culture. Not saying I dislike everything about the country but I was always a little bit more interested in other cultures and I made a lot of friends on the internet from different cultures. When I was in university, I studied in a different country for a few months and that was the time when I felt most comfortable and self-confident in my entire life. Made tons of friends, much more than I had in my country.

Now, years later, back at my country and in working life, I find myself feeling embarrassed about many things about this country. Let’s just say that I have a very different belief system and thought system compared to many others in this country. Not saying I’m better than everyone else in this country, it’s just that I feel a bit different, like I don’t belong. So I can’t help but feel a bit hesitant to say “I am from XXX”.

I hate it when the way people look at me or behave changes, especially on the internet, when they find out where I am from. It’s not like we can choose where we are from, right? Still, many wouldn’t understand this feeling if you come from a western-open-minded-developed country that many others look up to.

So yeah.

536,"Father-in-law struggles

First post ever on Reddit, seeking help, advice, or maybe just venting. 

So my fiancé and I have been living together for 4 years, together now for 6 years. She’s been in medical school and we ended up moving to VA for it. (Originally from MN). Well, along the way my father-in-law has had doubts about us. Mentioning I would not be able to support her if something happened to her. (I was a lowly security guard at the time). Assumed I was there to just marry his daughter and reap the benefits and then get divorced and get money. Yes he mentioned getting a prenuptial agreement. He never thought I was good enough so on and so forth. Most of this was said 4 years ago. 

Fast forward to now. My fiancé has finished medical schooling, and was accepted into residency back in MN. While this is great news. It was poor timing, I recently started a new position. I have a career job now and I have to wait 6 months to a year to transfer to the Midwest. My fiancé has moved back in with her parents in the mean time and we are starting to plan our wedding. Her parents are gifting us $20,000 for either the wedding, honeymoon, or a down payment on a house. This was a great gesture and was great until my fiancé told me father-in-law gets to make decisions because he is paying for the wedding. The other thing he is arguing is that we have to make the guests feel comfortable and make sure they have a good time at our wedding, they are the priority. (We of course will do our best but the priority is what we want).

This kinda threw me through a loop because he is constantly arguing with my fiancé. They always butt heads. He thinks she has too strong of a personality for me. (I am a bit reserved, but me and my fiancé make joint decisions, support each other and are happy). We are a united front and I feel like he is trying to put a wedge in between us. We of course have a few fights here and there but things are worked out and we do our best to resolve our differences. Anyways, he said since we moved to VA that he sees us as married and thinks we should just have a small family only wedding. I’m really just stuck with how to deal with him and our current situation.

543,"Hey everyone, so a quick background, I currently work in the finance industry as an assistant for 3 people. I've been at this job for about half a year, and it's overall a job I can handle fairly well. I switched working from a healthcare industry, and the environment/personalities of my superiors are extremely different.

Since we've been working from home for the past 2 months, it took me a bit of an adjustment period. Several weeks ago, I had a huge slip-up in addition to a buildup of other mistakes, and needless to say, I got chewed out pretty badly over it. My boss and his partner both called me expressing their frustrations. I admitted to my wrongs, because it was definitely my fault, and we moved on. I usually handle constructive criticism pretty well, but this was different.

Since then however, I always feel a sense of anxiety and worry that something bad will happen. It can be during work hours or hours after work has finished, and I'm already worrying about the next day and freaking myself out that I'll receive negative feedback. I never felt like this at my old job, and the positions are pretty much the same. Perhaps it's because I work directly under 3 executives, whereas before I had a team of people my age that I was able to be open and casual with. This doesn't excuse my mistakes, but I just have this constant fear and paranoia, and it's driving me insane. I double check all of my work, but it's never reassuring enough for me.

I'm always walking on eggshells, and I feel constantly looked down upon when it comes to this team, even though we're working from home. Has anyone experienced anything like this or know how to deal with it? Thanks in advance for any help or advice!

TLDR: Had a big slip up few weeks ago that I got in trouble for (which I admitted to). I now have a constant sense of worry/anxiety during and after my workdays, because I fear that I'm going to mess up again or get even more negative feedback. It's a constant feeling that's making me uneasy, but work is all I can think about, even if I try not to. 

I originally posted this to r/jobs, but no avail.",20May2020,1

545,"My fiance and I have been living in this apartment for 3 years now.  Her last roommate wanted to move out before the end of the lease to live with her boyfriend.  We were okay with this, however we needed her to find a replacement roommate before leaving.

We found a replacement, who verbally agreed to finish the current lease and sign the lease for the next year.  She moved in all of her stuff in the beginning of May and paid May's rent.

Now she is suddenly moving out this Friday with no intention to pay June's rent and is not trying to find us anyone to replace her.  We are fine with not renewing our contract for another year but we need help paying for the next two month's rent.

We also found out that she had told us that she signed the addendum to replace the previous roommate and the new lease but we have now found out she never signed anything.

What can we do?  Would an implied agreement hold up in small claims court?  What evidence would we need to support an implied agreement?

557,"My roommate annoys the crap out of me. I’m an introvert and she’s an extrovert and she talks constantly. Like if I open a window she’ll say “That’s a good idea!” If I close it she’ll also say “Good idea it was getting chilly!” I feel like I can’t do anything without her adding an opinion about it. If I’m making dinner she always walks by and says “Ooooh”. Even when I’m in my room she’ll poke her nose in to comment on how cute the cat is or on what I’m watching or on how I’ve arranged my furniture.

If she’s making dinner she’ll narrate it “Making tacos today yum yum! Almost out of flatbread.” If I’m not around then she’ll talk to the cat with a horrible baby voice that I’ve asked her to stop doing. She just makes so much noise. She talks constantly and she clears her throat or blows her nose every 20 seconds because of allergies.

A few times I’ve had to ask her to do things, like clean her dishes. but she never asks me to change my behaviour in return so I’m not comfortable asking her to stop the annoying behaviours because it’s too one-sided. I don’t want it to be like I’m criticizing her for everything she does.

We used to watch TV together and try to have conversations when I first moved in. But over time I just find her more and more unbearable. She just talks constantly and I don’t have the energy for it. Even watching TV she would put herself in the show and talk about how she would behave in that situation, which is not interesting to me. I stopped watching TV with her because she talks over it, or she’ll rewatch the same tv show on repeat over and over and it drives me nuts. My first year living with her she watched Mindy Project all the way through 3 times in a row.

559,"I was recently accepted into university for the coming fall. I’ve dropped out the last two times and to deal with mental health/family issues. Both times I was afraid to study what I want to study because my family and others have high expectations for me; however, this time around I want to study what I want.

I’ve also had a dream since I was a kid to go to a certain university - although I was denied the first time I applied to schools I have hope I can go through the graduate program.

Although it’s a dream I have I’m afraid it isn’t worth it. Getting a PhD is extremely difficult and would take a ton of effort to get there. I’d have to cut back on socializing and traveling to see family because I also have to work part-time to get me through. I know I want to study this stuff but I’m afraid going that route isn’t worth it even though I’d regret not taking a shot at it.

I also fear I’d regret not spending more time with friends and family and building important relationships because the time required to get a PhD done is crazy. It seems that no matter what I choose - be it attempting my dream, balancing my life, or simply spending more time with family and friends - I’ll regret it. I don’t know how to make a decision or move forward with my life. I’m stuck. I’m overwhelmed. I don’t know what to do or what I want at this point.",20May2020,1

563,"On may 19th, my whole family had a feast for my 11 year old niece and my 73 year old grandmother. In person. 

I saw pictures of them today on Facebook. I immediately felt very sad. I am dreading my birthday because of this. I just know none of these people in the picture will visit me tomorrow or wish me a happy birthday tomorrow. Only on facebook or on my phone which is like talking to a wall. You feel nothing from just reading texts and emojis. 

I am bummed out, sad. Kind of heartbroken. (Sort of crying as I'm writing this) so maybe really heartbroken. 

I didn't want to admit this, as a hyper sensitive person as I am, if not even a single person in those photos come by, it will make me realize no one actually gives a fuck about me and my suicide tendencies would skyrocket, I had this ideation since 2015. I've struggled on and off with this. These days it has gotten stronger. 

I've been dealing with two narcissists in this house for years, I've been abused as a child which I'm now a person with PTSD, I didnt graduate high school yet because of severe depression, no friends for 10 years. So now you see why. 

Deep down, I dont want another sad lonely birthday celebration again. Like when I was 18, 19 and 20. 

I just want to be in a room, feeling special for once in my life, my whole family around me- singing happy birthday to me. In a homey environment that I always wanted. I was neglected as a child, not seen as a person with rights or with emotions.. 

If I would continue writing about more info on that and about how my life is right now, it'll take possibly an hour and ruin me even more... so I wont bother. 

I am dreading my own birthday...

So... I just want to advices on other ways to celebrate my 21st birthday if I wont get a single visitor or birthday wishes...

My dad and brother are the narcissists I'm talking about.. my dad is too selfish to be selfless for his own daughter's birthday, which he discovered she's suicidal in march 15 because i confessed to him while he was drunk via messaging. 

Yeah anyway...

564,"i'm a disabled, 19M living at home and my mom is my caretaker. i'm kind of forced not to have a lot of personal boundaries due to needing care i can't give myself, but i do not like being touched normally. this is the only thing my mother actually listens to me on. 

she calls me whiney and says i ruin ""the fun"" when i need to leave a situation due to sensory overload. she'll disrespect the fact i don't like my things touched (especially things i consider my ""comfort objects""), and she'll give me the ""silent treatment"" when i ask if we can not talk about a certain subject. (as in, she will literally stop talking to me the whole day, and sometimes the whole next day.)

i've tried multiple times to reach a compromise but she does not budge. she doesn't even think she owes me apologies, ever. it's always been me crying and apologising to her and her going ""yeah, okay.

she constantly tries to put blame on me for things i didn't even know i did, and when i explain why i think she took my words the wrong way, she won't listen to me. 

for example: i had been (mistakenly) very stressed over my recently started college classes. she asked me one evening what i wanted for dinner and i said ""i really don't know."" but i guess my tone was wrong. a day or so later she starts venting to me about how awful everyone in the family is and how she is the only one who does anything.

the confusing part is she'll go back to being nice and happy and normal at the drop of a hat. she once told me it feels like walking on eggshells to be around me but that's exactly how i feel around her. sometimes she'll be incredibly nice and soothe me while i'm having a breakdown and other times she'll coldly stare at me for the same thing and tell me to ""Get over it.""

i have no idea what to do. if i ignore things they go back to normal but sometimes it makes her angrier. on the other hand if i try to talk through it and settle something she ignores *me.* nothing ever makes her happy and i'm at a loss. :-\[

I've been here for two years and have mastered the position. I'm frequently the go to for my peers, other departments, and even management. I've constantly used my knowledge of field work to provide the best customer service in can. I have my flaws, but I think I shine above the rest on the day to day. 

However, I have approached management about policies, procedures, tools, etc. I think can be upgraded or updated that would allow us to be more efficient while cutting costs and raising customer satisfaction. Each time, I make sure to provide examples or steps we can take as well as major parties involved. At this point we do more office admin work than any actual technical troubleshooting. While they agree, there is no push to make these changes. At all. 

When I brought my dissatisfaction to my direct manager, he said he agreed and that I should speak with his boss, the department manager. After two months of constantly pushing our meeting back, I was finally able to speak with her. I voiced my opinions, examples, and how we could make our department more efficient. This was met with multiple, painfully weak, argument against them. I've been feeding examples of these deficiencies to my managers but continue to get ""We need more examples"". 

This is paired with a peer who was hired from the field and given the a title of ""Support Specialist II"" due to the pay bracket. I asked my manager during my yearly review ""What steps do I need to take to move into the next level?"" His response was ""You're already doing it"". He says it's an HR problem and when I asked about it on the group call, with his Manager, she said ""We will see what we can do, no promises.""

Am I beating my head against a wall for no reason? Should I just accept that change will not happen and no amount of hard work will change that? I've double the required metrics, kept my QA scores near 100%, and constantly strive to improve myself and others. Ultimately, I just want to make my department better. When I leave I want to feel like I have accomplished something more than just ""my job"". I'm at a loss for options and at the same time, I cant afford to just leave. I need some advice. 

I should add that I've been told by internal and external sources that my bosses boss, the woman I sat down and talked to, does not take going around/above her with a grain of salt. Her counter measure is to paint a negative picture of you to her management and when you mess up, to let you hang yourself.

576,"\*\*hi I'm writing this super quick sorry for grammar or punctuation!\*\*

For background, my parents have been together for 20 years, both in their 50s, while I am 19(f), and my sister is 28. My parents have always been very active and loved to party, overall in really good shape for their age. This past December, while I was at school, my mother called me and told me my dad was in the hospital. It was during my finals week, so I took all of my finals in one day and came home that Monday. The second night I was home, within he almost passed away. It was probably the most traumatic thing that any of us have ever been through. We were fully saying our goodbyes and holding his hand, but late that night he was transferred to a hospital willing to take him. He somehow bounced back slightly in the ICU at this hospital and remained there, unconscious, for a little over a month. He was diagnosed with a rare disease that has caused many lasting medical problems that he did not previously have. He is on the road to remission, but not quite there yet.

This is where I am asking for advice. My mother, the most selfless and resilient woman i will ever know, is my dad's main care taker. Since all of this is relatively new, she has not had any time to sit down and relax. She went straight from the traumatic night of almost losing my dad, to 24/7 taking care of him. For the first few months, she was doing great and had everything under control, but lately I can just tell she is exhausted. I can feel how tense she is all the time, and she is also often on the brink of tears. She mentions wanting anxiety medicine of some sort to help her sleep, but doctor's offices are closed and she has no one to talk to. I am leaving to move back to where i go to school in less than two weeks for the summer. What can i do to help her feel better? I can't go back to school and leave her like this with a good conscience. My sister lives out of state, so I will be leaving her alone for the next three months. I have been home helping with things for the past few months, and she tells me that she is grateful and okay with me leaving, but I can just tell on her face that she is not completely okay; and not just regarding me leaving.

1, is it horrible of me to leave her right now? I have been strictly quarantined with them since march, because of my dad's suppressed immune system and the pandemic. We all agree it is time for me to go back to a normal life, I just feel so guilty. 2, how can I help her?? All I do is spend time with her and try to remind her she is doing amazing, but I just don't think it's getting through to her. Please let me know what you guys think, and feel free to ask any questions you have.",20May2020,1

584,"I (18, F, UK) have always had to deal with my parents being poor due to their reckless spending and lack of care. As soon as I started to get money, they started taking it. I tried my best to save so I could move out as soon as possible (they've always been extremely abusive and I need to leave ASAP... now more than ever) so I tried to tell them not to always ask for money without telling them why I didn't want them to ask. So far, my mum has taken £2.27k and my dad has taken £700. I always felt like I *had* to give them the money when they asked. It was all from my savings. I haven't seen any of it back even though they told me they'd pay me back when they could. I regret giving them anything and still lose sleep over it. They promised the money within a few months of taking it yet it's now been over a year. There was nothing signed (now I realise that this was a stupid mistake) and it was all verbal agreement, just ""don't worry, we'll give it back"". I don't know what to do. Can anyone offer me any advice? I'm so tired of this. I've cried so many times and I'm tired of being stressed out. I have no problem helping but this is just rude. If you are running out of money and can't pay your bills, cut back your spending... right? They both constantly waste money when they owe me and it's stressful to see it. Please help!

586,"I've known a girl for 5 years, and she's my best friend. I was there for her through thick and thin, especially when she had some tough times. She did the same for me as well, and I did end up falling for her at around the second year that we knew each other. I've never told her about how I felt even to this day. She has a boyfriend, and they're really happy together. Especially as her best friend, I didn't want to be selfish and ruin their happiness just for mine.

This whole Covid-19 ordeal has given me the time to think. When we used to hang out in a group when all was right with the world, watching my best friend and her boyfriend hang out together, I felt that I had no chance at all, I ended up shutting myself off from them. We did have fun hanging out, but for me, I'd most of the time sit in the corner and listen to my music and watch from afar. I had a few chances when she was single but I never took them. 

We used to call each other on the landline (home telephones for those who don't know) frequently and chat a lot. I'd literally run to the phone to answer it. Nobody else ever contacts me, she's my only friend who does... Nowadays, the telephone's gone silent. The sound of the bell which once connected us doesn't ring anymore. I find myself just sitting in front of the telephone just waiting for her calls once again, but it's silent. I feel really hopeless and spend most of my time just staring at the telephone. When I call her, she doesn't pick up anymore. I don't know what to do. There's probably nothing I could do. I keep telling myself she's busy but that's probably been a lie I've been feeding myself all this while.

She has a really great personality and my best friend. My only friend. I'm just at a loss on what to do.

Years ago i realized i could stave off the abulia with music, but right now all of my earphones are broken, and I wouldn’t dare to listen to music out loud since my parents hate any sound that they dont make, and they will probably yell at me.

589,"I have a co-worker who I see as someone quite different from me in terms of interests, personality, values, beliefs, etc. She is technically nice, a hard worker, polite, etc. It's really odd for me to say this, but the issue is simply that we are both people with very different personalities and life experiences. And that's something she doesn't realise, much less accept.

All of our differences are not a big deal to me. I can work with her, whatever. But I didn't see myself as necessarily having to be buddy-buddy with her. However, maybe because we share a lot of the same demographics, she does not seem to understand why we're not BFFs.

The perfect example of our awkward relationship is when she confronted me about having been removed from my Instagram Close Friends list. Apparently I had tagged her in a video that I quickly deleted, which caused her to be suspicious. She then discovered, through our mutual friends, that she was no longer on my Close Friends list. She confronted me after a few months of carrying this around with her. I told her not to bother with what people think of her, but she ended up crying. This is just one of the many instances she has over-inflated very minor issues (she's lived in the same small town her whole life... maybe that's a factor?).

Ever since then, I've just tried to remain civil and professional. I don't initiate small talk with her or engage with her in conversations I know she has no interest in. I limit anything personal I share with her. I do try to be polite and fake interest when she does engage with me or initiate conversations, but it feels very forced because everything she says/asks me seems so childish and trivial to me.

However she sees all of this as me being angry at her and unhappy with her. Recently she gave me a  note saying how she must have made so many mistakes with me and that she was seeking my forgiveness. Again, it caught me off guard. I had no idea there was an issue? Why can't we just maintain our professional relationship and leave it as is? 

I don't want to be outright rude or hurtful. I don't know whether I should have told her I want a strictly professional relationship, because I know telling her that would hurt her a lot (as it implies I don't like her or want to be friends). I want to be mindful of how I act with her, but what is a 'nice' and genuine way to treat somebody who is so different from me, yet who seems overly anxious about our 'friendship'?

TLDR: I work with someone who has a completely different personality than me. It's something I'm used to dealing with, but she's become overly anxious about why we aren't 'getting along' like besties. How do I interact with her in a mindful yet genuine way, where I don't feel forced/fake?",20May2020,1

tl:dr at bottom.

My(23m) partner(24f) and I have been together for just under 2.5 years and we're perfect for each other. We work well together, don't fight, share financial burdens, live together and treat everything as ""Us against the problem, not the problem against one of us"". 

It's been amazing and I can't stress enough **I DO NOT WANT TO END THE RELATIONSHIP**. 
I want to marry her and she wants that too.


About 6 months into our relationship, I admitted my fetish to her, to which she reacted wonderfully. Expressing her initial hesitation, over time she admitted that she wanted to try it with/for me and we proceeded to engage the fetish multiple times every month for the next year and a half. 

Recently however I noticed that she no longer brings it up in any context which she used to do. So I decided to leave it, perhaps she simply didn't feel like it on those times. Three months pass and nothing. 

About 2 weeks ago, after sex, we're laying there next to each other enjoying what we call ""after-fuzzies"" (post orgasm bliss). I decide to bring up why it's been so long and that if there was anything wrong that I want her to feel like she can confide in me about anything and I will not get annoyed/mad/sad, anything. She then tells me that she no longer wants to **ever** engage in my fetish again. 

**Damn**.

To clarify, I don't need to engage in this fetish in-order to orgasm. But it sure does excite me when it is in play. Therefore it's a big deal for me and hearing that she feels uncomfortable with it, making her no longer want to ever do it again, it hurt. But not in the ""You hurt me by saying that"" way. The hurt feeling like when you were a kid and you lose your favorite toy knowing that you will never see it again. So kinda like grieving in a weird, sexual way. 

Anyway. 

Ever since she brought up how she felt, I just haven't felt like having sex. Not that I'm not feeling horny, I just don't feel like sex. 

Now I don't feel any resentment towards her or any other ill-feelings and feeling like not wanting sex isn't me not wanting sex with HER per se. I just don't want SEX. 

About a week ago, I apologized about us not having sex at all in the week prior and she said she didn't notice due to us two going back to work after 7 weeks of lockdown and that was that. 

Fast forward another week and we still haven't had sex. Nor have I felt the desire to either. Now I'm getting worried and I start thinking of possible reasons why. Am I tired? Am I stressed about something? What could it be? I struggle to stick it to any one reason. The only coincidence is that I lost the desire around the time of her admitting how she felt. It sucks. I don't want her to feel undesired. She's beautiful and wonderful. 

I don't know what advice I need, I just need to get this out there, perhaps one of you have had something similar.

Has anyone ever had their fetish rejected? What do you do. How did you feel. 

Thanks in advance.

599,"hi my name is tiegan and i'm 14.  i got kicked out of my last school for a bunch of stuff but it was mostly for sexual stuff.  but i got expelled and so i have to go to the public school in my town.  basically i kept getting in trouble for doing slutty things but then i got caught with weed in my backpack too so i got kicked out.  anyway in my town there are two schools but one is technically private and its where all the white kids go and then all the black kids go to the public school.  i'm not racist that's just how it is in my town and idk why.  i got kicked out of the private school that i went to and now i have to go to the public school.  i went for a couple weeks before the schools got shut down for the virus and i didn't see any other white kids anywhere so i looked it up and i'm literally the only one.   

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcox\_County\_School\_District\_(Alabama)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcox_County_School_District_(Alabama))  here is the source it even says on wikipedia that there segregated so u know i'm not exagerating.  some of my friends are black and most of the ppl that live here are black but ive never been singled out like this before and idk how i should feel about it and what i should do.

i know some kids here from my town but they don't like me very much and i know some of them know about why i got kicked out of my last school and i'm worried i will get bullied for being a slut.  i have been doing online classes for a couple weeks bc of the virus and lots of the kids make fun of me for being white and no one rly ever cares.  one of my teachers asked if i was sure i even went to their school.  

i don't have any problems with black ppl but my family does and my parents are really mad that i got kicked out of the other school and i'm worried everybody will think i'm a racist too at my new school.  my mom went to the school to yell at the principle but she only got to talk to the receptionist woman who made her leave. and i'm sure everybody who heard about it knows that she's my mom bc we're the only white ppl there.  she is known in my town for not liking black ppl and mexicans.  please believe me when i say i'm not like her and i don't have any problem with ppl from other races.  

so basically i am just worried to go back to school bc i don't fit in there at all.  plus i already have a bad reputation bc i did slutty stuff and my mom is a known racist so i'm worried that i will get bullied a lot.  tbh i have bullied ppl before and i know it's wrong and i don't do it anymore so i kind of feel like maybe i deserve it.  and i know it's my own fault i got kicked out of my other school.  but idk i just don't feel comfortable with the whole situation but idk how to talk about it without being racist.  thank yall for reading.",20May2020,1

601,"I posted this before but got no responses so hoping this one gets some. 

Okay so this is kinda long and I really need advice. 

I have a cat named Taz and he currently lives with my (18F) mother (49F) and her boyfriend, we’ll call him J(48M). J is very very abusive, my mom has been with him for about 2 yrs and I’ve had so many instances where I could’ve called the cops on him but I haven’t. He’s hit his children, been mentally and emotionally abusive to them, and has done the same to my mother. He also likes to use his hands on the animals. Over there, they have 2 dogs and 3 cats, one of the cats is Taz(obviously) and is my mom’s and I’s cat, he’s about 2 now and was adopted before my mom started dating J. J is a truck driver and is gone all week except weekends, and he used to take the older dog with him but stopped recently. One week when the dog and J came back, the dog’s eye was completely bloodshot and when asked, J admitted to hitting him when he was mad. 

To make a long story short, J thinks it’s okay to grab adult cats by the scruff and I just learned today that he’s kicked Taz multiple times in front of his son. I’m not sure if it was hard, but either way Taz is an animal and doesn’t deserve to be harmed like that... to add to the story, my mom said once I move out I can take Taz with me to my new home. 

So here’s where the issue is; a couple weeks ago J hit his oldest and I called the cops on him, his oldest lied, J and I got into an argument and tried to kick me out and I decided to leave to live with my dad full time on my own free will. So now I’m basically fully moved out from my moms but I’ve agreed to spend the night maybe once or twice a week when J isn’t there. But since the whole ordeal went down, I’ve wanted to take Taz to my boyfriend’s(20M) house to live with his family. My bf’s family has a female cat and a female dog over there, so I think he’d get along pretty well with them and the family. I’ve talked it over with my bf’s family and they’d be happy to have Taz live with them. 

The full problem is that my mom doesn’t want me to take him over to my bf’s. She says that Taz helps her (which he does) and he’s safe over there. I really don’t think he’s safe at all. She also still says I can take him when I move out but I’m already practically fully moved out, and I don’t trust J around him at all anymore. Another reason is that my bf lives on kind of a busy road and she doesn’t want him to get out, which her road is also very busy but the speed limit is 30-40 mph faster than my bf’s road. Lastly, she says that she’d be still paying his vet bills and I told her I could pay for his vet bills. 

I’m having a really hard time deciding, I really want him to be in a safe environment with people who won’t harm him. But I also feel bad taking him away from my mom because she loves him. I already told her she could see him anytime she had a day off and they wouldn’t care but she’s very stubborn, which I am too I’ll admit. I know she loves him and he loves her but I just don’t want something to happen to him while I’m not there or she’s not there because J did something to him. And honestly at this point I think he’d do it just to spite me and my mom. 

Can y’all give me advice?

602,"Basically there’s a lot that goes into this but I’ll try to keep it short. 
My half sister has had her kids taken away and put into foster care more than once, as a result of physical abuse by her many boyfriends (she always chooses the same type of man). My sister started dating a new man back in December, and he moved in the same week they started dating, around that time my niece became depressed and as a result my sister required she be hospitalized and has made report after report stating that my niece should not come home because she’s “too dangerous” to have around her own siblings even though my niece doesn’t have a history of violence. Now my sister is pregnant, with her 4th child and now says she’s giving her over to the state and says “it’s what is best for her and me, she’s not part of my family as far as I’m concerned” this all stems from my niece telling the hospital that my sister also beat her (which my sister had admitted to doing and our grandma also witnessed when visiting) 
I don’t think it’s a coincidence that this all coincides with her new boyfriend as the timing of it is very suspect (he moves in, niece is hospitalized, he gets my sister pregnant, niece is given to the state) 
She’s now in a group home where it’s been documented that there have been several children who have committed suicide while there. There have also been allegations sexual, physical, and psychological abuse. Me and my husband have considered asking for guardianship but we are 20 years old and he’s in the military so I’m not sure how that would work. I just need overall thoughts on what to do, my niece has gone through enough, and I’m sure this only serves to compound the trauma she’s been through.

Now i just moved out of town to follow an University, i m a first year student, i was mad at myself for being shy, and not an interesting person in general, so i just did what i always wanted to, talked a lot, made a lot of friends, gone to parties, becoming ""popular"", there were many people around me cuz they liked that i smiled a lot and i was very sociable in their perspectives and i ve loved that, hell, i ve even been to many dates too, nothing happend tho cuz i m interesting for like 5 minutes and then people start to get bored...

My family is telling me to prepare and to give him love and show him we will be fine but I don't want to lose him. I want him to see my kids grow up. I want him to be there for me when i need help with my car or something with the house... I won't get to have him for so many things and my heart hurts. I have to be strong but i can't...  i'm weak. I know I'm selfish because he has lasted longer than any doctor could have imagined but i just want my dad to be okay. I can't let him see me cry but all i wanna do is cry. I don’t know what to do with myself. I wanna see him but I’m scared. Please someone help me I hate feeling like this because I know my dad and my family need me. Any advice I would really appreciate it.,20May2020,1
609,"this is a bit embarrassing for me to talk about, but i feel like i really need someone outside of my life to take a look in and give me their feedback, because i am just absolutely lost at this point.

so basically, i have this very vivid imaginary world in my head. i've had it with me since i was a kid, and it's grown over the years to fit my needs. i think of it as my way to cope with stress from the real world. i think about this imaginary world before i sleep, when i'm bored, when i'm sad -- it's really just become such an integral part of my life, almost like a constant in a way.

in my imaginary world, i have an alter version of myself i guess. they are cooler than i am, not really 'me', but rather what i wish i was. this is all self indulgent stuff, so they also have a tragic backstory, cool powers, lots of other friends they have meaningful relationships with, etc. i always imagine this alter version going on adventures or having conversations, it's basically a place where i can do whatever the hell i want to do, a place where i feel safe.

throughout my life, though, i've noticed a few things that make me unsure about the 'safeness' of this coping mechanism. for one, i frequently have identity crises because i get upset that i am not my alter version. this sounds trivial, but for me, it shakes my whole mood. the fact that i will never have those adventures or powers, and the fact that the characters my alter version interacts with probably wouldn't like the real me, these are all things that make me feel down. i then start doubting myself, i become unsure of who i really am. it's quite difficult for me to untangle this alter version from my personal identity, which is already lacking.

somewhere deep inside, i try to believe that i am my alter version, that in some alternate universe or something, i'm living the adventure i've always wanted. however, this makes my outlook on this reality more grim. i will have depressive episodes where i feel like this world is not up to par with my imaginary world, that my imaginary world has more to offer, and that everything is so empty and colourless in this world. 

so as of late, because i've been doing better mentally lately, i've decided to ditch this imaginary world. i don't think it's possible for me to create a new one, because all of this happened when i was a kid, and the 'magic' just isn't there anymore. i can't tell if this is an effect similar to withdrawal, but i've been getting depressed over not having this coping mechanism anymore too. it's been affecting my sleep, my creativity, and my overall sense of identity too, ironically enough. this world was my everything. i prided myself on having this imaginative ability and i saw great comfort in it. 

i've tried bringing the topic of this imaginary world up with my therapist, but i haven't been in contact with them for some time due to the quarantine and the fact that i hate online therapy. the few times i've talked about it to them in live sessions, they didn't really take it seriously, saying something along the lines of ""it's a harmless imaginary world, everyone has something like that"". 

what should i do? there is no easy solution imo, but i would love to hear what people think of this.",20May2020,1

611,"My husband and I are both struggling right now because we need some serious medical attention but we have absolutely no money to pay for it. Literally not even the copay. (In the US)

Our insurance sucks so bad. Long story short, last year we tried to get on Medicaid but we make about $100 more a month than the income limits in our state. I just had a baby in January so I really wanted to get on Medicaid so the baby would be covered. We even asked my husband’s boss to lower our pay for a month so that we’d qualify for the birth of the baby, but he is ultra conservative and lectured us on getting on government welfare  and wouldn’t help us. He’s a douche canoe.... my husband needs a new job... whatever. 

But right now our insurance is through his work and the deductible is about $4000 a person and the coinsurance after that is 60/40. So it’s really expensive. We owe $7000 on our baby and haven’t even started making payments because we are living paycheck to paycheck right now. We were doing okay when I was working but now I’m home with the baby. 

Well... I think I have arthritis or some autoimmune disorder or something. Every joint on my body hurts, especially my shoulders, and I can barely pick up my baby. I need to see a rheumatologist bad. I did physical therapy on my shoulders a few years ago and it didn’t really help, and now the pain has spread to my other joints. 

My husband has a gallbladder issue that makes him in so much pain he can barely sit at his desk at work. We have gone to the doctor for him before and they tried antacids, but it didn’t help. His whole family has had gallbladder problems and I think he just needs it taken out. 

But guys, we are so broke. I have absolutely no idea how we will pay for it. We already have the baby bill stacked so high. If my husband needs surgery we are screwed. I have met my deductible but that doesn’t help much when the coinsurance is so high. I don’t know what to do and I’m starting to panic. I really am. Any suggestions?",20May2020,1

My current job isn't related to what I want to do in life, and I spend my days bored out of my mind. I'd been looking to move on for a few months now. I thought I finally had an out when I contacted a start-up I interned with in college and got a verbal offer for a full time position last week. This job would be much more aligned with what I want to do in life and the company has been making a name for itself, but my job's existence would potentially be in jeopardy due to the current covid-19 situation.

I was originally excited to go back to the start-up, but losing that job is a very real possibility and I'm starting to lean more towards being sure I can pay my bills over feeling fulfilled in my job.

She told the group to add her LinkedIn, and I already did. What should I say without crossing too far into the creep territory? I was just thinking of randomly texting her, ""Hi! What are your plans after the semester?"" then see how she responds. Is that weird?",20May2020,1

Right now I'm happy I still have a job and an income and I don't have to job hunt during this mess.

I bought some expensive e-learning courses and books and working from home made me realize I needed a new PC too, so I bought one. I work in tech so as you can imagine nothing I bought was cheap. Still, I'm in the privileged position where it shouldn't hurt that much. I'm investing in my future, none of the things I bought are unnecessary and spending all that money didn't put me in an uncomfortable position financially and yet I can't stop thinking about it. A few days ago I had a full blown panic attack in the middle of the night over the costs of it all. My stomach ties itself up into knots every time I start thinking about it. I can't concentrate on learning at all. Seeing the books on my desk fills me with regret over the money I ""lost"" or ""wasted"" on them.

626,"Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile.

I’m attached to him already. We’ve been doing “foster-to-adopt” for the past week and a half, and yesterday we found out he’s had heart worm for over a year, and it’s caused his heart muscle to thicken and he’s developed a heart murmur and liver problems. We already have him on heart worm treatment, but the last phase of the treatment gets really difficult because of how advanced it is — they have to give him two shots and a blood thinner so he has a chance of surviving the treatment. After those shots, he has to be on strict crate rest for two whole months, only leaving to use the bathroom. He would also have to be on medication for his heart murmur and thickened heart for the rest of his life.

Because of all this, my parents have decided they don’t want to keep him, and are planning on returning him to the rescue place tomorrow. We still want a dog, but they want to look for a new one with less problems. I’m already attached to him — he’s a little corgi/beagle mix and he’s the sweetest dog in the world. The vet did an X-ray yesterday to check out the heart worm and also found a pellet from an air rifle lodged in his back that presumably the previous owner shot him with. I just feel so bad for him now. My dad said the vet implied he might not live very long even if we cure the heart worms, but I don’t care. I just want to make the rest of his life the happiest it can be, no matter how long that is. He’s about 7 or 8, FWIW. And if he’s stuck moving around different foster homes for the next 5 months (that’s how long the treatment takes including the crate rest) he’s not gonna have a great time. I just don’t want him to die being scared of people. I want to show him that people are nice and I want him to know he’s loved.

I’ve almost given up on changing my parents’ minds, they’re pretty much committed to giving him back at this point. But if anybody has any suggestions how I could convince them to give him more of a chance, let me know please. Mostly, I’d like to know what I can do to make his future as good as possible, and also how I can cope with being sad. I mean, I’m not devastated, we’ve only had him for 10 days. But I love him already and I’ll really miss him. Thanks from the bottom of my heart for any advice.",20May2020,1
627,"I’m a female in my 20s and the eldest child. I was born and raised here in the US but due to our culture, my parents have always believed mental illness to be completely made up or things that their own children would not be afflicted with. I’ve dealt with anxiety and depression since high school but it really escalated in college due to my field of study. Anytime I tried reaching out to my parents about the issues I was facing, I would be brushed off. For example, I had a really bad panic attack one day and I called my mom but she didn’t believe me because “you don’t even know what a panic attack is. There’s no way you can have one.” So I stopped reaching out and tried to deal with it on my own but it got worse to the point of self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and even some attempts. I was able to keep this all from my family and siblings. I would instead confide in two of my cousins (35f and 30m) who helped me anytime I called and would give me advice etc. Fast forward to this year, my siblings (older teens) went through my phone and found my finsta which I had used as a sort of diary/expressive space anytime I wanted to distract myself from suicidal thoughts. But the my siblings discussed those with my parents. This resulted in an “intervention” which consisted of them saying that they all cared about me and loved me. However this was immediately followed by statements such as “you have no right to be depressed,” “just move on,” “turns out your really are weak” etc. Because of this, I didn’t really want to delve into the issues that I had faced in the past few years and my parents then informed me that either I would have to tell them everything or I would be completely cut off from the family forever. I didn’t want to lose my family so I told them a little bit about the issues and I told them that I had been going to therapy for almost 2 years which had really helped. They were ultimately really disappointed in me and stated that they thought they had raised me better. All that being said, my parents have turned on the two cousins I confided in, who happened to be their favorite niece and nephew. The cousins ended up disrespecting my parents in my defense and now there is so much resentment between all of them. They won’t talk to each other or me and I can’t help but feel guilty because I was told that if I had just been able to keep everything in check and not dwelled on anything, none of these problems would have occurred. I don’t know who to turn to so please advise.

TL;DR —&gt; I was depressed and suicidal and my parents found out but instead of trying to help me, they turned on my confidants.

630,"Hello everyone here, I'm here to get some solid advice from wiser people than me. Recently, about half year ago I changed school because of bullying and not being able to adapt and interact with other people around here. Yeah so I changed my school where my old friends were (kinda stupid move but I was desperate) and then everything in social ways changed for better. I made new friends and stronger bonds with old ones. Until now when I realized that this school is too hard for me and I'm behind in my knowledge that I should've acquired when I was too busy trying to make things better. Making it less complicated I just put all of my attention to my mental wellbeing and ignored all of the school stuff that I was supposed to do. I don't regret it in the end because I feel a lot better now, I overcame depression and I'm much more confident person with my self esteem rebuilt again. But besides all of that stuff I'm failing 3-4 classes now and there is probability that I can not pass this school year. I don't know what to do because if I will keep going and fail in the end then changing schools will be more difficult but if I will retreat and change my current school then I will have to adapt again and make new friends again etc. I don't really want to leave my friends behind or not pass one school year. There's only one month left to holidays and end of this school year and I'm becoming more and more scared of it. And yeah one thing I didn't mention was that this school has a ""proffesion diploma"" which means that after I finish school I can become qualified electrician which is cool I suppose but I don't really want to become electrician in the first place. Sorry for my poor explanation of this type of highschool but you can always google it yourself it's called ""technikum"" in poland but in other countries you can call it technical school but it's VERY different from the one in poland. Of course all this stuff means I have to learn much more and it's awful when you hate this proffesion (basically i'm in this school only because of friends). I don't really know think it's a great idea to suffer in school for 5 years only for friends that will eventually leave you after all of you will graduate. Everyone after that point in life goes in their own direction. But hey, what do I know, I'm just 16 year old teenager  with lack of knowledge of life whatsoever. Btw I'm in first year of highschool if anyone  is wondering. If you have any questions about this ask and I will anwser them.

I and other employees just dont feel comfortable with that and i would hate to be the person to give someone covid because we couldn’t follow cleaning proticol. 

Anyway the owners wife (manipulative bitch) now wants me to come back to work, i just dont know if it’s worth it. I just feel like this puts me in a difficult position especially with covid going on and almost no jobs to apply for.",20May2020,1

Hi All,

I am seeing if I can get some opinions on a situation my GF and I are having with her work. She works in paralysis recovery. Basically she works with clients who range from paraplegic, quadriplegic, traumatic brain injuries, etc. and she puts together work outs for them to do together to give them core strength, etc. So she works very closely with them daily. She just started back up last week and on Sunday evening received a call that one of her clients tested positive for Covid-19. She was wearing a mask but the client was not as her boss has been very lenient with precautions and not taking temperatures and not having clients or staff wear masks while working out. She did have to help lift him on to a table at one point so she did come in contact with him along with another coworker and the main trainer who was with him (who was not wearing a mask either). They did close down on Monday morning to clean which is good but did not get tested that day as it might be too soon to be tested and risk a false negative, so they agreed on Wednesday they would all get tested. Her boss does not want to tell clients about the fact that someone in the building did test positive which I guess if they were not there that is fine in a way but she also does not want to tell the clients that were in the building on that day. Those clients used the same bathroom as this client which there was no cleaning done after that client had used the bathroom. All of these people have compromised immune systems and yes they are choosing to go in for their workouts but letting them know seems morally right and then you let them decide if they still want to come in for now.

Her boss then wants the same employees who worked with this client and have not been tested to come in for Tuesday and Wednesday to work with new clients who have no idea about this. She is then saying that she is not requiring people to get tested now (even the trainer who worked face to face with this client for a few hours) and if either my girlfriend or any other of her coworkers do not want to work before they get tested then they will have to ""part ways"". She did not schedule an appointment for Wednesday for any of them to get tested like she said she would. I am currently not working as I had to inform my boss just as a precaution because her husband has cancer and she does not want to risk herself, him or her employees until they know my girlfriend's test results and then where to go with me.

My girlfriend kind of got heated with her boss this morning and is afraid now that her boss might just say fuck it and let her go.

I just want to know of any opinions people have on this, are we overreacting to this or is my gf doing what is morally right during this time? She does not want to risk any of her clients possibly being exposed if she does not even know herself right now if she is positive or negative.",20May2020,1
635,"I’ve lived here in a pretty nice trailer park since October and never had any problems until recently when two other renters with kids moved in. They’re not related or anything but yesterday I drove my Jeep to the shop and it is loud and it’s because of the exhaust leak and that was it. My other vehicle I use for everything work, grocery shopping, etc... when I come and go from the park I go slow asf to where a old person could walk faster. Last night the maintenance man came over to tell me that people have been calling and complaining about both of my vehicles the Jeep saying it’s loud and the other vehicle saying I’m going over 10 mph in the park and blaring music. I didn’t even know it was 10 through out the park I thought it was less and I don’t even really listen to music that much. Their kids are between a year and like maybe 7 and they’re unsupervised all the time and don’t get out of the road until their parents decide to get off their lazy asses and check on them. So you have to sit there for god knows how long until they move. I was late to work one time because of it.They’re acting like I’m sitting in the car honking the horn and cussing the kids out but I honestly think it’s because they get tired of having to watch their kinds because the rest of bus have places to go.

637,"Advice on how to stop being so timid? Especially around superiors?

I [23 F] grew up being extremely shy (only child until I was 12!) and struggled to make friends in elementary school. I feel like being an only child for years really affected the way I interacted with others at a young age.

It wasn’t until high school and even college when I made long lasting friendships and really came out of my shell. I became comfortable interacting with others and talking with strangers. 

But I still struggle to talk to my bosses and coworkers, for some odd reason! I find it so incredibly difficult to engage in small talk with them. I feel like I come off as extremely awkward because I focus way too much on what I’m saying and how I say it and I end up being quiet most of the time. That’s NOT me at all! I’m usually very fun and conversation flows well when I’m with people I’m comfortable with. 

Maybe it’s because I worry about impressing my superiors too much and end up being afraid of saying something stupid. I always think to myself that if I have a question and speak up, will they think it’s a stupid question and seem me incompetent when I know that’s not true?

I just can’t stop feeling like I’m awkward around them or something!

Can anyone give tips on how they overcame this? Thanks so much!",20May2020,1

642,"Is this the right move?

I’ll make a long story short. I went on a date with a girl. She said she didn’t feel anything romantic towards me. I kept chasing her and a month later she started talking to me more. One week she was talking to me a lot more than usual. We talked for a couple hours over text one or two times. 

She added me on Snapchat when I didn’t request it. One night she snap me saying she was horny and a little drunk. We exchanged pics. I might’ve messed up here because I had no idea how to flirt and I don’t think I was very confident. Ever since she’s never tried again to do that and we don’t talk as much as we were that week. Last week I asked her if she wanted to go walking at the park and she said yea. That night before she got drunk and puked in the middle of the night. I asked the night before if Saturday was still on but no response. 

I figured it wasn’t happening but the night of she text me asking if I had dinner plans. We ended up riding on bike motorcycle somewhere to eat and then took a ride. I don’t think either of us knew what to talk about so maybe dinner was kind of boring but I know she liked the bike. The past couple times I’ve tried to talk to her she’s not engaging about it just one word or nothing to go off of. It was starting to piss me off a little. I asked her if she wanted to go again on the bike this Saturday. She opened it and took an hour in a half to reply. It was over Snapchat. She said maybe I’ll have to see. 

Like I said Ive been a little pissed at her lately. Idk if I should do this or not but I wasn’t going to text her until she text me and I wasn’t going to count snaps that aren’t directly said towards me. I also was going to say I have other plans if she answers sometime this week even though I don’t. I’ve been too nice to her and it’s got me nowhere. Is this the right move? Or am I overreacting?",20May2020,1

645,"
I am 15 right now and going to be 16 later in the year. My dad is British, but I was born in America and have lived in America my entire life, although I have been to the UK many times to visit family, and know lots of people there and like a lot of things about the UK more than the USA. I have a US passport, but in the past 6 months - year have realized I can apply for a UK passport because of my dad. The only hurdle is my mom. You see, my dad doesn't really care either way what I do, but my mom seems to not support this.  

The main reason I want to apply for a UK passport is because I like the country a lot and while I am very young, want to be able to live there at some point. The other reasons I want to apply specifically now is because right now since everybody is at home and theres not much to do, this is the perfect time to do this because I know my parents won't have time to help me or give me the documents at all when things go back to normal, so I want to use this window to actually get it done before it becomes significantly harder to track down all the documents. Not to mention, If I wait until I'm 16 my passport will cost more because it will be an adult passport. And if I wait until I'm an actual adult (18+) then it will be much harder to get my parents to help me send the supporting documents.

At random times during this past 10 months or so I have asked my mom to assist me but all these times she just tried changing the subject whenever I told her any of this and when I would actually ask her if we could do it, she would just say that it is useless. I was annoyed that she didn't care about this but I sort of understood at the time she was in an immigration process so she would need the documents and would have too much on her plate. However now that she has been done with her immigration process for 6 months and is working completely flexible hours from home I would hope she will understand and help me out, but from her reaction when I tell her that I want to apply for it in the next week or 2, it doesn't look like she will.

I can't lie because I am a little frustrated because every time I ask her if we can begin the process soon, she ends up saying that its useless and says something about her thinking it will make me not American anymore. I have literally put research into this and told her many times that I'm not getting citizenship, I'm getting a passport, and that since I have been a citizen since birth it will not affect anything. I have done so much research on this because of her that I find it kind of strange that I know so much about UK passport and citizenship by descent law. I secretly kind of think her dislike of the UK when she lived there has some effect on her decision making.

A couple solutions could be possibly waiting until I'm 16, because then I could get an adult passport, although I'm not sure exactly if I would be able to apply for this myself because while its an adult passport I am still a minor. Alternatively, even though my dad doesnt really like to get involved with this type of stuff, I could just tell him anytime in the next 6 months - year that I'm considering going to university in the UK and need a UK passport to avoid visa fees and whatnot, which isn't really a lie considering that I am thinking about going to the UK to study, but it could be hard for my dad to believe because he would consider it weird that I wouldn't want to stay in the US.

Whatever the case though, how would I convince my mother to help me in applying for a British passport?",20May2020,1

647,"Hi Reddit,

I study International Business Administration in Tilburg University (Netherlands), and I have big problem with the very calculative classes, such as statistics and mathematics. Not only are they really difficult for me, but I can not find the motivation to study for them. The rest of the classes, such as accounting, marketing, economics etc.. are fine, I feel like they are more interesting and you need less ""raw"" calculating skills and more learning the formulas and such.

&amp;#x200B;

I already failed mathematics, and most likely will fail statistics in the coming week, which is fine, I will have enough credits to not get kicked out, but I am not sure if I want to continue with this course. I choose it because it was a very general one with broad career path opportunities, but I am regretting it, I was hoping it would be less mathematical. I will have to try these classes again next year, and also continue with statistics 2 and math 2..

648,"I was a substitute teacher until COVID shut down the schools. I applied for unemployment and got a very small amount (because I didn't start subbing again until last September). Then I started getting the $600/week additional money and my required work searches are 0. 

School ends this week. If COVID weren't around, it's very possible I would not have looked for a summer job since I haven't worked summers for the last 10 years or so (I used to be a full-time teacher). Teachers/subs/etc. are not normally eligible for unemployment during the summer when they are due to return at the new school year, but in this case there might not be a new school year where I can sub. 

Should I continue to apply for unemployment? After the initial claim which I did a couple months ago none of the questions relate to teaching type employment. Should I assume that it is the government's responsibility to check or decide that? On the one hand it feels sleazy to take money when I might not be working anyway.

656,"Dear fellow Redditors, I need your help and insight on a problem I have. I am a college student who goes to college in a small college town. 

Last year, I lived in a supplementary dorm room shared between 5 people, me included. During the school year, I was rarely in my dorm, and therefore wasn’t close to any of my dorm mates. Move out day came, and because I was out of town, I was late for my dorm’s move out day to move my things out for the holidays. When I got to the dorm to move my belongings out, my dorm mates all moved out and left, and none of my belongings that were mine were there. I contacted one of the dorm mates through email, and he said they had thrown all of them out because they were unsure if I was going to return. However, the dormmate that I contacted had kept two of my items, an expensive heirloom watch and a pair of unworn and relatively pricey winter boots. I told him I will be back to retrieve my items. 

Due to my schedule and constantly being on the move, after a few month, when I returned to my small college town, I asked the dormmate to return my items. It turns out he lost the expensive watch at a house party held at his house a while ago, but he still had the pair of shoes. 

I told him then that he ultimately had to compensate for it, but we’ll probably work something out, since he told me he did not have the money to pay me back for it.

I took a break from college and was on the move again, with a busy work schedule.

Fast forward almost a year, I’m back in my college town, so I texted that very dormmate about the situation,and he still doesn’t have the money to compensate for the lost watch, despite him telling me earlier about his venture into stock investment. I told him I am down for installments if that’s better for him, but ultimately he still has to compensate for it. 

This is when he decided to play the “you were late to the dorm move out day, so according to the housing contract all of your items that were left in the dorm should’ve been thrown away” card. However, if he had left my watch and pair of shoes at the dorm, the housing staff would have kept my items in a late move out corner, because I sent them an email back then. It wouldn’t have been lost.

In short, the dormmate is now not willing to cooperate and take responsibility for losing my watch. I am deciding to either take legal action, or consult with the local police department about this matter. 

TL;DR:

I have a busy schedule and am constantly on the move. I was late to dorm move out day last year, and my dorm mates threw out most of my belongings, except an expensive heirloom watch and a pair of shoes, which he took home. 

Dormmate who took both those items home lost the watch. Almost a year later, he is not willing to cooperate and work out compensation for the watch. Am thinking of consulting local police or more. 

Are there any suggestions as to how I should proceed to receive compensation for my lost item from an uncooperative college student?",20May2020,1

To give some context of my romantic love life, I've basically never really had a relationship and I'm turning 20 in 3 months. I have been with people, but one was a girl I met after 3 days and then we basically didnt do anything together for 2 months, except cuddle, and then we broke up, and another one was a Long Distance Relationship that didn't go anywhere. Also broke up with her after 2 months. After that point I've almost gotten into relationships with people who think I'm nice or really funny, but it always got fucked up somehow, and I feel like that's partially due to my height.

I know a lot of people will claim that height doesn't matter in the end, but I'm so convinced it does! I know about 9/10 girls will say they don't care about height but once it actually comes down to it they feel less attracted to shorter guys. That's not their fault! I feel like the majority of girls are just subconsciously romantically attracted to guys that are taller than they are, and of course there's absolutely girls out there who really don't mind or even prefer shorter guys.

But MAN, these thoughts have done a huge number on my self-confidence regarding dating. For the record I'm already getting therapy for self-esteem issues and I've not brought this up with my therapist yet. But either way, I feel like the reason I haven't gotten in a relationship in 3 years is, not because I'm short, but because I think it's because I'm short. It's putting me in this endless loop, where if anyone even comes as close as SUGGESTING they prefer taller men, I give up on them and feel bad about my height and get more insecure about it and then I stop trying until I start trying again and then the same thing happens and it's and ENDLESS LOOP, and I HATE it. I hate it so god damn much, I just want to be able to get into a relationship with someone but this mental loop has got me extremely frustrated and I want to break out of it.

I want to hear your guys' thoughts though, I need some second opinions about this because I never feel like I got genuine opinions on this issue.

660,"I'll try to summarise this as short as possible, my friend who's now 19, dropped out of Sixth Form in year 13 (i don't know America's equivalent, high school?) and only has GCSE qualifications. During year 13 he stopped concentrating in class, said he would stare at papers and wouldn't know what to do, and feels he can't to anything else. Since dropping out he wouldn't complete courses/apprenticeships because the second it got difficult or he losses interest he quits, and says its because of his autism (he has mild autism, you wouldn't notice unless he told you) and his ADHD. Now, I partially understand, but it's getting to a point where he has just stopped trying to go for anything, at all. He has no prospects according to him, and i don't know what to tell him. He says he has no passion in any field, and that he can't work for a business that he doesn't find interest in.

He also claims he has anger problems, for example if he worked retail and had to deal with a rude customer, he'd knock them out and he couldn't control it. The only way he can control anger is the presence of his dog. He also says therapy doesn't work, for whatever reason.

What can he do, surely he isn't the only person in the world who's dealt with this, because that's what he feels like. He's been essentially self-quarantining himself since November 2018.

However, the quality overall was very disappointing to the point that I didn't sleep at all stressfully and cried. The breaking point was that I realized how terrible this choice I made, as the quality of this camp that school offered(so-called ""welcome camp, intended for introducing the school to the new students"") reflected their ability on dealing with anything, that might eventually push me apart from my dreams, goals and old friends aside from constant suffering.

That strong impact lasted for one month or so. I got a hard time to adjust how different were the people I'm facing with from the past in the city center. This school was ranked quite low and locates in the suburb area. The culture, hobbies, were grossly distinct from my experience. That was a huge issue for me to even communicate with others let alone making friends. I felt so alienated from every peers. And I developed an unhealthy habit to have lunch break alone hiding in a remote room, while others stay in classroom.

This habit eventually escalated. I started to search for more and more private spaces like abandoned floors and empty halls. In some extreme cases I even stayed there for the entire afternoon(5 hours), composing and doing my own business.

The main narrative for my school life ended. Nothing dramatic but some disappointing inuendos and minor disputes between me and the school offices and school policies(they are of military backgrounds. Straight up soldiers in general. Being there to keep the school safe as guideline described. I had a lot of bad experiences with these people).Â 

I lived my life steadily, as never really mentally break down(some others did during the last year, had I witnessed), although under constant stress. 

But one phenomenon got me reflected. 99%, if not 100% of all my dreams were vivid nightmares. About being alone in a huge dark maze-like building, about walking in another school, about rushing for something, about failing the test, about being trapped somewhere. Until yesterday has I keep dream about these, meanwhile the frequency went from two to three times a week to rarely once in a month now.

(Part II)

In the last year of high school, I applied for home study(a lengthy, complicated process) for the second semester meanwhile preparing for the college exam. I got such a high expectation and pressure to get into a decent local school. From teachers, and more of from my family. Still gradually I started to wonder how long will this last. And is this use of time really worth it. I went from studied my ass off day and night regardless of anything, to feel so doomed and gloomy about it and lost my motivations. Until one day I was informed that this college testing score and be used on applying to Germen schools. And that was somehow a ray of hope for me, as to leave for a new world. We had a lot of school advertisements and had a lot of time learning about them in a detailed manner. However these schools here just can't spark any interests in my heart. 

I can’t see my future in here. All I thought about was to apply for a German school.

Throughout school lives I have been always soaked myself in a completely different world than others. Music taste, hobbies, books I read, the game I played, the shows I watched. Sometimes even the family educations as I grew up in a Japanese rooted family.

This along with my personality led me to gradually became an alien in this environment. I fancy about going to the other side of world badly. Not escape but develop myself more. And Germany was such an opportunity.

Long story short the opportunities in Germany then fallen flat, not because of Germany but the institution that handle this. And I then decided to go to Finland.

Finland is like an impossibly perfect opportunity for me.

It has long been my high key favorite country for some reasons but never did I thought about studying there, in the sense of it sounds so hard to do.

I gaped almost one year til now. During this periodI secretly cancelled the local schools I made to applied here twice(two different tests I expected to take). As I never even told more than four people my German studying plans(namely my parents and teachers). The rest of the family are down right conservative and expects me to do what ever they think is right to do.

Now currently I’m on the track to a cool Finnish University.

(Part III) 

My first short breakdown was during the time I cancelled the second round of schools offered here(I got a not good looking score because I lost all motivation to prepare) and be found out by my parents. I did much research and so sure Finland is where I will be. My parents learned I want to go to Finland. But they insist me to have a lower risk way by enrolling a local school first. In case I can’t get into my aiming schools. 

That is a wise move after all. I might lose nothing but the period of time to reflect and learn more about myself 

However to me, at that point I was not even sure about going to a college at the first place as it’s just a weird norm here(99.9% of the high school students). I have a strong passion and attending more classes to me then was a bad idea.

So my mom told this news to her family. They became very aggressive and disappointed about the whole situation.

To me, before deciding Finland there was a ton of research and reflects(four months). I never told my parents the things going on with my future plans.

As they thought me it’s my own business and I should be responsible to it.

So when one day all the “passive progression” against my mom accumulated over the critical point. She had a talk with me. She said things like “I should force you all the way through your school life and made you in to the best schools”,

“I failed at teaching you”, “You need to retake the test next year”, “It’s unrealistic to make a study plan like this”, “You made my family feel very disappointed, why can’t you think about my feelings”. 

I was not ready for that at all. And all of sudden I don’t even feel like I can explain a thing to her. She was extremely passive aggressive. And I feel so painful inside.

I lost the faculty to say a word all the sudden. And I knew I was not ok at all.

In my family, just like the majority of Asian family, we don’t talk about mental health.

To her I was just being “weak”. 

And she started to say more mean stuffs, like and to me that was like a very deep attack into my heart.

My heart start beating very fast, I couldn’t breath normally, my limbs turned cold. And I just stuck there.

I thought about going to therapy after during that week, but then because it was just for that one day, I choose to “forget about it” the next day.

(Part IV)

My second break down was from yesterday til just now.

Because of the C virus outbreak, many schools started taking some measurements like closing down, postpone etc.

My mother then start telling me I might be conscripted into army because of the situation. As I need to get the proof for attending a higher education before they start to do the annually conscription. In short this is a messy situation. 

And so my mother start telling me to retake the tests here.

But yesterday when I looked at the official website it was like a heavy strike to me. I can’t read things on the site. I can’t read how to apply for the test, and felt very disgusted.

And then my father remind me again. I felt dizzy. And then four hours ago my mom start the whole passive aggressive act again, for asking me to sign up for the test.

But at this point I have many other plans even. Taking this test is the worst move. 

I don’t want to explain to her as she used to express how my plans are unrealistic and I won’t get the support and will fail eventually. And how failed her education to me is that made me do all these things. 

Her words make me strongly feeling like a failure at that moment. And a pretended mentally illed person fussing about something. She told me to man up, stop pretend. And said why can’t I consider her feelings, she will be driven crazy by me as well. Why can’t I just listen to them and do what they want me to do.

She thinks mental ill is a very shameful thing.

As one day I bring up this to her, she joked about it, and talked how depression really is as she witness it once in her life.

(Part V)

My parents don’t care about my academic performances as long as they don’t get the blame from their families. And not do something so different from others like not going to college. 

They don’t scold me, but always use the passive aggressive attitude towards me when they want me to do something they want. And when I’m feeling down or mentally not good I need to try hard to hide it. Otherwise my mother will stick to that and keep spraying salt on my wounds and make me feel far worse.

If I fail at the Finnish school I will do something else like just go to work again and save up. My goal is to get out of here and live in a different place. I’m learning Portuguese, my English is at a certain level of proficiency, I had the highest level certification of Japanese language, and Mandarin is my native language. 

So I might be able to find some teaching jobs abroad.

And also I want to get into music industry. I want to try many things. I have my own life philosophy much differ from my parents.

And at the moment to my parents all I should be doing now is study, and preferably stay here forever. 

When they see me at home, they expect me to study. For something. Like for the test, or for a potential test.

They think Taiwan a “good enough place to live”.

“Outside world is not that much better”.

According to their experience studying in France for their master degrees. Their jobs. And many things they observed.

Besides them, their family expect me to come back right away, as soon as possible after studying there.

But to me I’m just never feeling connected to this society even. The culture is unfamiliar to me, my friends here are just like me, mostly from abroad.

I’m very determined to never go back here for living. Born here doesn’t mean I need to live here for the rest of my life at all.

I currently live with them, and I want them to just let me go. But explaining my plans to them is just so painful now. And this test thing is still on heat. I still can’t get it done.

Am I just being spoiled, being too privileged? 

I know my parents are thinking for me but we have such a different value on this subject.

So I’m freshly out of college and living on my own in a new apt for at-least a year, maybe longer.

My options are as follows:
1. Use friends w/d which is simple but not as available as I would like.
2. Go to a laundry mat which just kind sketches me out.
3. Rent a w/d which could turn out to be just as expensive as buying one.
4. Buy them but I would have to get a moving team and instillation and idk what I would do when I move out. 
5. I’ve seen portable ones that don’t seem so bad, like maybe I should just get one but also idk if they are any good. But still wouldn’t know what to do with them when I move out.

So, I would appreciate if y’all could give me your thoughts on which one would be the best.

672,"Hello

I want to preface this by saying I went to high school together and we now live together four years after graduating. She moved in with me two years ago and this is when it all started. So it's me, my fiance, his best friend, and her. **She is also the only one in the house with a deadbolt lock on her door.** She says its because when her and her ex were dating that their old roommate would steal from them. I can barely even borrow a lighter from her without feeling guilty, if that shows you anything about the type of person I am. 

I noticed my clothes were ending up in her clothes, underwear and bandanas and things like that. I would ask her, ""Have you seen my black bandana?"" after noticing it was missing after I washed and dried it and she would respond with, ""I haven't seen it. I also have the same one."" Which she does.

At this point I don't even know what mine is missing but there are bralettes that have gone missing since she's moved in. She's also 3 sizes bigger than me, so none of my stuff would even fit her. I truly believe that she enjoys stealing thing that have little value to her. She also likes to steal clothes from stores, not so much anymore, but also likes to take plants from peoples gardens when we used to go on walks. 

This one time I ordered two different colored shirts off a website, the first colored one shows up, and then the next day I see the other colored shirt was also delivered but it was not in my mailbox or around my house. I eventually got a refund for the shirt but was disappointed when it never showed up. My roommate is packing for her friends wedding trip in Mexico while I'm also in her room and holds up the shirt that I bought and was missing and says, ""And this one's for Katie"" - the bride. And I proceed to say, ""that looks like the shirt I ordered, that says was delivered but I never got""  My roommate responds with, ""Oh well if it's yours then you can just have it. I ordered a similar one on Etsy, I can show you if you want.""  So had I not been in the room as she was packing, I may have never seen that shirt again.

Another time, I had my vape pen sitting out on the downstairs coffee table, she then left for the night and I noticed my pen was gone. I hate misplacing things so I searched high and low looking for it. I even checked underneath the rug at least four times. The next day she comes home, I say to her, ""have you seen my pen at all?"" she replies, ""I haven't but it should be around here somewhere"" so I leave to go upstairs quickly and then when I come back down to search for it I notice that it is magically underneath the rug. 

Both my fiance and his best friend have had bottles of alcohol go missing too. 

She likes to invite random dudes in my house in the middle of the night and not tell anyone either. This one time, one of the dudes she invited over stole an entire liter of milk. 

We have even come home during our lunch break without telling her and caught her wearing our roommates clothes. And my fiance had to go and ask her for it back. 

Another time, our old roommates, friends came over and left a jacket and when no one was around, she took it and wore it for months until our old roommate asked for it back when he caught her wearing it. 

Whenever we try to tell her we don't feel comfortable with our stuff being around her, she gets defensive and says she can just move out. Which isn't the problem, it's just her petty theft we have a problem with which can only be solved if she simply doesn't steal. 

Most recently, as of two weeks ago we had some friends over to play Jackbox in the downstairs living room. I brought down five stylus's so we could all use them when it came time to draw. I remember after they all left, I thought to myself, ""wow they left all of them and no one stole any."" Then a day or two later, our thief roommate was cleaning the downstairs living room and I notice there are four left, ""hey have you seen the other stylus?"" I ask her. She responds with, ""no I haven't seen it, one of those bitches must have took it."" So then come Thursday 5/14/2020 - she's playing Jackbox with her family over skype. After she's done, she invites me into her room to help her set up a dresser. ""You found the missing stylus!"" I say, hoping she would return it back and she responds with, ""Oh no that ones mine, I bought different colored ones on Amazon awhile ago."" I look at her desk organizer and I see other stylus' but not in the same style. I know she is lying at this point but I'm too scared to say anything because she just shuts me down or lies to my face. I then went upstairs and replaced hers with an extra one that's bent. 

Now its Sunday 5/17/2020 and I'm in her room because she wanted me to help her set up some wallpaper. While in there I notice my yellow bandana in her dresser drawer. So as soon as she leaves the room for ten seconds, I grab it and put in my shorts and walk upstairs. I didn't say anything because I'm sick of her getting defensive when I ask her or just straight up lying even though I did have the receipt to prove it if I had to. 

So yesterday, after festering over the yellow bandana and everything she has taken from us over the years, we finally got a deadbolt lock both for our bedroom and for our game room. And installed five cameras.

1. Kitchen, for missing alcohol
2. Front of the house, for packages that have gone missing if she were to ask.
3. Game Room
4. Bedroom
5. and Laundry room, where I assume she is stealing my belongings from.

My fiance tells everyone in our house group chat that there are now cameras being installed. And she responds with, ""Do the cameras have to be inside though? Like I get wanting to have them by the entrances but why do they have to be in the laundry room and kitchen? Can't we have them in the garage and porch? I do my laundry half dressed all the time""    \*\***We specifically didn't put any in the downstairs living room for that reason.\*\*** ""I don't really mind the kitchen one but the one in the laundry room feels weird to have inside."" she adds.

My fiance, who is trying to be polite and beat around the bush, responds with, ""It covers all the back entrances and back windows that are back facing. I just can't see the window from the garage and it was wide open today when I got home. I can try to find a better spot but yeah. I made sure no camera was down there so you wouldn't be that burdened""

She responds with, ""Ok.""

Now texting each other personally she sends to my fiance a text about bills.

This was their exchange. 

He responds with, ""It's all good! Just throw me what's owed for now :) and sorry about the camera thing, just want to make sure all valuable/vulnerable areas are covered.""

""Yea I get it but if we could maybe just move the laundry one I'd appreciate it. Just don't wanna feel watched while I'm doing my chores downstairs lol""

""Yeah I get that, we've just had shit go missing. I really would feel more comfortable making sure everything of ours is covered too. sorry to be weird about it.""

""What's downstairs that needs to be monitored like that though? You guys have all your stuff upstairs. I just want to feel comfortable where I live and I wasn't asked if this was cool with me, you guys just put them up and mentioned it after the fact. I really don't mind if the cameras are upstairs but I'm not really keen on having them in my living space.""

""I just know Sahand (me) has had clothes go missing that end up in your room, not trying to start anything but I would just feel better knowing our stuff is safe.""

She responds with, "" 👌"" like the mature 26 year old adult she is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know should I proceed with this, I haven't seen her since this text exchange and I hate confrontation but I'm ready to be open and say ""I've noticed my clothes end up in your clothes and I feel disrespected when I try to ask for them and you get defensive and lie to my face"" 

 I just don't want her to bully me into getting her way about moving the camera out of the laundry room because she is definitely a bully who likes to get her way. What are your thoughts?",20May2020,1
673,I've been married for 4 years now and my marriage is good. Just recently since this covid thing my husband has been working from home and everyday wants to have sex while he's on the clock no big deal one problem is he is very unhygienic and has really let himself go since he hasn't been in the office. He's always been unhygienic since I've known him she showers a couple times a month and brushes his teeth once a week. As gross as it is I'm used to it.  but the extra pounds and dirty scruffy beard is new. Anyways the other day he was using the bathroom taking a number 2 barely wipes his ass hops up washes his hands approached me to have sex. I politely reject. Because I know he just sat there on the toilet for a hr with his dick touching the water that hes shitting in. And I know there's no way in hell he would conveniently take a shower. Same thing happened today except this time I point out that the last thing I need is his toilet dick germs near my vag I'm already trying to get rid of a yeast infection he gets upset and storms away.,20May2020,1
674,"I’m currently staying with my partner’s family for the year and it’s kind of difficult for me because her dad is kind of like an authoritarian type where what he says is the only correct thing and if anyone makes a mistake he makes sure you know that he would have done better if it were him and he has to make sure everyone is always doing what he deems as being productive (so everyone either has to be in school or employed working over 30 hrs) and it kind of makes me feel a special kind of hatred. Growing up my parents were very hands off (tbh neglectful) and that made it to where I became self reliant, I didn’t have to have people tell me to do this thing or that bc I learned early on that I was responsible for myself so I just did it. Because of that I absolutely loathe being bossed around, or someone telling me what’s best for me when I know myself best. I’m trying to just shake off the annoyance and anger when I’m given input about what I should be doing with my life and the supposedly only right way to do something, I try to tell myself “oh well, you can’t just change a person like that. He’s gonna think what he’s gonna think 🤷‍♀️” I try to just tell myself that’s one of the costs of living here and I should just be grateful (which I am, but it doesn’t stop me from being bothered). I just feel like I need a better way to cope with it, I don’t like being under a magnifying glass and being told as an adult that I should be working more or making more money or making better grades and doing more and trying harder and working harder. If I felt like I needed guidance with my life I would ask for it. There’s nothing I can really do about his attitude about things but I can change mine. I know I won’t ever be like “yay! He’s telling me what to do!” Bc who likes being bossed around anyways? But the anger and annoyance I feel is kind of consuming and it puts me in a bad mood or makes me feel paranoid for just existing bc I’m afraid he’s gonna think “damn -_- just sitting around I see”.

680,"Alright y’all so I am a 24(F) living with my girlfriend of 4 years 24(F) and recently we let my best friend of several years (23M) move in with us. We have been struggling to pay the rent recently and he was looking for a place to live so he is paying 1/3 of all living expenses. It is a 2 bed 1 bath apartment with the 1 bath connecting to mine and my gf bedroom.


Now there are a lot of issues I’m having with both of them but they are both on the autism spectrum and I’ve always been pretty good at handling their peculiarities but I then realized that they hate each other... a lot. Neither of them can deal with the others problems and because I’m the connecting factor here they both want me to handle the problem with the other one. They both get angry that I’m “making excuses” for the other one because I will say things such as you “well you have your things and they have their things” and keep saying I’m taking sides. If I’m taking a side in this it is my GF because I do think my friends issues are a lot ruder and harder to deal with.

For example my friend has claimed a spot for his computer at the dining room table that we have in the living area and refuses to move his laptop ever. We’ve asked him to move before because my gf likes to do puzzles and paint but he refuses to move saying he has every right to be in the living room 100% of the time (he really is in there from the moment he wakes till he goes to bed). My girlfriend is upset because he has a nice desk in his room that he can play league and DND at but he won’t move. He also takes 2 hour long showers and has a 1 hour long skin routine that he gets upset if we mention but with one bathroom it can be difficult. We’ve also discussed that if the bathroom light is on and the door is closed that means someone is in there, but he constantly knocks on the door anyway. This is a problem for my GF because she refuses to speak while on the toilet so he nearly walked in on her the one time she forgot to lock the door because after knocking he tries to open it. One time we convinced him to move his computer so we could build a puzzle (he was not pleased) we took a break from the puzzle to go to the store to get popcorn so we could enjoy a snack while doing it. When we got back he had put the puzzle back in the box and put his computer back on the table. My girlfriend cried for like 2 hours and I talked to him about this. He then ordered a leaf for the table without consulting us and installed it and said “now there is enough room for everyone” not realizing that my gf needs alone quiet time to herself sometimes. Cuz he is loud, very very very loud. He also plays his crappy music though a Jambox speaker at all hours of the day so we constantly hear his music. Finally got him to turn that off when we try to watch tv.  

Now my gf I think is mostly in the right but she refuses to help me deal with it because they can both wipe the floor with me when it comes to confrontation because they are 100% logic based. So unless I can give a logical reason to something they will not budge. My girlfriend is constantly angry and crying anymore because she said she no longer feels the apartment is hers anymore but she wants me to “fix it” but I honestly don’t know how. She won’t go in the living room or kitchen anymore and refuses to cook meals so it’s all fallen on me.

681,"One of my closest friends is getting married in October. We are all so excited to celebrate, but with everything related to the virus, I am quite certain social distance measures will still be in effect at the time of the wedding. She has mentioned considering rescheduling and maybe plan the event closer to her (the venue right now is across the country closer to family), however her family has invested a lot of $ and time and they are kind of steering the ship. 

It's not my place to have opinions here, I'm not even in the bridal party, and I will likely attend regardless. But I'm genuinely concerned she may not be aware of what her wedding may look like: people in masks standing 6 feet from one another in pictures and not being able to mingle and dance with friends. I'm one of her few friends that works in healthcare and perhaps has a bit more realistic view of how this will all take shape long term through the fall.

Should I talk to her? Should I let it be?",20May2020,1
682,"Hey! I hope I'm in the right place for some college major/minor choice help. If not, please redirect me to the appropriate place :)

I'm currently looking on taking a Psychology major in college. However, I also have a interest in Neuroscience as well and was planning on taking a Neuroscience minor. But I couldn't help but notice they're quite similar in some aspects. I want to learn how the brain functions and how that relates to behavior, either it be from brain injuries or simply genetics.

As of now, in the future I plan to be a Forensic Psychologist or a Homicide Detective. After my Bachelor's degree, I plan on getting my Master's in Forensic Psychology. And then possibly a Ph.D. As a person who's lost a loved one to homicide, I wanted to help others better understand why people kill in anyway I can.

Do you think this is a OK decision or should I look for another minor besides Neuroscience? Should I just get a Bachelor's in Forensic Psychology or wait until my Master's? Perhaps you can recommend me minor choices that would be reasonable and in the right direction? I appreciate all the help I can get.

684,"I’m a female in my 20s and the eldest child. I was born and raised here in the US but due to our culture, my parents have always believed mental illness to be completely made up or things that their own children would not be afflicted with. I’ve dealt with anxiety and depression since high school but it really escalated in college due to my field of study. Anytime I tried reaching out to my parents about the issues I was facing, I would be brushed off. For example, I had a really bad panic attack one day and I called my mom but she didn’t believe me because “you don’t even know what a panic attack is. There’s no way you can have one.” So I stopped reaching out and tried to deal with it on my own but it got worse to the point of self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and even some attempts. 

I was able to keep this all from my family and siblings. I would instead confide in two of my cousins (35f and 30m) who helped me anytime I called and would give me advice etc. Fast forward to this year, my siblings (older teens) went through my phone and found my finsta which I had used as a sort of diary/expressive space anytime I wanted to distract myself from suicidal thoughts. But the my siblings discussed those with my parents. 

This resulted in an “intervention” which consisted of them saying that they all cared about me and loved me. However this was immediately followed by statements such as “you have no right to be depressed,” “just move on,” “turns out your really are weak” etc. Because of this, I didn’t really want to delve into the issues that I had faced in the past few years and my parents then informed me that either I would have to tell them everything or I would be completely cut off from the family forever. I didn’t want to lose my family so I told them a little bit about the issues and I told them that I had been going to therapy for almost 2 years which had really helped. They were ultimately really disappointed in me and stated that they thought they had raised me better. 

All that being said, my parents have turned on the two cousins I confided in, who happened to be their favorite niece and nephew. The cousins ended up disrespecting my parents in my defense and now there is so much resentment between all of them. They won’t talk to each other or me and I can’t help but feel guilty because I was told that if I had just been able to keep everything in check and not dwelled on anything, none of these problems would have occurred. I don’t know who to turn to so please advise.

TL;DR —&gt; I was depressed and suicidal and my parents found out but instead of trying to help me, they turned on my confidants. 

I would like to add that my parents have provided for me to the best of their abilities and this just happens to be a weak point.",20May2020,1

686,"I don’t know what is wrong with me, I’ve tried all the advice online. Exercising, changing diet, making my bed, talking to a counselor, trying something new...I’ve done it all. Yet for the past two years I’ve still been struggling with self-esteem issues and periods of almost zero energy that damage my productivity, sex drive, and mood. The only thing I haven’t tried is seeing an actual psychiatrist due to not being able to afford it and lack of “sliding scale” where I live.

I’ve been with my SO for four years and I’ve had to resort to hiding my emotions because she told me that whenever she knows I’m upset she feels like she has to drop everything to “babysit” me, even though I do not ask for it. The last thing i want is for my problems to affect her, yet she still lets them affect her. 

These issues have prevented me from being able to seek any sort of interest that could lead to a career where I could make enough for a place to live for the two of us, because nothing interests me.

688,"I apologize if this is long there are a lot of details that make this complicated!

My fiancés family has gone to the beach every year for decades. Earlier this year, my boss sat us down and we discussed the option of closing for a week. Taking a week off is otherwise impossible, even with extremely advanced notice. We talked about what month we should do it, and August (the month they go because it’s affordable) was off the table, along with a certain set of days of the week. This complicated things with my fiancés family, and everybody was upset, thinking they couldn’t go anymore. I told them I could just not go but that wasn’t an option. My fiancé wouldn’t have it if he stayed home, and he refuses to go without me. Thus, I feel like I didn’t have much of a choice. They asked what month we could go, and my boss said June was an option, so they booked dates without confirming it with me to relay to my boss. My boss was angry with me because now that was the week we had to take off no matter what, and she confirmed it with all clients and employees. Everything was planned and ready.

Then obviously the pandemic happened, so the beach was thought to be off, but since they’re technically opening back up in time, we’re still going to go hang out at the beach. My boss hasn’t told me if she plans on closing still, but it looks like that might not be the case anymore according to my schedule because we’ve been losing a lot of business. Because I made them change their dates and it was a huge deal because of me, and because my fiancé won’t go without me, I feel like I have to go (even though I don’t think it’s the best idea right now). But I also feel like my boss would probably kick my ass if I went, and probably quarantine me or at least question her judgement about me.",20May2020,1
689,"I'm a university student hoping to become an editor, and recently I've been making some extra money by doing a little freelance editing over the summer. I was overjoyed when I got my first gig, editing a full-length manuscript for an author to self-publish. So far, it's been great for gaining experience. The author has been very nice to me, I've learned some new grammar rules, figured out my editing speed, etc.

The problem is, every once in a while I'll stumble across something culturally or racially insensitive in the manuscript. They're few and far between, but it's been enough to make me pause and cringe a little. I was able to justifiably remove a few instances that worried me, and to fix some of the vaguer generalizations through fact-checking. But now I've stumbled across a section where a POC side character is introduced in a stereotypical and somewhat derogatory way - I have no grammatical excuse to change it, but it feels wrong to leave it in.

It's possible I could strike a sentence or two in the edits and improve the section (and I probably will). But my role in this gig is (technically) purely to proofread, so there are only so many excuses I can make if she wants to know why I made a change outside of grammar and punctuation. What's stopping me from just telling her that I don't like it? I'm an unemployed student getting paid and I'd like to finish the gig, I'm not a professional and lack the authority and experience to know if or how to approach this issue, I have trouble confronting people in general, and above all, she's the author and this is her book, not mine.

As an editor (sorry, a proofreader) part of me knows I shouldn't be changing someone's story to fit the way I would write it... But even though the book belongs to her, it will have my name attached to it too, in the acknowledgements. I want to put out something that I am proud to say I contributed to. I'm not sure where my responsibility is in this situation, and what my professional boundaries should be. How do I deal with this? What if it happens again?",20May2020,1

692,"Hello all,

I had to make a throwaway account as this person stalks everything he can find.

So.. at the moment I’m feeling pretty powerless. My girlfriend and I used to be in a small group chat with a bunch of friends we met through Playstation. We were friends for around a year with them and would play together near enough every single evening.

My girlfriend decided to start streaming her gameplay online using a platform called Twitch. About a week or so into the streaming in the middle of April, she was sent screenshots by this person showing a group chat of them and two other people from our friendship group insulting and slagging her off. We were completely shocked by this as we have been nothing but nice to these people, it was completely unprovoked and out of the blue.

She’s done nothing wrong and hasn’t ever done anything to him, I can promise you that. She loves her friends and seen this person as a good friend.

We had a fallout and removed these people from our lives, the other two haven’t been in touch since, but this person will not leave us alone, despite us telling them to leave us alone and blocking every interacting we receive.

Every. Single. Day since the fallout he has been creating many fake accounts through different platforms to insult and harass her. My girlfriend enjoys streaming every evening, but is struggling to do so as this person continuously creates fake accounts to join the stream and insult/annoy her. He has made accounts with insults in such as calling her a slag and insulting her looks. We ban the users and have reported at least 10 accounts to Twitch, but they haven’t done anything and haven’t responded to us so they can’t be permanently banned from her channel.

Along with this, they have sent text messages to me and my girlfriend with insults, tried to ring us over and over again and has used multiple phones to do this.

They have also made fake accounts impersonating her and have messaged friends with insults pretending to be her. This has happened on Facebook, Twitch and Playstation. On Playstation, this person would change a single letter in the name to make it appear like my girlfriend’s username and add friends of hers claiming to be her, in what we believe is a mission to ruin friendships she has.

Now this may not seem too harmful for some, but this happens every couple of hours, every day and has been happening since the 15th of April.

This person isn’t known in real life by many, we’ve heard they’ve done it before and uses false aliases online, so we can’t confirm their real name, only a brief location and what they look like. Only one of our friends have met him before and has confirmed what he looks like, he has also done this to our friend but seems to only target my girlfriend now.


We have contacted Twitch and Playstation but they haven’t responded. We have also been to the police, who are still investigating it but we haven’t heard anything for a few days. But I am here to see if there’s anything else I can do? 

This upsets her so much and I feel powerless. 

Every single day she is receiving this abuse and it’s so hard for her to stay strong because this person will not stop until he’s ruined her life.

I am so sorry if this sounds confusing but because so much has happened, I find it hard to word it all correctly.",20May2020,1

694,"I'm super ashamed of myself.  I've had a self harm issue since I was 13. At 18 I made a really big effort to improve my living standards and mental health. I even got a tattoo to cover the worst of it. The tattoo was like a mini celebration. I thought I was past all of that but I'm not. I'm not going to say it's an addiction, but the constant thoughts and sudden impulses make the relapse extremely difficult for me. 

4 months ago I relapsed. My job is stressful, my home life is stressful. I can't find any time to relax because all I can do is think about my job. My partner and I are also in the process of moving in together and as you can imagine- that is also very stressful. I'd like to preface this by saying my partner is not a source of my stress. 

The first time I did it, he knew something was off, but i lied and insisted he's seen the scars before. I said they weren't new and the only reason he's JUST now noticing them is because we we're laying in a new position. What a flimsy lie! Eventually I came clean and we had a super emotional moment about it. He asked me to promise him I wouldn't do it again and I should try talking to him about it before I got to that point. I agreed, now I'm a liar and a broke a promise to get help. 

How do I tell him it happened again?? How do i say I'm sorry I betrayed his trust? I just want to forget about it. I'm worried we'll get intimate, and it'll make an uncomfortable situation for the both of us. I feel disgusting and I hate looking at myself. I don't have to have sex anymore because if we do i have to get naked and I know he won't ignore it this time. I don't want to lose him because I have poor impulse control.

I wouldn’t normally mind but it seems to be constant, especially since I’ve noticed it. 

It often happens as I’m just walking through a room, too. The person will say something, sometimes just as I’m almost out of ear shot - usually loud enough so that I know it’s not them talking to themselves and working things over but then say they are not talking to me, specifically.

It’s really getting on my nerves lately, and despite asking politely for them to stop using me as some sort of verbal springboard, they continue - and assure me I am the problem.

698,"Three years ago, she (20) met a 40 year old man on Tinder. She was nuts about him.

We were shocked when we found out, but clearly she wasn't changing her mind about him, so we tried our best to tell her to be careful. She brushed us off, was very defensive every time we brought him up. ""Her choice"", is something she repeated like a mantra. Then, a  month or two later, she tells us she's pregnant. We are worried sick for her, but she again tells us it's her choice, because this way, the man will ""never leave her"". Lmao. She choses to have the baby. She then marries this man, without telling any of us she planned on doing so, told us how sad she was that we didn't attend (she lives on the other side of the damn country, btw), and that they hate the man because of his ethnicity. That they need to get off their high horse and accept her for who she is. All of this happened within 6ish months. The man quit his job, and forced my sister to work WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT to pay the bills. We sent her money for tuition; she promptly used it to buy a flatscreen tv that the man wanted. As much as it hurt us, we cut her off financially after that.

During this time, I (17F at the time) had visited her (before any of us knew about the guy). She was frankly disgusting, describing sexual acts in detail, bringing me underwear shopping (for the guy), and sexting the dude in front of me. Because of this, I didn't really want to see him, but she made me meet him against my will (told me we were gonna go get ice cream, there was no ice cream). They made out in front of me for like 10 minutes. I walked away in disgust.

My mom tried to visit her as soon as she found out about the guy, but my sister gave her an ultimatum once she was in the city. My mom had to first meet the fucking man, accept him, and THEN, my sister would meet her. My mom refused, and I called her while she held back tears, alone in a city on the other side of our country.

Anyway, then my sister moves and refuses to tell us where she is. She keeps spouting horrible things about my parents (they're racists, classists, they look down on the man because they don't fit their narrow expectations of what she needs as a husband, etc). I don't know where this is coming from; my parents have been extremely supportive and are worried sick for her. It's not about the man's money or race, it's about how hes obviously taking advantage of her.

Then, a year or so later, she tells us she's having yet another baby. We've all but given up. She refuses to listen to us and thinks it's our fault that there's a rift in the family. My mom now has severe depression, my dad, who had minor heart problems to begin with, is much much worse. A couple days ago, I sat with my mom while she broke down with an anxiety attack. We both cried for an hour. 

Yesterday, I videochatted with my sister. It has been a long time, and I think I had forgotten how twisted her mind is. I found out she's living in a shitty 2 bed apartment with four people, and can't afford to pay for the one class she needs to graduate. She told me all about how she believes God will be there for her. She said she plans to have a third child as soon as physically possible. She believes using protection is evil because it is against God's wishes. She believes the only purpose of a woman is to have children. She believes abortion is evil because it destroys gods creations. She said she plans on having children until she physically cannot anymore. She said she doesn't have to worry about providing for them, because if God allows her to create children, then God will provide for them. 

This is all what that man has told her. His entire huge family is involved in this manipulative ""Christian"" bullshit. I remember at the very beginning of this massive shitshow, my sister told me that the dudes ex girlfriend had actually approached her and told her that he had impregnated her, and was trying to get her to have the baby so that she would ""have to marry him and stay with him forever"". Thank God that poor girl aborted the child, and ran far, far away. 

My sister said this is her choice and I have no right to tell her that this is wrong. She said I simply cannot understand her because I'm not a believer. She quoted the Charter of Rights and freedoms. Whatever. 

The worst part is that she refuses to believe she did anything wrong. I told her it's her fault mom is so hurt, and you know what she said? That it's mom's fault for hurting, because she chose to hurt. She said if mom is hurt, then that is God's will. 

I told her it is irresponsible to have children in her financial and physical circumstances. She won't have it. She can barely take care of her two children, and yet she wants more and more and more. She told me she wants my parents and I to accept her for who she is, that it hurts her that we won't. I told her shes the one who cut us out and hurled insults at us while she ran away with a 40 year old thumb. She said something along the lines of, ""how can I want to be with a family that can't accept me for my way of life"". 

She makes absolutely no sense. Everything she says is logically unsound. We have tried for three years to explain to her why we are upset and she does not understand. 

I don't know what to do. I can't talk to my parents about this because I don't want to hurt them anymore. I don't want my sister to live her entire life as a fucking human cow for a 40 year old ass, living off child benefits and clothing/food banks. I love her; she's my sister. Do you think it's worth it to keep talking to her, or should I just shut her out?? What the fuck do I do to comfort my parents? I tried getting my mom to go to therapy but she said she doesn't want to talk to someone who won't be able to understand.

699,"I'm tired of hearing it. How she wished she raised me differently incase it may have slightly changed me. She thinks all her decisions still influence me and that she raised me wrong and she's a bad mother. My parents divorced when I was 2 and though I've never really gotten over it, there's nothing I can do. I believe as a result, it's made me not really value my family since my teenage years. Mum believes she was overprotective of me and though I've admitted she's right, I've also mentioned I personally believe I'm fine the way I am. 

She blames herself because I don't have a relationship, she blames herself for thinking she influences my every move and she blames herself for me having difficulty making friends (anxiety and confidence issues on my behalf). All I see is her beating herself up while also using both her and I as an example of her failures. I've told her this, I've tried comforting her and assuring her that she's wrong in some aspects of her blame, but she won't listen. She believes she has no one to talk to about her other problems despite my recommendations for counselling, but she refuses. 

It makes me not enjoy spending time with her (not that I do much unfortunately) as I feel she's constantly trying to maintain an unnecessary ego, which in result makes me maintain a similar ego. I've gone to therapy for this, but it has no effect if the problem doesn't want to change. I don't know what to do. It's depressing, it's frustrating.

710,"I sometimes go to auditions to be in movies which I enjoy. Recently she forwarded me an email that talked about an audition for theatre ( I only do recorded things because I cannot act infront of crowds )

I have told her that I don’t want to go and that and that even if I  nail the audition I would not want to act in the following project. She says” it will be a great experience” and that” it’s ok you’re just going to go” but she should not be controlling this ( I’m 14/15 btw). And when I bring it up she says that I should stop pressing her. I don’t even want to audition!

She does a lot of crazy, insane things beside this, but even though this isn’t the worst thing she’s done I would still like to convince her that this is a bad idea.",20May2020,1

712,"Whenever I get confronted, I'd try my best to diffuse and calm the situation down. Either by speaking softly, or letting the other person say whatever they want so that I won't have to listen to them talk too long or just agree with them for the sake of it and leave.  I love saying ""thank you"" to people who are angry, especially when I find the reason for their ""advice"" to be petty, ie being shit talked about my harmless study habit(like wth, don't f\*\*\* nitpick into something that works for me, you ass), or criticizing me for throwing away a plate full of food after a sudden onset of stomach pain(F\*\*\* piece of shallow crap, you don't know me, nor the pain I'm going through so just F off.), or receiving a sarcastic answer when I asked a rhetoric question. Like, don't respond to rhetoric questions sarcastically when you don't even get it, you f\*\*\* dense piece of shit. 

Anyways, after such confrontations, I'd always get unreasonably angry. As I don't get into verbal arguments (I hate them, they are more trouble than it's worth), but what happens if the massive build-up of anger that I get. The only way I found that's helpful is to vent my thoughts to non-related parties, although I do feel bad that they have to sit through my rant sessions. (and the fact that I kept having to clarify that my reenactments are words that I really wished I said but didn't) I try my best to keep the people I rant about anonymous if they aren't family though.

So... well, are there any post-confrontation anger management strategies? I need a way to clear my head after the pissing-off situations. 

Sometimes, I feel like my attitude made people I really dislike, think that we're friends, and they are pretty toxic too.  Like they'd put me down verbally when we meet and then say that they were my ""closest so-and-so friend"", honestly, if you were my closest xxxx friend, then I'd rather be friendless. 

Then there was once when my thigh was molested by a friend's friend, and sadly became my ""friend"", I really really dislike that person.  My plan of avoiding that person went down the drain, as somehow I kept sitting between my friend and my friend's friend. .......!!!!!!! Gosh, the memory pisses me off.",20May2020,1
713,"I went through an extremely nasty divorce. It took a few years to get finalized and that happened in 2015. Not only myself, but my kids also went through a lot. I am originally from NY but was loving in Florida when I got divorced. I am going to make a long story short. Just before the divorce was finalized I received a job offer in NY. I fought for custody but was not granted it. Although the judge did give me plenty of time with the kids. Before the divorce was finalized my wife left the kids with me (they were 11 and 9 at that time) and she disappeared. She still called the kids but did not see them for about a month. It turned out the she went back to NY and was working at a school as a pregnancy leave fill in. She still has her teaching certification in NY. I always thought she would go back to NY and work because she lost her teaching job in Florida and she can make much more money in NY. That was one of the things on the back of my mind when I accepted the NY job. I also had trouble finding work in Florida. After the divorce I petitioned for custody again because of the way she was treating the kids. They both wanted me to. In October 2017 things were so bad between my son (16 then) that she said she had enough of him. I flew him to NY the next morning. He was feeling good when he was with me. I got him registered for school and set up his whole room I’m the house. After a few weeks he said he wanted to go back with his mom because she said they would all go to therapy. It crushed me. Everything I was fighting for just crumbled. I knew his mother would not go to therapy and I was correct. My son and I were going to therapy in NY though. The therapist said he was fine and didn’t say anything about want to go back at all until that day. 

Now it’s 2020 and I remarried to a great woman on 2018. I am not fully happy in NY because I regret leaving the kids and feel so guilty. When I’m in Florida, which I am now spending time with the kids, I am so happy. I truly love my wife but I can not be without my kids any longer. My ex wife has serious issues and I feel like I failed my kids by not being here. I’m so torn and so stressed. I have one reason to be in NY and two reasons to be in Florida.

She gets really sensitive when we discuss her weight. Recently she became super comfortable showing me her body and I love it. i love her. But she often gets insecure and sad because of her body and helping her lessen that is definitely my priority.

I'm also afraid because while it's still alright to be overweight at a young age...there may be effects in the future.

I also know she hasnt been doing her injections and taking her pills on schedule, at all. Don't worry, she sees a doctor who has been with her in this journey. She started a year ago. She lost 10 kg at first but now her progress has come to a halt.The doctor expects her to lose 5kg or 13lbs this month...and she told me she thinks she didn't.

The only time they do text me is when they need my help for assignments and stuff.

As a young person (21 years old), it is difficult living in a time in which I have easy access to political opinions across the spectrum that can easily be found on the internet, tv, or even just by talking to the people around me. When people give their opinions on political issues, they are always so confident in the way they express them. You get all of these conflicting messages about various issues and people have various opinions and they come across like they come from the facts.

It is difficult for me though, because while I want to hold political views, at the same time whenever I do I hit a roadblock in my mind where I realize that even if I was to vote for X or Y legislation, I cannot know for sure that a.) it would benefit society, and b.) it would be fair to everyone in society. 

I also want to be empathetic to other people's beliefs (most of the time) and that is hard when political discussions lead to disagreement.

738,"I live on the second story of an apartment complex and the neighbors in question live on the third. Since the lockdown started in my state in late March, I've been working from home. I regularly have meetings and am attending a virtual conference today. Since day one, the children of my upstairs neighbors have been so incredibly loud, I've had to leave the apartment with my heart racing and hands shaking because I'm just so angry.

I have videos on my phone with evidence of the noise - banging, a strange creaking that stopped when I heard the mom scream at them, and *her screaming* so loudly that I can make out her words from my bed.

I saw one of the kids in the hallway the other day and I've never heard someone with such heavy footfalls. I know there's a possibility that the floors/ceilings are thin, but I can't hear my next-door neighbor's dog barking nor my downstairs neighbor's kids unless they get rowdy and start yelling during a video game (even then, it's nowhere near the same volume).

We tried going to them directly, but they refused to answer their door. So, I tried banging on the ceiling to let them know they were too loud. Not only does it not stop, they bang back and sometimes go on for about ten minutes seemingly being louder on purpose. Finally, I went to their door again after a meeting and the mother immediately blamed her neighbors (my room is in the corner of the building on the opposite end from that family, so that's impossible), told me I was interrupting her kid's studies, and said ""How dare you knock on my door,"" all at a volume that was clearly heard by the first-floor tenants. While she screamed, I went to the family nextdoor to her that she blamed and, while she continued screaming, asked the mother if her kids were stomping around. The kids had been in their front room all day and were barely audible over her screaming. They said no, of course.

I walked away while she starts screaming at that family (I'm so sorry to them) and, a few hours later, my dad tells me she came and apologized, saying she'd caught her children running around in their rooms instead of doing homework. But it hasn't stopped. Not only that, but the noise is not concentrated in any one room - they run through the hallway and living room and it can be any time of day.

I've been told to wear noise-canceling headphones, but I ended up wearing them for thirteen hours straight one day because there is *no break* from the noise. There's five kids in total.

The leasing office is closed, but we've gone to them before, about a year ago, and they were able to make the family quiet down for a couple weeks. My parents prefer the cops not be called, as my state doesn't have a clear noise-complaint law aside from music and gatherings, so nothing could really be done.

The worst part is the vibration. Noise is one thing, but the running vibrates and can be heard through a lot of headphones and travels down my wall into my pillows, so I'm woken up constantly at night and my ability to keep calm is deteriorating.

During the summer, they make a pool on the balcony above ours out of a tarp, letting huge amounts of water pour onto us or our stuff randomly. The wife and husband have screaming fights on the balcony constantly. I hate this place so much, but my parents can't move and I'll be moving as soon as possible.

But after receiving confirmation from the hiring manager, I sort of regret it and have realized I've been putting off getting a better job because I'm scared to quit my current one. I've quit many jobs, and it always sucks... But this is the first job I've had for more than a few months (been there almost 10 months) in the last two years, so for some reason it feels more intimidating to quit.

So, before I explain, I have mild Aspergers :/ and without medication I don't pick up on a lot of social cues. Luckily it makes me greatly affable, but I can never really read things like when people are starting to ""like"" me.

744,"Is uni worth it? I do have consistently good grades, and my tutors think I may even be able to make Cambridge or Oxford.

I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t go. I considered maybe taking a piercing course and becoming a piercer? I am also interested in that.

Lots of people have told me that uni isn’t worth it, especially for how much it costs. We are a medium-low income family and I would have to use loans. I could go for a less prestigious uni instead, but money would still be an issue. I don’t want to go and then not be able to get a job in the field, making it a waste. 

My biggest fear is to end up in a dead-end job I hate with a low salary and to end up depressed with where I’ve ended up. 

A) apply for Cambridge and lower unis, it’s worth the effort 

B) apply for a less prestigious and so cheaper uni in a cheaper area 

C) no uni, it really isn’t worth it

Now I just do whatever I want after I get out of school, sometimes not even going to school. I'm very afraid of my future but I can't seem to put any effort into anything.

746,"Throwaway account

My s/o has been working a job for the past few months, almost a year, but the past 4 months she calls me crying that she hates her job. She says she doesnt know if she hates the job or if shes just depressed. I assumed she was just going through a rough time. 

Now she is calling me on the way to and from work about 90% of the days she works (1 hour commute) saying she feels like hurting or killing herself. Often times she'll say shes going to kill herself and will hang up and won't answer for the next 10-15 minutes. I literally have panic attacks when this happens. I have panic attacks when she calls because i dont know if shes going to say ""im having a bad day"" or ""i ran my car off the road today""
I tried to tell her i feel like im being abused but she says stuff like ""i wont talk to you about my problems then since i make you feel bad""

Now I'm not one to just walk out on someone because they're depressed or going through a rough time in life. I want to help her, or if i cant, i want to be able to point her in the direction of someone who can. She's already in therapy but i dont think shes brought up the suicidal thoughts to her therapist. I never ask or prude on what goes on during her therapy but she has mentioned that her therapist doesnt know because shes scared of being hospitalized 

Am i wrong for feeling abused? What advice can i offer? Should i alert someone in healthcare that her life is in danger?",20May2020,1
747,"I am currently a security guard, and am the senior guard on site since I have been here for 3 years, after me the one who has been here the longest has been here for about 4 months. I have basically been fulfilling the supervisor position unofficially for about 7 months. My last day is in the first week of July, and I am trying to make sure the site is taken care of after I leave since I actually do like the people I work with. It's safe to say that after 3 years and an extremely high turn over rate that I've meet a dozens of workers for the same job as me. And that has helped me gauge how to help out my current team since they all come to me for literally everything.

I have one employee, she's been here for about 2 and a half months, super nice and willing to do her job, which I take into huge consideration. She has unfortunately called out almost once every single week since she started or has had to leave halfway through the shift. With leaving halfway through or calling last minute that leaves one person covering multiple high priority posts which I have done before and it is exhausting. The reason that she calls out is because of health issues that she's having, which some seem to be last minute and she has been to the hospital before. I don't mind someone calling out, but at this point I am worried not only about her health, but also about her job as well. 

I need to talk with her about this and want to mention that if it is a continuous occurrence then she should see a specialist since this is not normal. How do I bring this up?",20May2020,1
748,"Hello!  


Next year I am to visit my boyfriend's parents in South Asia. I've already discussed with him how I should dress, and it's basically having to cover my shoulders, knees and not showing any cleavage. Of course I will respect that and not wear any of the summer clothing I would wear at home.

During this conversation I did bring up that although I will do as he and his parents tell me to, I still don't think it's okay that women cannot wear what they want to (not only in his home country obviously because there's a lot of judgement on women's clothing around the world) and that I don't think that this issue is a purely cultural one, but it also has to do with misogyny. I also know that colonialism f\*cked up dress codes for kids in schools, not allowing them to wear traditional clothing for example, which is obviously horrible.

So I am not quite sure how to address this topic exactly without being insensitive. As I stated before I'll obviously adhere to any rules his family gives me and I will not complain in front of them, but something in me really wants to have an honest conversation about why his parents expect me to dress and behave a certain way and if he thinks that's okay.

How would you guys go about this topic? Any advice for what I should stress, what I should read up on, what not to say?",20May2020,1

I should also mention that before the test mentioned beforehand they had already asked if they could help me, I of course declined. What should I do?

My mom literally said ""make a few questions wrong so they don't know that we are cheating"" and I see this purely as wrong.

750,"So I have been living with my boyfriend for around a year now, we live with his mum, sister, and younger brother ( we are saving up to move to our own place). I feel like everything I do is wrong and I dont know what to do. My boyfriends sister had a boyfriend who also lived with us and she had nothing good to say about him, but to his face she was nice.  
Now we pay rent and everything to Help pay for food and bills, but i like to help around the house: if I see washing that needs to be put on, I will. if I see washing up to be done, I’ll do it and dry it up, if I Know the airing cupboard is full, I will empty and sort it all out. And if everyones home at the same time we will always see if they want dinner with us and we will cook it for her and everyone.But everytime I do something she goes “you don’t have to do that” or “I will do that later” and everytime I’m alone, she’ll come into the room (I believe to see what I’m up to).

 My boyfriend has suggested I take a more laid back approach and just don’t do any jobs around the house. But I know that would annoy her as that’s what the sisters ex boyfriend used to do. Also, if she is left to do everything, the sink gets piled up, as does the recycling and the airing cupboard.

I love my boyfriend and want to be with him im just not sure how much longer I can take it. We’re no where near ready to pay for our own place. Talk to her you might think? She will always deny everything and to be honest it will probably make it more of a hostile environment. My boyfriend won’t move out and into my parents home as His brother is very young and it’s quite a drive away.

My CC balance is 3500$ for one and 6500$ for another.

752,"I just want to apologies first if none of this makes sense or it's gibberish, I've read it over and don't know what else to write.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 26 M from the UK. I've never known what I want to do with my life, I've never planned ahead and I've never seen myself being ""at the top"" of any profession. My only explanation for this is that I've suffered from Anxiety and Depression since I was about 14-15. I never thought I'd live until 20, then when I hit 20, I never thought I'd make it to 25 and that trend continues. 

I currently live alone and barely make enough money to live on, I had to ask my parents to loan me money for my car insurance this year because I don't have any extra money to save with. 

I have 4 friends, only 1 of which I know in real life, the others are online. (not classing any of my colleagues as friends as we never speak outside of work).

I thought about doing some courses to put myself in a better standing for a raise at work, or to help me find work elsewhere. Though I don't have money to pay for them, and I don't know which I would do.

I'm so indecisive and I end up just sitting playing video games and wasting my time. 

The thought of being single and living like this the rest of my life makes me not want it to continue. Since lockdown started my mental health has deteriorated a lot and suicidal thoughts have become almost a bi-hourly occurrence. I just don't see the point, since I won't make it to 30 anyway.",20May2020,1

The reason is, that I've had a pretty below-average life like most. I've been told I'm not smart enough to do/achieve certain things. Sometimes, it was my ex, some my ex-friends, some acquaintances. and a physics teacher. I always thought these were negative experiences but tbh I haven't really achieved much in life. I guess I also lack motivation. I think I'm ready to turn it around but I don't want to do it with the intention of proving anyone right or wrong. I want it to be MY want of the hour.

756,"As some background info, I am in a family of 6 with 3 siblings (2 brothers and a sister) and both of my parents (as I'm writing this, dad is 56 and mom is 52). My dad grew up having dogs around and loves everything about them. My mom has never had any kind of pet and would prefer to keep it that way. My dad has wanted to get a dog forever but with 4 kids and with my mom not wanting one along with keeping us out of trouble and the house in order, he accepted that it wasn't the right time (my dad is a doctor while my mom is at home but she volunteers, shops, and likes watch/record us playing our school sports which we are pretty involved in). 

Fast forward years later and we have myself and one of my brothers in college while my other brother will be a high school senior and my sister will be a high school freshman along with my dad planning on retiring in about 4 years. Since we are in the COVID-19 pandemic and stuck indoors for the foreseeable future, talks have erupted about getting a dog now. My mom wants a small dog (daschund, maltese, etc) but keep in mind that she doesn't want a dog at all but if she had to pick, she would pick a small dog since big dogs terrify her and need more maintenance. My dad want a big dog (golden/labrador retriever, german shepherd) that you can throw a ball to, chase animals off our yard, and in some cases protect family members. (My siblings and I have our own preferences but I believe this discussion should be skewed towards my parents)

Until my dad retires, my mom would have to be around the dog more often and that is unfair towards her since having a dog is a lot of work and I don't see her throwing the dog a ball or playing/cuddling with it but she also doesn't want to be the reason why we, particularly my dad, could be less happy. My dad knows the joy of having a dog in the house and although he doesn't say it, I can see it hurts him deeply not having one even after all this time. We all have talked about the pros and cons but it doesn't seem to help and no matter what dog breed we find (we have talked about medium size dogs like beagles) no agreement can be made. I just feel sad because no matter what decision is made, someone is going to end up upset/disappointed and maybe even resentful. Our tentative plan right now is to wait until my dad retires to get one (probably a labrador retriever since that was the closest we could get to a consensus)  but my dad will still be upset about it and a lot can change in the 4 years. Like what if they want to travel or go on a cruise? You certainly can't take care of a dog then.

762,"Sorry about the throwaway account, my parents are semi social media literate and know my main account name.

My mom has a very stressful job, and one of the main ways she does self care and stress relief is to decorate and redecorate/ rearrange the house. Since we have been stuck inside with no outlet she’s been doing it a lot more. To give her credit, the house is BEAUTIFUL.

I don’t mind when she does it, but I HATE when she asks me to help. I get instantly annoyed and quickly angry when she asks me to help her decorate. She changes her mind constantly throughout the project and makes us take everything down and restart multiple times. She is a (self proclaimed) neat freak and I suspect a bit of a perfectionist as well. 

I get upset and angry really quickly when I help her and it’s not okay. She isn’t asking anything difficult or wrong of me. She just gets a little snippy sometimes. So I’ve always felt like my feelings are irrational or uncalled for.

But here’s the big issue. She had a three day weekend this last F/S/Su and I had no classes so she went all out and moved her office into another room and completely redecorated in there with my help. It was horrid for me, and on Sunday night I broke. I had what I can only call a mindless meltdown, where I locked myself in my room and was hyperventilating, sobbing and hitting the floor for a good 20-30 minutes. I couldn’t think straight and just kind of shut down and when numb after. I knew something big was coming as Sunday morning and all day I was twitching my hand constantly and my right leg just kinda...refused to work? A couple of times. Like, I got so angry, that my leg locked for a minute and I had to limp??? But I’ve never had a big freak out like that.

I do NOT under any circumstances want to help her turn the old office into a guest room this Memorial Day weekend. I’m crying just thinking about it. I’m terrified to tell her no, as it’s a normal and reasonable request, and I’ve kinda never told her outright no on anything. I’ve said “no, how about another time?” Lots and always followed through. But I really don’t want to help her decorate the house ever again. I know it’s dumb that I’m having such a big response to this, but how do I tell her NO. without being a jerk?",20May2020,1

I am seeking out medical advice for various things, I have helped support my mother basically my whole life, oh and I also failed every single one of my classes this semester.

They are asking him to leave but he has only ever had one job in his life that he quit since he couldn’t handle (they helped him get the job), and they tried to get him to go to school and counseling which he also dropped out. He lies about taking his medication. He lies about using their credit card to buy food. He refuses food and just eats ice cream several nights per week. He stays up all night playing video games, takes 5 naps per day, then when he is awake just sits in a chair with a blanket over his head.

He is refusing help from them (even going far as to blame them for not doing enough for him), and becoming rude and unmanageable. The doctors say he has severe depression and anxiety but it seems there is so much more (he just blankly stares into space even when you are talking to him. He was sexually abused as a young child and has never given help while he was with my parents. He barely speaks and just plays video games all night and sleeps all day). My father committed suicide in 2001 with similar symptoms. It’s clear the relatives cannot handle him and none of us can either. He has no income, no car, nothing.

After fairly routine interview questions he said he would forward my answers to the hiring manager and let me know. 5 min later he said I had the job. Supposed to be 27 an hour for training and then 19 an hour after that. He said that (and this was the most alarm raising for me) they would provide all office equipment I would need and that they would send me a check to cover the cost. I’m supposed to go to their specific vendor to get the computer and software BUT the check for this will come from one of the 26 different companies that owe them money. Totally weird right? I asked why and he said that’s just how they do things. Odd way of doing things for a supposedly huge company operating in over 90 countries right?

I'm wondering what the best approach may be to convince my mom that my sister needs mental health intervention and has for years. She shows clear signs of depression/apathy, video game addiction. She's given up on schoolwork and doesn't care that she might have to repeat a grade, and doesn't care to plan for a future at all. 

My mom thinks my sister is 'lying,' is 'just lazy,' etc. It's a conundrum because my mom is very pro-mental healthcare on social media, lol. I need her to realize that she's being hypocritical and my sister is the one suffering for it. I live away from home and I don 't drive so I can't  take my sister to appointments. 

I love my sister dearly, and I need a new way to get through to my mom about this. Maybe any resources on what teenage depression looks like would be really helpful?

I wonder if there are people out there who after decades meet an ex again in a friendly manner. Do they ever become acquaintances again? These will always be complex feelings I have but they are mine to deal with.",20May2020,1
778,"Some context: I (22 f) just graduated from college and will be starting a new job soon. My boyfriend (22 m) also graduated and will be starting a job in a similar area. We've been dating for almost 2 years, and we have talked a lot about our future, including marriage. We'll get to it, we just need to save up some money first. We found a house to move into to rent together very recently.

My problem is that my dad was pretty upset when I told him this. He very much believes that couples should not live together until they are married. He has always been one of my biggest role models, and this is the first time I've ever heard him say he's disappointed in me.  He thinks by moving in with my boyfriend before we're married, I will be making our wedding less special because nothing will change afterwards as we already live together.

I would love some advice on what to do in this situation. How do you feel about living together before marriage? Do you think it makes a wedding less meaningful? Thank you in advance for your thoughts!",20May2020,1
779," 

So my boyfriend (19 M) of over a year and a half now has been discussing with me (20 M) to finally start moving out and doing our own thing. The both of us will be first time movers out of our parents house.

I'm used to being independent, since my mother is a terrible parent and my father is more of a tough love kind of guy, I'm used to making my own decisions, and it's not foreign to me when adults who live at home with their parents tell their parents they're going to do something instead of asking.

But my boyfriend? Ah. Well his mother sheltered him a lot before starting to push him away once he came out as trans. I've been with him through thick and thin of about 5 years as friends, so I know the whole story and I've been slowly building him up ready for the world.

There's just one problem. Everytime he wants to go somewhere, he has to ask his mother.  
Day out? Gotta ask.  
Come over mine to stay? Gotta ask.

And if he \*is\* allowed to stay, he's only allowed to stay for all of 3 days before she complains and tells him to come home.

I've said on many occasions that he can tell her he's staying with me for a while instead of asking, it shouldn't be a problem, he's an adult, and if she's that pressed about it, to just get over it. She can't start to push away her son then try and restrict him from seeing his own boyfriend.

Recently, I've been asking him to come up to mine and spend quarantine with me as it'd be easier for us to look at apartments, bookmark them, look at jobs and uni's nearby, etc for when this whole corona thing is over.

But everytime I bring it up I'm greeted with ""I'll have to ask mum"" or ""Have to wait for mum to get home"" and all these excuses, sometimes avoiding my suggestions completely. It's not like he has to sit awkwardly with his mother because I'll be the one picking him up? And he'll be staying for a while anyways. (If you're wondering why I won't go over his, it's because I do not feel welcome in the slightest. Forced to go out and walk their dogs with my boyfriend, etc)

After a couple days of excuses upon excuses I just got tired and snapped at him. (Obviously I'm in the wrong for that and I apologised after, and things are okay i think?) I said how it's getting really annoying and invasive that he's got to ask his mother for EVERYTHING. It really makes my heart wrench and my chest tight. I do struggle with some bad mental problems that I'm working on, and so is he, so getting our feelings across can be a little hard, but he's so damn insistent all the time about his mother. And when I say he's an adult and should be able to do what he likes, he complains he doesn't want the rest of his family to witch-hunt him. (His sibs are all a lot older and frankly, pretty horrible to him.)

I've gotten to the point of telling him he needs to start doing things without asking his damn mother's permission all the time, I've been patient for over a year now and I'm on my last nerve. Now he's mad at me, and won't text me or return my calls.

What do I do? ?  I've been as gentle as I can and I've just hit my limit",20May2020,1

It's been like this since last year but I figured back then it was just the cold weather and the single heater supplying their 2 units. Now though, with it starting to warm up, it doesn't help much. All showers at all times leave my wife and I shivering and uncomfortable.

We can hear when they take a shower downstairs, so we make sure to avoid taking one around their schedule but it doesn't help. I think they may have a clothes washer downstairs that they installed in unit which may be taking all of out hot water, but that's just based off of a few observations and could be wrong.",20May2020,1

They’re convince that everyone’s looking at my body while I’m walking and will tell me so many times to change or pull my shirt down. Everything I wear has to be either loose and cover my ass, it so tiring, especially since they got to do whatever they wanted in their youth and only became religious later.

783,"Okay so... my best friend and her long time bf now fiancé are finally getting hitched. The wedding is supposed to take place out doors in beautiful bar harbor Maine. Sad news is that they made these plans well before covid even hit our country. The wedding isn’t until September and I’ve been really looking forward to going but I also realize that we are in a pandemic. On top of my very good friends wedding my fiancé’s family also has an upcoming wedding between his brother and his soon to be sister in law. A few days later. In California. 

And did I mention we’re living in Hawaii? Hah so I’m starting to really have my reservations. For a number of reasons. In the beginning when it was late March, early April. I honestly believed that if people stayed home and if non essential business stopped. And if we were testing and really quarantining the sick, I thought this would blow over. But seeing how most of the country has really dropped the ball, also no help from current legislation on that one, it’s starting to fucking terrify me. 

If we’re going to these weddings we have a lot of traveling to do. A lot of opportunity for contamination. I don’t want to get sick. I don’t want to infect my friends or my future in laws. 

Also I don’t have health insurance. I don’t have a job right now. 

I know this week much of the nation is returning to some semblance of “normalcy” I definitely believe it’s way too soon. This second wave I feel is about to break upon us. People are still sick, more people are getting sick, we don’t have proper testing yet. People are dying! And people I know that plan to attend these wedding have compromised immune systems. Am I supposed to sit back and watch them share buffet style meals and hug and embrace friends and family members from all over this country?! 

 3 months is a decent amount of time. Maybe there’s hope, but also who’s to say what’s gonna happen. What if by then we have to shut it all down again or we can’t even gather in groups over 10. 

I guess I’m mainly putting this out into the universe of reddit because I might be seeking some affirmation on my thoughts because my future spouse doesn’t really seem to think that we’re at that much of a risk...which he may be right. We could potentially go and not get sick and have a grand ol time. I guess I’m just thinking that my friends and my future family are being pretty selfish. I think for the good of everyone and their guest they should think about postponing. It just really seems like the respectful and right thing to do. So I guess I’m asking is how I go about suggesting to my best friend that I think she should consider postponing her dream wedding. 
And then after I do that, how do I suggest to my future in-laws that they should consider the same. 
Without also sounding like the selfish prick that doesn’t want to leave her safe little island where almost no one is sick...",20May2020,1

785,"My roomate smells. Let’s call him Henry. Henry smells unusually bad. In every way possible. Every area in the house is subjected to his smell and it is beyond bad: his bedroom, his after shower smell, his cooking, and worse of all, his 3 poops a day (I’ll get to how bad that is later) It’s not a normal situation in any of these scenarios. 

Before you advise anything I CANNOT leave. Just advice me as if it is impossible for me to move out cuz right now it is.  

So both my roommate and myself are on the autism spectrum. I’m not gonna go into it too much but I need to explain that when it comes to our senses, we are complete opposite. I am sensitive to smell. He has admitted to me that he has NO SENSE OF SMELL. And I believe him cuz there’s no way he could live the way he does if he actually did. 

And I live in a house that’s kinda trailer-like. There is one entrance/exit and right when you walk in is the living room and kitchen. It’s all one room. To get to the rest of the house is a single door with a single hallway. This hallway has the doors to every other room in the house and the bathroom. In other words, one bad smell in one room affects all the rooms, especially if the smell comes from a room in the hallway. My bedroom gets the brunt of all smells because it’s in the back of the house so all smell flows through to me. Literally I can sit in my bed and smell everything. 

Let’s start with the kitchen. It’s the easier one for me to deal with because it’s the furthest away. We don’t eat together usually, but he eats the smelliest food possible. When he cooks it’s like all the most offensive ingredients you can think of. 

Now let me talk about his bedroom. Henry doesn’t bathe right. Idk what’s going on but he stinks. In fact places where he sits the most in the living room stink like him. I kid you not. Like I have stopped sitting in there cuz anywhere I sit, when I get up, the back of my clothes smell like his stench. It smells like a musty body odor smell. So his bedroom smells like this bad body odor moldy smell x1000. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him wash his sheets. I’ve been in there to reset the circuit breaker and to adjust the WiFi extender and it is BAD. The best I can do is keep his door shut and mine shut but once in a while he leaves his door open and I get to smelling it from my bedroom. Also because he smells, when he bathes, his post-shower vapor smells exactly like this body odor mold smell and it usually trails into my bedroom too. 

My other roommates agree that he smells. So it’s not just me and my autism/hypersensitivity. In fact, the roommate who used to be here MOVED OUT cuz he straight up said to me “Henry’s smell is ruining my life”. I am that roommate now. Henry’s smell is ruining my life. Especially with the pandemic, I don’t leave my house or even my bed. Even before the pandemic, I am legally disabled and stuck in bed quite a lot. 

Now for the final room of filth. The bathroom. Ok so I have been in this house for 3 years now. And at first I legitimately thought our house was suffering from some kind of plumbing issue because the house often smells like sewage backup. Other times I thought it was an actual dead animal trapped in the ceiling. I looked. There wasn’t anything I could find and if it was a dead animal it would be more consistent and take time to decay. The smells I am experiencing from the bathroom  come and go. I’ve been bedridden in the house too many times and alone with Henry enough to know for sure without a doubt, that it’s Henry’s poops. He poops 2-4 times a day. And every time I smell it immediately, usually before he even exits the bathroom. I sometimes have to wait 10-15 minutes before I can go into the bathroom and hallway and spray spray spray. I’ve used the powerful febreeze odor control in that expensive  can, and I’ve gotten the $10 unicorn gold spray. It works the best but it’s not enough at this point. In fact I’ll tell you why I finally resorted to this post. 

Just now I smelled the worst smell. I’m currently still suffering from the smell for two different reasons. I’ll get to both reason. And I’m smelling all this from the comfort of my bed even as I type this. 

So I smell the first smell. A horrible smell. A smelly smell that smells smelly. I knew this sudden smell was Henry. I peep out my door into the hallway and see he’s still in there. So I have to wait 10min or so to do anything about it, but I spray a few sprays of what I got on me into the hallway. But nothing could’ve prepared me for the smell that was yet to come. He finishes using the bathroom and leaves. I can smell from my bed that the smell has gotten much worse. I go into the hall armed with scent bomb (that concentrated scent stuff found at gas stations that’s honestly meant for smoking in your car). And the smell overcame me. I started crying. I don’t know if it’s because the smell itself is so bad or because the smell can burn your eyes. It smelled like a military grade scent bomb. I am not even kidding. An actual fucking stink bomb meant to take people out. At this point I’m convinced Henry has some unchecked medical condition because it was so horrible. I spray my scent bomb and my unicorn gold. I spray it into the toilet, the air. I’m talking like 10-15 sprays. And unicorn gold is supposed to be something you spray in the toilet water directly before you poo, but he never does. So at this point I’ve done the passive aggressive thing and left a note “before you sit, please spray in the toilet. After you get up, spray into the air. (I am hypersensitive 😢)”. I don’t know what else to do. I know it’s mean but at least with a note it looks like I’m addressing everyone. 

Now for the second smell. It honestly smells like he’s cooking shit. I don’t know if it’s because his bowl movements smell so similar but my brain can’t un-smell it. He’s cooking something now. It’s mixed in with the stink bomb smell and I’m just sitting in a cloud a sensory hell. I feel like I’m being tortured. This is where the autism comes in, the sensory part of it. I feel physically upset. My heart rate is up. I have a headache. I have sprayed into the hallway again, and I have a candle lit in my room. It just smells like garlic pungent vegetables and poop mixed together. I want to die. 

Please tell me what to do. Talking to him probably won’t do anything cuz HE CANNOT SMELL IT. And the other roommates are usually at work when he deploys his sewage stink bombs in the bathroom. So I feel like talking to them will do nothing. 

I share a room with my partner and I’ve begged him to move out together but he doesn’t listen. He just buys me candles and is at work when Henry cooks or poops, and he mostly doesn’t have to deal with it. But I DO. 

I need someone to tell me what I can do. Is there something I can hang from the ceilings or an automated spray machine that lets me control what liquid it uses? 

At this point I’ve been googling “how to get rid of dead animal smells” cuz I cannot keep running into the hall and bathroom and subjecting myself to that anymore. And I also cannot fully get rid of the smell either. I’m still sitting in my bedroom. A/C is blasting. Fan blasting. Window open. Please please tell me what to buy and I’ll buy it cuz I wanna die. 

This post doesn’t even get into all Henry’s gross habits, like collecting garbage in weird places instead of throwing it into a garbage can. Until recently he would pee like battery acid stinky piss and just leave it into the toilet. It was bad. Everyone got sick of it and he finally started flushing more. 

It’s getting to the point where I’m gonna have to link this post at the top of my eventual r/relationships post because I cannot live like this forever but I also know we are in no position to leave or kick anyone out right now.",20May2020,1

I've promised her that I don't think of her any differently, that I love her just the same and that she never has to hide anything away from me, that we can always talk about it without any judgement, she can tell me if shes thinking compulsively, if shes done something shes embarrassed about or disappointed of, that I always want to know and I always care.  I've told her I want to do everything I can to understand it fully and be on the same page as her, always be the best support I can be for her.  

Is there anything I can do to help her with this?  I feel slightly resigned to a passive role, just being ready to talk about it whenever she needs to, but I want to do something active to help her, but I also understand there's a limit to how much I can do.

803,"Let me set the story . I am m18, the youngest of 4 and I despise my mother.   

So my dad who is turing 51 this year has bees sober for over 20 years. About a mounth ago he started brewing his own beer and wiskey. (Bordom during quarintine) He started simply just tasting it and then light drinking and a few days ago he got drunk for the first time in 20years. My father is a very kind and gentle person . When he is drunk he simply goes to bed. He has never hit my mother and he is not abusive in any way.  The issue is that everyone seems very concerned about him drinking again. My mother threthend to deforce , my sister wants to denounce him , my oldest brother doesnt seem to pick a side. I decided to have a talk with him and honestly I dont see the issue. He works exstreemly hard and provides everything for the family.  He pays all the bills , he fixes everything , heck he is even jolly most of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got contactede by my aunt (fathers sister) and she asked me to convince him to stop drinking. 

Now here comes the question . Do I ?

&amp;#x200B;

He seems to be having fun with brewing his own liqour . He isnt doing anything Ilegal (where I live) and he seem really happy . I think he deserves to be happy. He is always there for me . 

I dont think he would be losing much if  he drinks. When I spoke to him he told me that he loves my mom but they havent slept together in years. He told me he feels like a prisoner . Im to young to make this call .

804,"new to this sub but  so I really don't know if this belongs here.

background knowledge that I guess you should know:

1. I'm 13 and in middle school
2. My parents where awesome enough to get me my first cell phone 2 years ago when I was in the 6th grade after an incident involving a swimming pool, a mini van, and a miscommunication with my brother
3. that first phone broke, and my parents got me a flip phone, it's amazing and I love it
4. I've been bullied for having it..

&amp;#x200B;

okay so basically, I've had a flip phone for almost 2 years now, and I absolutely adore it, it's great!  however I'm currently in the hormone filled hell known as middle school (or junior high or whatever). I've been given flak about how my parents must not love me because of the phone but I usually ignore them, it really gets on my nerves and I occasionally (all the time) ask my parents when they'd be willing to get me a better cell phone. I try not to sound ungrateful about it but I worry that they think I don't appreciate them even considering getting me a phone. 

they always say ""when you're more responsible"" and ""maybe when you're in high school"". where I live there's talk of having us retake the school year, so that's another 2 years until they'll get me one.

I do realize that I sound like an entitled piece of shit kid who's just whining about how he wants a new phone, and you might be right. I'm just tired of getting weird stares from everyone, I'm tired of being the odd one out, I'm tired of being the kid who has to take the battery pack out of his phone to shut it down during standardized testing. I just want to be normal.

805,"So, a little backstory: I had a crush on this girl but never did anything about it but I've gotten over that and now we're basically best friends (friend zone gang). I thought we wouldn't lie to each other but It turned out she had actually been dating this guy who I was/am friends with about 3 months before I was told.

So while we were texting today she told me she had actually had sex with him (didn't say it directly but admitted that was what she meant), I already had a suspicion they had done it but for some reason it just felt like a punch to the gut and I don't know why. I truly want the best for her and I can see she's really happy with him, I think it's the feeling that I'm getting left behind that does it for me since this has been a repetitive problem in my confidence.

They then talked about being able to steal the art without a real consequence since it’s not a rule to not steal art on the specific community we were in, but I got mad and kept telling them that they should ask the original artist for permission since they wanted to edit it.. And then they got mad since I was so stubborn about it.

My sister is often very angry, she loses her temper easily, can be very insulting (out of nowhere too), and she sometimes does strange things (I caught her licking the wall once, when she was under some stress due to my mom being away).

I feel like he might have some feelings for me as well, as we've talked a lot recently and have been kinda flirty. When I've asked about his girlfriend he's said that she trusts that he wont do anything and he had good communication with her, which didn't really answer anything

My other problem is that through trying to find out my about H, I started talking to his friend (call him J). I realized as he got a bit more flirtatious in messages, him even asking if we could share nudes, to which I declined. I enjoy talking to him but I just don't feel attracted to J the same way I do with H.

When I was 7, I had a dream that four brown dogs were chasing after me and the owner stopped them. The following day while walking to my grandmother’s house, a group of four Black kids chased me down for my jacket, only to have their mom see it and stopped them.

When I was 14, I had a dream that my grandfather told me he will never see me again since he was moving and I was distraught. The following day he died.

When I was 20, I was extremely lonely. I had a dream one night about being lonely and not having anyone, and a stranger visited my apartment to tell me that she sensed I was a good man and would like to get to know me (weird, I know). I met my GF of six years the following day.

When I was 22, I had a dream that a bathtub caved in through my ceiling narrowly missing me and I kept thinking about how I could have died. The following day, a large metal object flew off a construction site and hit the center of my dashboard, narrowly missing me by an inch or two.

Last night, I had a dream that water kept leaking into my car trunk, causing mold and the mechanic told me to get another car. I woke up at 6 AM this morning to my kitchen ceiling leaking onto the floor, and now the maintenance guy is saying I might have to switch apartment until it’s fixed.

I'm a 22 y/o private college student in a lovely program... the instructors are clear, friendly, always willing to help. My classmates are a great bunch of people to be around and great hard working students.  


I singed up and enrolled in May of last year. Fast forward up to now, I've learned a great deal, but one thing hasn't changed up until now... I'm still a procrastinator. I'd always put off assignments to the last minute , and always make excuses for myself for not doing something up to par and things like that. I've always felt very slightly disconnected from the rest of my class due to my lack of prior skills relevant to the program in question, but it's no big deal and something i've kept to myself. We all love each other equally.  


We have moved to online classes due to COVID-19, and the classes have been going smooth so far. They still are... but just not for me. I can not for the love of me find the motivation to keep up with the instructor or to even do any of the material being covered right in front of my face. Instructor is going on with the lecture, everyone is following along and asking questions, but I just can't do it right now. I just can't follow along at this point in time. I love the instructor and he's great but it's just like I want his voice to stop already I still want to do the work, I like it when i get into it and I want to thrive as an artist, but something is just preventing me from this... I'M preventing me from this, but I am failing to understand why I'm feeling this way. My thoughts are now stuck in a constant loop of (Losing motivation? &gt; ""Must be Losing interest"" &gt; Reinforcing fact I'm not losing interest because I love this stuff &gt; thinking i'm just telling myself that to make myself feel better).   


I don't expect a step-by-step guide to victory and I certainly don't expect anyone to hold my hand and walk me through this; I am just asking if anyone else has experienced similar feelings? Any of you able to offer tips on regaining motivation or getting back on track? Any advice is welcome... I feel like I've lost control of any sort of discipline.

I have no idea where that came from, I’m normally a fairly calm and compassionate person and I always try to do what’s right. I apologised to her a bunch of times and she seems to have forgiven me, but I still feel awful. I’ve been trying to help this friend of mine with her mental health for the past few months, but I’ve gone through a lot of trauma in the past as well and it taken its toll on me. I care about her so much and it hurts to see her in pain, especially this time where it was my fault. I promised I’d always be there for her, and I feel like I’ve let her down. 

After some reflection, I think that deep down, I’m just absolutely terrified and have been using anger to hide that. My life hasn’t been great, I’ve gone through a lot of traumatic stuff, but for a while, I was actually happy, and was turning a new leaf. But then, in the last few months I’ve been through hell, time after time, without any time to recover. I recently started cutting again for the first time in years and I had to turn to alcohol to calm myself down when I had a panic attack the other day. The only good thing in my life is my friends. I love them so much and I honestly would’ve killed myself if it wasn’t for them. 

I’ve been so angry lately but I’m scared more than anything. 

I’m scared of losing my friends, they are the only good thing in my life and I couldn’t live without them. I’ve lost friends before and I’ve lost family members. But now, I finally feel like a belong somewhere for the first time in my life, and the thought of losing that terrifies me. 

I’m scared of getting sick again and ending up in another coma.

I’m scared that I might never have a girlfriend or boyfriend, and that has made me irrationally mad at people in relationships lately. I just wish that when I woke up in the middle of the night, sad and afraid, like I am while typing this, that I had someone to hold me and tell that everything would be alright. 

Most of all, I’m scared that I’m too broken to keep going anymore. There is nothing in this world more terrifying than having to watch yourself turn into someone you hate. Watching yourself become so twisted by anger, regret and fear that you become a mockery of everything you once stood for. I’ve gone through this once in the past, and I barely managed to pull myself out of it. I was happy for a while, and then my world fell apart again. I can’t go through this again, I’m not sure what to do.",20May2020,1

Too long won't read: 


My boyfriend wants to move to France for a year, even though I don't speak French, and defer our plan being to move to Maastricht for university in September due to the pandemic. I'm ok with either choice,but I cant decide.


Before the corona-virus, my boyfriend (been together for a year, have lived happily together since January despite the pandemic) and I had plans to move to Maastricht (Holland) together for me to attend university and for him to learn his trade a bit better (bartending).
There's a lot more opportunities there for us and we equally fell in love with the city.
 HOWEVER
Given the pandemic, we are both unsure about going to Holland in September as the situation is still very bad there. My boyfriend started thinking about moving back to France for another year and THEN moving to Maastricht. (clarification: he still really wants to go to Holland, but thinks that it would be better to wait a year for everything to cool down.)
He's half French and has family there, he's confident that I can find a job there and he'd easily have one too. I don't speak French, but I can easily pick it up as I've already learned 5 languages beforehand.


It's true that I wouldn't like to do online classes if the pandemic isn't over by September, so deferring wouldn't be the worst choice. However, this year was meant to be my Gap year and I don't want to go into university too old. (I'm turning 19 this September and my boyfriend is 22)

So I am currently a senior in college and was supposed to be interning for a company in the Dayton area.

I have already signed my lease and am now basically paying 1750 to live there over the summer but with no source of income. It’s too late to back out of this lease. Is there any possible way I can ask the company to pay for the amount of lease since they notified me 10 days before my start date? I think they should because they said that I would be started June 1st and didn’t make any notion that this was only a possibility since I have signed my offer letter and told them I would be getting a lease in the area. Basically asking if I have a valid reason to ask for them to pay for lease and asking how I would work an email asking for this. Thank you and please help.",20May2020,1

835,"**Cheated ... now what? About a year ago, I moved in with my live-in partner (who has a kid, not mine directly), who stopped wanting sex. Even after several asks and conversations, he did not want to have sex, get married, or have kids with me.** 

Still seeing the person I cheated with, though on-and-off, and unsure if it has long-term potential. Feels like I can't shake the bad karma of the cheating. Obviously it can't be undone... If it helps, intuitively I believe my ex was cheating on me throughout our relationship. His child even said something like, ""even with all the cheating..."" once. 

Now my mind is full of memories of several exes and trying to figure out what exactly is needed for a balanced, sustainable relationship. While I'm trying hard not to follow them on social media, part of me really wants to clear the bad relationship karma and start fresh. In my heart of hearts I need a monogamous life partner who wants three kids. There, it's out in the universe! Just dwelling on this during the timeline-less pandemic... :-)

I could text him but that feels invasive and I don't want to give him an obligation to reply.

841,"  I am 22 years old, about to be 23 years old in college. I am originally from the east coast, but ever since I can remember I wanted to be on the west. I graduated with a degree in IT management back in 2019 and I started to look for work in the west. Portland, San Diego and Vegas were my top three choices. I had never been to any of them, but I had been to LA numerous times so I had been across the country. For months I would apply with either no response. I would take drastic measures and call the companies trying to hire. I learned something very important, and it's that most companies prefer local candidates over ones across state for at least entry level positions as the one employer said. Even then it was hard to get a job locally due to the competition of where I lived out on the east coast so I was having a frustrating time getting a job in my field anyway.

I made a choice to just go and take a leap of faith and try and move out here for an easier time to be employed. For the past almost year I have been saving money working at a part time job as a food runner at a restaurant saving money, as well as my savings during my college career to come out here. I did it by March of this year, right when the whole COVID-19 thing starting to ramp up. I guess I was being dumb and didn't take it seriously at the time hoping it would be over in the next month. The restaurant I was working at was closed the next week anyways when I was out here in SD. When I got here and told them I am now local, they started to try and move forward with the hiring process. Unfortunately with every single one of the employers, they say due to the pandemic they are on a hiring freeze. I got so far and they were gonna start me out with one employer but he said it can't happen due to the pandemic and as soon as its up he will hire me.

Of course there is another problem of mine with this. Since they said until the pandemic is up, I figured I will just wait it out. I can't even get the stimulus check, because my mom marked me as dependent after doing my taxes. She said it goes by last year or something like that instead of this year, but she did my taxes this year back in January. To me it doesn't make sense that I'm marked as dependent and I have friends that were in college last year that graduated in 2019 that got their stimulus check money. When I talk to my mom about it, the stimulus goes by last year instead of this year. so starting in 2021 I guess ill be considered independent. I am Independent according to her this year, so I can't argue about it I guess. Apparently too I do not qualify for unemployment, because according to my mom I had worked last year in October, when she tried to file my unemployment for me. So she got her stimulus check, but I didn't get mine which really sucks.

My mom was doing everything for me. Cleaning my room, doing dishes, paying for my car insurance and bills I was so lazy and she was so used to doing everything. I want to be on my own like I was in college. I finally took the leap of faith and did this. She argued with me over the phone saying she doesn't want me to really come home because of how immature I am. She complains so much about bills and giving me money all the time at home, what difference does it make. I paid for my housing here out of my own pocket of money I saved up.

I love it here in SD, I wanted to wait the whole pandemic out, but I feel like this is my only chance. I know I came out at the wrong time, but I'm more upset I can't get any job, stimulus money or unemployment due to this COVID situation. My mom gave me an ultimatum saying that I either waste more money out here waiting for things to get better or come back and live with her. I can't even go back to work if I live there with her, because the restaurant I worked at Is take out only and I worked as a food runner, a position for when restaurants get busy. I just want to be independent on my own, and Its very frustrating because I am trying to get on my own but she calls me immature when I have these ideas. She says me working part time at a grocery store is a bad idea and I don't think so because its something. She tells me I need to focus on finding a career out here, but it is so hard with the virus pandemic. I still have money to stay out here, because I saved a ton of money but I'm afraid if she is right like all my ideas she shoots down and says they aren't good. Im really frustrated and stuck.  Do I really have to live back with my mom? or is there hope if I just stay?",20May2020,1

843,"So I have been at a loss of what to do for a long time, and I'm not sure who I would be able to reach out to for guidance. 

Right now, I am a junior majoring in biochemistry going for a double minor in psych/chemistry and have just started thinking about going to med school. How original, right?  This past semester I got an XF (failed due to academic dishonesty) because I sent an answer in a class GroupMe chat since my school switched to online classes and someone reported it. I understand now how wrong that was, even given the current circumstances. It's a black mark on my record that I know will not go unnoticed, however, even with that, my GPA is 3.59 and will likely go up with summer classes this semester. I am also currently working as a research assistant, and will likely have the position for the next two years, so I have that going for me.  The only thing I lack is volunteer hours, but no hospital wants the liability of a new volunteer hanging over their shoulder with the virus. 

So my real question is, do I have a shot at med school? What does it really take to be a good doctor? All I've ever wanted to do is help people, and I have an interest in becoming either a gynecologist or a psychiatrist, but what can I do to be sure that's what I want? What kind of meaningful work can be done as a biochemist?

845,"I know I want to be a high school teacher. So it's gonna be a secondary ed major. But I'm torn between math and biology.

I love biology. It's super cool, and something I'm interested in. But there do exist science deniers. (Seriously my HS biology teacher was very religious and had a disclaimer at the start of her class that religion may say differently, but we were required to learn this stuff, so if you didn't ""believe"" in what we were learning, just parrot back the curriculum. I am very much a non-religious person, and this would be challenging for me.) I also feel like it would be hard to tutor kids that weren't getting the material, because it's just... Information about how life works, and I think helping kids who are struggling is one of the major motivators for why I want to be a teacher.

As for math... I'm not the *best* at it. I recall struggling through my advanced math classes in HS, but when I went off to college, the math courses I was required to take seemed super easy, and I delighted in being able to help my classmates, as well as my younger siblings with the things they didn't understand. I mean, the *concept* of math is cool- that fact that humans figured out and coded these secret, objective laws of the universe is insane to imagine, and it's undeniable. 

Some of my favorite, most cool teachers and professors were math educators. My HS math teachers did things like have us play with M&amp;Ms, or play calculus-related songs on his guitar, or pretend to be a douche bag (but was actually giving us tough love and all the skills we needed to succeed in life, and was a reminder to not take ourselves or the small stuff so seriously.. I wrote that teacher a long, thankful email later, despite having negative feelings toward him during school.) I distinctly remember one of my college courses started out with my adorably nerdy professor (think, a different cardigan every day, huge thick glasses, adult braces, and a mild speech impediment) introduced herself as someone who was bad at math and didn't like it. That like, blew my mind. And she was an amazing teacher.

So, I'm *leaning* towards math, but also that seems *scary as fuck,* for some reason. This is the second time I'm choosing a major (I'm 5 years into college, at this point) and I don't want to change my mind again or waste my time. (Also like, I'm gonna have to pick *what kind* of math I'd like to teach and that's another big decision that's scary.)

852,"Hey guys,
I just started a new job starting March and it's been until now, about 3 months. I was hired as a rehab technician to work with patients doing exercises and as a front desk help. This job started out great and my boss was nice to me and not flipping out all the time. About two weeks into my new job COVID 19 hit and we lost half our patients. My manager then suddenly stopped showing up for a week without reason, then showed up for two days and quit. 

My boss has been berating me every day since then, because he's so stressed out about the situation. I already have so much on my shoulders, I'm working the front desk and trying to learn rehab exercises, pulling 12 hr days without lunch breaks or any kind of breaks. There's just so much work to do and my boss is constantly coming up to me, adding on work and talking to me like I'm stupid. I just meet it with a ""okay"" and a smile because I'm a great worker, but all this negativity from him is getting to me. I don't have any co-workers to bounce the negative mindset off of so I'm just depressed as hell. 

Ever since my manager quit I've been doing all the work that she did plus my job and my original job duties are disappearing. I'm not working with patients anymore and just tied to the desk full time. I'm getting paid the same but I'm doing admin work which should be getting paid way more. So I'm doing more work than my last job, getting paid much less for a lot more work and pressure. I hate it here and to make it worse my best friend passed away two weeks ago and I'm depressed when I get home too. He committed suicide because quarantine got to him. Lifelong friends. 

Were such a small clinic it's just me and the doctor (my boss) so me leaving would destroy his business. He's trying to bring on a new hire sometime in the middle of next month which is too fucking far away. I am barely hanging on day by day. 

I want to know how to quit this job, how long to hang on for during this pandemic. The job market for a rehab technician is bad right now because there's less people working due to social distancing. The physical therapy clinics got hit hard. Quitting without having some form of financial income isn't an option.

In my position, I built a department which only did menial tasks that was disrespected by everyone into a department that handles a lot of more stuff a lot more competently over two years. I understand that she is in no way obligated to be nice to me, but it still sucks that she wouldn't care enough to acknowledge what I did, even to the point that she didn't even bother to respond to my emails besides an offhand response to one email in class. 

I don't care for the most part of what people think of me. However, I've looked up to her for the last few years as a role model, so that's why this even affects me. When I came into my school, I was a troublemaker in my classes, and I came in so depressed and I towards everything and I couldn't handle the stress of just being in a social situation, but I really had put an effort into my schools NJROTC program because I was learning things like honesty, respect, and how to be a better leader and because there was literally nothing else keeping me going. 

I never learned any of these kinds of things from my parents. All my dad ever does is tell me I'm not good enough and he used to make me feel so terrible about myself(to the point that it destroyed me as a person). I never really made close friends at my school because of how I behaved and I just was so depressed and done with life that it messed me up a lot that nobody gave a crap about me, but I chose to put everything I had into this program and it paid off.

861,"My husband and I have a friend that I met in a college math class about two years ago. We have since been inseparable. Leaning on each other, taking each other's advice, studying together, taking classes together. She normally gets along with both my husband and brother in law. Having their own inside jokes. She hated being told what to do and she tends to hate authority figures in general. Which by no means are any of us controlling like that.

Where we live gets extremely hot during the summer. It was hitting 90 degrees in March.  She was living in room with no windows in a garage and not allowed to use AC. Her mental health was also struggling due to the strife with her grandma who her mom helps to take care/watch over. She started therapy under my recommendation last year and we know she deals with anxiety and depression. We helped her move in about 3-4 weeks ago.

During board games that we play together, she tends to lead the show and advise everyone on how to play best, enforcing the rules and what not. Sometimes yelling if something someone is doing is annoying her or breaking the rules. She's always been nicer about everything towards me: As if I can do no wrong. Even when I admit of doing something that has annoyed her, she has openly said I'll just blame them anyway. She doesn't work or pay rent but contributes by cleaning and just generally being willing to help.

She has always been a touch aggressive towards my husband and is hardest on him. I think because he represents the patriarchy? But I am just not sure. (My husband is very kind, progressive, thoughtful, and wants to be a stay at home dad, so gender norms don't matter to him)

Yesterday she fought with her boyfriend and ended up crying while my husband was cooking dinner. She took her dinner and ate alone while watching a show. My BIL, husband, and I ate at the table then proceeded to playing scattergories. While we were finishing up our second to last game she interjected laughing with us and helping give judgements on the rules. I thought she was feeling better. We all started playing uno attack. BIL was giving her lots of attack cards getting her flustered. This went on for a few games where she wasn't winning. She won our last game. BIL made a joke. And then my husband said you finally won in a joking poke fun way. A screwdriver we had used to open the battery pack on uno attack was on the table still. She snatched the screwdriver and pretended to stab my husband with it. My husband said ""I'm done"" she put down the screwdriver. My husband picked it up, put it away, and retreated to our room. 

I tried talking to her about it last night. I asked her if she was okay. I asked her what happened with the fight. She said she was fine, she explained the situation. She doesn't like when her BF drinks but she also says she doesn't have a reason. He claims he will stop drinking if she has a valid reason. I named off some reasons and she didn't agree with any of them. I then said are you sure you're fine because you pretended to stab my husband. She was unapologetic and she said she was just joking. 

I have PTSD from abuse and neglect as a child. This scared me. I stayed up until 6 this morning freaked out. I locked our bedroom door because I kept imagining her ending up in our room with the screwdriver. I also have Aspergers-like social problems and have trouble keeping friends. I want to be friends with everyone and normally forgive easily. But this. This is a line I didn't know I had. I don't want to be friends with someone who would stab my husband(also best friend) and I think I don't want to be friends with someone who would pretend to stab him either. I want to protect him. 

I'm thinking we should kick her out. I'm thinking of not being friends with her anymore. But we have classes together in fall, I've been planning her wedding set for June 2021, she'll have to go back to her grandma's house. If I break off the friendship we will no longer have mutual tutoring and study partners. And I don't know how to deal with the awkwardness of breaking off a friendship (even though I've lost lots of friends).

I usually can take stuff like that but shes over a lot and my home is supposed to be where I can just zone out and have a good time. She also puts her two bits into things that are none of her business or that she has no say in. For example, I have my license and my brother does not and we had classes a 40 minute drive away for a bit so I had to drive him. My car broke down (transmission) so I had to get a new one, and I asked him to help. He expected me to pay him back and of course I am by helping him pay for his classes for school, but I told him (while she was there) that if our places had been swapped, I wouldn’t have expected him to pay me back because He’s my brother and I don’t care about money that much. She then said “I don’t believe that” like?? Bruh you dont even know me so why the heck you think you can come into my home and slander me. She also hates one my music abilities (semi-professional drums) and says “drums arent hard” which gets on my nerves a lot since I’ve put so much time into practicing and getting good at them.

* Hercules, Gaston and Tarzan like to bro it out in the gym and have, for 3 years running, failed to get past the second round of Love Island auditions.
* Esmerelda has failed to get any traction on her SoundCloud tambourine mixes and has reluctantly created an OnlyFans account.
* Tinkerbell has a flourishing online business selling PD oil (pixie dust) and has been vocally campaigning for the legalisation of PD in the media despite studies suggesting it almost always leads consumers towards mortal peril.

The other characters in the list are: Mulan, Jasmine, Aladdin, Aurora, Tiana, Cinderella, Snow White, Evil Queen, Frollo, Meg, Hercules, Belle, The Beast, Ursula, The Pied Piper, Maleficent, King Triton, Wendy, Peter Pan",20May2020,1
868,"My partner is 28, his dad 49, my sister is 35, I'm 24. Shes not interested in him but has a habit of talking to anyone who messages her and leading them on simply by responding and being nice. My bf has a strained relationship with his dad anyway and has already stated if anything were to happen between the 2 of them he would cut them both off and not have anything to do with either of them, which would be fine from his point of view but my sister is my best friend. 
His dad has messaged my sister saying how beautiful and sexy he finds her and likes and comments on every single thing she posts online. Shes done some pretty desperate things for attention before and I'm worried that even though she said shes not interested that she will sleep with him and mess things up. It would be weird and feel wrong if they were to start a relationship. My father in law would also be my brother in law and my bf sister in law would be his step mum?! His dad has done some pretty fuxked up things which majorly affects their relationship and this would completely tip it over the edge. 
I'm not sure if I should say something to his dad and tell him to back off or if it's none of my business, but I'm worried about the relationship dynamics.",20May2020,1

873,"Hey so I know that this sounds a bit egocentric and maybe even arrogant. I know that in the grand scheme of things, this isn’t a big deal, but as a human with human needs and emotions, I feel so lonely. It’s important to have a pack and I have had one on the past. Within these past couple of years, my absolute best friends that I’ve ever had have left me. 

I know that may seem like I’m biased, but it’s pretty simple. We are complex individuals and think certain times that things should be taken personally. That’s what my last friend did. I couldn’t follow up with loose plans and she thought that I was a bad friend because of it. I was just trying to be there for myself during a depression I was having and couldn’t really be all that reliable and I told her. Every plan set in stone, I myself was reliable. She took everything I did personally, as she did/does with everyone and everything. 

She told my other long lost friend that I “fucked her over”, even though she left the friendship, telling one of my other friends that she didn’t want to be my friend anymore. I had to find out through the other friend about this and it broke my heart. 

Anyways, with this long lost friend, I was messaging her the other day, trying to figure out what happened with our friendship. This person meant so much to me at one point in my life. I even saved her from a possible suicide. She was sooo important to me. We had a falling out due to me being too straight to the point I guess. My style of constructiveness is a little harsh and I guess that’s what has hurt my friendships, but I’ve only meant good things. I only have good intentions and I don’t want to hurt anybody. 

She told me that I wasn’t “better” yet. Whatever that means. She had heard of my falling out with the first girl I had mentioned, saying that I “fucked her over” even though she’s the one who left me. 

I feel very lost. I don’t have anybody. I don’t have family really, they were quite abusive towards me and since childhood I’ve kept my distance. I’ve only had friends. Am I doing something wrong? Has the abuse rubbed off on me? I can be negative sometimes and I have a dry sense of humor, but I am a loving person and I crave deep relationships. 

I’m alone, especially now. I know that this situation isn’t considered horrible or bad or whatever, but it doesn’t make this hole in my heart any more smaller.",20May2020,1

879,"Hi there I am 21 and currently live at home with my boyfriend (21), mom (45?), dad(49), little brother (18), and since September, my moms childhood best friend (40’s?) and her son (5). Life before my moms friend wasn’t absolutely horrible but it definitely wasn’t the greatest. My dad is a marine and an alcoholic and chronic weed smoker. He is a functioning alcoholic and can get up and go to work everyday but he comes home and drinks all night. He gets triggered very easily (it could be over something he misheard) and after that there is no coming back from it. I love my dad but he used to terrify me as a child and make me think I was going to die/get horribly beaten, causing me to sleep with a hammer under my pillow for many years. He never beat us but he always got extremely scary for hours on end and would throw things, slam doors, and scream for hours on end. My mom was more supportive in most things when I was younger except she used emotional manipulation tactics as punishments for me that give me anxiety I struggle with to this day. She also always blamed me for how my dad acted because “I should of known better.” 

Now her childhood friend and son have moved in everything is worse. She previously was living at her parents house but left because her mom slapped her in the face during an argument. She’s been here since September. Her son is 5 and is cute at times but doesn’t understand the word no and behind on a lot of things. For example, he doesn’t wipe his own butt, dress himself, if you give him a pizza lunchables he would have no clue at all what to do with it, he can’t open a bag of chips (doesn’t understand how and doesn’t want to learn he wants you to do it for him), has peed all over the bathroom multiple times (I sat in it once and my whole butt, legs, and feet were wet), slapped my grandma in the face on Christmas (his mom laughed), he wants you to compliment him when he’s naked/ in his underwear and will completely interrupt me talking to someone o try and get a compliment, is really rough with all the animals in our house (3 dogs, 2 hedgehogs that I rehomed a month ago, some fish, and a cat. He jumps on our dogs and has put his fingers in their eyes, tries to feed them chocolate or legos, probably more), and was caught by my dad 2-3 times now fondling my male dogs penis. My mom doesn’t care and won’t listen to any of us about how unhappy we are because this was her childhood friend and her ex husband/kids dad was abusive but they haven’t lived with him in two years. They use that and his age as an excuse for his actions, they don’t tell him it’s wrong or discipline in anyway. Needless to say I am very unhappy. 

So, how do you move out of your parents house? I know you obviously need money and good credit (mine is bad from hospital bills I have a chronic puking condition.) My boyfriend works but I currently don’t because I’m scared to leave my pets alone while the child is here and I also get sick a lot. Does anyone know of any government programs I can apply to while still living with my parents? They make a good amount of money and still claim me on taxes so I’m not really sure how any of this works. My mom as of the past 3 years has been too busy to notice my existence more for than a few minutes and even when I ask her for help on official things I don’t understand (like taxes, bills, signing official documents, how to apply for stuff, etc) she is too busy. I needed her tax information to apply for charity care to help with my hospital bills but she was always too busy to help me and wouldn’t give me the information to see our taxes, now I have probably close to 10k against my credit I guess. I’m not really sure how it works I’ve been getting letters in the mail for months saying my payments are late and that I need o figure something out. I don’t think my parents would help me and I honestly would rather be able to leave without them knowing. This living situation is causing a deep dark depression for me and I have struggled with thoughts of suicide for over a year now. Idk how any of you guys can help with advice. We do have some money saved already but not a bunch.",20May2020,1
880,i (17f) became super close to my friend (17f) when we first joined secondary school. we both had other close friends but we always said we were best friends (cringe i know) and told each other stuff we wouldn’t tell anyone else. my other close friends left the school and me her and her other close friends (none of us were actually friendly we just had my friend in common no issues between us just didn’t really know each other). we became a sort of group which i tried to leave on multiple occasions after feeling left out and ignored but always ended up returning too. i basically only really wanted to be friends with that specific girl but it was sort of a package deal (didn’t have a problem with any of the others just personalities don’t really mix). i’m aware this is waffling so i’ll get to the point. she started ignoring me when we both changed to different schools for sixth form and replaced me with another friend from the group who went to the same school. i completely understand them being so close like they moved together and i don’t think i’m being that petty e.g she was meant to come on holiday with my family and her mum texted my mum the night before saying she wasn’t coming any more and she never admitted it to me or provided an explanation. tehre were other cases like this and i just feel like she completely ignored me and i don’t really know what to do about it as we still see each other once a week cos we have tennis together (obviously not atm) and i don’t want it to be awkward but i also want to know if i have done anything wrong that i can fix or if we’re just drifting apart. what do i do?,20May2020,1
881,"My fiancé (we will call him Kevin) and I have been together for almost 4 years now and over time my mother has asked him for more and more favors. My mother is a single woman in her late 40s, so I understand the occasional help with moving/fixing things around the house. But over the past year or so she has started to rely on him more and more. She just assumes he will do things for her. When I go see her she walks around the house pointing out things saying “oh Kevin will have to help me do this” or “I really want kevin to build this for me”. It’s as if as soon as a thought pops in her head, the solution is to have Kevin do it. My fiancé is not happy about her doing this either, but she tends to play the victim and will take it VERY personally if we even attempt to talk to her about it. To me it almost feels as if she is using him to fill the void of not having a man around HER house. I think if she asked for the help instead of just assuming it will get done for her, it would make me feel better (but I’m not even sure if that would make me feel any better).

883,"Hi,

I  was sick for almost a week now and it starts getting better. I called  in sick last Thursday. I seemed to get better over the weekend, so I  tried to work, but messaged my boss and told him I wanna still cure out  my cold (I had low temperature and some othjer symptoms like feeling  weak etc.) and he told me it's fine and I should cure it out, specially  in times of the corona crisis. That's kind of where the downward spiral  started. Fast Forward to yesterday (tuesday) where I messaged my boss  again telling him I was feeling better but I am taking another day off  just to make sure I cured it out. I was almost symptom-free all day and I  was kind of looking forward to work again, but yesterday night I was  having trouble breathing (or even just perceived it this way, I don't  know) and got maybe 2-3 hours of sleep because I slipped into a panic  attack thinking I might have sepsis, heart attack or something of that  matter. I decided to probably not work today (Wednesday) and rest. After  the 2-3 hours of sleep I was feeling surprisingly well and I decided to  not rest and log in to my work PC and start getting stuff done, just  telling my boss who was still offline that I will work again today as I  felt better generally yesterday (which was kind of dumb, I should have  been straight up from the start), but it did not take long when suddenly  the tiredness, shortness of breath and  also my temperature was low.  Not as low as it used to, but still not ""normal"" temperature. I realized  a co-worker messaged me how I was doing and I replied I was doing fine  yesterday but had trouble breathing at night and probably will call my  doc for an appointment and go offline again. So, I basically sent  another message to my boss telling him my cold striked back and I have  trouble breathing and I will call my doc, which might sound weird after  telling him how good I was doing yesterday. So, I called my doctor, got  an appointment and he told me I might have Asthma and a cold and that  usually happens when Asthma meets with an allergy or Illness and should  get my lung volume and potential allergies checked sometime... Which I  definitely will.

I later felt the  need, I really don't know why maybe I thought I would calm down my bad  feeling doing so and I did not want someone to be even a little worried I  had COVID-19 or something and might need an ER stay or die, to write a  semi-long (maybe a 2-4 minute read) message my boss yet again updating  him on the situation and also my coworker who had asked me how I was  doing that morning. I did not get a reply from either, which I kind of  don't take too personally, I mean chances are they are busy or switched  off their work phones, but somehow exaggerates my bad feeling that they  might think I just wanna slack off. On the other hand I have proof that I  was at the doctor and he wrote me a letter where it says I should not  work and stay home until saturday, like it is usual in my country. But I  still got a feeling they think I am a pussy for caring so much, or  starting work for like 4 minutes, then realizing how bad I feel and  quit.

TL;DR

I  feel bad for being sick and telling some people from work for thinking  they might be worried for me being sick for so long in times like these  (is that narcissistic? Like assuming they think about me.), essentially  and want some opinions.",20May2020,1

The females pretty good about cleaning the kitchen, but the guy Patrick let’s say his name is, was not taught to clean up. He consistently leaves dishes, tools, and trash out around the kitchen and living room. He will let the sink build up and we have to consistently remind him to do dishes before he touches them. I am pretty much the only one who cleans the kitchen. I always do my dishes immediatly after eating. I will clean the kitchen and come down in the morning to his mess of eating last night. He leave out sauces, pans , crumbs and food all over the place , and prts to his car and tools, also any trash instead of throwing it away. I have texted him, cleaned up for him, had talks with him ect. One time I piled up all his trash/dishes on to his cast iron skillet he uses to cook.

Honestly nothing has ever been directed at me or my partner. They’re generally just getting together and socialising but they do it on the road outside the house as oppose to in it. 

I can’t help but get triggered by it. Pottering round the house I can hear it, watching tv I can hear it, sitting in the garden the other side of the house it is stupidly loud.

893,"I work as a carer. Our rota is released monthly and we are given only a few days to check it and raise any issues. After that, they will not accommodate it unless it is an emergency, sick leave, etc.

They will however constantly change the rota without notice or reason and do not notify of ANY changes, with the exception of one person. This causes issues for staff and clients.

The rota is communicated via app with automatic updates but no notifications. I have raised this issue multiple times, other people have raised this issue multiple times. Once, the manager said over text “you need to check your rota all the time,” despite taking the opposite stance in meetings. 

I’ve become so frustrated with it I screenshot every single day for the month so I could prove they were doing it.

897,"So, my (22f) boyfriend (23m) and I are looking to move into the next chapter of our relationship and get a house together. We are currently staying with roommates in a suboptimal situation (small house, too many people) and are ready for our own space. Both of our dogs are living with our parents because our current house is really old and the landlord is really strict about animals scratching up the walls and doors. This was always meant to be a temporary living situation, my goal has always been to find a house in my price range that allows my dog (a huge wolf-like black GSD) to live there. My boyfriend’s dog (very small Pit mix) lives with his father, and is happy there with his dad’s other dogs. Our dogs, unfortunately, do not get along. While my GSD is big and looks menacing, he is extremely well behaved and loves playing with other dogs, I’ve never seen him show aggression towards any dog. His little thing is very anxious and mean, and tries to bite my dog when he comes near her or tries to play with her. I am not okay with this, but I can’t really do anything about it so I just try to separate them as best I can when she gets really annoyed with him. 

Once, we brought his dog to stay at our current house for a just a few days. During the two days she was there, she refused to eat or drink and was depressed all day until my boyfriend got home from work (he works all day, from 6am-6pm M-F so I was the dog’s main caregiver). My boyfriend suggested I hand feed her and give her water out of my hand until she drank. I refused because she is a dog, and would need to figure it out without being babied. I would never baby my dog like that either, so I didn’t see the issue. My boyfriend then accused me of not trying and not caring about his pet. While his dog is not my favorite thing in the entire world, I don’t think I was being unfair by refusing to hand feed her, and I was still taking care of her all day. She also just doesn’t like me very much, she will not play with me or anyone else except for my boyfriend, which has made it hard for us to bond. 

When my boyfriend stays at his father’s house, he treats his dog differently than his dad’s dogs, which has caused her to be kind of a spoiled brat. Minus the kind of. He will only let her on his bed, the others have to stay on the floor. He also lets her sit on his lap while he eats and yells at the other dogs to get away. Now, whenever he or I tries to give attention to another dog, his dog will position herself right in between us and the other dog, sometimes sitting right on us and putting her face in ours. He encourages this behavior by patting her instead of the other dog. She doesn’t listen either, when I tell her to get off the furniture she just sits there and shakes like I’m hurting her, and then I have to either just leave her be or physically move her. She does this same thing with my boyfriend. 

My boyfriend has been upset because he feels he will not be able to take her to our new home, because she just won’t eat or drink and is depressed anywhere except for his dad’s house. He also said he would resent me if he brought her and I didn’t let her eat and drink out of my hand and babysit her all day. Then, he started to blame my dog, saying it wouldn’t be safe for bring her anyways because she would pick a fight with my dog and then he would turn her into a chew toy because he is bigger. I told him I did not think that would happen because my dog is not aggressive, but he wouldn’t listen. He has decided that we shouldn’t take either dog, because he would resent me for having my dog there if he couldn’t have his. I did not agree, because my plan this entire time has been to get a house that I could have my dog in. While my parents love him and care for him, I still visit him at least twice a week and take him for walks, he is my dog and I made a commitment to take care of him for the rest of his life and I want to honor that. I’ve had him since he was 5 weeks old and am very attached to him. My view of the situation is that since my boyfriend feels he can’t have his dog because of her own issues, so he wants me to leave mine behind in solidarity. 

I have suggested getting a dog trainer to help with his dog’s anxiety, giving the dogs separate areas in the new house for when she gets too overwhelmed and aggressive, and he shoots me down every time. He says he could never trust them alone together. I love my boyfriend and want to move in with him, but I’m feeling hopeless at the moment. What can I do to fix this situation?",20May2020,1
898,"So at the beginning on April, I[31m] started talking to this woman[26] off a dating site, we got on right away and quickly moved to phone numbers, everything going was perfectly, We couldn’t meet due to the lockdown but we spend night after night watching movies together over the phone, video calls and sleeping together on the phone and as wild as it sounds, we both confessed we had fallen for each other, her first in fact. 

And then a few weeks ago, it was about half 1 in the morning and we was going to go to sleep and she tells me her sister needs her to call her and she’ll call me back, fair enough. Gets to about 3:30-4am when I finally fall asleep after not hearing from her, I wake up to a text saying “Sorry she kept her on the phone for ages and she fell asleep afterwards” which again was fine, except the next day or so, I overheard her friend(who I’m 99% sure is her ex but she hasn’t told me that but from what she has said about him during past convos it’s easy to work out.) on twitch talking about how they all played a game until 5am! Well that was a bit of a surprise to me, nothing major to get upset about but I wanted to just know what the deal was so I confronted her about it and she just said that she did fall asleep but woke up and couldn’t get back to sleep so she played with her friends and didn’t see what the issue was. I said that there wasn’t really an issue, the timeline between 4am and 5am had her falling asleep, waking up and playing “all night until 5am”. Anyway I just said forget it, it’s not worth any kind of argument about. 

Following this, I’ve noticed she slowly became a little more distant, she had stuff going on with her family life which I understand but she started to choose to play games with these other people over me, which is when I put it together that one of the guys in the group was her ex. So I just lurked around a bit in his chat, and noticed she would tell me “I need to go do X/call X person” but she would be in his channel immediately afterwards. 

This hurt me a lot, and after a few days of this kind of behaviour, we was planning on meeting but I started to get really scared because I feared I would get really hurt if I didn’t get these negative thoughts out my head,  I sent her a message telling her I was feeling down and confused, how I felt like she was being cold and distant, feeling like I was always the one chasing after her affection while giving her all of my time and attention. 
Well she flew off the handle at me saying there’s no reason I should feel like that, that I know she’s having family issues and she’s struggling with lockdown etc on top of it. 

I apologised and tried to better explain why I brought it up, but she wasn’t having any of it, she’s told me I’ve hurt her and she feels unhappy and like shit now, and I offered to just come and hug her, whatever she wanted to make her feel better but she says she deals with stuff differently, she wants to be alone, She said that she usually runs from people before they hurt her to protect herself and that she loves me and she is scared because she loves me. 

Fine I said I’ll stop messaging, she said it’s fine to send a good morning/night text, That was Monday  and I’ve only sent a few messages, basically just asking if we was still “together” which she just said “yes” and today She messaged me during the night saying “another night of no sleep” I just told her I don’t know what I can do or say, she wants to be alone but it seems like she’s just hating me.

I honestly just don’t know what to do now, I can’t make sense of this situation. I feel like she’s either trying to push me away and protect herself or she has feelings for her ex again and I don’t really have anyone to get advice from so I’m hoping someone can give me a different look on it. Sorry this is a bit all over the place but I’m kinda a mess right now, I can try and give better details if needed.",20May2020,1
900,"Since I’ve been back home from school I’ve noticed my brothers dog who used to really love me is now absolutely terrified of me he runs at the sight of me, when I go into pet him he runs, mostly he just runs away from me. At first I thought he just didn’t remember me and it would only be a matter of time before he got used to me again which is what happened over Christmas break after he hadn’t seen me for an entire semester but it’s been over 2 months and he still comes no where near me. It’s strange since he doesn’t seem to have a problem with either of my sisters one of whom he only met for the first time a few months ago. I’m not a huge guy. About 5 foot 9 and 140 pounds.

907,"Background, I work in non-urgent 'elective' healthcare in Portland Oregon. I was supposed to start a job in Chicago, IL in April, but state orders in Chicago closed elective procedures/clinics, so that got put on hold. As of last Monday, those have reopened. The job wants me to tell them if I will start on the first of next month.   
Chicago itself-aside from elective medical procedures-is still in a lockdown until the end of this month, and then going to start a staggered/structured reopening most places are doing.   


I keep going back and forth on if it is smarter to stay here during current COVID times, or whether I'm being irrational. Oregon is one of the lowest in cases per capita and deaths per capita (3 per 100,000, in the bottom 5 states with the lowest numbers) Illinois has considerably higher deaths per capita (35 per 100,000 and much higher numbers of infections. 

We've had \~140 deaths here total in 3 months, and for the last few weeks Illinois has had 130-190 deaths per day. 

  
In addition to the outright higher number of infections and moving from one of the states with the lowest per capita #s of infections to one of the states with the highest per capita #s of infections--my hesitancy is partially:  
 A) moving is going to involve driving across country which obviously will have to have some stops, etc which increase risks for exposures and such  
B) I'd be moving from my current situation in portland (living alone in a studio) to an apartment with 2 roommates  
C) based on the location of the job downtown/lack of parking I'd be using public transit to and from work  
D) What if numbers blow up there and the job has to shut down again anyways?   
E) I have asthma and have been on a vent before, so I guess the possibility of that all seems much more real to me. Especially having some friends who have gotten really sick with covid. 

But then the other side of my mind just wonders if I'm being a hypochondriac and being overly cautious with all of this. I keep going back and forth, because I don't want to turn down what would have been a good job opportunity, and I will plan on moving to Chicago regardless--but I'm trying to decide if it is smarter to stay put in Oregon for now where it seems 'safer' or to move. Just kinda wanting some people's thoughts.

Me
Agency: current employer
Tech company: freelance/ past employer

I worked with a tech company full time for 1 year. Around Nov, a friend who owns an agency suggested that I join her (with me onboard, it's just the 2 of us). It was better pay, more flexible projects. When I put my papers, I got the option to continue freelance. I spoke with my agency boss and she agreed. Some background: she and the tech company have some conflict but because she gave the go ahead, I confidently took the freelance role.

Fast forward 5 months. She keeps insisting I leave the tech company because some of our clients also have a problem with the tech company. (This is the second time she has asked and given me the implied deadline of july) 

Tech company is slightly selfish and clinical in their approach in collaboration and 3 clients have issues. However, I have a great relationship with the tech company and love the work I do although it is little. 

I don't do any communication with the clients at the agency so I don't get why this is an issue. Also most work that goes out is under her name so I don't get any name credit online. Which is another reason I want to continue with tech company where my work has my name on it.

I have explained to agency boss that I love working with the tech company but she keeps aggressively saying ""I can't deal with these clients and their shit. I can't keep explaining to them""
And I back off and agree to figure out a way to end the contract. 

How do I approach this?",20May2020,1

915,"Hi guys, sorry for the long post, but I have to get this out..tl;dr at the bottom 

Until last year I had my whole future mapped out. I had been with my soul mate for 9 years then, we got on, understood each other, had a lot of good times, she was my best friend and the most beautiful woman I've ever seen..

Then things turned to shit. Her dad who had been battling cancer for 7 years, lost his battle. And it was like she lost him, but I lost her. I fully understand grief (I'm a trained counsellor and have worked in mental health for 20 years), and I was there for her through it all, as anyone should be. But as the past year progressed she changed, I was fully prepared for anger, upset, anything. But it wasn't that. She became a mean abusive woman, constant having a go at me about anything and everything, accusing me of affairs (I gave her no reason to think like that, i do nothing but work then relax playing on my xbox or spending time with my kids, I'm an ugly guy and felt blesssed to be with her). 

It got to the point where she would row with me any time I said anything, constantly putting me down and insulting me... I am unphased by verbal abuse having worked in mental health so long, but when its all you hear from someone you love, it hurts over time. But that wasnt the killer. The killer was the silent treatment. She would literally refuse to talk to me for full weeks at a time, then we would talk, then she would get nasty, then not talk. I've asked her repeatedly to get help, even just talk about what's going on with her, the closest I got was her admitting she hadnt been the same.

Over the year she's just completely alienated me and become so hostile, I never gave up, I always did my best to show her I love her, but last week it came to  head when she accused me of being drunk (i am tee total and have not touched alcohol in 2 years), I stated ""the only alcohol in my house is a bottle of prosecco thats been there for 8 months that I got as a gift and I'll regift"".... she goes off on a complete attack, accusing me of having champagne fueled orgies, stating she would never be with me again as "" you will be full of diseases the slags you cheat on me with"". I have never once even thought about cheating. And then she ended it, blocked me on all forms of contact and now it's a week we havnt spoke. I've tried to reach out every day, but obviously she doesnt reply. 

I just find it so hard to accept its probably over, when I never did a single thing wrong..

This past year or so, he seems to have gotten more ill, and just the last few days burns have been appearing up his arm, and I have noticed that they are getting worse, he claims they are just from cooking, but he has never really been the clumsy type, and to see they are getting worse when he hasn't been cooking, is a bit suspect for lack of a better word.

He is 53, his mother (my grandmother) is in a care home for the rest of her life after being diagnosed with Lewy-body dementia, his relationship with my mum has been on a downward slope for a few years now, he has been running multiple businesses which have all since gone down the pan, and recently he nearly lost his job. He has no interest in anything and his 'safe-spot' is the couch, where he sleeps for most of the day. My mum doesn't help at all, and although I think it is affecting her, I don't think she realises the harm that can be done with the stuff she says and does.

933,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons (and before anyone asks, my daughter is 16, so she's of legal age in our country).

Anyway, onto the story at hand...

I've recently become aware that my daughter is now sexually active. Obviously I'm not thrilled about this, but I try to be realistic about these things. I was her age once, and I know I was no different. Maybe that attitude is somewhat lax, but I try not to be too much of a hypocrite when it comes to parenting.

But here's the thing. We're still in lockdown due to the coronavirus, and we're expected to be following social distancing. My daughter however, with all the time in the world on her hands, has been wanting to go out and meet up with the guy she's been seeing.

This has meant she's brought him back to the house several times over the last few weeks (undeniably taking their alloted hour of exercise as seriously as possible), which is obviously breaking the rules.

As much as I'd prefer for her not to be exploring this side of herself, what I don't want is for her to get in any trouble due to a lack of somewhere to go. We had a fairly frank conversation about it and, rather than try to prevent the inevitable, I came to the conclusion that it was safer to let it slide. She's old enough to make her own decisions in that regard, and I can honestly admit I'm no stranger to how strong those hormones can be.

From what I understand, they been meeting up exclusively and haven't been around anyone else in weeks, so the chances they've come into contact with the virus are slim. But I suppose whichever stance I take, I feel like I could be seen as the irresponsible parent.",20May2020,2

935,"

So last night I went to my boyfriend's right after his close friend had visited. He met her on a dating app 2 years before we met and used to make out with her in the past but stopped. The two have been very close emotionally and every time I'm around he keeps chatting with her. Yesterday he had her over after a run and when I went to his place I found that my shoes which are usually in the corridor were hidden in the closet. My toothbrush was thrown away because it was apparently worn out. To top it off I found his bed was made and there was a used condom wrapper in the dustbin. This made me paranoid and dig deeper only to find two used condoms in there. I have been on the pill for 3 weeks now. The last time we used a condom was two weeks ago. He said the wrapper was ours and the condoms were ours too and he had just not thrown out the trash. I find this a little shady because the condom wrapper was on the top on the bin, to which he said he found it under the bed from back then.

He also said that it's the friend who is clingy and she keeps on texting him but she is nice.",20May2020,1

I've asked this question before but I got no help or advice. Anything you can add that would help to identify, explain why this happens, or help out would be appreciated.
Whenever I get asked to stop doing something (i.e. I say or do something that I don't realize hurts someone, someone asks me to not say/do that, politely or rudely.) I can logically understand why and I do my best to respect the person's wishes but it makes me feel really shitty. Like nauseous, slowed heart rate, full body pulsing shitty. It throws off everything, my rhythm, my breathing, and it's a terrible feeling of sadness and guilt that I'm very intensely overcome by.
I want to emphasize something, and that is: No matter how polite the person is when they ask me to stop, they could literally sit down with me and reassure me and be super sweet, and it would feel JUST as terrible.

A WEEK before I am to leave my other job and start with this new company, the said company called me today stating that they mixed up my application with another person and I actually didn’t get hired in.

A couple years ago, I had the foresight to create a shared Google-Doc between him and myself, and I asked him to write down things about himself and things he'd want to say to people while he was still able to do so and remember them. And after a few months he had a single paragraph that was basically an obituary. It really wasn't what I was hoping for, we all already know his birthday and who his parents and children are, where he's lived almost all his life. That was basically all he wrote. So I asked him about 20 questions, all open-ended to try and give him an idea what what I had meant. I asked him about his earliest memories, about his first jobs, what his favorite memory was with each of his children is, what it was like for him to lose a son (my father). I asked him about his thoughts about his faith, how he came to Jesus. He answered all of the questions I had given him in about 1 and a half pages. Its all very valuable but I wanted more substance, I want to get a little deeper into his brain while its still here, and I want to have something to share with everyone when he can't share it himself. Unfortunately, I'm slow to think of more questions, and the clock is ticking, we're getting pretty close.

941,"So before I begin I should probably mention that I went through something pretty traumatic. My mom threatened to kill me, I won't get into the details but she's working through it. After that, or maybe it was even before that, I started to get really paranoid. And at first I thought it was just anxiety, so I took an online test. It said I had mild anxiety but when I read what anxiety really is, I knew it was more than that. Im not denying I have some sort of anxiety, but I'm not afraid of what's going to happen. I'm only afraid of what is happening. Once I was making burritos and uses a knife to cut the burrito. For some reason it scared me holding the knife, and when I put it into the sink, I couldn't stop staring at it. I was scared of it. I was scared that it was going to hurt me. I started rushing and putting salsa on them and when I threw it away I spilled some. So when I was cleaning it up I had to look away from the knife. Which terrified me, so as soon as I was done cleaning it up, which I did as quickly as possible, I spun around to look at the knife again. And then I took my burritos and ran to the couch. For a while I just sat there, scared. There are more situations like these including one where I was singing an Adele song and looked ik the mirror and saw a wreath, for some reason it really freaked me out, because I thought I saw a person, or some creature. Right when is aw it I stopped singing and just stood there, really scared, watching it. I knew it was a wreath, but it still scared me. Whenever I glance at it I still get really freaked out. I know I probably didn't have to say all this but I'm still scared. And now when I'm sleeping I wait up sweating a little, which never happened before. And I have a huge fan next to me so it's not because of the temperature. I know I should probably talk to my counseler, but I'm just afraid I'm overreacting.

As recently as last night we told each other we were in love with each other and we wanted a future with each other, but we’ve both insisted on a break during this time because it’s been really hard on our relationship not being able to be together for a while (we basically spent the majority of April in person together and he had to go after 2 and a half weeks or so - I had intended to go visit him but my schooling has gotten in the way, as I was not doing well in my classes, so I had to stay home and focus on that). He’s the most recent one between the two of us who has pushed for a break, and I told him that if we were truly on a break, I needed some space. I think it may hurt too much to talk to him as if everything was okay knowing that I can’t be his right now. He also talked to a girl recently who he said he just wanted to be friends with, but he said she was giving him a lot of attention and that talking with her made him happy. It eats me up inside that he may already be moving on while he still tells me that he wants to marry me someday.

If I meet someone who does happen to have painted/long nails I just can't focus as Im just horrified and distracted by the nails.  


However it's now started to translate to myself further, I can't stand my nails and I cut them every day, 2-10 times a day, it's like an obsession, some nights I can't sleep because I have to cut my nails and it's driving me crazy.  I just can't stop because the second I see the white it just freaks me out and I instantly become obsessed with getting rid of it. Furthermore, I lose all focus again when I see nails as they just freak me out beyond belief. I struggle with socializing with other women because if they have painted nails I just can't talk to them, it's really scary for me because it just dictates so much of my discussions. It's more fingernails than toenails that I find myself obsessing over.

I eventually found success in my life and I am now very wealthy, something I only dreamt of as a kid. I have a lovely wife who is also wealthy now but brought up poor, and we both want to live the luxury boujee life that we dreamt of as kids. 

We are looking at houses that are huge and luxurious, and they are in rich bitch neighborhoods, but we also know we wants kids eventually.

I cant shake the feeling that they will end up becoming like those boujee kids at the private school I went to and I feel really guilty for wanting to live luxuriously.

How can I treat myself and my wife and my kids without spoiling them and making them oblivious to the world? Even if I teach them about volunteering and values and morals and teach them about how fortunate they are, they will never understand the lives of others if they are living in a rich bubble.

I do not want to give up my dream of having kids or my dream of living a boujee life.

Her sucky boyfriends, her sucky friends, her sucky opinions are untouchable. She always chooses the worst paths and the wrong people, and nobody can change her mind about it. The other day she did it again and it was the last strike for me. She wanted to go to a friend's house to cook and to drink. Her friend's family is huge (12 people in the house) and they don't care about the virus at all. They don't take the right precautions when they go out and they have a brother that visits the wrong crowd to get drugs. That house is not safe to go at this time. My mother, 58 and diabetic, is nervous about this virus and tried to talk her out of the idea of going out. My sister didn't listen, her argument was, ""At the end, we're going to catch the virus one way or the other."" I had to step in and I exploded, something I never do. She didn't listen anyway. We had a bad argument and even her friend got dragged into it because they knew about the conflict the outing was creating at our home and they didn't care. They didn't cancel the outing to avoid conflict for my sister's family sake, something a good friend would've initiated. My sister went to their house and while she was there we kept arguing over text. I told her to never come to me if she gets caught in any kind of trouble and to find whatever support she might need in the future from that dysfunctional family. She threw me under the bus and showed the entire conversation to her friend. Her friend texted me through every social media account to insult me for talking about their family. I say ""She threw me under the bus"" because she also talks bad about her friend's family whenever she has the chance. She knows their family sucks and she throws shade everytime she talks to us about them, but of course, she kept that quiet because it wasn't convenient for her at all... We don't talk anymore. We live under the same roof and we don't even look at each other. She's 24, never had a job, wakes up after noon, she's always on her phone talking to her friend and doesn't do anything else for my parents or for me. All she knows is to gossip about her friend's lives when she doesn't do anything for hers. I don't want to act like the supportive and forgiving sister anymore. I've always let her attitudes go but this time it was so unnecessary and so risky. She never consider us when doing anything.

962,"I’ve never posted to Reddit before but I just feel so terrible so I could really use the advice.

So for some background, I’ve known this friend for a few years now but we only became close in the past few months. However, she’s very quickly become by far one of my best friends and helped me through a lot, especially becoming more distant with another close friend who treated me not so great. 

Throughout quarantine, she’s been my main source of sanity. As in we’ve facetimed nearly every day and talk constantly and basically I haven’t gone a day without talking to her in probably six months. Quarantine has been quite hard for her, though, considering how she’s my age but lives with her grandparents, making the restrictions a lot more emotionally strenuous on her and her family who are especially at risk. Her grandfather is also the only one in her family who can drive, so I’ve tried to do grocery and errand runs as much as I can throughout quarantine to try to help them so they don’t have to go out.

A few days ago, it was her birthday. She was really looking forward to this birthday, so I felt terrible she had to spend it inside. Her mom reached out to me a few weeks ago asking me to plan a little drive by for her so I invited as many of her friends as I could and it went really well. She was so happy and it was honestly one of the best days I’ve had in a long while 

However, here’s where I started to mess up. What was supposed to be a drive by accidentally turned into everyone getting out of their cars and talking for a bit, mostly socially distancing but still as we all know that doesn’t do much and I could tell she was stressed.

Then, that night, I don’t know why I decided to but I ended up choosing to hang out with a few friends. Our state has lifted a few restrictions for small groups, but the day after I immediately felt terrible. I sent her a long text admitting to what I’d done, to which she responded she was very hurt and didn’t even know what to say to me, especially after I’d seen some people on her birthday, and that had already stressed her and her family out. I might be acting over dramatic here, but she hasn’t talked to me in a few days now and I’m honestly just so worried. I want to give her her space but I’m also concerned our friendship won’t return to what it was or that I permanently ruined her trust. I never wanted to ever do anything to hurt her, yet I acted incredibly selfishly, and all I want is to be able to talk to her again. Any advice? Am I being too dramatic?

1) The cover photo is a photo I took of someone else working. I figured this was ok because the photo depicts an action and displays the school colors of where I went. You can't tell who the person is - the main aspect of the photo is the work being done (nothing significant, it's akin to someone tightening a bolt).  Is it OK to use a photo that isn't OF you to represent the idea of you \[being hands-on\]?

For some reason, I have this scenario in my mind where a customer’s relative buys the same print and they’re like “hmm mine looks a little different” LOL and they compare the prints or something. What do you guys think? Should I contact them or just let it go? :)",20May2020,1

973,"Hello, I need advice on a problem.
Since this whole quarantine situation started, I had been very stressed and overwhelmed with the amount of work I get. Don't get me wrong, as a student I don't have that much work that it would be unbeareable, my brain just makes me think so. I've noticed myself developing a horrible habit - if I couldn't concentrate on homework I would start scratching my arm to the point where it burns and goes terrifyingly red and then I could get back to work. The effect however wears off quickly and I end up scratching my arm again and again and again. I have had my little history with selfharm when I was younger, though it wasn't anything big; I did my thing, stopped and haven't told most people because I didn't want to and it wasn't necessary.

I'm worried that at this pace however, I'll slip back into the hell hole and get back on track with hurting myself. I don't know what to do. I haven't scratched myself to the point that it would bleed, but I have had scratch marks that stayed a couple days - I know it needs to stop but I literally cannot concentrate on work if I don't do it.
My attempts to prevent myself from scratching my arm included wearing a long sleeve (which is uncomfortable since the weather is getting hot), I made sure my nails were cut short, I tried tea, I tried occupying my other hand by kneading an eraser, I tried to just not do it, but I feel like I'm going crazy, I cannot for the love of the holy bowl of cereal focus, I literally can't.

I would welcome any advice from how to concentrate better to how to prevent myself from doing it. Hell, even psychological tricks, I'd try anything.

976,"I run a small mail-order comic business, I guess you could call me a freelance cartoonist. I've only got 4 orders so far but I'm eager to make a name for myself in the comics world and do some honest work. My question to you is this:

What sort of promotions can I offer to encourage customers as the operator of a business that operates through the mail. Business has been slow lately, and to speed it up I've advertised on the Internet, but even with this the mailbox is empty.

Another promotion I tried recently was lowering the prices of my PDFs from $5 to $3. People complained that $5 was too expensive for a PDF, and I agree, since PDFs don't take any ink or paper, and I can e-mail them rather than shipping them. So I made my PDFs cheaper. Originally I was going to make this a Covid-19 sale, to promote hygiene and cost efficiency, but I'm thinking I might keep the PDFs at $3. The only trouble is, I figured plenty of people would send in $3, which to be fair is a trifle, but they haven't. I may be forced to raise the prices back to $5 just because lowering them to $3 does nothing and I may as well make a little more on my meager scraps.

I've also tried mailing 20 coupons out locally. I spent $11 on 20 stamps and everything, and made sure each one was uniform. I stamped and addressed envelopes by hand for three hours. I hope I get some results from this endeavor soon. I used to hang up signs on poles and stuff, but nobody is walking along the street since the pandemic started, so I figure mailings ads right to their houses will be more direct. I have yet to hear from any of the 20 people I sent my ads to. I hope to hear from them soon, but in the meantime, the question remains:

What would be an effective promotion to grab people's attention? I've tried advertising online because I know that's where to get everyone's attention but when I do that all I get is hatred and bigotry. I want some easy, preferably affordable manual solutions I can try to promote my comics around the neighborhood. I hope to get national coverage soon, but in the meantime I figure people are more likely to trust a locally operated business.

he got really pissed at me and said that if i dont start responding to his texts hes going to off himself. i told him id start responding but he said that wasnt good enough. he said i need to have a conversation with him every single day at 10 am. i told him this was ridiculous but he keeps threatening suicide, so im going to comply

979,"Throw away because I’m worried about negative attention. 

Basically, my grandfather has dementia and is making my families life a living nightmare. Extremely violent, insensitive, loud, filthy etc. and *normally* this would be a situation I could handle because, should this be literally any other human on earth, I would feel empathetic towards them and know that they are just scared and confused and need help. 

However, he has been just as bad if not worse well before he got dementia. I’m a CPS failure and so is my mama. My grandfather was extremely abusive in every way but sexual, but he does do perverted stuff like force girls to hug him or “accidentally” walk in on my mama changing for showers and stuff. I am completely deaf in my right ear because he beat my head on a coffee table, I shake in fear when my boyfriend reaches a hand up to brush my face because I just assume he’s going to beat me, I scream when I hear a loud noise, and I have slight brain impairment from multiple concussions I received as a child. 

I am an extremely empathetic person, to the point where I will cry if I see someone try to get a high five and then get ignored. I feel almost no ill feelings towards anyone, even people who are mean to me, and I’m overall pretty nice I think. But every single day of my life I have fantasies about my grandfather dying, and I want it to be really bad. I don’t want him to pass peacefully in his sleep. I want some crazy person to break into our house and chop him up with a big axe or something! I tried to kill myself first at 9 years old, after I begged CPS to take me away and they left me there to get beaten for calling them. Now I am 23 on June 13th and I had to come live with my mom because I was homeless and hit by a car last summer. 

So now he has dementia and he will constantly harass people in the house, beat down doors, scream and hit people (he still hits very hard even though he is old. He can pick up the fridge but no one believes any of us when we say so.) And it’s always over something like his checkbook that he never uses, or trying to beat me until I give him his car keys back. He lost his license and my grandmother gave me his car so I could trade my crappy one in because the frame is bad. I cry a lot and so does my mom, we are always in a bad mood and both of us are suicidal because we can’t deal with him anymore. But we are also very poor, and my mama says we can’t afford a old person home for him and we just have to wait for him to die but we have been waiting for 15 years now. He is 90 and not unhealthy at all according to his doctor, except he never drinks water or sleeps. It seems like whatever the opposite of a miracle is. 

So all the advice I see online for dealing with dementia is being empathetic and understand of their situation and stuff, but what do I do when I can’t feel those things? I am only mean to him if he attacks me, and mostly I just tell him go away leave me alone! Other than that I hide a lot and don’t talk to him at all and get my mom to help if he’s doing something bad like breaking into my car or hurting my grandmother. 

Usually my boyfriend will put jimmy neutron on tv loud for me if my grandfather is being crappy but now it doesn’t help anymore and I just want to die or have him die it doesn’t matter which one anymore.

Hello, I was sad this morning and wondering if anyone else has developed an eating disorder because of their financial situation. I have been working a low-wage restaurant job for the past two years and was out of work with a sizable debt for two years before that. Over this time, I usually have been able to afford to eat one or two meals a day (my job has a strict pay-for-food policy). Occasionally, a manager who knew my situation would sneak me a meal to take home and this would be the highlight of my week, as the food is really good!  

However with corona, my store had to shut down until maybe August. There has been a hold up with unemployment, and so for the past six weeks I have had to relegate myself to 1 meal every day and some days need to be every other day. The food I bought to provide for myself is simple, rice, beans, and I had a few boxes of pasta. I've been rationing the end of my bag of rice for the past week as its all thats left, and I realized today while looking in the mirror that my body has been paying a price. My ribs all poke through and show, large indent down the middle of my chest, just basically all the stereotypical things you would imagine when you see people's bodies with eating disorders are there. I've spent today trying to sort out this development although there is not much that I can do.  

I was thinking about it and I realized that there might be other people in my situation with advice to offer. I don't want my body to waste away but I'm not sure there is anything I can do.

They’re the type to punish me for not having a job but when being offered several jobs, they force me to decline the offers for no good reason. I am an adult and still have a “lenient” curfew of 9pm and cannot leave the house for more than 5 hours unless for my job that they finally allowed me to have.

Hi, so I'm a 19-year-old currently staying in Perth, with my dad while I study my dad works over in the mines so I'm often alone for a couple of weeks at a time. Somebody came to my door at 4:30 am aggressively yelling to be let in and trying to forcefully open the door I live in a complex and my neighbor stays in the room above my garage he has complete access to his room from the garage. The man at the door kept insisting I was a John and that he knew me never met the man in my life nor did he meet the description of my current neighbor. I compromised and opened the garage for him he was sweaty injured and had dried blood on his clothes and seemed to be intoxicated he held something in his pocket while he spoke to me (i assume keys). I went back inside locking my door to the garage and heard him go upstairs it seemed really fishy to me like something was off. I was paranoid, not sure of what to do I called the non-emergency line and gave them the info incase he was apart of something.

30 minutes later he's back at my door yelling for a John trying to forcefully open my door asking to be let into my house so he can head upstairs to his. Fuck letting him in I call the police he refuses to leave and I already let him in through the garage to his place so IDK what he want's and I'm worried he's gonna break the door.

The police arrive to talk to him and they leave that's it I didn't speak to him or the police during that situation so I'm left in the dark he's gone I assume he's a crazy stranger. So I call the non-emergancy line asking for info and they tell me he is in fact my neighbor and that's all they can tell me. I call my landlord and explain what happens she confirms he is my neighbor and that he just moved in and that what happened is unacceptable.

I'm confused IDK if I did the right thing calling the police or if this is normal? I moved here from a smallish city What should I do from here and what advice can people give me?",20May2020,1
988,"Earlier this year, my sister attempted suicide with her prescription meds. Thankfully, she didn't take enough to cause any harm. She was placed into a mental hospital for a couple of days afterward. The doctors there said that although this was her second attempt (first was with a belt), she seems to have a good support system and just needs more counseling in between sessions with her psychiatrist. Since this has happened, I've seemed to be the only one that took initiative to keep medicines in our home locked away. I've kept her medicine locked away in a box in my room and recommended that my mother do the same since she has so many medications, plus we have OTC painkillers and cold medicines. She didn't do it, said that my sister would be fine and she wouldn't try it again.

I've recently started working full-time and my sister usually takes her medicine in the afternoon or at night. We came up with a system that I would put her medicine in a cup and leave it for her to take when she's ready, but sometimes I forget and so does she. By the time either of us remember, it would make the dosages too close together.  I do customer service work, so the environment I'm in has to be incredibly quiet, meaning she can't just come in and ask me any more.

She has also expressed wanting to travel the world and live on her own someday. I have a hard time believing this will be possible considering I have to administer her medicine.

990,"This is one of my first posts on Reddit, because after numerous google searches, I can’t find any specific advice for the situation I’m in.

I’ll start off with the basics. I live have a girlfriend who lives across the country, we met a little less than a year ago, and I love her more than I’ve loved anyone in the world. I’ve helped her with a lot of her suicidal thoughts, and she even says that I’m the only reason she’s keeping together, because she imagines a future where we can both be happy. She’s helped me in ways, too, but nothing nearly as drastic because I don’t have any mental health issues, just some slight insecurities and whatnot. We help each other in any way we can.

It’s just that she has attempted before, and stopped herself. I don’t know how many times, but she’s told me about her most recent one. She’s also dealing with so much in her life, just so much. She has social anxiety, actually shaking when forced to talk to people in public, she has parents who are divorced but continue to live together for the sake of their kids (which really doesn’t help since they constantly fight), her father recently left out of nowhere and continues to come back only to leave again. This happens often. She has a little seven year old sister which is submitted to these things too, and, what is probably the worst thing, her brother.

Her brother is a manipulative, psychotic, little demon child. He hurts her physically, fights over the smallest things, acts like he knows everything and is superior for it. Her family and everyone else absolutely loves him because of his good grades and outwardly smart appearance and demeanor, and yet, inside of their walls, he treats my girlfriend, his sister, like she is worthless. He’s called her fat, has said she should kill her self, has broken her door so she’s unable to lock it, has taken her money, her happiness, and anything she even finds any comfort in. He manipulates everyone into thinking he’s the victim, and even though he got one F on his report card, he’s still viewed as a king compared to my girlfriend who received three F’s (and they both received F’s most likely because of their horrible living conditions and constant stress of their environment)

Today she snapped. She wants to hurt him, like genuinely hurt him, and I understand why. He has done so much to hurt her and I know why she would want to take her anger out on the source of her problem. I was trying to calm her down, and I think it worked, but after she turned on some music (which is what she usually uses to ignore the surrounding world and focus on herself and her emotions) she hasn’t spoken to me. This is made even worse by the fact that we live states apart, and we have never seen each other in person, face to face, beyond facetiming. It’s hard to communicate when she gets like this, because she’s so fed up in the bad that she doesn’t even want to focus on the single that she’s explicitly said makes her happy. She just wants to focus on her emotions in the way she always has, and I understand and respect that.

I’m just so worried for her. She’s snapped and I don’t want her to stoop to his level and resort to violence. I know she’s a good person, there’s just so much bad in her life that it’s hard for her, or me, to ever see the good. She has attempted suicide recently, and today she did the thing with wanting to hurt her brother (that’s the first time she’s said it and meant it). She lives with a homophobic family, so they don’t know that she’s pansexual or dating me. Besides her brother, no one knows about me (and he only thinks we’re friends). Her family doesn’t like her. Her brother thinks she’s worthless, her little sister is too young to understand anything (but she is really nice and probably one of the only good people left in her life), and her parents have recently seemingly disowned her for her bad grades. She has pleaded for help and they won’t provide it. For right now, I seem to be the only thing keeping her together and I know she’s a good person but I’m so worried I will mess up one day and won’t be good enough to hold her back. She means the world to me, and before I met her I never imagined much of a future for myself. Trust me when I say that what I do for her, she does for me. I’ve never been suicidal, but she makes me want a future.

I always say to her, “Being allowed to keep you when you’re happy is worth being for you when you’re not.” I know what she’s like when she’s happy, and recently whenever she’s had anything to smile about, her dad, mom, brother, friends, or just the forces of the universe find some way to crush it. I’m so worried for her, and I just need advice.

In the school they’ll be able to navigate around and interact with different characters. One of the character will be a student who forgot his lunch at home. The player’s task is to cook a lunch for the student and must carefully listen to understand what are the students interests to cook the perfect meal. The games will be very simple, with a lot of narrations. 

Once the player wins a game, they will receive an award depending on the game’s task. For example, “Best Chef” , “Superb behavior” , “Math Wizard.”

I’d really appreciate your thoughts on this idea, and whether you have any suggestions on how to improve it?",20May2020,1

The people who are planning this thing have asked of any of us want to give a speech or something to the teachers or to the class. Naturally I just thought haha nah definitely not cause I have panic attacks just from presenting in class in front of like 10 people. As time passed however I felt like I really did have some things to say to my class but mainly my teachers. I sat down right now and wrote a speech but the thought of me going on stage in front of everyone terrifies me. This probably sounds really stupid, but for some reason this became important to me and I don't really know what to do cause I feel like I'm gonna throw up",20May2020,1

1002,"Lately I've realized I have a real problem dealing with this. I don't have very many of these encounters luckily, but when I do it really affects me and sticks with me. If someone yells at me or flips me off I'll spend days thinking about it and feeling anxious/angry. 

In fight/flight I usually freeze but when I do react I always come in hot. I yell back or return their anger and it just escalates things and leaves me feeling worse. 

As a kid my dad was abusive and my mom was really passive, she always turned the other cheek to family, friends, neighbors, etc. and never stood up for herself so people walked all over us. I remember always feeling too impotent and weak to protect her, my dad would spitefully call me ""little girl"" and I hated how helpless I was. 

I think I never let go of those feelings, and now as an adult whenever someone is aggressive I overreact like I *need* to respond to prove that I'm not just going to take it. When really I'd rather just brush it off and be happy... I don't like being angry.",20May2020,1

1011,"Insurance company did not pay out on moms policy, $20,000 funeral bill in collections.

This is my first time starting a thread on Reddit, bare with me. I tried to break everything into different parts and keep it as short as possible.

My mother and our family:
She was immigrant and single mom. In America it was only be and my two brother. I was 18 when she passed and my two bothers, 13 and 20. We were in the process of loosing the home, business and cars before since she was in recovery. I went from a B average student to having to take summer classes to graduate high school. My oldest brother just came to America when he was 17 and struggled to assimilate.

Her death:
She was in recovery after being in a coma, she was not suppose to die. Her condition had less than a 4% mortality rate. 


My moms life insurance: $250,000
After her death I called the insurance company to notify them. They informed me there was a lapse in her policy and I just needed to be paid right away. The next day a family friend with into our family agent who took the payment in check and said everything was good.


My moms funeral: $20,000
The funeral home originally informed me of an option which seemed government assisted. It was if you made under a certain income, and since I was a freshly homeless 18 year old old I did.... until they learned of her life policy which they said disqualified me. I even had family friends offering to make a Go Fund Me but I felt bad and said no since my brother/ and I were set to get $80,000 each. I spoke with my brothers and we decided to give her the funeral she would of wanted by returning her body to rest in our home country. Her information policy was given during paperwork and the funeral home verified the payout with our insurance company as payment. My older brother and I were the only one that signed paperwork since my youngest was 13.


After they decided not to pay out:
3 weeks after my moms death I got a VOICEMAIL from the funeral home stating they weren’t going to payout on her life policy because there was a lapse. A VOICEMAIL!!!! When I called back, that particular agent was always busy. I was 2 weeks from going to moving and going to college. Which ended up being one of the worst decisions because my dad ended up passing away 3 months after my mom and I literally had a mental breakdown. I tried to return to school after taking time off but couldn’t function.


The reason for no payment:
They found a loophole, a lapse of payment could only be paid if the individual was still alive. When I was on the phone the agent was informed my mom died, when the local agent took the money, she knew my mom had died and when they smoke to the funeral as well! Why wouldn’t no one tell, or just tell me there was a possibility of no payment before I promised $20,000 to a funeral home.


The lawyers:
My family friend recommend me to lawyer that after year of “I’m waiting on this,” seemed to drop the case. After another year and a deep depression I consulted 10 plus lawyers, NONE of them would take the case. I finally fine one a year later who tried to do the arbitration process and again 6 months passed, then a year and nothing. I finally gave up. 


My life now:
I am 25 now, we are still in the pandemic. I’ve decided to try and take charge of my financial health and do the total money makeover by Dave Ramsey. Since everything happened a seem you fall into a deep depression every couple of years. I’ve done horribly with my finances by continue to add to my student loans and buying a financed car. What was I thinking? At any moment the collection agency could come after me for the funeral expenses.... how do I start a family knowing this. How to I really move on.


What now:
The funeral home was smaller and tried to be understanding. They said to update them with what was going on, but ended up sending the bill to collections. I only ever got less than 5 calls from the agency and 2 letters. I’ve moved many times since then. 


I’m thinking maybe I should try and get a copy of the legal documents I signed at the funeral home. The account never hit my credit. I service was used and the funeral home deserves to be paid, but legally do I really have to pay them?

Any suggestions, words of support or similar stories. Please help, I just want to heal.

SUMMARY
My mother passed away and I used the promise / advance of her life insurance policy for the funeral expense but the insurance company decided not to pay out on her policy. Now I am stuck stuck with a $20,000 funeral bill in collections. Help.",20May2020,1
