2,"Last year we spent $850 of our money to buy gifts.  But, like a good portion of the world,  I've stopped working and he took a 20% paycut. We are going into our very dwindling savings monthly.

Now we are both really pissed at eachother.  He told me he was going to do half of the gifts from last year. But hes added a bunch of people to the list and it comes to $750.

If we do that,  we won't be homeless, but any misstep financially we will be having trouble.

We are spending considerably more than we are making monthly.   We have a business separate from where he works that is losing $5000 a month,  no salary from me and a reduction from him. 

But now im the jerk because I told him that we agreed on $400.

Can someone help with a compromise. He refuses to give an actual gift,  he wanted to send everyone either a $25 or $50 giftcard.  He said that nobody is going to get anything. Its either all or nothing. 

The owner of his company isn't doing anything.   And he wants to spend another $100 on him.",22Dec2020,1

I know there is a logical, rational and reasonable solution to my situation, I wait till next school year go to university and get a job after that. 
There is only one problem, I dont want to do that. Now I know the world isnt fair and we dont alwayse get to do what we want, but I beleive that if you are willing to put in the work you can brake the ""rules"" and create your own path. I want to live in Asia, south korea, japan, those places keep me up at night and I want to gave life there, a job, a place, friends etc.... 
If I pull my weight, I know I can learn a new language, then all I need is a working hollyday visa and there I go I mean I know its possible, I've met people who have done that, so why shouldnt I try ? Am I being delusional or do I just need a bit of confidence ?

Please be honest, I also know that moving to a whole new country in ""these times"" may sound crazy but there is alwayse a way round things so lets just ignore all that talk

I missed a payment on one of my cards, but my statement says I still have until January 5 to make at least the minimum payment+late fee.

15,"I (16F) haven‚Äôt really been close with anyone in pretty much my whole life. For as long as I can remember, Ive had trouble making friends. I even remember getting rejected by my ‚Äúfriend group‚Äù back in kindergarten. In elementary-middle school I had trouble keeping friends for any longer than just a year. 

Its getting upsetting, obviously. The beginning of this year, I stopped talking to almost everyone I knew because I was switching schools. The friend group I was in (who i also thought hated me at the time lol) was pretty toxic anyway, so it didn‚Äôt affect me too much. A few months ago, I started a new job. Everyone there is super close with each other and I knew some of them already so it was easy to get along with them, I think. I started hanging out with them, and it was cool for a while, but the feeling of them hating me came, just like it always does. 

I cant help but think that they might talk shit about me when Im gone. That they think Im annoying, clingy, loud, whatever. They want me gone, they wish I didnt start working there and they dont like me. And I feel this way with literally everyone I know. Including my family; immediate and extended family. 

And the reason I think I may be right is because like I said, its been this way since as long as I can remember. Nobody will tell me what Im doing wrong. Id like to think Im a pretty self aware person but obviously not. I dont know what to do. I dont know how to fix myself or stop thinking this way or whatever the solution is but I really need too.",22Dec2020,1

Today I had to watch my little cousin (taking covid precautions of course) and I was stressed out because managing school and a 5 year at the same is pretty difficult. I decided to email my teachers that I wouldn‚Äôt be on any zooms. I worded it so that it was very obvious that I was scared of being counted absent.

20,"Sorry on mobile sorry for formatting!

So I've been dating this guy for almost a year and a half. We've been living together for over a year (unplanned). This is out 2nd Christmas together. (For reference I'm 20f hes 24m) last yest he just asked what I wanted and bought everything I mentioned. Which isn't really what I meant tbh. My family does chrismtas wish lists so basially everything we wish to have we write a list give it to mom and she chooses what she wants to buy us from that list. This year we're staying at our own home because of covid also because his job doesn't allow his to travel more than 30 minutes away from his job site (cause covid). 
Anyways earlier this month he asked what I wanted and I mentioned things I needed like new bras and panties, newer bed time shorts, school supplies for next college semester. Etc hes like ""tbh im terrible at shopping for women can I just get you a gift card"" im like sure i don't care that means I can pick out exactly what I want. I got him a gift card from my bank where he can spend it anywhere he pleases, and some winter stuff because he's from Florida USA so he's not used to the North Carolina USA weather. (Hes here because of US military) 
Today we were talking and I cant remeber exactly how it came about but hes like ""I didnt get you anything ü•∫"" and im like thats fine. He said ""are you upset"" I told him no. Because that's the truth im not materialistic plus I can afford my own stuff. If I need help I know I can ask him for help and he can do the same. He did say not to get him anything for Christmas but I did anyways because I saw stuff I knew he'd like. 
But idk I kinda just feel sad? Like your sister brother ajd parents all got me something but you didn't? When youre the person I'd want a gift from the most?

21,"My mother met my step father a few years back, and due to California practically being unlivable due to taxes and overpriced living, we were forced to move in with my step grandparents. It has been a year now and my step grandmother alone has fueled my depression for her producing comments such as, ""You used to be so pretty. You know, You should wear more makeup"" (Yes, she had the audacity to follow that sentence up with such a degrading remark)and ""Are you sure you'll fit into your prom dress? You've gained some weight since then."" ('Then' being only three months) 

My step father enables her unfortunately. Instead of changing the subject like my uncle and mother does, he continues and enables her remarks which gives her a sense of right. 

I'm really done with having to deal with her being such a conniving snake, nothing I do is good and she has to comment on it all. My step father has inherited her ego and pride as well, he doesn't even witness the worst of her, she is only like this to my mother and I (The reason for that is because my step fathers kids that do not live with us have told lies about us and my brothers that live in Oklahoma) 

I never argue with her, but I don't ignore her either because that is seen as disrespectful so a conversation is a must apparently. 

Please comment a way I can deal with her using me as a punching bag, I truly have not witnessed as bad of depression until moving in with her. In fact, she has tripled my depression and anger I feel inside.",22Dec2020,1
22,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub, but I've tried multiple times already and it just gets removed without me getting any advice.  


TL;DR: Josh assaulted Lea. I didn't believe it and both of us told the community she was lying. She proved she was telling the truth, and now I'm being alienated in the community. Where do I go from here?  


I want to clarify before I explain, that I can't begin to imagine the hell she went through as a result of this and I'm in no way saying that she's done anything wrong. I also know I probably added to that and I wish I knew sooner what had actually happened. That being said, I'm being railed on constantly in the community and I don't know how to remedy this situation.

Earlier in the year before the lockdowns, my friend Josh started dating someone I went to high school with (Lea). I want to be completely honest here so I can get the hard truth from you guys and work on mending things. I didn't like Lea at all in high school. We weren't in the same circles but whenever we crossed paths I found her extremely annoying and she was always looking for attention and drama. So when Josh started dating her I was honest with him and told him he should look for someone else. He said he wanted to make his own mind up and I respected that. He came to me a couple times because she had told him I was being rude towards her, and I'll admit I could have been nicer, but again I didn't like her so I was very short with her in conversation. Anyway they eventually broke up and that was that for a while.

Then I heard from some friends that Lea had been telling people that Josh made her feel really uncomfortable while dating. She said that they had been drinking one night and when they got home she told him she didn't want to have sex because she was too drunk, and he undressed her and fingered her etc despite her saying no. This enraged me, as I didn't believe it and there was no proof at the time. I asked Josh about it and he was equally as angry and told me it was all a lie. Any time I heard this story from someone else we corrected them and told them about how much of an attention seeker and drama-whore Lea was and the community opinion shifted to being in Josh's favor.

Then Lea decided to post all the text messages her and Josh had exchanged after that night where he admitted to everything she had been saying. I dropped Josh as a friend immediately and tried to reach out to Lea to apologize but I don't know if she got my texts because she never responded. I've had numerous people verbally abuse me since as a result of what's happened, and a huge amount of the people in the community now want absolutely nothing to do with me. I feel like I'm being branded as an accomplice to a sexual assaulter, when that isn't the case. Again I wholeheartedly understand that I added to Lea's anguish going through all this, but there was no evidence at the time and people were just believing her with no reason. I don't think I should be alienated just because I wouldn't get out my pitchfork. Not many people will agree to spend time with me now and the ones that do don't want to be seen in public with me, and it's taking a huge toll on my mental health. I know this is probably too complicated or above reddit's paygrade but I literally have no one else to talk to about this and I feel like I'm going nuts. Where do I go from here?",22Dec2020,1
23,"Hello, everyone.  Feeling a little strange about asking for advice, but: I am just finishing up college and am ready to start seeking out the next thing.  I have a boyfriend that is very kind to me and we create a lot of great artwork together, but I can't shake the need to break up with him.  I've broken up with him twice this year, but we always get back together because neither of us really has anything better to do.  I feel guilty because there isn't anything particularly wrong with him, but every few months, I get an overwhelming sense of dissatisfaction.  

I've suffered from depression on and off for a few years now, so I've kind of lost faith in my ability to make sound decisions. I was recently offered a job to move to Europe to teach.  This is an excellent opportunity, but I'm terrified because of what it means for my life here ""at home"".  1.) I will probably have to give away my beloved pet rats and 2.) break up with my boyfriend.  Part of me fears that I will regret the breakup, and the move to Europe will make me feel more alienated than I already do.  On the other hand, I am afraid that I will regret not taking this opportunity.  I am getting old (27) and have always wanted to see the world.

36,"Hi everyone, 
Last year I was living in my dream city going to a great school, but then covid happened and I had to move back home and give up my apartment because my job shut down permanently and my school also did. My mom was kind enough to take me in and I‚Äôve been staying with her since March. I am grateful truly for this because there is no way I would have been able to make rent without my job. However she‚Äôs kind of disrespectful to me and refuses to talk to me or treat me like and adult and she‚Äôll make comments like you only make it in that city for x amount of months even though she knows I didn‚Äôt want to leave and has started treating me like she did when I was a teenager. She also shoves in my face that I‚Äôm not paying rent even though we came to an agreement that I would work on her house doing whatever from cleaning to fixing things. There has also been quite a lot of change in her life because her and her husband ended up getting separated this year and the divorce was messy, which is why I try to be understanding. But I can‚Äôt help feeling resentful because the comments are adding up. Luckily this year wasn‚Äôt a complete waste because I was able to get an apprenticeship for the job I‚Äôve been chasing since i can remember. Along with paying for school my apprenticeship, which takes up most of the work week, is unpaid. It goes till October and then I have to stay and work for another year due to a contract I signed. So here is where my dilemma is. I really truly want and need to move out, but I won‚Äôt be paid till at least October and after that my pay will not be great for the next year. Where I‚Äôm living currently is no where near close to where I want to live. I have money saved for rent from living in the city which will get me to October, but I wonder if I should even bother moving out or I should save the money for the next year and a half so I can make the big move once I‚Äôm don‚Äôt with this job.

I started to really question if I actually liked her or was just infatuated. This happened during Christmas break which is still going on. I feel like away from all the hullaballoo of school life I've had some time to objectively examine my feelings. I'm not sure if I want to be with her after all. I still love talking with her and I still think she's amazing but I've kind of lost the desire to pursue her in a romantic way. I don't know why this keeps happening to me. This has happened with every girl I've ever been interested in. There'll be something mutual, then I'll get cold feet and want out. I've started to nitpick some of her physical characteristics, and I think that I may not be physically attracted to her after all. This, to me, is a sign of immaturity. Part of me still wants to give this a try but that might just be because I don't want to be alone or I don't have the guts to be honest. I need some advice. Do I push through this hiccup or do I back out?",22Dec2020,1
38,So I (22) just found out I'm pregnant and I dont know what to do. I had an abortion few months ago because my boyfriend (23) and I are not financially stable enough to have a baby. I don't know if I should or want to go through that again but I also don't know if I should even have a child. I'm not sure if I would be able to handle any of it emotionally.

I clicked on it and it freaked me out, it was adam but at the same time it wasn‚Äôt; he was entering ps5 giveaways (adam didn‚Äôt give a fuck about video games he was a bookworm) and was commenting on his university‚Äôs account that he doesn‚Äôt have a dorm room and that he lives in a hotel room with a creepy guy and pays 10$ a night (and adam is rich) I told adam did u follow me from another account? and he got super nervous and denied everything and deleted that account immediately but I managed to screenshot everything. I thought wtf but THAT wasn't all.... the anonymous guy texted me and asked me how I was (right after I told adam about the account) and I told him I was fine and then I asked him to give me his account because I had a problem with a friend and I wanted to check if he was him or not (i didn't tell him it was adam), he sent me a screenshot of what seems an account and covered everything but only showed the followers and the date he joined Twitter to prove to me that he wasn‚Äôt my friend, I believed him and told him the story and he said do u promise me not to tell anyone about this? I was like sure I promise and the chat disappeared out of nowhere and I thought he blocked me. minutes later he sent me a message saying hey I replied why did u block me he said I didn't I deleted the chat and we talked for less than a minute and he said okay please don‚Äôt tell anyone but I'm adam. I got into total shock and didn‚Äôt even pay attention to what he was saying and was asking him why did u lie about all this and what about Sara? did u even love her? and he said no I loved her with all my heart but she‚Äôs the one that made you hate me so I hated her, I don‚Äôt think im getting back to her, and he told me about how he stopped smoking cigarettes just because I told him I hate the smell of it and how his mother and father are divorced and his mother is the one that‚Äôs paying for everything and how he didn‚Äôt post his pictures because his self esteem wasn‚Äôt the best. im super confused right now and im sorry if my writing was a mess but thats the best I can do right now because of im in total shock. what do I do?",22Dec2020,1

I am a senior in hs and I have been friends with frizzy since a school retreat that brought us teens close together back in February. we have fun since she is pretty innocent and sheltered. we bonded over quarantine as well, we would ft in a group chat with two of my other close friends and my best friend, lion.

I usually joke about lion with sex because she understands and so I do, so I continue making jokes to frizzy. then we find out the guy she is interested in is a junior. well no big deal, but I make a joke saying just date him anyway. frizzy got angry at me over txt in gc and she makes it known she wants me to not talk about that anymore. so I text and say  i‚Äôm sorry I won‚Äôt mention it I am used to joking like this with lion. she starts quoting things I said in the ft call after I had apologized and said I wouldn‚Äôt bring it up. I tell frizzy to stop and if there is a problem we need to talk separately, not in the group chat. but she continues to make me sound evil and she accuses me of pressuring her into having sex. girl how can I pressure you if you don‚Äôt have anyone to have sex with in the first place? anyway, she also starts saying that she‚Äôs nothing like me and would never have sex after a couple of months in a relationship like I have in both of mine. she said you can do what you want but I will not be doing that, i‚Äôm feeling like im bein slut shamed by her. we call again and things escalate.

I gave her two days and like then I texted her telling her this shouldn‚Äôt be a big deal and I am completely shocked because she has never ever done anything like this before. she quotes me AGAIN which I told her to stop doing. frizzy tells me that it was a big red flag that I yelled at her on ft... and thats the reason she is cutting me off. I told her I am here if she needs anything.  i am still confused abt the way she just switched up after 7 months of friendship. lion my best friend of 6 years told her off after that.

47,"Sorry English is my second language so ill be a bit choppy. 

So she‚Äôs been offered a job by her ex-fling at his business doing something she claims she wanted to do for months and months and how excited she is to be doing it.

The only issue is he was fucking her before lockdown, and their ‚Äúfun‚Äù had to end because of not being able to see each other. And now they‚Äôll be working directly together which is freaking me out. The office is in the middle of nowhere, just them two - and he has to drive her everyday because it‚Äôs the only way she can get there. 

She told me (on our first date) that she fucked him, but when she‚Äôs with her friends and I‚Äôm there, they constantly bring it up like it‚Äôs normal and just funny as they have a special nickname for him (I won‚Äôt say, but he‚Äôs a brewer, so he‚Äôs named the ‚Äúbrew man‚Äù. So... oh yeah, remember during lockdown the brew man used to visit you to bring you food). 

So yeah. They met on a night out. She was 19, he was 35 and they went home together, then met again two days later to fuck or whatever they were doing. This was a week before lockdown. Then it happened and she was serious about it but he wasn‚Äôt and he apparently tried to sneak to hers to fuck her but she didn‚Äôt want to but he didn‚Äôt care about the restrictions. 

Then he apparently had covid symptoms and told her that if he died he‚Äôd leave her his apartment (they knew each other for a few weeks at this point, might I add). 

So anyway, we‚Äôre together now and it‚Äôs going good but this has annoyed me thoroughly. Out of all the jobs to get it had to be with someone she‚Äôs slept with. Just my luck. 

I went back home last week, and now this guy suddenly comes when I‚Äôm away and she tells me with short notice that she‚Äôs gonna he working for him. Suspicious? Yeah I told her this and she called me immature. 

So she started a shift a few days ago, he picked her up of course and they went to his office. He personally showed her how to do stuff and it sounded like they had fun. They were doing it for 6 hours, and apparently went for a walk together whilst waiting for pizza to arrive. Then he drove her to an atm and overpayed her which was odd. 

I told her this and she just told me I‚Äôm insecure, but I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs just trying to get back in her pants. 

He‚Äôs a pretty unattractive guy and I‚Äôm annoyed she even got with him in the first place. It makes me feel on the same level with him and that I‚Äôm not that special if she‚Äôll go for someone like that. I mean, he sounds sleazy too. Like he‚Äôll do anything to sleep with her. Like what I‚Äôve mentioned, and giving her a job and overpaying her on the first shift (like it‚Äôs a bonus she gets because she‚Äôs slept with him) and driving her and ordering her pizza. 

I‚Äôm just not okay with it. It severely annoys me. I hate that this cunt is in her life and she‚Äôs just allowing it. I hate that she can‚Äôt see how sleazy he is and how him bending over backwards is just a thing he‚Äôs doing to fuck her once more. 

I can‚Äôt get past it and it‚Äôs made me lose a bit of love for her as she clearly doesn‚Äôt care about how I feel. Just that I need to ‚Äúget over it‚Äù as she gets super defensive whenever I bring it up.",22Dec2020,1
48,"My friend recently was having a really hard time. She relapsed and vented on me talking about how there‚Äôs so much stress, grades, schoolwork, loneliness, etc. etc. I knew that she has a problem with procrastinating, and with winter break coming up I tried to help by proposing a ‚Äúvirtual study group‚Äù type thing where we would get on a call and just do work, because when someone else is also doing schoolwork it kinda gives some motivation to do work yourself.

I pushed for it quite a bit, and she hesitantly said sure since she is a very introverted person and she believed that a call would make her too nervous to finish any work. We settled on a meeting date that‚Äôs during the break and the day before I sent her a message reminding her.

She sent me a message saying something along the lines of ‚ÄúI just wanna have a good time there‚Äôs so much going on school, loneliness, depression, and COVID. I hate life and then you just gotta be an adult screw that‚Äù

I was pretty shocked and a bit angry at first but I calmed down and thought about it a bit more. I feel like I have good intentions, but am I forcing too much of what I believe is right onto her?

49,"My former best friend, Banana, and I are no longer in contact. We are both 22y/o females and were friends for 8 years before reaching our current no contact. I need advice on how to give myself closure. I will explain the nature and recent events of our former friendship.  

Banana and I were friends for 8 years. We met when I moved to her middle school during my 8th grade year. We bonded over our love of music and sang together in choir after school. We continued our friendship throughout high school while enjoying honors courses, band, and ROTC together!! We spent quality time togther after extracurricular activities, mostly enjoying T.V. and campfires. She was a very outgoing, genuine, and compassionate person. I came to love her like my sister. Banana and I also invited Moon into our friendship circle. The three of us spent many years developing a strong friendship, which I thought was unbreakable. 

High school was a difficult time for me. I moved schools several times and left an extremely abusive household. I overcame PTSD and fought to graduate high school early. I continued my eduaction at a University and sought therapy. Throughout those difficult years, Banana and Moon were amazingly supportive friends. They listened when I needed an ear; we planned time to enjoy each other company--despite the chaos around us. I will always appreciate their love and support. It felt like they were family, and I cherish holidays spent with Banana and her mom.

Fast forward to one year ago. Banana was dating a male that both Moon and I thought was abusive. We witnessed situations where he verbally degraded Banana and was misogynistic. Moon and I were clear with Banana regarding her abusive relationship. We wanted to support and love her--no matter what!! During this time, Banana set me up on a date with a former friend of hers. The date did not go well. I told this man I first wanted to be friends; however, he proceeded to grope me and try to kiss me. I told him we could not be friends, and I did not want his presence in my life. I later told Banana how horrible was my date with the male. She was shocked and agreed I had every right to be upset. I now am involved in a healthy romantic relationship, and we live together.

Throughout that year, Banana did not make plans to visit me and appeared to withdrawl from her friendship with me and Moon. This past summer, she broke up with her boyfriend. Moon and I moved Banana back home and took shifts spending time with Banana so that she was never alone. There were a few occasions Banana made hurtful comments to me about my weight, but she later apologized and compared my beauty to that of Moon's--which was also very hurtful and rude. Banana's character seemed to change, too. She usually talked about herself rather than showing interest in either my or Moon's life. She seemed generally unsupportive of our success. She did not make plans or efforts to visit either me or Moon. Our friendship seemed to be deteriorating. 

Two weeks after Banana broke up with her boyfriend, she began to date the male of which I had an extremely uncomfortable date. I was floored that she would date a male who made me feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable!! He violated my space, and she started to date him! I told her over several phone calls that I was worried about her decision, and I did not feel comfortable being around him. She ignored my advice (though she did previously ask for my advice). She also asked to spend the night with me so she could visit her new boyfriend. I told her no. Mostly because that is rude, but she had not visited my home in two years. I had just found a new apartment with my boyfriend of one year, too. Banana has made no efforts to view my new home!!  She also planned two social gatherings and invited both me and this male. I did not attend either events, though Moon did tell me he was there. The second event Moon attended, Banana abandoned Moon at Banana's house for two hours to spend time with said male at a political event. Moon was disappointed and went home. Banana did not apologize to Moon or ask her if she went home safely. 

Moon and I spoke about our relationship with Banana and decided we should discuss our grievances with her. Moon and I planned a day to share some wine and snacks to talk with Moon about how we were feeling. We first met at a Mexican restaurant, without the intention of talking to Banana there. However, Moon was so upset that she interrupted our lunch to confront Banana about how she abandoned plans with her to spend time with the male. Banana said she would not apologize and blamed someone else for her not coming back to Moon. Banana did not take responsibility for her actions, and she did not appear to care when Moon explained how depressed she had been and needed her friends. Banana said she felt attacked and was going to go home and cry. Moon and I felt her response was very immature. We reflected and feel that she used the narcissistic behavior of DARVO to deflect responsibility of her actions.

We texted Banana later that night to invite her over for some wine and cheese. We expressed how we just wanted to talk now that we were all cooled off. Banana said she needed to study for her one online class she was taking this semester. The group message exploded with Banana and Moon into an argument. I told Banana that I felt it should not be this difficult to have an honest conversation with her. Banana agreed and left the group chat. Moon and I have not spoken with Banana since that conversation. 

I feel hurt and disappointed with how fragile our friendship was in the face of conflict. I thought we were stronger than this. I thought Banana would support me when I told her how her new boyfriend assaulted me! I thought Banana would have made at least one attempt to visit me in the past two years. I thought Banana would have taken my and Moon's hurt more seriously. I am so disgusted and disappointed in her behaviour. I do not know how to move on, and I do not see us reconciling our friendship. When I reflect over the past few years, there are many instances Banana has been unsupportive. I am also starting to realize how materialistic and selfish Banana has become. She usually wanted to spend time with me and Moon in bars or with drinks, whereas we just want quiet quality time. (Nothing wrong with a bar, though--just too loud for what we wanted to do with Banana).

I am not sure what to do for me to emotionally move on from this past friendship. I feel so much hurt and anger, but I know forgiveness is for my healing. I just do not know how!!

TL;DR: How do I move on from an 8 year friendship after much hurt and pain? Thank you in advance. I could really use your all's guidance.",22Dec2020,1

51,"TW: Abuse

Hi guys! Sorry this is kind of long, but the first bit is the only important part.

The Commonapp has an optional ""additional information"" where you can include any info that is essential to your application. Mental health is a common topic for people to include in this section, but it seems like people advise against writing about mental health unless you have made serious progress.

I was sexually abused when I was between the ages of 7 and 10, and my abuser moved back in with me during quarantine. My mental health has always been kind of bad because of this trauma, but living with him again has definitely made it worse. Because of this, my senior year grades are pretty bad and I think I will be rejected from college because of them.

Should I include an essay justifying my bad grades this semester and giving more context about my life?

I don't feel comfortable going to my college counselor about this because she will have to report it and I will have to go through a whole process.

I googled it, and the internet has no helpful advice regarding writing about abuse in college essays, so I decided to ask for some help from Reddit. I am very new to reddit, and this is my first post ever, so I hope I haven't broken any guidelines by posting this.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the essay I would include if you want to read it:

PROMPT: Do you wish to provide details of circumstances or qualifications not reflected in the application?

When I was a child between the ages of seven and ten, I was sexually abused by an older family member. My abuser moved out of my house when I was eleven to pursue a career in a different state. I worked very hard to find a way to cope with this trauma on my own because I was afraid if I told my parents, I would destroy my family. By high school, I was able to focus my attention on my interests and my schooling, and by my junior year, I was thriving academically and in my passions.¬†

Unfortunately, at the beginning of quarantine, around late March, my abuser moved back into my home. I have had to quarantine and spend all of my time with a man who has caused me a great deal of suffering. This had a negative impact on my mental health and pulled my focus away from the things in my life that I truly care about, like my education and other interests. I told my parents about my abuse in April and have started going to counseling to help resolve my trauma.¬†

I¬† am very proud of the progress I have made, but living with my abuser again has made focusing on school very difficult. I am concerned that my first-semester senior year grades will not represent me very well because I was spending all of my time in quarantine with an abuser. I would appreciate it if you could look to my junior year grades as a better representation of what I can achieve when I am not in these circumstances. I hope that living with my childhood abuser during quarantine will not negatively impact your perception of me but give context for my senior year.¬†

Through counseling, I have acknowledged that my trauma will make me stronger and more resilient. I believe that in college and professionally, I will thrive intellectually and academically because of my natural curiosity and drive. Please understand that I will not let my abuse define me, but it has shaped me in a way that is too significant to not include in my application. I am the goofy, passionate, and intellectually curious person that I have displayed throughout the rest of my application. I could not be more excited to explore my interests and meet people from different backgrounds at college.

&amp;#x200B;

In this essay, I do not really talk about how it has affected my mental health because I have not made a ton of progress in counseling yet. I definitely oversimplify a lot of things.

For context, I am applying mostly to exclusive schools (Ivys and stuff), and I meet all other qualifications besides my Senior grades, which are Bs and Cs (and one D). I have already been rejected from Dartmouth, and I did not include this essay in that application. I am no longer being abused, but I am living with my abuser. I am currently 17 years old.

I know it's against the community guidelines to ask for help with essays, so I am not doing that here, but if you have any advice about how to approach the topic, please let me know.",22Dec2020,1

55,"Hey guys. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but here I go!

I graduated High School in 2012, and started at a CC in Fall of 2012. At first, my grades were not the best, but eventually I started to bring them up slowly. My grades were actually pretty good and I only had a couple classes left before I could have transferred; however, I had some events occur that just trashed it all. My grades dropped to F's and W's. And they stayed that way. The events that had occurred really wrecked me emotionally, physically and obviously, in my academics. While these events were unfolding one after the other, I still tried to keep going to school (even though I was failing them), because it was the only thing that kept me from really breaking down and just completely loosing it. I really like going to school, even though I'm not some Harvard genius, or some 10 year old kid that knows all. I may not be those kids that just know math and science from the top of their head, and brag about their knowledge of engineering. I may not be any of these people, but I still like school. In school, I am very average. I am very slow at learning, but I still learn (no, I don't have a learning disability). I've been trying to get out of CC for basically 7 years now. My grades from the past 3 semesters have been better than F's and D's. They improved, as well as my living conditions and well being. This coming Semester is my ""last"" semester (according to me), and I started my application process for some schools. According to the ""Cal State Apply"" website, I have a 1.98 Transfer GPA. Yeah I know, that's really low. I was not expecting it to be THAT low, to be honest . That being said, what are my chances of getting into ANY school? I know schools are known to only choose the kids that have 4.0's or the ones that have a really low GPA (like myself) BUT, gave the school a nice Small gift of $1,000,000 (*cough The Loughlin Children*****cough). Anyways, I hope someone can give me some advice on what to do. What should I do if I can‚Äôt get accepted anywhere? Should I just start working? If I can‚Äôt get accepted anywhere, I won‚Äôt know what to do, since going to school is all I‚Äôve ever really known :/ A part of me believes my chances of getting into any school and even getting any kind of degree have been ruined, by myself, and a certain someone.

TLDR: I'm a 27 year old guy. My grades suck because of shitty abusive relationship and other events that happened. My GPA is 1.98. Will i get accepted anywhere? :( What are your recommendations?",22Dec2020,1
56,"So i‚Äôm a bisexual 18 year old dude that leans more towards gay than straight. I‚Äôm not out so I‚Äôve been deprived of sexual, emotional, and physical love and affection from guys my entire life. In an attempt to try and get that kind of experience without having to come out to my extremely homophobic friends in this extremely homophobic town that I live in, I downloaded Grindr.
I didn‚Äôt use it for hookups, I used it to talk to dudes.
When I talk to dudes I get to know them and we have great conversations, sometimes those conversations turn sexual or all lovey dovey. 
Either way, no matter what they look like (hot or not) or how sweet they are, I end up ghosting them for varying reasons. 
Sometimes its because I lose interest, get too scared of things being real, or because they don‚Äôt fit the image in my head, meaning they‚Äôre too attractive for me or not attractive enough. 
I‚Äôve had like 15 dudes within the last 3 months text me how much I hurt them or that I broke them. 
I know I‚Äôm an absolute piece of shit, I just can‚Äôt stop it and it happens every time even when I don‚Äôt think it will. I‚Äôve never felt worse about something and I don‚Äôt want to hurt people. I just have some deep rooted issues or something.

61,"I've (35F) have been agoraphobic for 15 years now.  I haven't left the house at all. Barely leave room since I live with family (hopefully to change soon). The family I live with now is nice. It's my mother, step father and 22 year old brother. We get along fine enough. I just can't bring myself to socialize with them. I've always been this way. 

I had a bad childhood. To give a quick summary, my mom abandoned my older sister (37) and I when I was 6 months old. She was the definition of a deadbeat mom, occasional weekend visits maybe once or twice every few years. My father hated me. Hate like I've never seen before. He would beat me nearly every time he saw me. During this time, my sister and I lived with our grandparents (dad's side). My grandparents were amazing. The best people in the world in my opinion. They raised us with no help really. Eventually my grandmother got sick and passed. That's when my life turned into a nightmare. 

When I was 18 my sister went onto my computer and found some nude photos of me with my boyfriend (Stupid, I know. I learned the hard way). She hacked my social media and posted them, including lies about stealing jewelry from my grandmother and pawning it (turns out my grandmother gave it to her sister). She did this the night my grandmother died. I lost everyone. Family and friends wouldn't speak to me. They just threw me away without even questioning it. My sister and a friend of hers ran a campaign (as they called it) to get me to kill myself. I would have if my boyfriend didn't remove me from all of it. He let me move in and gave me a safe place to be. I was shunned at my grandma's funeral. Couldn't stand with the family, I ended up in the back and spoke to no one because I was ashamed. A year later my grandfather and I reconciled and I was happier. My boyfriend and I moved in to help care for him and eventually my sister would move back in too. My sister admitted this all to me years later saying ""I was disappointed it didn't work but I'm happy now cuz you help with the baby"" she has a daughter and now a son also. 

We all lived together for about 10 years. My boyfriend and I planned to move out eventually but I loved being with my niece and nephew, then my grandfather got older and needed more and more care so I never pushed the subject of moving out. 

My sister was a toxic person in my life. I couldn't fight back because I was raised to know I'm not allowed. I'm a second class citizen in every way possible and I accepted that. It got to the point that I wouldn't wear my clothes around the house because she would insult me or borrow them and I'm not allowed to say no so I started just hiding them. I constantly wore pj pants and my boyfriend's work shirts but she'd still ask for them. It's small but it really messed with my mind. She'd be entitled to anything. I've had to get out of a shower with soap in my hair cuz she needed the bathroom. All she did was look at her eyebrows then leave. I have a million examples of small stuff like this but when you add them up it takes a toll on you. 

2 years ago, she accused me of stealing money from my grandfather, because I told her after bills there was no money left to give to her. I showed her bills, bank statements and receipts. She still accused me of stealing. At this point I can't handle it anymore. She could get me arrested for this lie. The kids are old enough to care for themselves and my grandfather's (90 years old) care became more advanced that I couldn't do it safely (I couldn't physically help him out of bed without concern of dropping him). I left. I told them I was moving out. I explained to the kids and my grandfather that I can't live there anymore and that I love them. I was gone 2 weeks later, renting a room in my mother's apartment. 

I visited the kids once. I was actually able to go a town over and visit! It was at night and for only 30 minutes but I missed them so much. It's different over there now. My niece swears at her mother and my nephew begged me to move back in the whole time. My grandfather was in the hospital (which isn't unusual) so I didn't get to see him. 

One visit. That's all I got. My sister started ignoring my messages about visiting, birthday gifts, etc. Eventually I get a response saying she doesn't see a need to be in contact anymore. She said she asked the kids and they don't want to see me either. It's the most heartbreaking thing I've ever felt. I was with them everyday for 10 years. Helping everyday. I know legally I have no rights and arguing would just stress the kids so I let them go. I feel as if I lost children myself and it's made my depression worse. I can barely have a happy thought now. Everyone leaves. Nothing is safe. 

So here I am. 35 years old and in my room still. I can't get help because I don't have an id. I don't have a social security card. I don't have a birth certificate. I was born and raised in this country and I exist but I have no way to claim my identity. I can't leave the house and I have a terrifying fear of cameras now asking with speaking to people. I saw a therapist once but she said she wasn't qualified enough to handle me. I'm scared everyday about my future. I need a therapist to help me deal with my mind. I need to be declared disabled. I need some kind of income so my boyfriend isn't paying out of pocket for me as much. I need to be able to contribute. I don't know what to do. I can't get insurance to see a therapist. We contacted a lawyer and he said to just suck it up. I can't suck it up or else I wouldn't have been like this for 15 years. I don't know what to do. I'm sitting here waiting to die and I don't think I can't take it much more. I don't know what advice I'm looking for but I know I need help.",22Dec2020,1

64,"Alright, so my sister in law has been cold and distant to me for years and I would love to make the relationship better for the sake of my husband. I'm not expecting to be friends with her but would like some less tension.

I only met my sister in law a handful of times before my husband and I got married and she was always nice to me. When my husband and I got married (3 years ago) we eloped but had a reception that we decided not to invite kids to because we had a very limited number of seats and the price per head was too high to pay for a kid. When we told her that we weren't having kids she got all mad and asked why we wanted to ostracize familly. Obviously we wanted her there so we offered to pay for a babysitter and order pizza and the kids could hang out at my parents house and then we could all head there after the reception (and it wasn't some random sitter, it was my sisters best friend who my family has known for 15 years.) Anyway we tell her that and she threw a huge hissy fit saying she didn't want a stranger watching her kids and straight up told us ""If my kids can't come I'm not coming."" At this point I was annoyed and didn't like being issued an ultimatum for my event so we told them we'd leave two seats open for them and the babysitting offer still stood. She ended up not coming to the reception and when we had dinner with my husbands side of the family later on that week she and her husband completely ignored me, to the point where they hugged my husband who was standing next to me and didn't look at or say anything to me. 

That year for Christmas we got them a bottle of wine and a gift card and got no thanks from them. Last year they were civil to us and I thought things had maybe gotten better, but this year we made them cookies and some crafts and sent them and we haven't heard anything from them yet. I know they got them last week as my husbands other sister received hers (she thanked us.)

I'm getting frustrated because I know it bothers my husband and I feel like we've tried but are still getting nowhere with them in terms of repairing our relationship. Normally if someone treated me like this I'd brush it off and not concern myself with if they liked me or not, but I know it's important to my husband so I want to make an effort. 

Anyone have any advice on what to do or dealt with something similar?

70,"hello all, I \[18M\] am very close with my grandfather, and I have been for my entire life. He was like a second father to me and watched me grow up. He is, and always has been, a very touchy guy. To clarify, he likes hugging people and holding their hands (not just mine). He also has poor eyesight and when I go to greet him, he usually holds up the bottom of my shirt to see what text/logo is on it.

The first incident that bothered me happened during the summer. After a day of him sitting on the porch, watching a few friends and I mess around with water guns, I went to the porch to get my phone and go inside. He told me to go there, and he squinted and reached for my shirt. Since my shirt was hanging over my pants, his hand touched... There, and he jerked his hand away without a word, and grabbed my shirt to look at the name.

I was kind of grossed out by this but I thought he could have done it by accident, so I didn't say anything. A few weeks later, though, and another uncomfortable event occurred:

While my grandmother was getting dinner ready, he came up behind me, punched my butt, and whispered that we should start eating.

Since then (about 2 weeks) nothing else has happened except for the occasional butt-pats while hugging (which have always been a thing). I'm not sure if these were just isolated incidents and are meaningless, but I don't want to take the chance. Does this seem like grooming/predatory behavior or am I overthinking this?",22Dec2020,1
71,"Relationship Advice wouldnt allow my post

I haven't been on this account in a while but I'm hurting bad today and thinking about how much I wish my family would take me at my word and not see me as a bad person. If you look at my post history, youll see I have home troubles.

Just to get down some details, when I was about 9-10 I was pretty developed for my age. My grandpa or grandma from another country used to come over every year or so and stay for the entire summer, during one of those summers my grandpa groped me and when I told my parents what happened afterwards they told me that I probably just misunderstood what he was doing or that he didn't mean it that way. Because they didn't see it as a big deal i didn't either until years later when discussing my discomfort to my therapist during a session about what happened. It was only then I realized I was molested, and when I told my mom about this she told me i needed to tell my therapist I was lying about it because at this point my grandpa was still coming over and she was afraid cps would be called since i had younger siblings.

Whats shitty is they still let him into the house years afterwards, he'd ask us to sit on his lap and other weird stuff like that and we had to sit with him and serve him tea even when we didn't want to. When I got older my mom told me he'd touched her and other random women inappropriately in the past too which just makes me feel even more angry about the fact that she didn't believe me.

I hardly ever brought this up because I've been trying to process it for years, but whenever i did my mom would tell me ""Wow i hope that didn't happen"" and more recently ""you told us a different story when you were young, youre changing the story now and we wouldn't have let him into the house if we'd known"" BUT THEY DID and I told the same story over and over again, I feel like I'm crazy and it makes me question if I'm just imagining everything that happened to me???

Yesterday my mom got mad at me and told me what he did wasn't molestation and when I said groping me and touching me inappropriately is molestation she said ""are you trying to say you had sex with your grandpa, did you have intercourse with you?"" I was so disgusted, I feel disgusting. They're religious muslims whilst I am not and when I was younger and got caught talking to a guy online they called me a whore and just dirt when they let this man come over every summer for months around my siblings as well knowing hes gotten the furthest with me than anyone ever has.

Idk, Im just hurting, i feel invalidated, No one believes me....is it messed up that the act itself doesnt affect me as much as the fact that nobody believes it happened?",22Dec2020,1
72," 

To preface, I'm a 16 year old boy living in Colombia, who has been dealing with serious depression and anxiety. My parents are incredibly abusive, in different ways. My father, is an overbearing monster who incessantly seeks conflict, in a neurotic and unpredictable manner. Meanwhile, my mother is a very sweet woman, however, it's very superficial. She gaslights me constantly. Whenever I express inconformity with anything that goes around me, her typical reaction is to claim that I'm ""conspiring against her"", to provoke my father into having one of his fits. My mother is also very religious, as such, she believes that what I feel is wholly caused by ""demons"", who wish to ""destroy the family"". She has also belittled me by using my mental problems. She attempts to make me feel like whatever I say is false, with the pretense that I'm ""completely insane"". And thus, incapable of thinking rationally.

I've tried opening up to them about all of these issues, however, it always devolves into chaos. My father has told me every insult in the book; ""faggot"", ""autist"", and ""fat bitch"" are his favorites. My mother also insults me, in a similar manner. As a result, I suffer from frequent panic attacks. Yes, both my parents react with anger whenever they witness them. At first, they try to ignore me. If I continue, my father will personally come to attack me with the above mentioned insults. He has also threatened to forcefully take me out of my house on many occasions. All while my mother sits back and does nothing to stop him. She is incredibly frigid, and never attempts to help me. I'm at my wits end, and willing to listen to any advice you have for me.

A few years ago when I was 13 years old I ran an Instagram fan account for the band Queen. After a few months of running it I ended up frequently messaging another person, who actually ended up being a 29 year old woman. She was open about her age and knew I was only 13. She also knew I was suffering with some poor mental health issues at the time, due to personal reasons. 

I want to make it very clear that she never made any romantic or sexual advances on me. But she did often message me about her major life problems (for example, she was having divorce problems with her husband, her family pressured her into being a lawyer, her short term partners weren't treating her well, etc). 
She also tried to tell me that bisexuality doesn't exist while I was in the middle of questioning my sexuality and said the n-word multiple times even though she was white. I once tried to call her out on it but she guilt tripped me and made me feel like shit after. 
As well as that, she added me into a groupchat with several other adults where she'd threaten to deactivate her account every other day, until she did eventually just disappear without notifying anyone before. the last thing I heard from her was that she was going to go back to college to get the job she actually wants. 

I haven't heard from her since. 

Now, at the time I didn't see much wrong but looking back on it all feels so... Weird. As I mentioned before, she never tried to invest in a relationship with me but it still feels really off? Why would a 29/30 year old be interested in messaging a 13 year old? 

I suppose what advice I'm looking for here is just some clarity on why any of that happened. I know it's a vague question but I'm honestly at a complete loss for where to question.

83,"My gf of 4.5 years left me back in June because of mistakes and bad decisions I made and my inability to communicate and be vulnerable with her and within that was unable to come clean about my decade-long porn/sex addiction. I‚Äôve resigned myself to the fact that she‚Äôs done with me, I have to tell myself she wasn‚Äôt perfect either to try to lessen the depression a bit when I get in a funk about it. And I‚Äôm working on getting over her, even though it may be years. 

At this point my boundaries are super muddy. I‚Äôm a single guy and maybe I should use this time to explore and find out what I really want? But then maybe I should use this time to focus on de-sexualizing myself and settling into relational and sexual recovery with my therapist. 

Either way, I do know I‚Äôm devoted to learning how to be a better person and a better partner for a future relationship. I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôve learned a lot of those lessons already at this point, that communication and vulnerability is critical and that the biggest problem with a porn/sex addiction is what you make of it; some people can watch porn regularly and be fine, but I became someone who wanted what I saw in the videos and I objectified a lot of women.

At the rate I work, college was my best possible chance of meeting someone, and that‚Äôs what happened with my ex, but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever find another person, even after doing all this work to make myself a better man. That thought alone deflates my motivation bubble quite significantly. And that leads to the thoughts of ‚Äúis my life even worth it?‚Äù

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. Safe to say I hate myself. For everything I put her through and for not cowboying up to my shortcomings a long time ago.",22Dec2020,1
84,"I'm mid-20's visiting my parents at home  for a couple of months due to the pandemic, job loss due to the pandemic, holidays, etc. Quarantined with my immediate family in my hometown. My family is very close and we all have a great relationship and my parents are incredible parents and people. Being home has been super nice and I'm blessed to have a family that I'm actually happy to spend 2 consecutive months quarantined with - I know this is rare.

That said, this morning I'm pretty sure I woke up to my mom asking my dad if he could ""hire a hooker."" She went on to talk about money and Christmas gifts in the short bit I heard before covering my ears so I'm 99% sure I heard correctly considering that context. Which is frankly horrifying.

85,"I have been visiting my family for Christmas and have noticed strange behavior from my mom with her phone. 

Last time I was in town I noticed her using the gmail app and clearly holding the screen away from prying eyes. I may have seen some heart emojis being sent and possibly her using a gmail address that I did not recognize. 

This trip, she has constantly been on the Google Hangouts app chatting with someone(s). I don‚Äôt want to assume the worst of her, but I also don‚Äôt want her to be doing something that will hurt my father. 

How do I approach asking her about this? My current plan is to just ask her ‚ÄúWho have you been chatting with on the Google app?‚Äù while she takes me to the airport. I want to have a clear escape if the conversation goes sour which seems likely no matter what is actually happening.

I have a past full of violence directed towards me, was raised by psychotic parents, later turned to drugs for a way to make myself feel better but proceeded to ruin myself even harder and that's where the problem began. The whole purpose of me abusing my brain and body constantly was to forget all my failures including the fact that I, myself, am one, but it didn't work so now after almost 2 years sober off of everything I was doing, it slowly clicked. I've had some bad arguments recently with a lot of people i cared about, it all went to hell faster than I could blink but the worst part is that for a while now, and by a while i mean a few months, it's like everything inside me is gone missing. All the anger towards myself, the self-hatred, the anxiety, the pain and deathwish, they aren't there anymore. I just feel empty, i wouldn't care if i were to die tommorow or if the world would end, and it's so dull. I've considered trying to kill myself again but i don't think it's worth hurting everyone like that and frankly, it's a bit brutal.

91,"I'm going to make this post in multiple subreddits so I apologise if this is the second time you see this post.

Yes you read the title right

I'm a single father to a 9 year old boy who isn't potty trained. 

I've taken him to countless pediatricians, psychologists, specialists etc. Hoping to find a medical answer for this but nothing my son just isn't potty trained. 

He wears diapers that are meant for older kid bed wetters all day, even in school which I imagine wouldnt make him the most popular kid.

I feel bad for him as I can tell that hes incredibly embarrassed about the whole thing and I know he tries really hard to stop and I know he finds the diapers he wears really uncomfortable.

I've tried rewards, punishments, talking, reasoning, alarms, making him go sit on the toilet every hour, medication, attempting to diagnose him with something and every other method in the books but still no improvement.

I'm worried this will continue till it gets out of hand.

 Hes my only kid and I didnt really know when was the appropriate age to start potty training so I started at 2. He seemed really easy to potty train at first going weeks dry and being a very good communicator. This continued till he was 5 having some weeks dry and some weeks spent desperately trying to salvage his good trousers but one day he just completely stopped having dry days. He'd go months and months without a single dry day till eventually I had to stop letting him wear underwear and switched to diapers only as he was destroying his clothes.

The whole thing has made him very anti-social and insecure. He went from a talkative, energetic 5 year old boy to now a very reclusive, emotional and unstable 9 year old boy. I dont know if he gets bullied or if the kids even notice, but I do know from teachers that he rarely speaks in school and has no apparent friends. 

I feel like I've done this to him. I was a med student during most of his upbringing so as you can imagine I didnt spend as much time with him as most parents do. I want him to feel normal. I want him to be happy but he cant. I'm so stressed I dont know what to do anymore. What am I supposed to do now",22Dec2020,1

95,"I honestly don't know how I should tell them. I know it sounds like a dumb idea to do it anyway, but I'll explain... by the way, I can't tell them irl because I don't know them irl, they're friends from a community.

So basically, in late June this year, I first came onto discord presenting as a male, so everyone knew me that way. I've never told anyone that I was a girl, and I made a lot of friends, however, I did tell 3 friends that I trusted that I was a transgender male, because at the time, I was really questioning my gender.

But now, I know that being trans isn't right for me. So I decided to not go with it. (I wasn't actually trans, I was just questioning, and I decided that I didn't want to go with it. I told my friends that I was trans because I felt like I would be lying somewhat if I didn't.)

But of course, this isn't about me being trans. I just want to tell everyone that I'm not a male... and I never really was anyway... and I can't just tell them like that because they're not going to trust me or even forgive me.

97,"There is a LOT more context that I could add to this post but honestly it isn't really necessary for the question I want to ask. I will say that I have been put through hell this month and have even less empathy with this situation than I may have at a different time. Also I'm 19(F). My room shares a wall with my father's unfortunately- this has been an issue several times before. Two nights ago, I woke up at around 9 PM (sleep schedule hasn't recovered from recently being admitted to the hospital) to him and his girlfriend having sex and definitely not making any effort whatsoever in being respectful about noise. I even heard him complain that I had woken up when I opened my door because I was very thirsty (sorry for existing lmao). I immediately got up and grabbed the keys to our truck. As soon as I had it started he came hauling out of the house to ask what I was doing. I told him that I didn't want to talk about it as I was very heated and just wanted to take a drive to cool off. I wasn't yelling, I wasn't snappy, I didn't say anything sarcastic, nor did I even tell him that is why I was upset. (As of now I assume my older brother, 30, decided it was his place to spill). I didn't speak to my dad all day yesterday because I was still annoyed. I just got angrier from being in a bad mood and got stuck in a rut of thinking about everything else that upset me in the past few weeks. I wasn't intentionally being petty, space is just how I regulate my emotions and I know he was going to bring it up but I wasn't ready to handle that conversation yet. I spoke to him a bit more today through text. Well, once dinner time he brought it up. He told me that he didn't know that I could hear (this really is bs, he knew he just didn't care). Then in a slightly sarcastic tone he said I wouldn't have to deal with it anymore because she broke up with him due to embarrassment. Though they have no problem freely talking about their private lives, in detail, on Facebook and in front of me when I directly asked both of them to tone it down. Like WTF man I don't want to know. He wishes that I would have handled it better but I really don't know what to say to that. I have been put into similar situations several times. Pretty much every time there is a woman in his life everyone else can go f themselves. I am only home for break so I don't think its too much to ask for some common decency. He has asked me to message her to explain that my reaction isn't directed specifically at her. I need advice as to what I even tell this woman. I originally thought I could just give a generic apology and be done with it as the rest is between them but I can't think of anything that won't be embarrassing and awkward for both parties involved.",22Dec2020,1
98,"Long story short, my (mid 20s F) step dad abused me when I was 12-16. I told my mom many times as a kid and an adult, but she never believed me. 

It was hard, but I came to accept that I had to deal with this on my own. When I turned 18 I moved out, got therapy, and I‚Äôm now finishing my master‚Äôs with a good job in a prestigious company. 

Two weeks ago my step dad confessed to the abuse. My mom kicked him out and started calling family to tell them what had happened.

My mom and I have had a couple conversations since, and while she has apologized multiple times for not believing me, every time she has thrown in ‚ÄúI would‚Äôve believed you if you‚Äôd told me exactly what happened/given more detail‚Äù. I pointed out that on several occasions I had tried to give her more detail about the abuse, and each time she had gotten upset and insisted ‚Äúthat didn‚Äôt happen‚Äù. 

When I reminded my mom that I had tried giving her more details, and that she hadn‚Äôt wanted to hear it, her response was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember that‚Äù.

It makes me mad, because after years of abuse and another decade of no one believing me, it seems like my mom is just trying to avoid accountability and tell me it‚Äôs MY fault she didn‚Äôt believe or protect me all that time. Part of me also suspects she only called around and told the family so she could control the narrative.

I have so much resentment and mistrust for my mother, especially for the way she has behaved now that she can no longer ‚Äúdisbelieve‚Äù the abuse. I let her know that until she can be accountable for her choices, we no longer have a relationship.

I have mentioned to one of my aunts that I am cutting off my mom, and she started telling me I need to forgive my mom, that it‚Äôs an ‚Äúimportant relationship.‚Äù

Here are my questions:

1. Am I in the wrong cutting off my mom?
2. Do you think my mom really didn‚Äôt believe me, or is it more likely she didn‚Äôt want to deal with it?
3. Do you think my mom really doesn‚Äôt remember the times I told her specific details of the abuse?
4. Does that reason even make sense? I couldn‚Äôt/didn‚Äôt believe you because you never told me EXACTLY what he did to you, explicit details of the abuse, etc.
5. Why is my aunt more interested in my forgiveness for my mom than she is in my mom‚Äôs accountability for her failures as a parent?

Usually I live a happy, healthy, stable, ambitious life - but these last 2 weeks have been full of sadness, resentment, and mistrust - I feel like I need to watch my back around my mom and try to anticipate her next 3 moves. This isn‚Äôt healthy! Thank you for any input you can offer.

I have ordered a package from the united states, and it is shipping home to Belgium through the Fedex network.

Now I have never in my life ordered anything from outside of Europe so I was wondering about Customs duties and taxes...

The item I ordered is an artbook and a pin from an artist/youtuber, it is not available anywhere else but his personal e-commerce, so it's exclusively available in the states. (that's why I had to order from the states :-) ) do I have to pay customs or taxes on it? And how on earth do i calculate an estimation? I can't seem to figure out the fedex calculator at all...

All i read on the internet is that international non-European shipments COULD have those charges, to make sure you aren't ordering items outside of the Eu for lower prices etc... But these items aren't available here...

108,"TW: Mentions of alcohol abuse and suicide

My dad died when I (23FTM) was 12. His two sisters, H(60sF) and T(60sf) stepped in to ‚Äòhelp out.‚Äô Their idea of helping out was telling pre-teen me to be strong for my mother, to step up, and to turn a blind eye to my mother‚Äôs increasing alcohol problem. I wasn‚Äôt even the oldest kid in the house, my older sister was 20 at the time but I‚Äôve always been the most level-headed in my immediate family.

When I was around 13-14 years old, I got sick and my mother refused to help me. I would be writhing on the floor, begging her to take me to the hospital. She‚Äôd stand over me and coldly tell me to find my own way there. I‚Äôd have to call my oldest sister who lived half an hour away to drive me five blocks to the hospital. Things got worse and my aunts had to step in to help me get the care and the surgery I needed. I appreciate them for that, and I thought I could trust them to help me more.

Throughout my teen years, starting at the age of 12, my mother would get drunk, antagonize me, throw me out into the street, and called all of our relatives to tell them how terrible I was. I did have some emotional struggles, and I found out last year that I am on the autism spectrum and I struggle with emotional regulation. My aunt H would have to drive 45 minutes to come to pick me up to stay over. We‚Äôd stay up late and I‚Äôd tell her how my mother was drinking and emotionally abusing me. One time, I practically begged her to stage an intervention for my mom. My dad had also been an addict and they did that for him, and he was clean for the last few years of his life. He‚Äôd done a complete 180 and became the best dad ever. I hoped they could do the same for my mom. But my aunt H told me that it wasn‚Äôt her business, that my mom‚Äôs siblings should be intervening. Since that conversation, two of my uncles have died of alcohol-induced cancers so that should illustrate how useless that side of my family is when it comes to fighting addiction. Things got so bad in my family, and only continued to get worse after my older sister committed suicide in our home. My aunts had little compassion for me and forced me to go back to school even though I wasn‚Äôt ready. I had witnessed my sister die and they only cared about my grades.

My aunt T and I aren‚Äôt as close as she lives 6+ hours away. I‚Äôve asked her for help here and there, I asked her to help me get therapy and she had her wife help me and never once checked in. Last year, her son (19m) was involved in a car accident where someone was killed. My cousin and the driver were both under the influence and it was my cousin‚Äôs car. The charges against my cousin have been dropped, but for me, this is the end of my relationship with him. He‚Äôs destroyed at least 3 brand new cars while intoxicated. He‚Äôs held his mother in a chokehold and threatened to kill her. And now he‚Äôs left a young child without a parent. I can‚Äôt be around him.

My aunt H moved a bit farther away a few years ago after retiring. I haven‚Äôt had a chance to visit her new place, as she‚Äôd only invited me twice for the holidays and both times it was canceled due to inclement weather. H recently tried to invite me for a visit, as my aunt T and cousin were visiting. She invited me two days before for a three-day visit. I told her I couldn't make it as I had an important doctor‚Äôs appointment I couldn't miss. She went off on me, telling me I was ‚Äúunambitious‚Äù and I should make the time for family. I tried to be polite and explain that I‚Äôd need more notice as I‚Äôm trying to get my health under control and I have a lot of appointments coming up. She told me that it was an impromptu visit and she couldn‚Äôt give me any more warning. So I responded that then she shouldn‚Äôt have expected me to drop everything and should have been more graceful about my declining. My aunts have bought used cars for each of my sisters and me, and H offered to help pay for car maintenance if I couldn‚Äôt. I took her up on that offer earlier this year and she begrudgingly helped me, and then threw it back in my face over this text conversation. She told me I shouldn‚Äôt ask for help if I don‚Äôt spend time with my family. I told her I usually do, but I HAVE to go to the doctor and can‚Äôt reschedule. She continued to go off on me until I blocked her number.

H tried to send me a Christmas gift, communicating through my mother who I unfortunately still live with. I told my mother to tell H I didn‚Äôt want anything. My mom refused and H bought something for me anyway. It‚Äôs an electronic gift card (unreturnable) and I‚Äôm going to buy clothes to donate.

My aunt T just sent me $200. I am completely broke, unemployed, and struggling. I REALLY don‚Äôt want to accept the money. She is incredibly rich and throws her money around when her son does horrible things but barely helps out her brother‚Äôs family. Not that I feel entitled to anything but I could‚Äôve used some more emotional support at least. I don‚Äôt want anything from them anymore, they‚Äôve thrown it back in my face and refused to help me in the more serious ways I‚Äôve needed it.

110,"About a year and a half ago I moved in with one of my best friends / former roomates from college (Both 25 F). They always had a tendency to stretch the truth when we were in school  but it was pretty easy to look past and I just ignored it, some people are just like that.  after a year from graduating we decided to live together, I had noticed it got worse but again, it was just an  annoying thing. Fast forward to now, At this point it‚Äôs so bad where they will go 2-3 hours of talking to me straight where not a single thing is true, the stories change a bit everyday, or she will contradict herself (an ex talking about how she‚Äôs been promoted 5 times since starting her job and then having a break down bc her coworker got a promotion and how she‚Äôs worked so hard at her company and hasn‚Äôt received one). At this point it‚Äôs extremely frustrating and really hard to be around. It was really annoying and Drove me crazy but it was harmless stuff.  For the most part they were just lies about her self and things she‚Äôs never done / a family history that doesn‚Äôt exist, but now she‚Äôs started saying some pretty harmful things about some of our friends/ people she works with/ etc that I unfortunately know are not true.

I love her with my whole heart still and I understand this is a mental health issue. Thankfully we have decided not to renew our lease for unrelated reasons so I won‚Äôt have to be around her so much. I hate that I feel relieved, but I‚Äôm still worried about her. It is something a lot of our friends have picked up on but we don‚Äôt really talk about it. I‚Äôve tried to subtly call her out on a lie before but she just gets defensive and keeps extending the story. I‚Äôm worried to leave her alone. It got so much worse in the span of the last year. I‚Äôm scared she will get herself into trouble. She‚Äôs a good person but I really don‚Äôt know how to help her.

112,"So I have realized that I am a pretty messed up guy(emotionally speaking) and because I have been thought to ""just walk it off"" I have always believed that I am pretty normal. In the sense that ""oh who doesn't get screamed at every day and being told that they are a mistake"" or my initial reaction to anything I do is "" I should be quiet because my existence is an inconvenience to other people"" I have believe those things to be true and the norm. It took me a few years to acknowledge these things aren't what everyone has experienced. 

That being said I have never connected with other people in the best way. Yes I have friends and people I have come close to with my tough guy persona. But I don't feel like myself with them. 

So I have realized that I get drawn to the wrong type of people because I feel that they can relate to the mess that is my emotional state. But most of them lack the togetherness that I have forced into my life. And being with them and that chaos feels like they are breaking down what I have been trying to hold together for all my life. 

While I feel good with the presence of people that can relate to me and give me a feeling of belonging I also feel like what I have been maintaining all my life being destroyed from the inside. I don't know how to deal with this cycle of wanting to find a place where I belong with people I can relate to but without the element of self destructive behaviour that they introduce into my life. 

So I am between feeling truly alone and isolated in this world or being in a place where I feel like every thing I have tried to maintain throughout my life being destroyed from the inside and the feeling that if I let go for even a second I will do something the will cause me to spiral down until I kill myself.

118,"I work for a large healthcare organization.
I have only been employed with the company for 1.5 years. When covid hit, our company did a round of layoffs; I was fortunate enough to keep my job. However, my position ‚Äúchanged‚Äù and I was tasked with taking over the job of someone that was let go..in addition to my current position. This person had been with the company the same amount of time as me but had been OOO for months prior to being let go so things were extremely backed up. I was thrown into things with two days of training and no help, under the premise it would only be temporary. Six months passed and I was told the job was permanent and SHOULD come with a title change/raise. This was told to me directly by three members in leadership roles, one of which is the director of the entire department. This person told me she emailed the guy above her for permission to give me the promotion and was essentially just waiting on his okay. Meanwhile, several other members of my team were given raises due to position changes, similar to my situation. I‚Äôve been awaiting this raise and have absolutely busted my butt all year to earn it. I was called last week by one of the department leaders and told my position would be changing but my pay would not. I am disappointed and frustrated. My workload has tripled since taking this change on. I don‚Äôt have coverage when absent and find myself working from home even on PTO days.

120,"28 and always been a hard worker. Earned employee of the year at my previous job, and all my previous employers would say positive things about me if anyone were to ask them. I'm a college student as well online with 20 weeks left until my Bachelor's. 

I got a job at a company and I liked it a lot at first. But I stayed relatively quiet, and didn't talk too much except for when I needed to be polite. I feel like this gave others the perception I was weak emotionally and there were multiple times I was disrespected and I just kept my calm and stayed quiet. 

For example, on a few occasions I was in the middle of doing something and a coworker would just cut me off and tell me to just let them do it even though I'm doing a perfectly reasonable good job. I've also overheard a manager call me dumb when talking to another person on the team and over all being treated as if I'm beneath most people there. Most other managers were a little more laid back and let me be more independent and that's when I feel the most comfortable. 

The second layer is when I first started, my manager had me on a pretty set schedule. Usually 3-12 or maybe 2-11.  I loved that because it made my school work easier to manage since there were no set times for my classes but it allowed me to create a routine to workout everyday, manage my school work, and work on my other hobbies as well. 

That boss got promoted to a different store and we got a new one. With this went the set schedule and to a much more varied schedule. Morning shifts, night shifts and it was random. We were understaffed since I started and by this point even more so. 

I was an 4.0 student and my grades went down to a C+/B in the 2 classes I was taking. 

Long story short I got burnt out. I tried to stick it out and I couldn't find that spark like in the beginning when I started this job. My schedule couldn't be fixed because we were so understaffed who would come in? I was stuck. I had dreams of moving up in the company and after noticing the perception of myself by the other people, I knew that wasn't happening either. I had little self esteem. 

Last week in the middle of my shift I just went to lunch and never returned. It's been a week and I've been applying for jobs but I am now starting to regret it just because it's been so hard to find something else. At first it was great having time to get done all the things I wanted to at home but now I am bored of being at home. I want to be useful to someone and help others. 

In terms of money I'm not stressing yet since I have like 6 months of expenses in savings should I need it.  The stress was bad though where I was getting lots of moments of anxiety, and developed a small eye twitch that I never had before and I haven't had since the day I quit.

121,"Should I do something about this? 

My ""friend"" is such a nasty person. She talks shit about everyone behind their backs and sometimes even to their faces. She has called girls sluts, skanks, whores, bitches, and many other names. I have been called a bitch by her to my face and when I told her I was not happy about that, she got mad at me and ignored me and told me how much of a bad friend I am. She has bumped a girl really hard in the shoulder and then called her a bitch to her face. She chases girls in the halls and threatens to hurt them. She has threatened to slit my throat because ""I don't listen"" or ""I don't talk to her enough."" She treatens to shoot up the school all the time and says she will only spare a few people(I am not one of the few people she will spare). She also has threatened to run over a girl with her car and sneak into her house and murder her. One girl moved to a new school because of her and another one had to switch classes due to the bullying. She always brags about she ""puts dumb bitches in their place"" and its disgusting how proud she is of herself. 

I have so much evidence of her doing illegal shit too that I can snitch on her about. She posts on her private snapchat story of her doing drugs all the time. I know that she has bought and sold drugs on campus. I know where she keeps her vapes. I know where she keeps her weed. She brings this shit TO SCHOOL. She has supplied alcohol and drugs to minors and can get in serious trouble for that (she's 18 btw). She smokes and drinks with people who are 16 and under. She also vapes on campus in the girls locker room. 

Me and these other girls that she has bullied have been nothing but nice to this bitch and this is what we get? Should I tell someone at my school about this?

124,"Hi everyone thanks for taking the time to read this any input is greatly appreciated! Sorry that my writing is messy and kinda all over the place. 
TLDR at the bottom 

I‚Äôm a 19 year old guy from a weird medium sized city on the edge of the Rockies. Ive lived here nearly my whole life and have only a few friends (family at this point) who I‚Äôve known for most of my life. 

I love this city a lot of the time. I work an amazing job doing something I love and working with people who are totally family at this point. I graduated from high school last year and with COVID decided to take a gap year. For 2 months this fall I spent everyday in the desert doing a wilderness course and loved it. Backpacking rafting all that good stuff.  Now I‚Äôm back home on the grind working and just doing what I‚Äôve been doing for the last few years.

I applied to and got into 2 schools. An awesome school up in BC in Canada, and a local school in my city. I‚Äôm extremely privileged to have grandparents who are going to pay my tuition so I‚Äôm in a great situation. 

I‚Äôm absolutely torn wether to stay in my hometown, or  go move 1100 miles away and start fresh, experience more. I‚Äôm a very adventurous and independent person, I live on my own and pay my rent, so under a lot of circumstances I would go to Canada without blinking. But it feels like I‚Äôm leaving so much behind and I am. 

My job is amazing, everyday I get to wake up and go do something I love. And I have made so many great connections through it. I‚Äôm very connected in the industry I work in and have the potential to make a lot of money because of this. It‚Äôs a small business and my boss who is also one of my best friends and mentor really relies on me.  

My two best friends (I love them to death) don‚Äôt have much drive, neither graduated high school and neither can hold down a job. A big Part of me feels like I‚Äôm leaving them behind, I‚Äôm always there to help them and try to keep them on track, and I‚Äôm scared they will do nothing with their lives if I go. 

The school in my hometown is just eh, it‚Äôs not an amazing school and there really isn‚Äôt much of a community. But I could go and get a solid education and a degree, while working here in my hometown. 

The school in Canada is pretty amazing. I know it well as my sister graduated from it and I got to visit. It checks a ton of my boxes and is in an absolutely amazing area. 

The last 5 years of my life have not been that easy. I‚Äôve struggled a lot with depression and anxiety. Now I‚Äôm at a point where I‚Äôm doing a lot better. I have many people around me who love me and rely on me, and I‚Äôm torn wether or not I should go.

I drive around my city aimlessly all the time. Part of me yearns for more, for a whole new set of people, a whole new place. Part of me is so tired of doing the same things everyday over and over and seeing the same faces and being stuck in the same patterns that hold me back. 

But the other part of me really wants to stay, stay near to the people who love me, the places I love to go to and the things I love to see. I could make something really good in this town, I could make plenty of money and help my friends get on the right track. But I‚Äôm scared, I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll stay and blink and 10 years will have flashed by and I‚Äôm 30 and boom my life‚Äôs basically over and I‚Äôve sat in the same damn town for all of it. 

It really feels like both options hold an equal amount of positives I‚Äôm totally conflicted and this decision has caused me a great deal of stress. Any advice or input is more thank welcome. 

TLDR:
19m should I stay in my hometown working the job I love with people I love while getting a degree from a mediocre school or should I go to school in Canada and satisfy my urge for adventure and change?

So should I stay in my hometown or spread my wings? What did you do and do you regret it?",22Dec2020,1

Since Christmas is coming up I wanna send him( the owner) a text like happy holiday  hope to see y'all soon at work üò¨ I don't know if this would be appropriate though. What if he doesn't wanna open again, he hasn't texted anyone not even the kitchen manager. Should I say something g or just wait for him to say something??",22Dec2020,1
140,"So yeah, he and I just got in a bad car accident. As he was exiting the freeway, he was going way too fast. Next thing, his car spun out of control, slammed into a barrier, and got totaled. We seriously could have died. Luckily, nobody else was involved, and we are blessed to be alive and uninjured.

He was immediately silent and shocked until we got out of the car, and for the first time in many years, he started crying his eyes out. Im pretty sure he saw his life flash before his eyes.

It was his first car, and I cant imagine how it feels to be in his shoes being that young and unexperienced. He loved that car, invested so much into it, and now its gone forever. He‚Äôs genuinely one of the best kids I know, and he doesn‚Äôt deserve to go through this at all. I really don‚Äôt wanna seem ungrateful for literally not dying, but still, I feel like this is seriously f‚Äôed up.

I would assume many others have gone through similar experiences, or know people that have. For me, the situation was still scarier than anything I could imagine, but I‚Äôll be fine. I just need any help on how to help him handle this, as an older brother and his best friend.",22Dec2020,1

The dude only really gets support from friends and family. Last week, he confided in me that he wished that someone other than his friends and family could support what he does. This is where the possible asshole part comes in: I've started creating burner youtube accounts and leaving comments on his videos.

143,"And once again I‚Äôm here in my grand father‚Äôs room where I‚Äôll just sit on a plastic chair with my left leg on my right, listening to Takayans‚Äô and fiddling my plastic ruler on a table, fantasizing on my past events and what my action would be if I were to lash out. It‚Äôs not easy to live with a double standard, self-importance and Mr. Perfect of a father, even said that he is still part of my family and the breadwinner of the family. If I could just find a way to shut him up completely and a way for him to change. People keep saying that ‚Äúif the person wouldn‚Äôt change then you have to change yourself‚Äù I wish it was that easy however they can‚Äôt apply this concept in my family. The reason is not only me is facing the problem of where my father is a complete lunatic and want nothing other than perfection in fact my mother or her own wife facing the same and worse issue.There is proof of this. For example, there was once where my mom wants to buy something for her mother or my grandmother for her upcoming birthday, here one more thing, she stops working so she could take care of me, because of that she went to my father for some dough.My father responds with‚Äù what‚Äôs the benefit of you getting her a gift?‚Äù when I hear this my heart shatters into million pieces. How could you ask what is the benefit of getting someone a gift, especially for her birthday? It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs gonna life forever, she can just die any time now. That‚Äôs not all, there was once wear my uncle or my moms younger brother ask if she could lend some money to cash in with his to buy a new washing machine and once again she went ask again to which she was given the same question‚Äù What‚Äôs the benefit of that?‚Äù. While telling this she was about to break down and cry, ‚ÄúI would always save some money to get her gift since going to university and would go as far as making myself starve‚Äù. Here‚Äôs the best part, whenever she used this as an excuse to him, he would give an excuse of saying ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you say so?‚Äù as if she didn‚Äôt ask of anything. So anytime my mother gets money from him she would always spend it on groceries and buying other necessary items to buy for me and my younger siblings. She rarely spends anything for herself. But there was one part where it really breaks my heart so bad I wish I had not existed in the first place‚Äù because of you two my dream died, you two killed my dream‚Äù.after hearing, I could feel someone just shot my guts off my body and the sharp guilt started growing from my guts to my chest, I could not feel any worse than that. My father, even though he invest money, energy, and time in us, all he ever wanted back was respect discipline, and perfect results. He didn‚Äôt care for my interest or my dream. He already killed two of my dream, one was a professional gamer and a novelist. Since I mention that, what is the definition of the phrase ‚Äúhave a dream‚Äù?. To me, it means doing something you loved and absolutely do anything for it. But my father doesn‚Äôt see that as a dream he sees it as ‚Äúa waste of time‚Äù,‚Äù lowest standard‚Äù,‚Äù likely to fail in life‚Äù and of course the one line where it hurts me the most was when he says‚Äù you are shit when it comes to gaming‚Äù and ‚Äúyou are shit in English‚Äù It‚Äôs not even over exaggerating, it's literally what came out of his toxic mouth.I sometimes wonder how does he even has friends in this day and age. My most logical answer was maybe he acts patiently and peacefully in front of his colleague and friends but he lets out his rage and wrath to us. In a way, you could say that we are his punching bag whenever he feels not satisfied with his coworkers or his own relatives and high possibilities, his own family member. At one point I feel like I want to just be gone like I was not there at all or even just die because this kind of abuse is like every day. I can‚Äôt even ask for anything without having an intense argument and mostly won by him even though he is at fault and didn‚Äôt care for what is the point when someone brings up his mistakes. For example, there was one time where he went out earlier in the evening to buy something, during that time I was in the kitchen discussing to buy myself a new phone that has bigger storage, a bigger battery, and a working camera once.He then called my mom to open the gate so he could park his car inside. My mom was busy at the moment so she asked me to open it instead. I did but I forgot to move the clothes hanger, where my mom usually dries the washed clothes at, when my father came, no he did not hit it, he called again and ask me to move it. He then, as usual, scolds me‚Äù You‚Äôre stupid is it, can‚Äôt you see there is something in the way, how could you be so stupid and blind, Idiot!‚Äù.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt notice it.‚Äù I replied with an apologetic and relaxed tone. My father however continues with his pissed-off tone, ‚Äùhow could you not noticed that big of a thing that you didn‚Äôt realize there was something in the way, stupid, idiot*, bodoh, mangkuk,* retard‚Äù. maybe it was necessary to question how did I missed that but in the end was too much. My blood started to boil and I respond with the one time where he forgot my age and my year of birth. ‚ÄúOh, please it is not bad compared to you who don‚Äôt even remember your own son‚Äôs form(grade) and his first two numbers of his IC(identification card).‚ÄùI said confidently. But I should know better than he is a wall and doesn‚Äôt take anything to his cold ice of a heart. ‚ÄùSo?‚Äù

He replied and giving that one look where it says ‚Äùnow what you‚Äôre gonna do?‚Äù. The only reason that I brought up this so that he can see the point where everyone makes mistake. But of course, he didn‚Äôt take this as a point, instead, he took this as an insult(as expected) and throw one of my darkest past. In the past where I was a ‚Äúthief and got kicked out of school for that‚Äù. Of course, I can‚Äôt fight back. There was once I actually won an argument but did not feel satisfied with it. There was one time where we were chatting in the dining room. Fun fact it was only me and my mom talking but my father‚Äôs not talking to me but to my mom. Then my father brought up a topic where whenever I ate chocolates or sweets, I would bury them in nooks and cranny around the room. To which I respond with ‚ÄúOh please, you‚Äôre much worse than me when you just let your disposable mask everywhere in not only in the room but even behind the storeroom door next to the staircase. Seriously it is disgusting, you are meant to throw them after use.‚Äù To which he responds with, ‚ÄúYeah, so what?‚Äù without a sense of shame. My mom snickered when she hears his response which literally accepts that he is filth no different than me.

147,"I(24f) was with my ex(26f) for about a year and a half. We met in my city and spent several months together here before she returned to her home country. Her leaving was unexpected to me. She had intended to stay here, but after probably just over 2 months of dating, she told me she was leaving the country in 2 weeks. Circumstances had changed for her. I was really enjoying our growing relationship and was pretty devastated. We planned to end things when she left, but we ended up messaging each other all the time and continuing the relationship. We would facetime for hours a lot of nights. We made plans for me to visit her in her home country 4 months after she had left my city, but then the pandemic hit, borders closed, and we had to cancel. We continued our relationship for the next six months until borders opened agaian and we planned for me to come see her. So this past September, I took the long haul flight to go visit her. I had already been learning her language since before the first planned trip and I‚Äôd gotten pretty good. I spent 2 months with her, absorbing her culture. I learned about so much new music I loved, ate lots of delicious new food, bought lots of clothes, and got along great with all of her friends. Things were not perfect between us by any means. I had already felt throughout our relationship that she wasn‚Äôt as committed to me as I was to her. Despite saying she was in love with me and wanted a future with me, she had told me twice between the first trip we planned and when I actually visited her that she didn‚Äôt know if she wanted to be in a relationship. The first time she said it was because her depression was out of hand and she didn‚Äôt feel good about anything including me. The second time was during my break from school. She was working full time and said she hated seeing me have fun with my friends while she‚Äôs still working. Even though my break lasted only a couple weeks, she said she was reconsidering our relationship. I was really torn up while she decided because I was so in love with her, I was sure I wanted to continue. After the second time, I felt really insecure. I felt she wasn‚Äôt as into me as I was into her and that she would easily leave me. When I expresses this to her, she said it‚Äôs all in my head and I need to work on my insecurity. That she wanted a future with me and we‚Äôre in the together.   



  When I arrived in Brazil, it was great for the first few days, but then she became really cold towards me. The way she spoke to me was either just dry or really rude. I knew she was stressed with her job, so I tried to just keep my head down, but I felt that I had flown across the world for someone who wasn‚Äôt happy to see me. Throughout our relationship, the way she talked to me was always a bit of an issue. I was always gentle with her while she was insensitive and accusatory towards me. She‚Äôs acknowledged it and it had gotten better, but once we were together, it got so much worse. When we were with her friends, she acted better, and sometimes she would be affectionate, but mostly she was cold. I finally had enough and brought it up after she said some really nasty things to me. She apologized profusely and said she needed to quit her job, it was killing her. After she quit her job, things improved a lot, but she was still very moody. She doesn‚Äôt handle stress well and any little thing that went wrong would ruin her day and she would ice me out. I‚Äôm stupid, so I still wanted to make things work. I loved her. Despite the bad parts of her personality, there is a lot of good things that I was attached to. And we did have a lot of good times. One night, we stayed up all night talking about our lives. She told me she wanted a timeline of my life because from the snippets I had told her before, she knew my life had been crazy. I have had a very traumatic and turbulent life, while hers has been pretty calm and simple. After telling her my history which includes a lot of abuse and parental abandonment, she told me I‚Äôm hers now and asked if it feels good to belong to someone. It did feel good, but I wondered if she was genuinely ready to commit to me. Later I told her I was still worried about her commitment and she said she is totally committed to me. That me meeting all her friends and her facetiming with my best friend and grandmother are symbols of commitment. I felt reassured. 


  
 We seemed to leave on a good note. We were planning for me to come back in a few months. She seemed excited about it. We discussed it a lot. Then 2 weeks after I had left, we got in a small, stupid argument. During it, she blurted out ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be in this relationship anymore‚Äù. I was like really??? She said maybe she said that out of anger, but we talked more and she said she doesn‚Äôt have energy for this relationship anymore and that she wasn‚Äôt in love with me. I felt heartbroken. First I begged and then I said something really nasty that I regret. She blocked me on everything for a week. After a week, she reached out and said she hopes I heal. I said I have questions and started to ask her what happened, why things happened. At first she wouldn‚Äôt answer, but then she did. Everything she said was just kind of flaky bullshit, avoiding any kind of responsibility. I saw that talking to her just made things worse. I feel like I never knew her and she never understood or cared to know me.


  
So now I have all these things from her country, all this new music I like, and a whole new language and I can‚Äôt enjoy any of it. I feel stupid that the Christmas gifts I got people are from there. I feel like an idiot who travelled across the world for someone who clearly wasn‚Äôt that into me. Even though she talked big, her behaviour screamed that I wasn‚Äôt important to her. I feel depressed, dumb, and angry. Idk where to go from here.",22Dec2020,1
148,"My boyfriend asked me a couple months back if I could babysit his little cousins while his mom went to the hospital, but recently I realized I can't. The deal was that I'd get to bring my dogs so that they wouldn't have to be alone constantly, but it turns out their dogs aren't friendly towards mine. I feel horrible because I don't want to back out, but they don't want me driving the kids anywhere, so visiting my place to let my dogs out and feed them isn't an option. What should I do?

I told my boyfriend, and he understands because he agrees that their dogs would most likely end up hurting ours, but I don‚Äôt think his mom will agree. I feel pressure to try and make it work because if I don't she won't go to the hospital like she has to and it will harm her relationship with us. I just can't put my animals at risk.

There's other reasons too, one of the kids has violent tendencies (I don't want to get into that because it's their business), and I am honestly afraid because I'm rather small. All together-- I just realized I'm not fit for this job, but I'm scared to back out. What should I do? Should I make it work? If I don't will it make me a bad person?",22Dec2020,1
149,"Hey there. I need advice because these times have been a little though for me. As a highschool student, I have all of this free time and don't quite know what to do with it. My way of doing things is similar to that 'workaholic' trait which is not good because now that i don't have any assingnments to focus on, i start to get all antsy and overall just in a bad mood and i hate to take it out on my family members.

I don't really like to watch tv or anything like that unless i'm doing something else as well, like folding laundry, otherwise, and please do not hate me for this, i start to feel bad about 'wasting my time' watching it, because i'm not actually getting anything from it, you know? For example, if i fold my laundry while I watch something, i get to watch the show and i also have folded clothes. But, when I only watch the show without doing anything else, by the time i'm done, i don't have any tangible 'proof' that i was productive.

The reason i'm posting this is to see if you guys have any reccomendations of different activities I can do to keep myself busy.

151,"My gf‚Äôs mental health is getting worse every day. Progressively. I don‚Äôt even know the cause of it, neither does she. Every day she gets into a fight with me which gets her at first very mad to the point where she yells her lungs out at me, and then after she is crying uncontrollably with nothing being able to stop her. We both are 17, so most of it is happening late at night on FaceTime. I stay up till 1 am every day to go through the same cycle again and again. It ranges from her telling me she will kill herself because she can‚Äôt do it anymore, to her yelling at me that I am ruining her life, to her crying apologizing. At this point I tried everything, fight back, calm her down, ignore her. Nothing works. Nothing calms her down and makes me feel like shit. 

Her parents don‚Äôt believe in psychologists (they think it‚Äôs too expensive and you can‚Äôt really see clear results which makes them question if it‚Äôs worth it) and obviously don‚Äôt believe in any sort of pills. I myself have money but can‚Äôt afford a therapist for her. So I came up with an idea to buy over the counter mood supplements (I guess it‚Äôs vitamins). I read about it online and it seemed to help a lot of people, and it‚Äôs not some random stuff, it‚Äôs sold at Walmart and such. It doesn‚Äôt say the age limit, so when I told her about it she got excited and agreed to get it. In my theory either it‚Äôs going to work, or it will work as a placebo and she will feel her mood get better just by having a positive mindset.

So I came to Walmart, grabbed the pills and went to self checkout. *bleep* Store clerk comes up and asks for an ID. Apparently in California you can‚Äôt buy any kind of supplements under 18. I get turned around and go back to put it on the shelf. My girlfriend is waiting in the car, if I tell her that I couldn‚Äôt buy it, she‚Äôd be devastated. I gave her hope, a hope that everything will get better. I couldn‚Äôt take it away. At moment I couldn‚Äôt do it. I couldn‚Äôt stay up till 1-2 am another night. I have to babysit every day, I can‚Äôt allow myself keep being exhausted. So I just went the isle without the cameras, put the vitamins in my pocket and went to the exit hoping nobody will stop me. Nobody did. I don‚Äôt look like someone who‚Äôd steal something. I am dressed nicely, I don‚Äôt wear baggy clothes, I wear a nice watch, have a good haircut. I‚Äôm not the type of person to steal. But this time I did.

I came to the car and gave her the pills. Inside this situation is bothering me, I can‚Äôt get over it. I know I won‚Äôt be caught, and 10$ damage won‚Äôt do anything to Walmart, but just the principle of stealing is crushing me. Today I betrayed my integrity and my honor. I‚Äôm devastated",22Dec2020,1

153,"I‚Äôve (F24) been working at this salon for 2 years and it‚Äôs just getting harder to get out of bed everyday.  I struggle with major anxiety and depression in general and I‚Äôve been feeling like this job is just making me feel even worse because of everything I have to deal with on the job and I almost quit multiple times but because of COVID I never did out of fear. 

My boss is the main issue; if you need to call out even for an emergency you will get shouted at and guilted. I had a family member pass about 6 months ago and I had to call out which I was mortified to do. When I told my boss I needed off and that someone passed she started shouting/guilting me saying how irresponsible I am, how I could do this to her, and how it‚Äôs not my responsibility to help with the funeral totally ignoring my loss. Even in regular daily shifts there will be random shots taken at all the girls about how we don‚Äôt clean or how we aren‚Äôt working like we should etc. and it‚Äôs just depressing... I also had a health scare last weekend, I fainted twice in a row (I think it was stress induced) and I asked my boss if I could have off the next day because I didn‚Äôt feel right physically and I was scared I would faint again and since it was so slow I didn‚Äôt think it would be an issue but she flipped out again and guilted me. 

There was a meeting with the district manager where the employees were to state their concerns for COVID and what we need to do to stay safe in the salon. When I stated all of my concerns she told the whole group if we feel that unsafe to not work... and to me that meant if you don‚Äôt feel safe quit... that‚Äôs not an option for people right now. My regular schedule was cut in half because of Covid and I‚Äôm still on unemployment... 

Another issue is that my boss isn‚Äôt buying enough disinfectant to clean our hair stations in between clients and she is opening an additional chair that isn‚Äôt abiding by the 6ft social distancing rule. Whenever I have to work at one of the stations that isn‚Äôt properly distanced my clients state that they are uncomfortable, I am too, but on those days all the other stations are filled and I have no choice but to stay at that station. It scares me that I can‚Äôt keep myself safe at work and I‚Äôm constantly stressing about unknowingly catching COVID and bringing it home to my mom who is high risk... 

And don‚Äôt forget about the rude clients that I have to worry about constantly if they‚Äôre going to scream at me about their blowout (this happens to all the girls on a regular basis). The salon is in a very wealthy area and that‚Äôs the clientele unfortunately. I was once told that I was the worst hair dresser that a woman came in contact with even though I styled her hair exactly how she wanted it... and the pay to me isn‚Äôt worth it especially with the small amount of hours I‚Äôm working it‚Äôs just about paying my gas and parking... 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth sticking around to get through Covid or finding another job where I‚Äôm not in constant panic about what I‚Äôll be shouted at about, guilted for next, or worried about not cleaning and spreading Covid. I just got my nails done for Christmas, and now I might have to remove them because our new clock in machine wants a finger print and false nails (even shorter ones) won‚Äôt fit in the little area for your finger so now I might have throw out money. Our old machine (there was nothing wrong with it) you could have 5 inch nails and you would still be able to clock in so this random change is irritating to say the least because I love doing my nails even myself at home and now I think my boss is saying they need to be removed fully even though that‚Äôs not in the job description/rules whatever it is... My depression has been through the roof lately and I‚Äôm having horrible thoughts and this situation with work isn‚Äôt helping, I‚Äôve been having panic attacks and now fainting apparently because of how stressed I am. I feel ridiculous but I‚Äôm really at the end of my rope... I just need something to give",22Dec2020,1

155,"I have an old friend from college fraternity days, who I am friends with on facebook. Over the last month he has been posting some pretty crazy things about how the US government is out to get him, keeping him from getting a job, and threatening to kill his family back in his home country.

I remember in college he had some sort of breakdown and had to drop out - leading up he was acting very strange and paranoid about people watching him. His roommate had to move out because he started behaving very irradicably. Finally someone got ahold of his family I believe, and he was able to get some help. He ended up finishing college a little later and has seemed fine other than his wild Trump conspiracies that a lot of the country seems to be suffering under.

I tried to find his brother on facebook - or any family - but had no luck. I reached out and told him I was concerned and that maybe he should try talking with a counselor virtually. This was after he shared a story about a guy flying his plane into an IRS building and he said it was interesting that everyone in the comments was calling the guy a hero. Obviously this was very alarming, and I don't want to stand by and watch something terrible happen.

I am deemed an essential employee since I am technically a part of the food service industry, as well as a part of my work‚Äôs skeleton crew that is responsible for tasks that can only be done in person rather than remotely. I have been going to work this entire year and doing my part to best protect myself, my fellow essential employees, and my family. 

I am the immediate and only backup for my coworker, Joan. Joan was abruptly sent home this morning and I was told to go cover for her at her desk for the day. I was told that she was going to be tested for covid out of an ‚Äúabundance of caution‚Äù because she‚Äôd had a scratchy throat over the weekend, but it would probably come back negative. Okay, cool, I can cover for her today. 

I‚Äôm wrapping up my day and I still haven‚Äôt heard anything on Joan‚Äôs test results. I had to run back to my own desk to put some paperwork away and my boss stopped me in the hallway. She said, ‚Äúso Joan is going to be out for 2 weeks, do you think you can cover for her for that time?‚Äù No further information. So I asked, ‚ÄúDid she test positive?‚Äù And my boss reluctantly said yes.

Not only was I sitting at her non-disinfected desk all day (I did wipe it down with a Clorox wipe but nothing crazy), there are two other employees that work in the same space as her daily and as far as I know, were not told that she tested positive. 

I was told I could get a rapid test on my own time if it gave me ‚Äúpeace of mind‚Äù but I was still expected to be in the office tomorrow. Shouldn‚Äôt management be telling me and any other employees that came into extended contact with Joan to stay home and get tested ASAP? I have a few coworkers that are in their sixties and seventies, and I refuse to put them at risk. I have coworkers with kids, with elderly parents, with chronic health issues. It just doesn‚Äôt seem right. 

I just sent an email to my boss explaining that I will not be coming into work until I get a negative test result. I have a work laptop and will happily assist from home until then.

I‚Äôm going to miss Christmas with my family in order to keep them safe. I sure as heck can miss a week of work to make sure my coworkers stay safe. 

Has anyone dealt with shady covid protocol at their workplaces? How have you handled it? Is this something I should report? This isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened.

163," 

so I'm 30 and frankly, am very good at creative writing and have been doing so for over 10 years.

i don't have a college degree, but want to make some money doing this. I tried Upwork and there's so much competition and is incredibly difficult to get hired for anything, and tried facebook groups which has yielded no positive results.

Is there anything you could recommend, any websites, facebook groups, links or websites, names etc where I could get money for my creative writing?

I can do ghostwriting, editing, revising etc at a very high level.",22Dec2020,1
164,"Okay so, I think I pulled a ‚Äúno call no show‚Äùtoday. I‚Äôm afraid to call. I‚Äôm afraid of the stand in boss (real boss is out on personal, calling the stand in boss ‚ÄúFB‚Äù as fake boss) as he‚Äôs hot headed and very scream-y. I‚Äôve got my coworkers numbers so I could ask them, but it‚Äôs already late and my anxiety is getting to me. Worst case is I‚Äôm fired, at this point I‚Äôd be relieved. With the snow there‚Äôs nothing they could have me do due to my lack of training on the heavy equipment. I‚Äôd be running around waiting on FB hand and foot.

More background: When I‚Äôm there I‚Äôm pretty much a trained monkey. I‚Äôm a yes man that bends over backwards for people. All the co workers joke that I‚Äôm the bosses and FBs ‚Äúbitch‚Äù, which I believe I am. I‚Äôm always the first asked to do anything, even when I‚Äôm busy doing something else or helping someone. When FB is sent to go do something I‚Äôm told by him to get him what he needs or to go with him to help. I‚Äôm expected to bust my ass and help. Due to my anxiety, willingness to help, and general inability to cope with things, I‚Äôm unable to do anything but help. I‚Äôve become more afraid of him, as he‚Äôs brought me to tears. Coworkers tell stories of how batshit crazy he is. That if he yells again at me, to tell them. He‚Äôs known for using people to get what he wants. One of our coworkers actively tries to make me feel like an equal even beyond the others, it feels like a really dysfunctional family. I‚Äôm the youngest at 20, all the other guys are 40+.


I‚Äôm a ‚Äúsummer help sub‚Äù in this place but they let me stay through the fall into the winter. As I wasn‚Äôt going back to school with the plague going around. Due to my technical end of time I‚Äôm able to work, but I‚Äôm also in a ‚Äúon call‚Äù kind of situation (I don‚Äôt fully understand it the real boss said I couldn‚Äôt work normally anymore, due to something with the high ups) The FB asked me to come in all week (which I kind of shouldn‚Äôt be able to do) I said I could come in Wednesday‚Äôs. FB asked for more commitment than that, which I understand but when boss and FB tote around that I can‚Äôt work after that week, but then FB immediately asked me to stay another week. No I wanna be done let me leave I‚Äôm so tired. That was last week. Now It‚Äôs Monday, and I didn‚Äôt receive any sort of call or message. I feel as though a coworker would‚Äôve at least checked on me. I think I pulled a no call no show.

I‚Äôm not the type of guy to confront ANYTHING. My anxiety prevents me from doing a lot of things. Especially if the fear is grounded in very realistic situations. I‚Äôm afraid of the person that is my superior. I shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to go to work. 

I only worked there past the summer cause of the plague, it wasn‚Äôt worth going back to college since I‚Äôm bad at online school. I guess what I‚Äôm looking for is advice, on anything. Anything please.",22Dec2020,1
165,"Hey, everyone. First and foremost, I apologize for a sad post here and ask you all to give me your best advice and what you would do in my situation even though both options are... less than ideal.

My brother molested me when I was in my preteens for about a year or two (my memory of the events is so foggy, so forgive me for muddled dates and details). Eventually I stopped the abuse by threatening him if he tried anything again that I would tell our parents who would and always will side with me if they knew. After everything stopped, I sort of stopped thinking about it and tried my best to move on with my life. For a long while, I barely thought of it at all. 

Now a bit of backstory: my brother and I have been best friends since I was born (we have a 4 year age gap), and I‚Äôve always treasured time spent with him. We grew up playing video games, cooking, gossiping, just everything together. At some points he resembled a best friend more than an older sibling. Even after and during the abuse I still spent time with him constantly. Basically, I swept everything under the rug and just pretended it hadn‚Äôt happened, and my brother never once mentioned the abuse to me. After the abuse, I was quick to criticize and blame him for anything from my parents relationship problems to him being laid off a job, but that was the only sign I gave that I still remember and I still feel angry.

Recently, I‚Äôve been feeling the strain of other issues he has and have started therapy in which my therapist is very focused on the abuse. All of these things led to me stopping talking to him completely. The thing is... I miss him so badly. Whenever I visit home we used to make food, drink bourbon and play video games all night. The simple joy of these nights mean everything to me and I want nothing more than to forget everything and get my best friend back. Adding onto this, my parents who have no idea about the abuse and who I REFUSE to ever tell have been pushing me to start speaking with him again and can‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm so troubled. Cutting him off would mean either a) I must explain to my parents why or b) I spend the rest of my life struggling to justify why I‚Äôm so upset

I just don‚Äôt know how I can win here. Either I stand up for myself and cut him off, completely alienating myself from my family or I just bury everything down again and spend the rest of my life trying to repress the abuse again. I‚Äôm just so angry still, but more so, I‚Äôm exhausted by holding the abuse against him all the time. I know I can live happily never telling anyone the truth and allowing my brother to enter my life again, but I almost wish I could just spill my guts and get him disowned and away from me forever. Please give me any advice you have. I‚Äôm so stuck right now and I have no one who will ever understand because I can‚Äôt tell them. 

Some details that I didn‚Äôt know how to fit in:

He was never violent with the abuse, instead bribing me with money and gifts of telling me ‚Äúall siblings do this, be a good sister etc.‚Äù 

I won‚Äôt accept an advice that relates to exposing or revealing the abuse. I cannot break my parents hearts like that

I have some very saddening and long withstanding habits, anxiety, and problems from the abuse.

My brother sucks for other reasons than this, but even though the bad outweighs the good, I have some of my happiest memories with him. 

TLDR: my older brother abused me but he has always been my best friend since before and after the abuse. I can‚Äôt decide if I should forgive him or not",22Dec2020,1

167,"So I had a very weird conversation with my boss HR (executive). I am wondering what to do. I work in a tech start up that is currently ramping up staffing to a goal of 700 employees pretty quickly we are currently just under 100. I started a bit over a year ago. She told me in todays conversation that someone from a very different department would be joining our department not directly working above me but I know his salary(much higher than mine) and would have a lot more authority and direction in terms of company HR processes. It kind of sucks because there reason for bring him over is his degrees which I actually have the same degrees...It was also revealed to me that he applied for my job but they didn‚Äôt hire him for it because he wasn‚Äôt qualified for my job. 

Now to be frank I think he‚Äôs getting this job because he is a man in his 30s and although had less experience than me is seen as more of expert. Which sucks... I am a woman in my early 20s and thats just how the cookie crumbles and although my work place has problems I am not going to let that deter me from using it to grow my career. 

This was told to me in a very diplomatic way and asked my general opinion and I said I was a bit confused but thought we did need what he was being tasked with. I was then told there would be a manager version of my position and I should decide what direction I want to move my career. 

I am in recruiting specifically and next week I predict will be the best week I have ever had in terms of candidates identified and offers accepted. What am I supposed to do now? Do they want me to demand the manager role? I am very confused.

179,"For background, there is a little boy (probably around 4) and his mother who live in the apartment above me. I haven‚Äôt ever spoken to them much, mostly only waved and said hi to the kid who is very cute and really likes watching our dogs.

Tonight I heard the mother talking on the phone from their balcony to someone who I believe was the boy‚Äôs father. And when I say heated, I mean I could hear it with all the doors and windows closed and the dogs were distressed and whimpering. I was tempted and couldn‚Äôt help myself, so I listened closer.

And from what I heard I am concerned that the boy‚Äôs father may be abusive. The mother was yelling about how she has to force her son to go see him and he always is throwing books and toys at her and saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to. Daddy hurt me. Daddy hit me.‚Äù 

And I can now hear the kid upstairs running around and crying from the sounds of it.

So basically I‚Äôm not sure what if anything I should do with this information. On one hand, this is very unreliable information. It‚Äôs from snippets I heard third hand when I was really just being nosy and potentially from an unreliable source. I don‚Äôt know that what I heard is enough to be considered worth an investigation. And I would hope that the mother will do something about it if this is actually what she is hearing from her son.

But on the other hand, I would feel horrible about potentially leaving a child in an abusive situation because I didn‚Äôt act. I don‚Äôt know why a kid would lie about something like that. And I‚Äôm concerned that the mother could have too much baggage/fear in her situation to act.

Hi, I just need advice from people who may know more on this subject than I. First of all, I'm a 23 male turning 24 in April but since I took a gap year and 1 major change later I'm finally entering my final semester of college in January. Previously however, I had been living in dorms but since COVID struck I was forced to move back home with my parents over the year.   


Instead of moving back into the dorms to attend school this fall I had decided with my best friends to get an apartment on the 24th of August. Now, I know you can be claimed as a dependent if your parents are paying for more than 50% of your living costs throughout the year. However, due to my age my parents didn't get any extra money on the last check for me nor did I get any as I was claimed as a dependent on their 2020 tax return(2019-2020). So would it be wise for me to just try and get the next round of stimulus checks (as in the $600) and maybe talk to my parents about not claiming me as a dependent on their upcoming taxes? Cause that alone would also allow me to put on my taxes the fact I didn't receive the $1200 on the first round and should give me a large chunk of the money I've been making to pay bills back.

190,"On mobile,  apologies for any misspelling or errors.

Just for a bit of background,  I have lived with a major anxiety disorder for a good number of years. I am prone to panic attacks and getting easily overwhelmed,  especially in very social situations. Knowing what I want to do with my life has never come easy to me and I haven't enrolled in college due to this reason, as I don't want to spend years of my life ans substantial money for something I'm not sure about. I don't want college,  if or when I go, to just be a ""something to do"". I love the arts, but don't know if that could be a career. Lately I've been having a tough time trying to be meaningful and not waste my life on nothing. I never seem to feel as if I'm accomplishing anything. 

___

I moved out of my parent's house a few months ago to a different state to live with my boyfriend of nearly 2 years while he is in college. He life late in the summer, and I followed in September. He (and now I) are living with his great aunt and her twin daughters who own the house, which isn't far from his school. Really my reason for moving was him and the feeling of needing a change. 

Before that I worked at a small frozen yogurt shop owned by people I knew and it was enjoyable,  but I felt every day came and went with no steps forward; I felt as if I was stagnating and I didn't want to be stuck in a tiny town at a froyo shop forever. I missed him, I was worried about him, and I was feeling severe separation anxiety. He was doing alright in school but felt empty without me there like it had been before. So I packed up and left my family, his family (who I've become very close with) and my cats. It was hard to do but I couldn't feel at home without the biggest part of my life. My house felt like a cage and I felt useless just working and sleeping. 

It was all fine when I got there, both sides supported me and it went smoothly. The plan was to find a job, save up, and maybe rent an apartment near by. 

The big problem ended up being the job situation for me. The twin girls work at a pizza place part time, and so does my boyfriend and his brother. I figured I couldn't work there due to management not wanting too many personal connections. I felt a bit at loss. 

Working in food service alhas never suited me outside of my yogurt shop job, which was a special situation that can't really be found outside of a tiny town. I get very anxious and uncomfortable trying to work in a fast paced environment with strangers and trying with everything I have to keep a friendly face and not break down right there. I tried two, quit on the second day before i even got to work. I didn't sleep and spent the next morning crying and hyperventilating on the floor due to dread. It wasn't going to work, so I didn't have a lot to due during the day and couldn't pay rent. I felt like a sponge. 

Now recently we flew back to out hometown to see everyone for Christmas. I was overjoyed to see everyone and we were all back together again,  but I know it won't last. I'll miss his 3yr old sister dearly and I don't want to leave her again, but I can't stay here again without him, it'd be the same as before I left. It only feels like home when I have him and all my family around me and I can't be in two places at once. He needs my support greatly and I need his, but I also sorely miss my best friend and our families. I am at a loss at to what to do about this conflicting feeling of home. I don't have a place where I feel at home except when we're all together, and it's eating away at me. I feel great urges to cry whenever I remember this feeling of home I have with everyone is only for a couple weeks. He has a similar feeling and can't offer much help besides just listening to me. 

Is there anything I can do to help this feeling and get myself going in this world?",22Dec2020,1
191,"(Please be aware this is slightly incoherent, my brain works strangely)

Ok so my gf (F24) and I (M23) have been dating for almost 2 years now. We don‚Äôt live together but we have had preliminary talks about that being something both of us want(I just recently out of college and got a job while she lives and works about an hour away from me). We get a long great, and I really feel we are great teammates and work together well to find solutions and love eachother. 

Lately she‚Äôs becoming frequently more distant and short with me despite my best efforts to be there for her, listen to her and try to get us to have fun together. I asked her if it‚Äôs cool if I come stay for a couple days with her and I‚Äôd just make the commute to my work, and she just said ‚Äúoh you don‚Äôt have to‚Äù when normally it would be more of a positive reaction and an ‚Äúof course!!‚Äù. Still I don‚Äôt want to get in my head too much and make assumptions about how my presence makes when it could be for a number of reasons.

I walk into her apartment and she is sitting in the living room (basically right in front of the door) talking to her friend from college on FaceTime. I catch the tail end of her friend saying something along the lines of my gf is thinking of breaking up. I didn‚Äôt and haven‚Äôt said anything about it to my girlfriend or any one yet.

This is a real gut punch. I do love this girl with my whole heart but it‚Äôs also not simple either. As much as I think we are compatible as a couple we do not have many similar long term goals. She wants to move around/doesn‚Äôt want kids and I want to stay in the area I‚Äôm in and I‚Äôve always dreamed of being a dad someday.

When it comes down to it I‚Äôm just wondering what I should do. I‚Äôm torn between trying to making it work with someone I‚Äôve come to really love and appreciate, or just rip off the band aid, since our life plans seem to be on different directions. Like I said, we are great teammates and I believe that we can find a solution to most of our problems by talking it through but I feel like this is something innate to ourselves as individuals, which makes it less likely to find a solution in my eyes.

195,"I have a growing aversion to parsing through large amounts of useless information. I try to limit my interactions with social media and other content farms because I find them too noisy However, I do like having friends, and in the modern world, that means I must have some presence online. 

The problem is that my friends like memes. These are, in my opinion, the worst of ""spam information"". The vast majority are low effort, overused formats with a punchline of merely recognizing a reference. I understand that people exchange them as an indirect way of saying ""hey, I'm thinking of you"" or ""laughing at the same thing brings us closer together"". But I still see these images and videos as well-intentioned, but dull little pieces of information that take up mental space and energy when people send them to me.

Its become extremely frustrating to interact with my people because if I want to talk to someone, I want to actually talk, not weed through memes. I've discussed this issue with them before, but over the past year a lot of my friendships have faded because I can no longer find the motivation to send/reply to memes.   

How do I go about maintaining friendships if the memes I dislike so much are an integral part of contemporary culture? I don't expect to get rid of them from my life entirely, but I don't want to deal with them as often as friends expect me to.",22Dec2020,1

Basically, I am single and I like women's butts. There's of course more to women: personality, confidence, kindness,etc. But there's nothing more attractive to me than a nice butt. Porn of course is the current solution (I am aware that porn does not reflect real life) but I want to actually do it some day.

It is to my understanding that girls are more likely to not do butt stuff than do. Don't worry: I'm not the kind of person to force is upon someone or slip it in there without permission. I've heard from friends that when you're together long enough, their girlfriends became more susceptible to trying things; anal was one of them. But there's no guarantee and I don't want to make a girl do anything she's not comfortable doing.

234,"I'm pathetic as fuck for posting this because it shouldn't matter but anywayy

So I met this girl or woman I guess on meetme by popping on her live one day. We just make small talk and she says she really likes me even though she doesn't usually like girls and to message her. I message her hi and she asks for my socials. I give them to her and we send each other a snap each and go to bed. A few days later I'm on her live again talking in the comments, whatever,  nothing unusual until the live ends and I go to bed. Few days pass and I send her a video of me petting my dog on snap. I think I just said hi on meetme too. Thats it. I get on meetme last night and she's blocked me on everything. She blocked me on all of the socials she asked for. I only knew this girl a week maybe and hardly spoke to her outside of live. I only sent her one message on both platforms aside from the ones when we initially met. 

It shouldn't bother me and I feel embarrassed for posting this because she shouldn't matter. She wasn't even an acquaintance. But I don't understand why she blocked me because I can't think of what I did wrong. I barley knew her. I want to know why but that'd just make me feel worse and make me look weird for creating a new account just to ask.

237,"I've noticed that i dont feel grateful that i was born and i dont feel grateful for them raising me. Aside from the bare necessities of food, water, shelter, etc.,  i AM very grateful for all the extras, like cakes and presents for birthdays, Christmas presents, the privilege of having food and drinks that we like, heat during the winter, cell phones, video games. All the things that arent necessary for raising a child but we got anyway. And when I think about it in the grand scheme of things, I am grateful that I live in a first world country where food and clean water are very accessible. But not grateful to my parents? Just to the universe I guess?


I never understood this sentiment of owing your parents something. They wanted you and they brought you into this world, and (hopefully) fulfilled the legal requirements of providing the basic necessities of life. Anything else is a gift given to you by them. As a child you don't have control over the gifts they decide to give you. Even if a child asks for something, the parent can always say no and the child has to deal with it and doesn't really have any grounds for complaining if all their basic needs are being taken care of.


Recently my moms been on a kick of, whenever someone says something she doesnt like, she will say something along the lines of ""Really!? Youre gonna say that to your Mother? Your own mother?"". (Example, she asked for some candy I had, I told her I'd get it for her, I'd rather not have other people going through my stuff. ""How dare you. I am Your MOTHER. Your own mother can't go in your bag? What am I, some filthy beggar on the street?"" ) But what does her being my mother have to do with anything? Why should she be the most important person in my life? Because SHE created me just for the hell of it? And then had to go through all the trouble of feeding me and buying me clothes. And if she had me under different circumstances, it would be completely different. But they had me intentiomally, then seemingly got bitter of all the hard work they signed themselves up for. 


The title of Mother/Father has no significant meaning to me, but it definitely does to others. And I'm not really sure why. Rereading this, I'm definitely bitter of something but I don't know what.",22Dec2020,1

Once I was close to graduation (high school) I realized that the likelihood of getting a job and being able to live off of this was very slim. So I went to college to study programming. After a year, I dropped out because of financial issues. I still got a job in the industry and today, work at a very big international company that pays me well and have a wonderful team. But I'm not happy. I told myself I would keep drawing and working on my skills my improvement has not only stagnated, I've got the worse. I can't seem to improve and drawing now hurts me because I know I objectively suck and there is no reason to continue. I have been drawing for 13 years and have nothing to show for it. I even tried attending an art school, but once again had to leave due to not having the financial means to. I struggle with depression anxiety and I've recently been diagnosed with the disease that will take my vision when I'm older. I feel like I am wasting away but at the same time, I can't draw without panicking. I legitimately don't know what is better for me at the moment. Giving up, or keep on trying with no end in sight.

So during the past 2 weeks or so, my girlfriend and I got tested positive for COVID and we both decided obviously to quarantine at our houses, so during the quarantine period we were sad we couldn‚Äôt see each other during the time so we FaceTimed a lot and texted time to time. My girlfriend one day decides to have a proposition that we shouldn‚Äôt text as much but just call to check in to see how we‚Äôre doing since there isn‚Äôt anything new to talk about when we are stuck sick in our houses, to me that sounds reasonable so i was like okay that‚Äôs fine she said it wasn‚Äôt that she didn‚Äôt want to talk with me or she doesn‚Äôt love me but it‚Äôs we have nothing really to say so we end our days talking about what happened eventfully or any new news. So as the day go on when we do text it takes either and hour to respond back or when we do talk it doesn‚Äôt seem like she‚Äôs interested in even talking with me, i try to have conversations and she‚Äôs either not paying attention or is on her phone looking at Instagram on FaceTime with me.(i know it sounds like I‚Äôm needy but i just think it‚Äôs rude because i don‚Äôt even do that to her and she recently started to do that) So to me it hurts my feelings and i feel like she doesn‚Äôt care and she doesn‚Äôt like me anymore. And since she got sick first and she is now not in quarantine i try to talk with her and either tell her i love her or that i miss her and i can‚Äôt wait to see her and she doesn‚Äôt give me the same energy as she did before. I understand I‚Äôm still in quarantine and i want to see her because i haven‚Äôt been around her or anything but she just isn‚Äôt giving me the same love. There have been other times where she would get mad at me for no reason while she tries to pick fights with me on things i have never done. I‚Äôve been feeling like maybe she isn‚Äôt liking me anymore or she doesn‚Äôt love me anymore but i feel like it‚Äôs all in my head and if i tell her my feelings she would get upset with me about it.  It just hurts me and i don‚Äôt want to feel like this.

She's very popular and has a lot of followers from our college. She usually asks everyone to share her work and if you don't she'll keep texting or calling till you do. So after we became friends and she realised that I get a lot of commissions, she wanted me to share her works on my page so she'll get commissions too. I didn't mind helping her but when I checked out her account almost all her works are copied from other artists or taken from pinterest and she posts it like her own work. She adds something like a few extra lines or changes the hair colour and posts it as her own work. Her leaf art is amazing and I love it but almost everything else is fake.
So naturally I didn't promote her page.

She started telling everyone that all my digital art is fake and that I'm using apps to make normal photos look like drawings. I lost around 100 followers when I had just 300. A few works I got from my college were also cancelled. She then started copying my works. I tried to call her out but she's popular so everyone supported her.

251,"I'm 16 year olds. My mom is 40 and has gone back to drinking after 3 months sober.

My mom used to be an alcoholic and drink constantly. This caused her to lose her job in the military. But since she has such a good history in the military she is getting let off with a honorable discharge. We live on the military base and due to multiple different issues she's been in, we are somewhat in a limbo. She is still getting pay but not working and is waiting to get moved.

Finally she got caught drinking and driving and was sent to an addiction treatment hospital. After that she made some friends, went to daily AA meetings, and has weekly dinners with her new friends. This when well for a a happy 3 months. Then suddenly yesterday she started drinking. And as soon as she starts drinking she doesn't stop.

So I went ahead and poured out any alcohol she had left and hid her car keys. I know this isn't a solution I should be should be using but I knew the next time she used her car it would be to drive to the store and buy more alcohol. I was correct about that. 

It was 10 p.m. when she came downstair looking for her car keys. She asked for her keys back and I said no. I told her I cared about her and wasn't going to let her go to the store to buy alcohol. After 5 minutes of back and forth she when back to her room mumbling she can't believe she is a prisoner in her own house.

254,"First things first: I am a 16F, petite (5 ft, average weight)

Typically, I have a small (really small) appetite and get easily bloated if I eat a bit too much at one go. It usually results in quite a far bit of discomfort and has triggered multiple insecurities for me.

The bloating issue continued and my parents decided to bring me to try Traditional Chinese Medicine (after Western medicine did not do much) Each visit, together with the medicine, cost around 80USD (i converted my local currency to USD)2 months in and I really feel like the medicine given wasp of little help.

Yet they insisted that something was wrong with me, finding ways to pinpoint faults in me: i.e playing games which I only do for 2 hours a day, sleeping in, feeling restless and lacking energy hence ‚Äúwasting my life away‚Äù. 

I have sounded out multiple times that I only get bloated *when i overeat*, yet they deny that and pass it off, while continuing to pressure me into shoving food down my throat. Sometimes in public, they would shame me or raise their voice when I say that I‚Äôm full - when I really am.

I don‚Äôt want to waste their money on going to the doctors, but no matter what I have said: that the medicine really doesn‚Äôt work, that its just overeating, I still get shouted at and constantly denied. 

I really dont know what to do. I dont know if its too much of a stretch to say that one of my parents are verbally abusive- they hurl vulgarities and degrading words at me almost every day.

Me and best friend have known each other all of our lives, but never really friends. We started talking to each other on the bus going from school starting about last year. I never suspected anything other than a friendship, I am convinced I'm too unattractive for anyone to want to be more than ""just friends"". We kept talking, being friends through summer. This is when I thought I might like her. I had that moment when you realize she's a girl, not just another friend. I never told her, scared if I did our friendship might end. She admitted to me a couple days ago that she had a crush on me right after we started talking, but told me she doesn't anymore. I took that opportunity to tell her I did too, but I was also over it. I really thought I was over her, but last night I had a dream that we were together, nothing sexual, but too touchy to be just friends. I woke up and felt so warm and happy, something I've never felt before. I knew it was different, it wasn't just a wet dream because she was a girl, it was a dream where we were just existing together, fully clothed. I don't know how to tell her, but she's really good at spotting when boys have a crush on her so I can't hold out forever. She's also said I'm the only one who helped her through her suicidal phase, and that she wouldn't be alive without me, so if I tell her and we stop being friends, I don't know how she would react. She is now going to therapy and on medication, but still scary to think about. I sincerely think I'm too awkward and unattractive for her in the first place, I really don't know what to do.

259,"My [F,24] boyfriend [M,22] and I have been dating for the past 4 months. We recently went on a vacation to Colorado together last week and things went great for the most part. We normally do not argue and have had very minimal arguments since being together. On the trip, I spent around $400 one day getting us train tickets, buying us food and drinks on the train, etc. and he didn‚Äôt even say thank you or show me appreciation whatsoever and this really bothered me. Once back at the house we were staying at, I brought it up and we argued for no more than 10 minutes and he ended up apologizing and we hugged/kissed and moved on. Things were great after this and just like normal. We had sex like normal, visited my friends in Colorado, went exploring the next day and he and I were fine. Nothing out of the normal or animosity towards one another. 

Leaving Colorado the drive home I got the flu and was sick. Getting home early in the morning to our home state he gave me a kiss goodbye and helped me carry in all of my stuff and said ‚ÄúI will see you later.‚Äù The plan was for me to go to his house around 6PM. I overslept that day due to some jet lag and having the flu. I apologized to him and he said it was okay. I asked if I was still coming over to his house, he ignored me for 2 hours which is unlike him, and then he said he was at his friends house fixing a car. I asked if I could come over after and he said, ‚Äúprobably not I need to get some sleep.‚Äù I was a little annoyed so I said I felt like he was ditching me. He got upset and didn‚Äôt speak to me the rest of that night.

He didn‚Äôt speak to me for the next 24 hours which is very unlike him. I asked him if he was okay and he responded and said he dropped his phone causing it to mess up and that he couldn‚Äôt lock it or he could t get back into it. I empathized with him and apologized for the night before saying I just felt like things had/have been weird since the first argument on vacation. He didn‚Äôt text me back for another whole day and all he said was, ‚ÄúYeah they have been a little weird.‚Äù This worried me a lot. I said, ‚Äúare we okay?‚Äù He did not respond. I texted him around 3 and asked if he could call me. He did not respond until 8PM and he said, ‚ÄúBeen trying to move past that but I don‚Äôt think i can.‚Äù (Talking about the original fight I assumed).

This caused me panic. I asked if he could call me or I could call him, that I was confused, that I didn‚Äôt want to lose him, and that those long gaps in communication weren‚Äôt fair to me. He ignored me and did not respond. This has been going on for 3 days. Which compared to our relationship previously we would talk, call everyday all day. We have met each other‚Äôs parents, talk about having kids, talk about getting married, talk about moving in together and then suddenly he‚Äôs so cold. 

In full panic mode I irrationally decided to drive to his house to talk to him in person. All of the lights were on in his house. I assumed he was awake. I texted him and said, ‚ÄúCould you come downstairs and talk to me please.‚Äù No reply. I called him 3 times. Then left.

263,"My mom is a late 50s year old Republican White Woman with nothing to do all day except watch Fox News or Facebook and it drives me crazy. I need advice/help on how to help her not be so over the top with everything. Let me explain:

So my dad is the ‚Äúbreadwinner‚Äù and makes enough money where my mom hasn‚Äôt had to work very much the whole time they‚Äôve been married (like 30 something years).
She was working when they were married but when had their second child (me) she became a stay-at-home mom and throughout the years after I grew up she‚Äôs had little random jobs here and there. She was a substitute teacher for a while, she baked for a restaurant for a while, she was a receptionist for a while. Things like that. 

But she hasn‚Äôt worked in the last 10 years. Pre-pandemic this wasn‚Äôt too much of an issue because she could busy herself in the town they live in and I dunno it never drove me that crazy. 

I live across the country, but I call her about every day to see how she is doing. And recently all she ever wants to talk about is the president (how great he is), the virus (how it is not that bad), and how the COVID restrictions are ‚Äúruining her life.‚Äù And it drives me crazy. At first, I tried to challenge her and provide actual facts and counter-arguments to her nonsense beliefs. But she gets extremely frustrated, tells me she can‚Äôt have an opinion because all I do is tell her she‚Äôs wrong, and then circles back to her nonsense belief. And I‚Äôve gotten angry before and not talked to her for about a week and my dad called me up and told me to make up with her. I tell her how my day goes, but when I ask her about hers she goes on and on about something new she doesn‚Äôt like about the pandemic and how ridiculous it is. And when I tell her I don‚Äôt want to talk about it she gets frustrated.

I‚Äôve talked to my dad about the issue and he doesn‚Äôt know what to do either. He works A LOT and is rarely ever home to start with, so I think he just does a ‚Äúout of mind out of sight‚Äù kind of thing with it and leaves it alone. (Except tonight he admitted to me that he has to deal with her extreme beliefs too and he doesn‚Äôt know what to do)

I made a surprise visit home over the holidays at my dad‚Äôs insistence. He works during the day (and into the evening) so I‚Äôm home with my mom and we keep getting into fights. Just this evening she made an offhand comment on how disgusted she is that the woman football player from Vanderbilt is being honored by the football hall of fame. And when I tried to explain why I thought it was a big deal (I truly think it is cool that a woman played in two college football games) she scoffed and said it ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt that impressive.‚Äù And got very frustrated by it. I also asked her if she thought a woman astronaut was something we should honor and she also said that ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt that impressive‚Äù (yeah, I‚Äôd like to see her be an astronaut). She also has this strong belief that wearing masks for a prolonged time increases the amount of CO2 we inhale and it is toxic to us. And even after I googled it and showed her multiple educational/scientific websites debunking that she said ‚ÄúWell I have spoken to two nurses who says it is dangerous‚Äù and that ‚Äúyou can have your opinion and I can have mine‚Äù (I honestly could go on and on about the outlandish things she says, but I think y‚Äôall get the point)

Honestly, I‚Äôm at my wits end here. She‚Äôs my mom, I want to have a good relationship with her, but I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep this up. And I truly think it boils down to the fact that she has nothing to do during the day. She doesn‚Äôt work, she doesn‚Äôt have responsibilities, so she watches Fox News and Facebook all day long. 
I know I‚Äôll probably never get her to see that a lot of what she thinks is right is not right (and maybe it isn‚Äôt even my place to try) but maybe it is my place to help her do something productive during the day? 

Right now my dad has a torn Achilles heel and relies on my mom to drive him to and from work, plus with the pandemic I don‚Äôt know what she can do but be home all day, so she‚Äôs kinda limited I think. 
But does anyone have any advice? On either how to get her to do something productive or how to get her to stop being so over the top in every conversation I have with her?",22Dec2020,1

And who knows how long it had been going on?! Mom refused to give me any more details. She never told me about this before, but I know exactly when it happened because I know exactly how he was punished. 14M got his own room (3M was moved out of it), and got grounded from electronics for a month.

266," 

So here's a basic rundown of my situation:

27, Male

Net worth is a little over 100k, been saving religiously since i was 18, built a mountain of about 30k, and recently was allotted 40k of my own money from my family portfolio since my mom realised im disciplined enough to handle it, and i also inherited about 40k from my grandmother. In total, i have over 100k, all in liquid debt funds, yielding a little under 4%. I plan on keeping it that way, and then dumping it all into an index when the market crashes next. I dont rely on the income of this.

Expenses are close to zero, no rent, food is taken care of, I only have to spend when I go out with friends.

I also get cash from my family regularly so i almost never have to touch my savings, it just grows, and more often than not, i save 60% of my salary and whatever each month.

My education is done too, got a masters degree a few years ago.

My main concern is that i find that im getting relaxed as far as my ambitions go. putting myself in a position of safety is superb and it feels great, but how can i make sure i dont lose my drive and ambition to do a lot more?",22Dec2020,1

Not going out and sharing extremely fragile details with anyone who will listen. 

Honestly just so over it. If you wanna have an adult conversation, finish it til the end instead of trying to have the last word and blocking me the minute you see my text bubble pop up. Telling me I reject taking any form of accountability for my actions when that‚Äôs legitimately ALL I do. I wish she‚Äôd just be better. No more of this ‚Äúbaby if you knew better you‚Äôd do better‚Äù shit. She KNOWS better as she‚Äôs been scolded by my dad for sharing this same private situation that she forced me to share with her when I was still living at home or else she‚Äôd come through on her threats.

277,"hey! the title's meant to catch attention - its not that simple.
I'm 15. My dad has smoked my entire life. The aesthetic, in combination with the native Russian street culture that I've experienced (my parents are russian), is extremely appealing; the sight of the smoke itself is satisfying and the feel of a cigarette is too. 
My dad has also had 3 heart attacks, with several operations. He's been a heavy smoker for 50 years.
Somehow, I don't see the harm in an occasional cigarette - am I wrong? 
I've smoked several times, and don't feel the need to do it, which is why I'm fairly confident in my ability to limit myself/stop if it gets out of hand.

280,"We've been dating for 2 years. We started dating when we were very young. We didn't know what a relationship meant. We will both be turning 17 within the next few months, Which means it's time to start thinking about careers and colleges.

I have found my passion, ever since I was a kid I wanted to become a Pastry Chef. I have been looking into colleges with my parents and together we have decided to try our hardest to get me into the Culinary Institute of America! The CIA is my dream school and it leads to my dream career! I am also very passionate about traveling and experience the most that I can in my lifetime! This matters more to me than almost anything else.

My boyfriend, on the other hand, is the complete opposite. He wants to live in our incredibly small town (like literally, the population of our town is 800) forever. He wants to go to our small community college. He wants to start a family with me after that. He wants me to stay in our small town with him forever... I can not do that. Having that same day in the same place over and over again makes me feel so dead and empty. That's why I love culinary arts, Your job is active and changing and you can work almost anywhere in the world if you get the right training. I believe that I was meant for greater things than to be another housewife in this empty town. I want to achieve my goals, I want to do all that I can with what I have been blessed with.

When I told him about my dream of becoming a pastry chef and going to the CIA, He told me that going to well-known colleges is a scam and that I ''am going to get played by the system''. what the heck kinda response is that lol.

But it's not only the conflict about the future that has me questioning our relationship.

* I feel like I've matured a lot quicker than he has. I really don't get his sense of humor. It's always childish and usually racist as well. He expects me to laugh too.
* I did not truly know his personality when I first started him. Sometimes it's hard to not roll my eyes at some of the things he says. He acts like he knows better than me most of the time.
* He very frequently pushes me to do sexual things with him when he wants it. Even if I have politely declined.
* I feel a lot of dread when I think that I may have settled down with my husband at the age of 14. I did not think of whether there would be a better match for me out there when I started dating him.
* He is very allergic to all pets with fur and peanuts. This one is not his fault at all but it's something I have to mention. It would be very hard to work as a pastry chef and to not come home with any traces of peanuts on me. And I really love dogs and it would hurt to never be able to have one. He's even allergic to hypoallergenic dogs.
* We have not been able to see each other for almost a year in person. This one is also not his fault. my mom is very strict with Covid-19 safety. It has put a big strain on our relationship.

On the other hand, part of me feels bad for even considering this. He loves me a lot. He truly considers me to be his future wife. I don't want to hurt him. He is a very fragile person and it would crush him. Also who even knows if I would be able to find someone else in the future. I would want to stay single for a while but I would eventually want to find someone to love.

286,"Over the past few years I‚Äôve gotten to be really good friends with this girl (I‚Äôll say Mary). I‚Äôd probably call her my best friend, and we are both in a larger friend group. We are all currently seniors in high school. However, over the past few months, Mary has been hanging out with another group of friends consisting of college kids from the next town over. Among them is one of her exes (we‚Äôll say Alex), who cheated on her and did a lot of really awful stuff that could warrant a post of its own without ever apologizing.

He‚Äôd constantly spread bad rumors about her around our school, some of which she still faces, though none of them were true. I didn‚Äôt get how she could still sort of be friends with him after that, but good for her for being a bigger person, I suppose. He claimed that he‚Äôd changed (though he also refused to apologize for what he did, rather blaming it on anything else), but it wasn‚Äôt long before it became pretty clear that he was exactly the same as he was before. Lately, he‚Äôs started making moves on her again (it‚Äôs important to note that he‚Äôs nearly 21 and she is 17), and Mary doesn‚Äôt like it.

There‚Äôs another guy in this group, let‚Äôs say Dylan, who Mary says is like an older brother to her. If he doesn‚Äôt like a band, she doesn‚Äôt like that band, if he likes this movie, now that‚Äôs her favorite movie, all that sort of stuff. It‚Äôs kind of nice that she has that kind of relationship with someone (knowing how she grew up with abusive relationships with most of her siblings), but some of the messages this guy sends are... let‚Äôs say ‚Äúoutdated‚Äù to put it nicely. Now, this is where it becomes important to note that Dylan is dating another one of the girls in the group (let‚Äôs call her Samantha).

A lot of drama went down in that other group in which they tried to encourage Mary to go out with Alex again, and she still didn‚Äôt want to. Alex didn‚Äôt like that he couldn‚Äôt have her, so he started a rumor that Dylan was cheating on Samantha with Mary. Of course, it was a lie, and as far as I know Samantha didn‚Äôt believe it to begin with, but the fact that he tried to put it out there with malicious intent was alarming. After all of his inappropriate behavior, you‚Äôd think something would be done, but no. He continues to face no consequence, and Mary seems less bothered by it than ever.

What I think is worse is how Dylan, this guy that she idolizes, totally condones Alex‚Äôs actions and even encouraged it to a degree. Particularly lately, Mary will often make plans with our group and then get invited to hang out with them last second and ditch us. With what she tells me about them, they sound incredibly toxic, but she doesn‚Äôt seem to have a problem, and I would really like to tell her how it sounds, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really my place. This could be my personal bias and lack of perspective, but I feel like I‚Äôve done a lot to help her out lately and be a good friend to her, so I don‚Äôt see why she is more loyal to this group of people who condone her ex‚Äôs creepy behavior than to us: her friends who support and protect her. Is this a logical course of thought, or am I sticking my nose where it doesn‚Äôt belong?",22Dec2020,1

Maybe a jealousy thing, wishing people would care why I'm excited, sad etc. Rather than the fact that I am those things.

288,"this is a throwaway account
I'm a sophomore in high school and this is the first year I haven't had this one teacher, and i've started to feel really weird around him. Over the years I became really close to him and we'd always talk and I always knew that he was a little strange, but he was really nice and good to talk to. I started to feel like things were getting a little personal, but I really just dismissed it as being in my head.
This year, not being in his class I don't see him as much but he'd always talk to me in the hallways. After school, he'd sometimes leave his classroom and talk. One day, about a month and a half ago ish, he told me I should come by after school to talk about something and I stayed for about an hour, and he ended up completely unloading to me about his divorce. I ended up crying, but instead of apologizing he kind of leaned in and said he was ""curious"" about what made me so upset and that moment kind of gave me the skeevies. :(
Just a couple days later, I was told from (now 4 people) that he actually left his wife to be with another (married but now too divorced) teacher. Hearing that hit close to home, and I felt lied to and like he wasn't the person I thought he was, and I ignored him for a full month. That was when things started to get weird. At first he kept coming to talk to me, but I would barely answer or just try to avoid him as much as I could. he noticed really quick and started coming around/walking by more, but he would just stare me down as if he was waiting for me to say something and it made me feel really weird. I'd see him randomly standing outside my other classroom doors as I was leaving, and he'd just stare for a second and then look away to something random on the wall. Once, he stood outside my other classroom door staring and talking to someone, and my teacher had to get up and closed the door. another time he stood in  the doorway of (another) one of my classes, stared at me for a second, and then walked out, but walked back past the door one more time. I told a couple of my close friends what was going on, and the day I told one of them, he did the standing outside the classroom door thing when I was with her, and she got creeped out. Another one of my best friends (for the record, he's asked in the past who I'm friends with, and often sees me walking with them- he knows who my friends are) was in her classroom, saw him staring in, and then he walked in and tried to play it off, and asked her about how something went that had happened over a month ago, and she said he seemed really off and gave her a bad feeling.
So a month had gone by, and I started feeling a little bad for him because it was christmas. one day he was staring at me from his door so i walked in and said hi, and he looked really surprised. He told me that i've been ""distant"" lately and asked why, and I just said I didn't know what he was talking about. I just told him i was thinking about christmas, etc., and went on my way, because I really didn't feel like talking to him any more than I needed to. He kept kind of venting about his divorce, and someone I told this to said it seems though he's doing it because he's trying to get my sympathy (Also, from what I've gathered it doesn't seem like he has any actual out of work friends but i could be wrong)
After I talked to him, he kept up like everything was normal- talking, etc. I still tried to be polite but keep as much distance as possible, but it felt like the staring was getting way worse- I had a friend unpromptedly mention it to me, because she was with me and noticed him staring and she said even though it looked like it was towards me it even made her feel really uncomfortable. The other day he saw me whispering to another teacher in the hallway, and he fully stopped and stared at us until we acknowledged him- he then later asked me what i was talking to him about. 
I want to talk to another teacher about this but I don't want to get him in trouble, at one point i was close to him, and all he's doing is making me uncomfortable. I keep thinking that a lot of these things are just in my head and i don't know what to think. What should I do? any advice or thoughts are appreciated",22Dec2020,1

I'm in med school right now and I get along well with everyone in my class. I was voted ""most likeable"" or something like that (I don't remember the actual name lol). But the thing is, I don't really have a ""squad"" or a group of close friends who I spend most of my time with. There was one person but then I started to get bad vibes so I distanced myself from her. 

I think I struggle because I don't like excluding people from plans, but close friendships require you to exclude others. Also I just don't know how people get close and start talking about personal stuff? I always feel like it's too much, I don't want to be nosy, etc. Earlier this week I found out that a friend in my class who I consider a pretty close friend has been dating someone since August - we never saw each other so she didn't mention it, but we have talked since then several times and she never said anything. So in my mind we're close but we're not *really* close? 

Also I think part of the problem is that I never initiate plans with people - I wait to be invited. Maybe I should take more control in strengthening the friendships I have? But would it be weird for me to invite people to do things since we're not ""close""? 

How can I get closer with people? I like everyone and everyone likes me, but I don't feel close to anyone. Any advice is appreciated!",22Dec2020,1

Currently I'm trying to get a bit more money saved up to afford furniture/moving and waiting on availabilities, but it's not enough to satisfy the one person trying to push me out as fast as possible. (For context, this person doesn't hold lease so they can't kick me out) I told her earlier that the complex that's most ideal for me wouldn't have an availability for 3 or 4 months, and even if there was an availability in another complex, money won't let me leave immediately.

Now this person is even more set on having me leave immediately, all because I filled out a wait list application.
She says that as soon as I found an apartment, I had to leave. But there's no apartment to move in to. 
She's trying to get me pushed out faster and faster, and it's causing fights with my other roommates and I don't know what to do.

Should I just jump the gun and move wherever I can? I feel like that's the only way to take the stress off of everyone.
Any advice would be helpful.",22Dec2020,1
295,"My grandma is mid 90s and lives in an assisted living facility. Since the beginning of the pandemic the facility has been on lockdown with no visitation allowed.

296,"Hello I guess I should give some input. I need advice for a certain issue I've been mulling about for a little bit. Idk it's kinda hard to explain but basically my issue is that I wanna apply back to college but I'm pretty scared I'll quit again. I originally went to college like a year ago when I was just turning 18, for criminal justice but turns out that didn't work out very well and I quit after my first semester. I'm 19 now and I wanna go back but for a completely different major. Problem is, is that I don't necessarily think I have what it takes. I want to go back for Computer Science but I've heard that it's a really hard major with a lot of math involved and math is easily one of my worst subjects; but I've always wanted to be a game developer and I figured a Computer Science degree would help a little bit. I never was the best highschool student. I was average at best and never stood out at a certain subject. I've always had this philosophy drilled into my head that If I don't get a college education, I'll never get a good job and end up being a fucking loser for the rest of my life. At this point I'm starting to doubt myself even more every day. All the rest of my friends and family are going to college and I'm kind of getting remarks about why I haven't gone back yet. So I need advice on what to do.",22Dec2020,1

298,"(This has been really hard for me to write because I‚Äôm not good a writing and I want to make things. Make sense?)

So I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm really looking for from this but I wanted to write something and ask for advice for some time now. I figured I might as well try and shoot my shot, right?

Anyways, there a few things I have that make me question my mental health. My friendships, family, and myself.

To start. I‚Äôll talk a little about my family. I live with a single mother, older sister, older brother, my brother‚Äôs 4 kids, and his ex girlfriend. It‚Äôs a pretty big family. Now, on my immediate family‚Äôs side, there are a lot of things that I struggle with. Trust issue, stealing. Gambling, and arguing. Those are just some of the issues but they all make me question my role in the family. I have no problem talking to either family member from my mother, to my sister, to my brother. I, naturally, have a lot in common with all three.  It the three of them together. Always, without fail, end up finding something to bicker about. My mother has a gambling problem as she can‚Äôt control herself from going to the casino. My brother has the same issue but not as bad. But he has a problem with having his days where he‚Äôs not like his usual self. He‚Äôs typically the laid back and talkative and very understanding person. But some days he‚Äôs very quiet and keeps most of not. Everything to himself. I don‚Äôt know what this means in terms of how he feels as he usually denies it happening or him changing his mood. My sister is greedy. She‚Äôs very strict on her money and typically doesn‚Äôt like spending. Usually on others like us. He gets into most arguments with our older brother. 


As for my issue. I feel like an outcast and sometimes the tool in the family. I work and earn a decent pay for my age. I help when I can with bills and groceries and stuff. But when I don‚Äôt help once out of the week, I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm selfish. Which is why I feel like I‚Äôm not valued by my family. I feel like a tool to them. I work and earn and all they see is the money I bring home. I save and usually don‚Äôt spend a lot. There‚Äôs not much I really want for myself. Other than wanting to live on my own. But that‚Äôs for another time. But for now. I don‚Äôt know what I should do. If I should confront them about it or if I should just try and focus on myself. 

As for my friend. I love each and every one of them. But there are times when I don‚Äôt feel valued either by them. And then there are times when I envy them. 

I‚Äôm socially awkward, so already I‚Äôm not really good at explaining or conversing with people. But naturally, I want to interact with people. One friend in particularly (they just so happens to be female) I ended up having a crush on them. I usually keep this stuff to myself but at some point I got a little close to her and ended to opening up a little bit to her. Feeling like she could understand me a bit. At first, she did and even opened up to me a little bit too. I don‚Äôt know if I took things the wrong way? Or moved to fast, or what, but nothing ended up happening between us. It was made clear that she wanted to stay as only friends. She told me she‚Äôll would feel guilty things didn‚Äôt workout. I respected her decision but at the same time, I felt kinda used and hurt. I don‚Äôt like to open up a lot. Even if it‚Äôs for my friends. I don‚Äôt like attention even though I crave it from my friends too much. I feel angry knowing that things didn‚Äôt happen how I imagined it. But at the same time it makes me sad and mentally very down. I don‚Äôt want her to think that anything is her fault in any way. She didn‚Äôt do anything wrong but it feels like I was betrayed. I have since kept my distance with her to an extent when it came to talking about personal stuff. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs caught on but I hope she doesn‚Äôt worry about it seeing as I should worry her at all. We‚Äôre friends and that‚Äôs all we‚Äôll be. 

As for my other friends. For the most part everything is all fine and good. But sometimes when we‚Äôre having conversations, topics I don‚Äôt like to talk about like relationships, intimacy, or even sex is brought up too often in my opinion. And it makes me angry sometimes when it‚Äôs brought up. Mostly because I don‚Äôt have any experience in that kind of stuff. I‚Äôve never been in a relationship. I tried a few times during school but nothing worked. I was never noticed or given a chance. 

It makes me feel like I‚Äôm toxic. I‚Äôm constantly feeling as if I need to put a front or cover my true emotion with something fake. And because of that, it makes me even more frustrated and angry with myself that I‚Äôm lying to my friend.  Which is why I feel awful when all they‚Äôve shown me was love and appreciation. I feel like I haven‚Äôt given that back to them. But when I want to give back by buying a gift. Or spending money on them. They don‚Äôt like it. It makes me feel unwanted, rejected, not loved. 

So now I don‚Äôt know how to feel. A part of me feels empty like a used up napkin. I‚Äôm not longer useful. Just like how I‚Äôll eventually be useless to my family. And I don‚Äôt feel wanted by some of my friends because I don‚Äôt know how to show my appreciation and love and gratitude to them any other way than buying them stuff or taking them out to places. 


TLDR: I feel like an outcast in my family and I feel unwanted by friends. But at the same time that‚Äôs not the case and I know it. But still deny it.",22Dec2020,1
299,"So my nuclear and extended family want to gather for Christmas. I've already decided to come home to see my nuclear family, but I'm uneasy about seeing extended family especially since we have some 60-somethings in our family. We would also gather on the 27th this month and it would be around 10-15 of us total. If they aren't strictly quarantining now, they are already well within the 10 day incubation period window. It also sounds like they'd all be willing to get tested, but I'm worried about the incubation window and they also wanted to eat inside a restaurant while too.

I quarantined and got tested before traveling home. I took the precautions necessary, but they clearly aren't as serious as I am about being safe. I need help arguing this one because I already been conditioned to feel guilty without even having been guilt tripped yet. I feel fairly confident that I'm mostly in the right here - they can take measures to reduce the risk here, but it's not at a nonzero level that I would be more comfortable with. Plus I want to quarantine with my family so I can be confident about my test results before I leave home to my roommates.

302,"hi I (F 16) and my mom (F 47) live in NYC. in September, those hellspawns moved in. they play music every night. usually from 4 PM to 4 AM and once even until 7:30 (but they only stopped then because my insane ripped neighbor walked in and just turned it off. they weren't even awake. they were sleeping with it on.) the first couple of times it happened, my mom went over and politely asked them to turn it down, they were super confrontational and started yelling at my mom about renters rights and that ""they don't have to turn it down bc its not too loud. that's total bs because we can hear it in the hallway, from my couch (25.ish feet away) with the door closed, from my room, and through my poor mom's bedroom wall) the second or third time we emailed the building's super, ""C"". C is an absolute sweetheart and a genuinely good guy (he's black, it'll make sense in a second). so he goes over there and asks them to turn the music down, aND THE NEIGHBORS START ARGUING WITH HIM, at one point this black girl put herself in between c and the other neighbor and said ""guys guys let me talk to him I'm black too"" and I know this is small, but he responded ""I wasn't talking to you"" and just knowing one of them got slightly shut down feels GREAT. he didn't even get them to turn the music down but it felt good. so since c couldn't get them to turn down the music, he tells my mom to call 311, we did that, but what essentially happens is they send out a notice to all police and if they WANT to they can go and do something, so of course no police actually ever come. i don't know what to do anymore.

TW SUICIDE/SELF HARM

A while ago I was hanging out with my friend he said he thinks I have BPD since he knows about my diagnosed mental illnesses. He told me that I show a ton of the symptoms for it (I talked to him about my mental state a lot and he keeps a close eye on my actions a lot to make sure I don't have an anxiety attack since I get them a lot) and the fact that my mother also has it. I brushed it off in the moment yet recently I have been doing a lot of research on it since I enjoy learning about mental illness. I never would self-diagnose myself and I know most people do not get diagnosed with it until later in life since it is very complex. Yet it can be caused by genetics or trauma, both point to show I may have it.

I have a physical disability and get around $700 I think? I am 18 and a full time college student and none of the money is being given to me.

315,"**This ended up being way longer (and more cathartic) than I intended! I put a tl;dr at the bottom.** 

Ok so, I have an option to transfer to an Ivy League school that is quite literally the best in the country for my chosen field of study. My current school has this field and also research. The majors I'm doing are quite niche, so most schools don't really offer them. My school has many amazing professors and lots of research, but I wouldn't say it has the resources or prestige of the Ivy League school or even other colleges. My school is a state school, but I'm in the honors program, which just means I need to retain a min 3.5 GPA, do 100+ hours of research, and write a senior thesis, plus some other minor stuff. This is for undergrad.

The reason I chose the state school, besides being in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic and being worried about travel, were the alumni connections (have alumni/current students working at 3+ companies I would love to someday work at) and how easy I was to get involved in research/clubs/ and stuff. 

I've just finished my first semester, but I'm already involved in some quality research and in a very weird twist of events I'm set to become a minor leader of sorts for a large and prestigious club (the club is 150+, I'd be leading 10-20 people). I've also met many wonderful mentors who have already gone above and beyond for me by giving me research, advice, waving me into upper level classes, and allowing me to join clubs and panels meant for upperclassmen. These mentors are a mixture of older peers and teachers. Basically, I'm living a big-fish-in-a-small-pond kind of world and I'm loving it. Like, don't get me wrong, it's hard work and all but I enjoy it. 

In addition to all of the above, I also I have built a nice group of friends and have a fantastic boyfriend. I have wonderful, supportive parents that are happy to see me whenever I come home. 

Am I stupid for not wanting to go to the Ivy? Well, I actually would like to go someday- for graduate school and my PhD. I know academia has its problems, but following through with graduate education  is defiantly something I see myself doing. I should mention that the costs of this ivy undergrad education would be mostly if not completely paid. The graduate and phd I'm not too sure about.

I like the Ivy, but maybe for when I have more life experience and confidence? Honestly I feel like I'll just fuck it up if I go. There's so much money (250+K to be exact, not including cost of living if I ever decide to stay on campus for research or something over the summer) riding on an undergrad Ivy degree, and I'd be making roughly 60-70K a year coming out of it (undergrad). I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder a couple years back, and I try not to let it limit me too much, but I think that there's a difference between pushing myself for growth and self-sabotage. This Ivy in particular is known for its unhappy students and high suicide rates. 

I like my state school. I feel comfortable, happy, and safe here. I know I can achieve what I want and I feel mostly satisfied. But I'm worried that I'm not choosing the right choice for me as a person, but for me-with-anxiety. Yeah, leading clubs and people and taking 20 credits is scary, but an exciting scary! Like a movie or a roller coaster! But going to this ivy league is Scary, capital S. Scary like driving with shitty breaks in the middle of a snowstorm. I see myself being stressed to the nines at an ivy, and I'll admit it took me most of my adolescence and childhood to get my anxiety manageable. That place of rabid and irrational fear is not a place that I want to return to. But then I think, maybe I should just suck it up. People break up with their perfect-in-every-way-buut-geograhy boyfriends and leave their friends and put themselves into stressful situations all the time, right? I should be able to do that too, right? Like am I really having anxiety about anxiety (yes, lol). Am I being responsible with myself and my mental health or am I just chickening out?

**tl;dr: I have the option to go from a state school to an ivy for undergrad as a transfer, but I have been excelling at my state school and the idea of going to this ivy makes me nervous. I would like to someday got here for graduate/phd studies, however.** 

I don't know, I guess I just feel like myself, my family, and my friends are too close to the situation to give an unbiased opinion. So please check me? Am I goofing this one up?

Sorry, I know this was long to read!

P.S: I am in therapy at the moment to manage my anxiety, and I also work out, eat healthy, and do journaling to mitigate the rest of the symptoms. Also, big hugs to anyone else diagnosed with one or more anxiety disorders! It's tough but we got this &lt;3",22Dec2020,1

319,"It‚Äôs that weird emotional time of the night for me here haha. Sincerely hope all is well for you and family. Lately, I‚Äôve been troubled with belonging issues.

I‚Äôm considered a 1.5 gen immigrant. I was born in China and moved to states during preteens. So I sort of experienced bits and pieces of both worlds. Like many 1.5 gen-ers, I always feel like I‚Äôm too Chinese to be American and too American to be Chinese. I‚Äôm in a delicate and confusing spot that is caught up between two vastly different cultures. 

Frankly, minus some negative experiences, I genuinely enjoy living in States. Idk if I‚Äôd enjoy it more than in China as I haven‚Äôt lived there for over a decade now. Before covid hits, I never really questioned about living anywhere outside of US. I just assumed that I‚Äôd live work and raise a family here for the rest of my life. I‚Äôm in my late 20s so settling down is the next big milestone. 

US China relation isn‚Äôt at its best and hopefully won‚Äôt get any uglier. But the surge in ultranationalism on both sides lately really put people like me Chinese Americans in very awkward spots, as if we must prove our loyalties. Because I see both perspectives and narratives, I simply can‚Äôt make a shallow comment to defend which side is righteous and better. 

What sort of prompted me to question in the first place is that my relatives in China kept on persuading me to move back and putting doubts in my head. Again, there‚Äôs rise of nationalism on both sides. On the Chinese side, it‚Äôs very very defensive, sort of see any Western influence as a existential danger to their way of life. I might be exaggerating a little here. But the gist is very anti-foreigners and West rn. 

According to my relatives, I‚Äôm obligated to go back to China since I‚Äôm a scientist and I can contribute to make China stronger. They would always go on a rant about how US is no longer the leading superpower and everyone is afraid of China. What hits home is their comment that I will never truly fit in in America. I won‚Äôt be apart of mainstream America. I will always be treated as 2nd/3rd class citizens. They‚Äôd ridicule how little saying and influence Asian Americans have. And how our community suffers endless silent racism. I take my relatives words with grain of salt, but ngl there‚Äôs some truth to it. What I experienced during Covid really made me to seriously question this for the first time. 

I don‚Äôt quite foresee myself making any major life changing plans, although I‚Äôd appreciate any advice you might have.

Recently he has reached out again, and it's clear he's become abusive, racist with far-right views. I don't like talking to him anymore and I don't really care to revive the friendship.

322,"This year started with the company I worked for shorting my paychecks and then missing two paychecks completely. When I asked to be paid and said that if I wasn't I was going to have to seek legal council I was fired for ""threatening the company."" I did seek legal council and we got up to depositions when we found out that the startup I was working for had very little money and no actual assets. We have been at a standstill since.

I had to move back into my parents' house because I could not keep up with my rent payments. I still am trying to pay off the fees I accrued for ending my lease early. I only intended to be living here for a few weeks. It has been 10 months now. My parents are charging me more and more rent and ""fees"" because they are hurting; my dad was furloughed 2 times since COVID began and they are struggling to pay bills. It is crippling my ability to pay off my debt and move out, whenever they need more money that week/month I get charged absurd fees like ""$10 for chewing ice.""

My parents and I have never really seen eye to eye. They are really good at appearing as loving and caring parents, but inside the house would classify as emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. Yes, they made room for me in their dining room so I could stay somewhere and I am truly grateful for that. However, they have also made it clear that it was out of obligation because they are ""good Christians"" and ""good parents."" My dad hates me, I know that seems extreme, and for years I thought I was just making it up.. but since I have been back he has felt the need to tell me and show me just how much I am hated and unwanted.

I have been working as much as I can to get back on my feet, and unfortunately, I had a stint where I wasn't working (due to COVID). I am doing everything I can think of and I just don't think it is enough. I need help and I have no idea what to do. I still have debt to pay off so I can rent a new apartment. I was allowed to bring my dog to my parents with me, but my cat is in a foster home until I can get back out on my own. I knew what I was going to have to deal with when I moved back and I thought I could handle it, but I can't.

323,"This requires a bit of context. I work in a fast food reference, and I have difficulties hearing. After meeting a Deaf customer, I decided that was the push I needed to actually learn ASL, to help myself and others. So while I'm taking orders, I sign the words/fingerspell while talking.
And my manager HATES it. She says that the customers don't like it (which is... Untrue. If their reactions aren't stone cold indifference, they're complimenting be on knowing ASL or signing in return), and that I should stop.
Now, I don't see the problem. So slight AITA here too but that's not why I'm posting. I'm speaking English, I'm just also signing while I do it. In a workplace where everyone speaks Spanish, why is me using another language to better communicate with others so bad? And should I stop?",22Dec2020,1
324,"My mom, as college applications are nearing, has been constantly pushing for me to create a ‚Äòcharity organization‚Äô for the ‚Äògood of the public‚Äô. 

It all started with that godforsaken cursed calendar app. She puts a calendar reminder, every day, saying ‚Äúcollege app for Cheap-Upstairs-‚Äù. Then she find me and tries to make me feel insufficient and unworthy about applying to colleges and the like. 

Over the summer, she yelled, screamed, guilt tripped, essentially manipulated in malicious ways in order to get me to come up with an idea or my own. So, after weeks of that abuse, I came up with the idea of supplies for kids in need that cannot access zoom. 

Now that this is ‚Äòmy idea‚Äô, according to her I can‚Äôt quit and have to do everything myself. Mind you, she said to me that she will do all the work, I just have to think of an idea, and that all the hustling for me to get things going - but so far she has just bitched about her fantastical ideas to me until I do something to appease her. So far I have spent around 60 hours making this fake organization. It got so bad that one of my very close friends is roped in, and believes the lie. I can‚Äôt even tell him about this situation because of the chance this will get back to her and then I, like in the past when I have reached out to the public for help, will be slapped, spit on, and deprived of sleep from her maniacal rants and refusal of letting me sleep until I publicly concede I ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt tell the truth and am sorry‚Äô.

I have a 4.9 weighted GPA and a 4.0 unweighted gpa, which means that I have gotten all A‚Äôs in my classes. To her, it seems as if good grades will not get me to a college of ‚Äòrepute.‚Äô Especially since the SAT had been removed from the college requirements, she wants me to do something to ‚Äòchange/impact/better the community.‚Äô Her latest fad is telehealth for seniors; she wants me to make this non-existent organization that she made me create, which has done nothing so far, to partner with this massively successful volunteering program. 


Now, mind you, I‚Äôm all for helping the community. In years past I have done everything from beach cleanups to serving meals for the homeless. But, this is fake, I can tell, and if I can, college‚Äôs definitely can. Hell, I don‚Äôt even care about college if it means all this extra society-kissing bullshit. I feel that hard work alone will achieve that.


I am reaching out in trusting the anonymity of the internet and that one of you might have an answer. I need help, to get away from her and her cyclical fanatical delusions of grandeur. I really do.

327,"Ever since I was a toddler I've been lying. I don't think my parents really know who I am. The same goes for my friends that I lie to pretty much on a daily basis. I'm lying to one of the few people in the world I truly like for who they are and not what they have to offer. I don't see people as people. I just see them as what I can get out of them. Most of my classmates are just a way for me to get homework answers. I have my friends because they have my back and I don't want to be alone. Most of the girls I've dated weren't because I actually liked them or anything. They just responded really well to the same sob story I use whenever I want to get close to someone whether it's for their friendship that I can take advantage of later or just so I don't feel alone. I've wanted to write this and post it here for about a year and nine months but I've always been afraid that this would be the thing to bring down my house of cards.

 I've learned to be more accepting of things in my life. If it's the pain i feel from stubbing my toe or if I just feel a little cold. Fuck man this girl I've been talking to though has been the one to make me question if this is the life I want to live from now on. I have let on some of my bad tendencies like how I don't see people as people but rather as tools that I can use to get along in life. She has never judged me to this date except for when I told her that I cheated on my last ex. I don't know why the fuck I told her this because this is the one person I should try the hardest to keep. I don't even understand why I don't even want to date her or have the same lust I feel when I'm around other girls. I genuinely like her friends and this is so weird to me. If I told myself that this is my situation with the girl in question only a few months ago I would have died of laughter. Most of my life to people's knowledge is a complete fabrication of events and never did happen. I don't even know who I as a person am. 

I feel like I have 3 different people in me and 3 different voices guiding me at all times. I feel like I have a compulsion to do random things like little challenges that will get me other things I want in life. This can be as simple as me doing an extra pull-up to increase the chances of her calling me or something as weird as grabbing 2 forks for me instead of 1 if I wanna pass tomorrow's test. I don't know what's wrong with me. I lie to everyone and even myself. I am so confused about myself I don't even know who I am. Everything is always changing inside of me. My godamn handwriting doesn't even stay the same in the same essay that I have to write. Some days I wake up and I can make everyone laugh and I'm hella smooth and I don't stutter. Other days I'm not even able to say a sentence without sounding like Walter jr. 

I also feel like I'm losing this girl that I've been going on and on about. I thought she be a stereotypical party-type girl that you only talk to smash and dip on but she's so much more than that. I don't have to cry crocodile tears around her to get her to like me or feel bad about me. But I messed this up too. We used to call almost every day but then i took her for granted and ended up never calling first and she made most of the efforts. No one really checks up on me but at one point shed call me up at the most random points just to talk. This is completely foreign to me because I'm the one that makes most of the things happen in any kind of friendship. But nowadays I can barely get a text back from her. Reading this now it's only about half right because she's busy hanging with her friends and all but I realize just how much I care. I don't know how to articulate this properly cause to my understanding she cares a lot too but I don't know how to express what I feel inside for real because whatever I say sounds like the same regurgitated garbage I tell everyone else. I don't know what to do about this whether I want to pursue a romantic relationship with her or whatever or just be friends. This is one of the only times that I value her friendship and not her body which is so fucking weird. This girl's a ten but at the same time, I don't want her in that way and just like her for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to fucking do with myself half the time. I feel like I'm losing myself. I used to draw a lot but now I don't. I used to build things in my garage but now I don't. I just sit on my ass and do whatever bullshit I can to get through the day. I love my music a lot. It is the most important thing to me as that is my coping mechanism and now that is starting to fall away. I am now listening to Poutine by Optimus on repeat for the last hour while writing this. But it's harder and harder to enjoy it nowadays.

At this point, I don't even know what I'm even asking advice for I just wanna know what to do for all of my faults so I don't hurt this girl or myself or anyone that I might come across in the future. It's 2 in the fucking morning and just a few weeks ago I would have been asleep by 10. I don't know what's happening to me I just hope I get to the light at the end of the tunnel.",22Dec2020,1

333," I've posted this on r/relationship_advice, however, in my experience, this subreddit has always given me the best advice.

I need some simple advice. My friend group has been hanging out regularly for the past 2 years and have hung out often, AT LEAST once a week and that's if it was a busy week. However, around September this changed. (Also, this isn't just because of COVID because during COVID we would still hang out or play video games).

To summarize it all, at the start of September, they stopped messaging me to hang out all of a sudden. I figured maybe I should ask them if they wanted to hang out. I asked and they said no they were busy, etc. I figured that... well they were busy since I've never had to deal with friends trying to ditch me before, I figured they were being honest and there was no reason to doubt them. Then, a week later I ask to get the same response, only this time I can see that they're playing together on Discord. I figured that they were probably playing with some other friends or were trying hard at the game (I've always been the worst at games in the group BY FAR), so took it like nothing.

Then it's my birthday (a week later) and none of them message me. That makes me mad because they always have wished me a happy birthday along with a gift and I did it for all of them that year. So at this point, I was confident they no longer cared about me, and although it hurt I removed them on Snap. The next day, one of them texts me to add them back on Snap, along with a happy belated birthday message. I figured I misjudged the entire situation, added them all back (although nobody else wished me a happy birthday). Fast forward another two weeks, I ask them if they want to play or hangout again, they all said that they were busy, but they were playing together, playing Minecraft (This was the one game that I was the best at, so it told me it had nothing to do with them tryhard in a game). So I figured I'd wait for them to hit me up since this was the third time I'd been rejected. Two months later, on November 1st, they message me asking me to play or hang out. I couldn't that day I was just too busy. They said okay. I ask them the next day, they say no, it's whatever.

Another month and a half pass, on December 15th, they hit me up saying that we should play sometime over December break. I say yeah sure, and I'm happy as ever. They hit me up on Saturday, we play, there's some other new guy there but I didn't care. We played and from my perspective, we had a good time (besides the other guy, who was constantly insisting that I was kicked out so that they could invite someone else, for reasons such as ""he's too shy"" or ""he's toxic"" completely randomly, although I wasn't shy or toxic at all). I figured who cares if that guy hates me, I'm hanging with my friends. Eventually, he leaves, I and my other friends continue playing until 1 AM when we all get tired. The last friend to get off, tells me that we'll play or hang out tomorrow, he promises it. He said that he won't be busy all of winter break, and neither will any of them. I figure that I finally have my friend group back. I message them the next day, they say they're busy AGAIN, even though they're playing the same game together. Same thing today.

I need advice all around:

1. Do they not like me anymore or am I overthinking? (I have been known to overthink about things in other friendships but this feels like too much to be overthinking)
2. If they don't like me anymore, for whatever reason, should I try to get them to like me again? If so how? Should I tell them anything about this?
3. If they do still like me, then what in the hell is going on?
4. Also, if they don't like me, is it my fault? (I know that I shouldn't hold it against myself, but if it is my fault in some way, I definitely want to improve on it)

P.S. Just because I can already see the comments incoming, we are not just gaming friends, we used to hang out all the time, but due to COVID, for the most part, we just game.",22Dec2020,1
334,"I love my girlfriend. 
Two months back I was playing with her, she clinged to my legs and I tried to lift her up but couldn't actually carry her from that position so I dropped her from what I thought was a safe angle in our queen mattress that we keep on the floor. Thereafter she started experiencing pain, turned out to be a herniated disk on the low back.
She is currently getting physical therapy and we have a pool so we swim together like 3 times per week, I do all house chores and I make every effort to prevent her from bending or doing anything painful.
I accept the responsibility of what I did but really sometimes I just want to sit down and cry because for her the pain is just too debilitating.

We have been talking about marriage and what our futures would look like together and I do truly think we will last. I have met his family, and he has met my mom and sister. His family likes me and my mom and sister like him as well. I think it's important to note my parents are divorced and my mom lives in a different country and I live with my sister and dad.

The problem is, he doesnt know I have a boyfriend and I am in university that he is paying for and I will be in school for another 3-4 years. I want to tell him I have a boyfriend because my dad values honesty A LOT and keeping it from him feels like I am lying and I feel bad especially because I do genuinely see a future with my boyfriend. I should also note that my dad is asian and i feel like any asian kid knows how difficult it is to gauge your asian dad's emotions because they always have a straight face on. I never know what he is feeling and I have no idea how he will react. I know he will not kick me out just for having a boyfriend but I also dont want him to be mad or start to become strict because of it.

So I‚Äôm from Chicago I lived in Vegas for 5 years on &amp; off I moved back in the end of my freshmen year and came back to Vegas sophomore year, my whole family lives in Chicago. Just me my mom and 4 little siblings stayed in Vegas and my aunt and grandma they both live together. So in the beginning of this year my mom thought about moving back to make a change I was planning to go with her of course. At the time I did have a girlfriend and one day she asked before I was getting ready to leave can I stay with her and her family. She lives with her brother his friend and they 2 kids. And it‚Äôs her mom and her moms boyfriend and her uncle it‚Äôs a really big house. I ended up saying yes but at the same time so many things went in my head I was very indecisive about it. I was gonna miss my mom so much anyways, I end up moving in then I started visiting to Chicago to see my mom and family before covid started, I‚Äôve spend Valentine‚Äôs Day, Easter, Halloween and thanksgiving with her family the day of thanksgiving we both were invited to go to my aunts afterwards, we sat and ate with her family later on she wanted to be there with them to do the Christmas decorations and the tree. She then got upset because later on after we ate they wanted to watch the game which was fine but my aunt called and was already excited for us to come remind you it‚Äôs just her and my grandma they don‚Äôt get to spend holidays with our big family because they very far away so yes I was excited to go. My girlfriend cried she stated ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt never wanna be around my family it‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt like them.‚Äù Which is not true but she doesn‚Äôt understand I never really visit my family or do anything with them. Remind you she gets mad when during covid and I say ‚Äúoh I miss my family‚Äù ‚ÄúI wanna go visit them‚Äù she says things about ‚Äúit‚Äôs bad to travel right now‚Äù but she writes things in her ‚Äújournal‚Äù that she thinks and ‚ÄúKNOWS‚Äù that I‚Äôm gonna live one day and I think that‚Äôs what the problem it‚Äôs really weird. Her family don‚Äôt really have other family it‚Äôs just them.

344,"I‚Äôm 24 and have never had a job. I suck. Currently I live with mom and dad while finishing up my degree (Finance and Risk Management &amp; Insurance double major). I have a 3.9 GPA but I know that doesn‚Äôt matter.

It‚Äôs all just so worthless because I know I‚Äôll never find a job. And even if I did, I wouldn‚Äôt deserve my pay. I would add no value. I‚Äôm worthless.

I‚Äôm at the point where even if I did find a job at Burger King or something, I‚Äôd feel like I would be stealing to get paid flipping burgers. I suck. What can I do about this?",22Dec2020,1
345,"Okay I know this may be a bit strange and I don‚Äôt mean to offend anyone but I really need advice and I figured people here would be understanding. 

I‚Äôm a bisexual woman and for a time I was sucked into the manosphere and incel websites and developed some sort of sick fascination with them, ever since I‚Äôve started to delve there hearing how they talk about women and their expectation of women to submit has begun to give me disgust for guys romantically. Even though I‚Äôm bi I‚Äôve started to consider only dating women because I hate how even if the guy I was dating was nice there would be a bunch of assumptions about the relationship and how I‚Äôm submissive to him and being treated as an extension of him rather than my own person by other people, Whereas with another woman I feel like I‚Äôd be free of these things.  

I‚Äôm not sure if this even makes sense but I‚Äôd really appreciate advice",22Dec2020,1
346,"I've been working out, I should still do it but it hasn't helped me stop thinking about negative thoughts.

Games kinda suck right now, got nothing to play really.

Don't have any hobbies beyond d&amp;d and games. I like to write but for some reason I never get past a page of stuff, which takes me less than 30 minutes, so it isn't the best at distracting me. 

Mostly I've been trying to watch YouTube but so many things have been reminding me about my loneliness. 

Just looking for some advice on how to distract myself.

If you suggest I pick up a hobby then what kind? I do like making stuff but I lose interest easily. *been meaning to get that checked out in case that's depression*",22Dec2020,1
347,"I figured this would be a great place to ask this but...

I‚Äôm 25 years old, single, still living with my parents, unemployed, and possibly facing a 1-5 year jail sentence. Would it be safe to say that there isn‚Äôt much hope for me and I should just end it or should I wait it out and hope for the best?

348,"So I'm 30 years old, a good looking dude I'd say, and today I had a doctor appointment with my new Primary Care Doctor who is also my age.. I had one appointment with her a few months ago during the summer and scheduled an appointment to have some blood tests done to see if I'm getting all my nutrients. 

Anyways, right from the start she was very bubbly and nice which surprised me because when i saw her last, she was very reserved, brief and short with me and almost like she was turned off by me. 

Maybe she had a bad day or something, because when I saw her today she was very bubbly and nice, asked how I'm doing in a conscientious way... she even put some thought into my appointment, and she was saying how she was thinking I should get certain tests done for specific nutrients, 

and then later on she asked if I have any Christmas plans, which I know is typical conversation; i told her I just have a small get together with parents and siblings, and I said ""what about you?"" and she responded with saying: ""Oh I'll be here working, but it's okay I wouldn't be doing anything anyways!""

I was surprised to hear that, because she had a nice ring on her ring finger and I always thought she had a significant other.. 

Anyways, two questions: 

1) Does it sound like she is in a relationship?

2) Would it be inappropriate to message her and ask her on a date? The hospital she works for has a message service so i would be able to directly message her on that service just like I'm emailing her.",22Dec2020,1
349,"So a bit of background, I am a girl in my mid 20s and I have been struggling with anxiety a bit since my teens. Around my early 20s is when my anxiety had taken a turn for the worse because this is when my only sibling died from a long battle (3 years) of cancer. I began suffering from anxiety attacks, fear pf dying from so many things, i became very humble and timid. I lost a lot of my friends because of how depressed i was and timid. Since then I have controlled the attacks though I still am struggling with anxiety.

I met a friend during college about 2 years ago. This is the first true friend I had been able to make since high school. My group of friends were all mainly from high school but I slowly lost them because of my struggle with depression for the last 10 years.

After I met this friend, Lana, we became really close but not because we had a lot in common but more her always in my personal space and talking to me so much. I normally am difficult to get close to or make a personal connection given i am not close to anyone in my life. Basically I required someone to make the effort to befriend me but As an adult I noticed that about my self so I began trying to make some effort. 

She was a very sweet girl, the type that would give the shirt on her back for you. She is from a foreign country and has lived in the states for 3 years who is studying in the medical field. She is 3 years younger than me.

So an example of her kindness. She would pay for your uber ride home if you had no money or she would let you stay at her place if you had no where to go. I would describer her as innocent, but since moving here to America and social media has changed her to a TOTALLY different person. 

Though I described her as a sweet and giving person she always seemed like she wanted more, like she wanted to live the ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù life or what she believed how she should live.

This is where she changed. Keep in kind So far I have known her for about 2 years. At one point I stopped talking to her because I am the type of person that would do that due to feeling overwhelmed about unrelated things. But sometimes she wouldn‚Äôt text either. I also noticed she would want to hang out with white / or people who look white all the time and party but i was really insecure so I would make excuses to hang out. So she began making new friends through apps. I noticed she wanted to be like a social media influencer also.

So, in March of this year, she got tinder and never mentioned it to me up until some shit went down, or oh she told me....
We began catching up and she told me she had gotten tinder and met many men on their but thing was was that she had a long distance boyfriend, whom she‚Äôd meet every few months and would take her to lavish trips. He seemed very nice and here she was telling me she was fucking many men. She thought this was a normal American thing.

Ok this is becoming long but short story is that she told me that she met a man early 20s named Alex. That was kicked out of his family home because of an addiction. She then told me that she got him a hotel that night because he had no where to go. She began seeing him a lot and falling in love with this drug addict. She continued to loan money and they would go out and party. She would only speak to me to complain about how he made her feel or how his friends were closet racist. (I have no idea if this was true because his GF was hispanic) she would then would ignore me if he would call like once when we hung out and he called and this bitch (Lana) ignored the fuck outta me even when I would ask her something she walked away. And she would ignore me for weeks until another day she would call me in the middle of the night asking me to DRIVE to a hotel to hang with Alex and her but in the background I found out that he was the one persisting me to hang out with them NOT HER. He would ask her if she had a friend. And her only friend was me at this time. She had another bff but she was not single and was not down for her shit. When Lana would ask me to hang out in the middle of the night with Alex I would say to my Lana ‚Äúoh then can you pick me up?‚Äù She would moan and grunt ‚Äúcan‚Äôt you bring yourself?‚Äù. And let me remind she was not that kind of person before. 

From then on, I would always say no to hanging out because I would get a bad feeling. Not sure if this is paranoia/ anxiety and insecurity kicking in. 

Also keep in mind she would always complain about Alex and how fucked he was but would go back to him. The last time, she asked me to hang out, well apparently he wanted to fuck me and that‚Äôs why she was asking me to hang. She kept pressuring me to go hang out with them and once I kept saying NO we hung up and later she called and apologized and said oh ‚Äútbh he wanted to fuck you and thats why I kept asking. I wont do that again‚Äù.
She would pressure by saying we can have a 3some. 
AND I found that odd because she would bitch and cry about being IN LOVE with Alex, but he wanted nothing to do with her. He apparently had a girlfriend who knew of this Lana! And Lana would show me text messages between the guy and his GF talking about Lana and referring Lana by a derogatory name. 

Though the text messages were praising my friend Lana on how she is so kind hearted I thought some of it was condescending. My friend Lana also told me that Alex‚Äôs GF sent Lana photos of herself in bikinis and asking which one looked best on her. Lana would show me weird text messages and when I would look at the screen shots they were recently sent. Sometimes I began to think she was orchestrating some of the drama because of how weird everything was. At one point she let Alex stay at her apartment to live. After weeks of not talking, Lana called me at 3am (not crying) about how she just found put Alex stole 1000s from her drawer and she wanted him out of her apartment. She begged me to come over to be there because she was too scared to wake Alex and his friend up to kick them out (o.O)

I was terrified at this point because this was days after I found out Alex wanted to fuck me apparently, so my mind started to think the worse to be quite honest. I told her No about me coming over and she begged and pleaded but no crying. Almost sounded fake. 

THEN after I hung up, she sent me photos of him naked in her bed??? And said ‚Äúsee he‚Äôs still here‚Äù and apparently his friend was there also but had his clothes on, asleep on the floor (she showed me too). I asked ‚ÄúWhy the fuck is he naked?‚Äù She just said oh he got hot and he‚Äôs on drugs which could had been true (the drug part)

I refused to come over, and she kept me on the phone to hear her kicking them out. I tried to catch her in some lie because this story of what she told me next sounded outlandish. She apparently had been trying to get her money back from him and supposedly has been successful. When Lana found out Alex stole so much from her after she showed so much love and kindness to him, she became angry. She began talking about murdering him and that she almost did it because she had access to a knife that night. She explained she never felt so much rage and went on about murder and how she would love it and stuff. I was just shocked but laughed but she said she was not kidding.

I am sorry this is so long and I probably left out very important parts but I really want to give a big picture of my dilemma.

Since then. She has met so many men over the internet and accepting money for sex. Before she broke off her relationship with her previous long distance BF, she wanted him to gift her something expensive before she did break it off. I have noticed she‚Äôs become more selfish and says that it‚Äôs just the American way. Lana made a friend Sharon, around the time she got tinder (whom I believe encouraged her to get tinder in the first place and accept money for sex) i feel like Lana takes everything to the next level because she wants so badly to fit in and be seen as American. I would try to explain she does not have to be so excessive. I would describe Lana‚Äôs new friend Sharon as selfish, Lana would talk crap about her though she would say she cares for Sharon she would say she is a messy person and she is careless about her actions like ditching Lana sometimes for others. Then Lana would end up saying that‚Äôs probably how Americans are &gt;.&gt;. She seems to see Caucasians as superior which annoys the fuck outta me. It pisses me off just writing this because she knows I am obviously American yet she thinks so strangely of America. She did come from a poor country.

So the day that she kicked Alex out, I basically thought she was going to do something to me if I had gone to her place that day but I felt like I was taking it too far. So I tried talking to her again after she stopped talking to Alex because I thought he was tainting her.

The kind of person Lana is: She seems to try to make things better than they are just to seem more American or rich. She always tries to correct my image if she thinks I am doing or saying something wrong (loser like). 
She always seems to over inflate stories and I have caught her in small white lies about how she has lived life in the pst and things she had. 
Once, she wanted to give me a fake designer bag but decided not to because of sentimental values, and when we were out near white people. She boasted about how the man she met on tinder, stole her designer bag, ‚Äúthe one I wanted to give you‚Äù out loud. But it was fake $20. Just giving you an idea of the type of person she is. 


So, I just get weird vibes from her now and recently we had not talked in over a month until she calls out of the blue getting right to the point literally asking me to be a roommate because she needs one. (She has done that, calling me out of the blue wanting me to hang out wither her and randoms because she had no-one else to call and invite but ofc she wont say that.) her new recent friends have strayed her away from me.

Shannon is her new bff that recently ditched her hard core lol and Lana would say that she would stop talking to her but days later Shannon becomes her roommate in a 1B1R. 2 months later Shannon is moving out for a weird reason. Lana shows me text exchanges after she told me she told her to pack her shit and leave by a certain date but the text messages were very recent like few minutes ago.

Every time Lana has called me its for a favor that like needing a roommate or wanting a friend to hang out because she HAD no-one else to contact and her guy friends want to hang with her friends.

I just do not know what to do because recently I have been very lonely. Most of the friends I had have children or I have stopped talking for arguments or growing apart. And also because of my depression and Lana is the last person I can actually call and hang out if I wanted to.
BUT I MUST MENTION the period when we were not talking for over a month I texted her hi and she took a day to reply and another day to reply again then out of the blue she calls because she needs a roommate. She gets to the point of what she wants quickly. Like she started small talk then interrupted asking for me to move in.

Should I cut her off?

So sorry this is so stupid but I have so much paranoia 

TL;DR I think my friend is capable of murdering me or being influenced to do something malicious by the people she meets just to fit in.

356,"Throwaway because i am paranoid about things people might see. I am under the age of 18, for the context of the things I am about to say.  This might be a bit long, apologies for that in advance.  


I used to be very active in certain game communities when I was around 14-15. These communities are primarily made up of people over the age of 20, once again for context. I really had no idea what I was getting into when joining these places, but I ended up making friends with some of the people there. A lot of these people are over the age of 20, which at the time I didn't think was a big deal, so long as they weren't pedophiles. I ended up becoming really closely involved with these people, on the games we would play and on sites like Discord. I didn't really think much of it at all.   
These people were never aware of the fact I was under 18, and most of the people there never ASKED if I was, either. Most of our conversations were usually PG anyways, so again, I never saw a problem with it. I never took in the reality that I was talking to people up to 10-15 years older than me, and I take full responsibility for that.  However, sometime in the middle of this year is when I fully processed what was happening was wrong. Things were starting to make me uncomfortable more than they used to, and I realized maybe what I was becoming a part of was becoming more than I bargained for. There were a lot more adult conversations happening, lots of private emotions and feelings shared and overall things I probably shouldn't have been hearing/reading. I felt weak. I was afraid to say anything in fear of losing the people I trusted. I deeply regret not saying anything earlier. They had even mentioned they would be uncomfortable talking to people near my age, and once again, it is my fault for not communicating to them that I was underage. Both these friends and I lacked communication and that's generally what's caused all these issues.

I had eventually decided to leave their group, and start fresh on private accounts. I do not talk about the communities I used to be apart of in fear that they may find me and know the truth of said things. Yesterday, in a moment of weakness, I decided to check in on my disabled accounts, to find some of the people from the group asking about my wellness and what I had been up to. I had been routinely talking to these people to the point where they had become very closely involved in my life. Some of them even saying they miss me and wondering where I had gone and what I had been doing. Anything I do or say now will most definitely hurt them more than it will me, and that is why I am here.  


I just want closure. I want these people to forget I ever existed and move on from me, I would miss them, but they aren't good for me to be around. I still have accounts for the game we played, and occasionally they try and make contact with me. I have yet to give them the whole truth, and I don't know if I'll be able to. I want this to end well for everyone involved but I'm afraid it won't be that easy. I'm not sure what to do, and I've been sitting on these thoughts for a while.

371,"I'm using a throwaway and keeping this very vague for reasons that will be clear in a second.

I have two kids.  Most of this focuses on my daughter, let's call her Elle.  She's old enough that she understands money pretty well.  She's got a joint savings account with me and gets an allowance for doing chores.  We also play blackjack and poker with change sometimes.  It's good math practice for her, and it's also a good lesson about how you can lose your money gambling.  Elle is still several years away from legal adulthood.

Recently I mentioned buying a couple of lottery tickets and Elle asked if she could buy one with her allowance money.  I explained what the lottery was and that she was probably going to lose her money.  She said she still wanted one.  So I took her money and bought her a ticket.  I figured it would be another good lesson for her about why you should be cautious gambling.  Her ticket won.  Not a little bit of money either.  She'll never have to work as long as she's not careless with the money.

Legally, she's not old enough to gamble so I'll be claiming the winnings obviously.  She's also not old enough to legally manage the money nor does she have the sense to at her age.  The legal stuff I'll talk to an attorney about.  What I'm not sure about is what I should be doing with the money.

Part of me says the winnings are hers and I should just put them in a trust to grow until she's old enough and mature enough to handle getting the money.  Then forget about them and go about my life like normal.  

On the other hand, I could definitely give Elle a better childhood if we used some of the money now.  We live comfortably, but my wife and I both work full time.  We could quit our jobs and spend a lot more time with our kids.  We could travel more.  We could put her in private schools.  We could give her a lot of opportunities that she'd never have without using some of that money.  And our other child would get to reap the benefits as well.

372,"so I‚Äôm 18 and been in quarantine with my mum dad &amp; brother this whole year. on top of that; I just did my first semester of university after graduating high-school during the spring...

there‚Äôs just been a real shift in things at home and I really feel like moving out. I‚Äôve talked about it with my therapists who agree that moving out would be a big step towards feeling better and learning responsibilities as an adult. The only thing is I don‚Äôt have any way to afford it really and because of the ‚Äúmy house, my rules‚Äù idea, they basically have total control over what I do. 

I‚Äôve had bad anxiety and doctors have told me that working a job would not be good for my mental health and also combined with school and other things. So they are in control of money and even the money I do have...they see transactions I make so I can‚Äôt even go out without feeling watched.

I love them a lot and I know they love me and they want to protect me, don‚Äôt want to let go of me and accept I‚Äôm an adult, and they just like control. The other night I was helping a friend gather stuff to bring home for Christmas and my mom said to be home at 11:30 in a text... I asked why and she demanded I come home.... I have no clue why!! I just finished exams and I‚Äôm helping a friend out, not committing a crime. Why do I have a curfew when I can drive and I can very clearly take care of my current responsibilities. 

They also want me to hangout with them...but WHY they normally watch TV (which isn‚Äôt really talking or spending time together), and they say stuff like ‚Äúwill you please spend time with us tonight we just miss you‚Äù... Am I being guilt tripped? I have homework and responsibilities I don‚Äôt know how to fit quality time in anywhere, which makes sense at this age in my opinion. But it makes me feel so guilty and awful and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being rude ....but we don‚Äôt have much in common, when we talk it normally involves me being told abt things I have to do, or some sort of chat like I‚Äôm a third parent to my brother or have to share every part of my life. It‚Äôs so irritating.

I feel pretty bad and when I talk about it with my mom she sort of just says that when I can afford to move out, then I can....IS THAT NORMAL??? Because so many people I know have parents happy to support their kids in moving and are willing to lend money until you have money to pay them back/ making money yourself.... it feels like I get punished for living kinda. I didn‚Äôt ask to be born and it does sort of feel I‚Äôm just being forced to stay here and be unhappy. I won‚Äôt be able to afford a place by myself for a really long time I don‚Äôt have nearly enough saved for rent. 

But yeah 
Is it wrong to not spend time w your family when you‚Äôre a student and an adult literally just trying to get my responsibilities done? 

is it normal for parents to...not financially help kids move out when they‚Äôre adults? 
Or is this weird? 

what can I even do? seriously I don‚Äôt work I‚Äôm a full time student and have so much homework and appointments for mental health and it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre still mad at me even though I‚Äôve been fairly productive. I‚Äôm so upset it feels like I‚Äôll be here forever and everyone else is moving on and taking control of their lives.

Ive lost interest in sports, Im bored of video games, Ive lost interest in engineering (which is what im studying) and im only really doing it for the money, I find it impossible to watch a film because i get bored quickly, Ive lost interest in all my hobbies and i just constantly feel like im in a prison.

I dont really have any friends and im pretty much what you would call a ""loner"". It use to bother me but now i just dont care.

I even use to have bad social anxiety but now i just dont care what others think and in a way it has made me alot more confident but i feel like i have nothing to lose.

I also feel like ive lost empathy and although i dont want to harm anyone but i just dont care who dies or who suffers in this world.

My only interest really is money, I do also from time to time see a woman that i like the look of and think ""i wouldnt mind having sex with her"" but thats about it.

If you seen me in real life i dont look or act like someone who is depressed in fact according to women im attractive (i get compliments and hit more than the average man) and im pretty extroverted/happy but i only act that way.

The reason why i fake it all is because i just dont want to bring anyone else down and i feel like its pretty weak for a man to show his emotions (because other men know what get to you and can take advantage of it).

My girlfriend and I (both 17) had unprotected sex about a week and a half after her period, I‚Äôve been nervous ever since. I had a wet dream the night before but understanding that sperm could be in precum with previous ejaculations I peed before we had sex. I came on her butt but i know it did not drip down into her vagina. She‚Äôs supposed to get her period between the 18th and the 22nd of this month. On the 16th she said she had discharge with just a tiny line of blood. What could this mean? Super nervous.

I've had fits where I cry a little bit for a few years now. In 2020, I've had moments where I just straight up start sobbing for an hour. I have self confidence issues. I really don't like who I am at all. I have trouble telling what my personality is or how I'm feeling. I can't tell if I have a problem, or if its just normal. My heart starts pounding whenever I do something risky, or whenever I think something is off. There's times where I just pace, stuck in thought.

380,"About 7 months ago I met this girl at a new job I started. When we first met I knew I liked her and I asked her out after a few weeks of knowing each other and she told me that she would only ever think of me as a friend and I was completely ok with that. We still talked and as the months went by we became closer and closer with each other. We became so close that it got to the point where we started flirting and going out a lot. Obviously I was like ‚ÄúFat fuckin win.‚Äù As we grew closer and almost more affectionate with each other she told me she was hesitant and almost unwilling to date me because she 1. Had home problems 2. Just got out of a long toxic relationship around the time her and I first met. (Both seniors in highschool btw). I‚Äôve been conflicted for a few months now because we act as a couple, we do couple things and etc. but we‚Äôve never been official. 

So this brings us to present-ish day. After months of that, about 3 weeks ago I decide to kiss her and she kissed me back. Again I see this as a fat win. Well after she went home that night she told me she didn‚Äôt want a relationship just yet. I wanted her to further clarify and she said she wants a relationship with me just not at this exact moment and I thought ‚ÄúCool, we can just be bros I‚Äôm 100% chill with that.‚Äù So for weeks I treat her as just another bro. We hung out Saturday, the 19th of December, and it was just a normal hang out of going to a restaurant and returning to my place and we just talked nerdy stuff and watched movies. Didnt make a move. Made no insinuation that I wanted anything right, because I wanted to respect her wishes. Well towards the end of the evening she said ‚ÄúHey, Panda?‚Äù And I said ‚Äúyeah?‚Äù And she got on top of me and I thought ‚Äú...unexpected but welcomed...‚Äù and we just talked for a bit while she sat on my lap cuddling me and I finally was like ‚Äúoh fuck this.‚Äù And started kissing her to which led to us having sex. SAFELY might I add.

Well after that we talked and she said she wanted to be official and that she liked me and has for awhile but just didn‚Äôt know how to say it. I just told her I understood and that all was ok right and asked if she would be my girlfriend and she said yes. Now here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm confused. She goes home and at this point it‚Äôs pretty late so the only text I really get is a goodnight text ya know. Go to bed and all is normal. Wake up the next day and we say good morning and she asked how I am. I text her back and I realized; she blocked me? I texted her on a different form of social media asking if I did something wrong and she said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fine I just need space.‚Äù When we first met she told me she values space in a relationship and stuff but like we‚Äôd only been dating less then 24 hours officially.

382,"Hello,

So I have been unemployed due to the pandemic since March and I normally work in a customer service/help desk kind of role. I've been constantly applying to random jobs since. I applied to a cashier position at a grocery store and got an interview. When I interviewed, they told me I wouldn't be cashiering I would be outside in the parking lot pushing carts. They said they'd do a background check then call me and it's been a week and a half but no call yet. I don't really want to work outside in the parking lot, they didn't ask me if this was okay, they just started hiring me but I know what it's like to work jobs like that. I am a full-time student, and they know my school is online so they view that as being fully available at places like that with crazy hours. So I've been applying to other jobs hoping to get something else that's more fitted for balancing work and school. I have another interview next week that I'm thinking might be better for me, a cleaning position. 

I feel afraid and not sure what to do because if these positions are too much for me, with work and school, I won't have unemployment as a safety net anymore. It has been so difficult to find work so it seems silly to be picky but I don't want to be so overwhelmed by a job that I can't focus on school. I don't know what to do but I don't want to get stuck in a bad position for myself. I just wish my old work would reopen. 

If I don't get another job by the time they call me can I reject and still get unemployment since it wasn't mandatory to be applying to jobs? How do I know if I am even eligible for the new package and 2021 unemployment? Is it too late to reject the grocery store position? In general, I'm just confused about what this means for me and so I would like help understanding what my options are. 

Thank you very much.",22Dec2020,1

395,"hi all. 

vague backstory cause i don‚Äôt want anyone i know to find this which is also why i made an alt lol. 

so this guy i became better friends with in middle school/freshman year keeps appearing in my dreams. after being friends for a while, he would just hug me all the time (rarely on campus tho) and i didn‚Äôt like it at first cause i‚Äôd never really been hugged at all. the more it happened the more fine i became with it. he hugs everyone though, and the way he talked to me rarely seemed different from how he spoke with others. 

in the beginnings of quarantine, i felt like i was the only one starting conversation on instagram so i just stopped. a few days later he texts me saying he‚Äôs sorry he never talks to me anymore. i say it‚Äôs ok, and it was basically the last time we talked. except for 8 weeks ago when he sent me an animal meme. which i left on seen because i‚Äôd been telling my online friends about him and they said to leave it. 

but now i keep having dreams about him. a few days ago in a small portion of my dream we were going up an escalator with my head on his chest, and days before that a similar thing happened. i just reread that one (i wrote most my dreams in a weak attempt to learn to lucid dream), and i wrote that by the end of the dream we were hugging as if we were getting closer as the dream went on. 

about a week before that one i wrote, ‚Äúi also remember being with [guy] a while after that [random event] had happened. i can‚Äôt remember anything that was said, but i remember feeling confused but like warm and slightly sad? when i woke up? i‚Äôm assuming we were still friends. and probably just hugging or something.‚Äù i barely remember writing this

weeks and weeks before that, i found i wrote, ‚Äú... so [guy] and i went to go sit down somewhere, my head on his shoulder. that part lasted so long, like i was there for ages. it could‚Äôve been [other ex friend] but he was wearing the classic hoodie so [it was guy]‚Äù and after that in all caps was just ‚Äúfuck [guy‚Äôs name]‚Äù and i don‚Äôt remember writing any of that. and i only barely remember the dream. 

there‚Äôs at least one more that‚Äôs way up in the google doc, but i feel like i‚Äôve already given a lot. 

i don‚Äôt know if i should text him?? i mean i feel it‚Äôs sorta clear what the dreams are saying but i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs truly what i want or if i just miss anybody hugging me since i‚Äôve lost all friends over quarantine and haven‚Äôt been outside. 

no, i don‚Äôt think i had a crush on him. i‚Äôm demiromantic ace. i‚Äôve only had one crush and the way i felt about him was nothing compared to the feelings for the other person.

This one time one of my friends was talking about how she had a really bad day at school and she said ""at least your boyfriend is breaking up with you"" she also made us feel bad about not wanting to change the date of our party which was going to be on new years just so she could go. It seems a lot of the time that if she doesn't get her way she makes us feel bad about it. I love her so much but i don't like pointing out when she is wrong especially in her argument with her boyfriend because she has tried to kill herself multiple times and i don't want that to happen again. Basically what I'm asking is am I in the wrong? If I am how can I help her or point out when she is wrong?",22Dec2020,1

407,"As a highschooler, I hate waking up early in the morning to go through classes that bore me to death. I've always felt resentment for school since the very beginning-- but it does make me shiver that 12 year old me wrote down, ""School makes me want to kill myself."" in my old diary.

I don't think I had a normal elementary &amp; middle school life. Used to weigh more &amp; the scars on my legs got me bullied by the boys in my grade. I wasn't smart either &amp; struggled to socialize so I guess I shouldn't be surprised I got outcasted by my peers.

My parents suck. My mom has anger issues, whenever she provokes me I start crying because I'm tired of it &amp; she'd make fun of me. My dad? He does the bare minimum-- but I'm still bothered by what my grandma told me about him buying a car &amp; spending money for his sister's education behind my mom's back. Mom said he apologized, but it still disgusts me whenever I think about it.

Now with quarantine, I have so much time to think about unnecessary things &amp; I keep thinking about that South Korea trip that happened in middle school which I didn't join because my family couldn't afford to send my brother &amp; I. My parents had me make the decision to go to S. Korea without my bro or choose the other cheaper option Malaysia &amp; my bro would be able to join. My stupid ass thought middle school grades mattered (the field trip takes up 30% of your score in the report card) &amp; I wanted to be a good sister so I chose the cheaper option. 

Forward with the future, my bro never really cared about the trip &amp; my dumb ass only realized that middle school grades didn't matter shit when it was too late &amp; that I should've gone to the trip without him since he didn't show interest. I regret not going because it was LITERALLY the only time when I was able to travel to a place I wanted to go to &amp; it really sucks whenever I think about the missed opportunity.

I also live in a developing country that's kind of a shit hole to live in-- can't even fucking walk in the streets, I'd have to travel by car only. Even if I wanted to walk around, the air is polluted &amp; you'd see trash everywhere. This place sucks to live in.

I'm scared I'm going to feel miserable for my whole life &amp; I'm wondering if I should end it.

Some people are going to call me spoiled or selfish, but whatever-- I'm curious what people have to say about my thoughts. I don't expect anyone to give me the ""perfect"" advice, but if there's someone who's willing-- I just want someone to tell me that my life can fucking change-- I'm just done feeling bored to death almost every single day",22Dec2020,1

411,"Hello guys! I'm a 13 year old male and is seeking for help. This has been going for 6 months now and it suddenly just happened, no backstory for it or whatever. My sister is having a sociopathic behavior and is threatening to harm my other family members. She keeps telling me that she's so full of them and she doesn't care even if they die. She said she want to throw a stone into their head till they die of blood loss. She always has a cutter beside her and she said that she won't hesitate to kill my grandparents if they scold her again. I'm aware that some people are sensitive and she is a teenager so mood swings are a thing. I also observed that she is very manipulative to her friends, only using them to benefit from them, she is forcing them to buy stuff for her. She also doesn't care about other's feelings. Recently, my parents confiscate her phone every 10 PM because she won't sleep at all, she stays up for days if she has it, which only made the situation worse. I don't think my parents are aware of this behavior and I'm the only one that is aware of it because she trusts me that I won't tell our parents a thing about what she does but I want her to become a better person and grow up. We were both raised equally and our parents are very good at teaching us stuff. They are really good and I wouldn't want them to be replaced by anyone. We grew in a place where everyone loves us and we also live in a clean and healthy environment. I have no idea what triggered it. Her friends are okay-ish, I talked to some of them and they are normal. I also observed that she has a superiority complex and that she thinks anyone that is lower than her is just a bug (She has the worst grades in class) she is not bullied at all at school and I have no idea what made her like this. Since I'm only a child, I am powerless to these kind of stuff and if I tell somebody they probably won't believe me since she is very good at acting the 'good guy' in front of other people.

412,"Quick context: I have ADHD, and get really excited over really insignificant things, and put really high hopes that people take part in my excitement, or at least humor me. 

TlDr at the bottom

Admittedly, the title sounds a bit harsh, but for a quick bit of story: This is someone whom I've considered to be my closest friend for the better part of the past 4 years of my life. This used to be the only person I trusted with my personal thoughts and feelings and he would do the same back. There were times where we would go over to his house and just talk about what was on our minds, or about what concerned us, and ask each other for input on certain topics. We've helped each other out of respective ruts. I've helped this guy through all the twists and turns, and he's did the same for me, but ever since he last dumped his girlfriend, he has been acting hostile for no reason. Right before he dumped her, I told him he needed to communicate his feelings to her, because the problem they were having was a rerun of his last relationship, and could be easily fixed just by talking it out with her. A week goes by, and he comes to me depressed that he dumped her. He begins the conversation by asserting that he doesn't want any judgement or ""I told you so's"", and I refuse to put my friends under any judgment, so I'm like, ""of course"". He goes on to tell me that he dumped his ex, and I nervously laugh it off (because what was I supposed to say). 

About five minutes later, he begins to get visibly upset with me. He begins to assert that I'm somehow judging him. I assure him that I'm not, but he just keeps getting angrier, so I just leave him to cool down for a bit. A week goes by, and he still asserts that I'm somehow judging him in some way. This goes on to this day, but I still don't have any real feelings on the subject. His temper over the next few weeks becomes obnoxiously easy to burst, leading to merely texting, as he can't handle being around people (or so I thought). About another week in, I notice that I only get to actually visit this guy once a month, meanwhile, he's going to another friends house to drink and get high every single weekend. At first, I don't really have an issue with it, cuz they're friends too, so they have the right to spend time with each other, but soon, I start wondering if maybe I've just done something, because now, I never get invited to hang out. The few times we do talk, I'll often get excited about something and start happily going off about how it interests me and what do I get from him? ""That's crazy- but remind me again.. Who tf asked?"" (This was around the time that the meme was popular) I brushed it off thinking he was just referencing a meme, and didn't actually feel that way, so I was okay with it. For the next few weeks, I would get excited over this and that, and I'd always hear the same thing. Over, and over, and over again. Getting excited about something, and immediately getting told ""I do not care, even a little"", really devastates me. I'd at least think he'd pretend to care.

 Fast forward to now, and he's ghosted me for a month. My other friend adds me and him to a group chat with my other friend's girlfriend to reconnect. I take this opportunity to ask my body friend why he's ghosted me for a month. ""Because you're annoying."" Because I'm annoying. I can admit, I've been really annoying in the past, but I've been getting really good at calming myself down, and I find it funny that all of my friends that have been talking with me agree that I've been doing better. I've tried to invite this guy, whom I've called my closest friend to everything, and he couldn't even type ""N-O"". Not once did I ever hear from this guy, over a month, no context until he's forced to interact with me.

 I've been thinking over it for a week, and I just don't think its best for myself to associate with this guy anymore.

The problem is me. In ALL of my relationships, I've always reached a point where I got really bored of the relationship and the guy. It's inevitable.

429,"TLDR at the bottom;

I'd like to preface this with I think I have a good relationship with my brother despite any grief we give each other over this and that I think we're both in the wrong on this one.

Lately I've had trouble having a ""normal"" conversation with my little brother (I'm 26M and my brother is 22). 

We are both very geeky/nerdy and tend to talk about such related things with a passion. This usually leads to us talking at length about these subjects and getting into it with mixed results. Mind you that we also talk about other things and the subjects themselves don't actually matter within this context, just that we can really get going about these things sometimes.

Recently, arguments between us have broken out on how we actually have these conversations and inevitably leading to either one of us ending the conversation due to general frustration on the whole front. We've talked about it and it seems that three issues have cropped up: length, interruptions, and interest.

Length is an issue because we both tend to talk a lot about the things we are passionate about. I tend to talk/ramble a lot more than my brother on most subjects and he seems to be getting more annoyed by this. I've tried shortening my explanations in most cases because I'm aware of my problem, but sometimes it's still a little long. My brother might also have this issue to an extent, but refuses to recognize his ability to do the same, citing me as a comparison.

Interruptions, probably due in part to our ability to talk for long periods, have become more common. Sometimes it's a non issue as we try to wait for a polite time to do so, but other times it is a matter of contention between us. We either lose our train of thought as someone jumps in to have their input on something we said or a thought runs us by as we can't get a word in edgewise. I don't believe we purposely interrupt each other most of the time unless we think it extremely important to the conversation, but I know we both do so accidently frequently as either of us pause for breath.

As to interest, we tend to talk about all of our interests with each other and get excited when either of us thinks we can get the other invested in something that recently came up in one of our hobbies or ideas. The problem with this lies in the fact, as two individuals, we may share many interests, but we don't share everything we may have dipped into. Basically it boils down to talk about something one of us isn't interested in, but the other is indeed and one of us getting angry that they aren't paying attention. Childish I know... I try to put in effort to be polite or develop genuine interest, but it's a little demoralizing when my brother doesn't feel like doing the same for me but gets mad when I stop showing him the courtesy.

I've tried to be polite about this and to his credit he's tried to do the same, but seems to think I'm the one at fault most of the time within our conversations. He's gotten quite mad at me when I've pointed to both our faults in trying to converse with one another and me basically telling him it's either it is what it is, in which case there isn't any point in getting mad about it and ending discussion abruptly because of it, or trying to figure out a solution together on how to get better about this, which he doesn't seem interested in.

Now I believe we are both good people, good brothers to one another, and we typically enjoy our company together... but it's been extremely demoralizing and frustrating to have a fun and interesting conversation end abruptly with both of us getting frustrated about the whole thing...

I'm not entirely sure how we can work together about this whole thing and I have no idea how to talk to him about it. Despite my talk on my ability to have long conversations, I'm not socially adept at all and am at loss a what to actually do in this situation. What do you think I might be able to do?

P.S. Not explicitly diagnosed as such, but both family and friends say I may be high functioning on the spectrum... so it may actually be just my fault but I don't know...

TLDR; My brother and I are recently having troubles in our conversations due to discussion length, interruptions, and waning interest in the other's non-mutual excitement about certain topics.",22Dec2020,1

440,"My boyfriend stopped taking his antidepressants in July. Then got really depressed, no surprise there. He didn‚Äôt talk to me for a few days because he was in a bad place. He lives with his grandparents that know about his depression so I told them what was happening.

They booked him a doctors appointment and he got more medication. A few days later he seemed better. Then a week later I find out he isn‚Äôt taking them. I try to get him to take them but ultimately it‚Äôs his body so it‚Äôs his choice. 

The only thing is, he still collects them so his grandparents think he‚Äôs taking them. I guess so they don‚Äôt worry. The last few days he seems depressed again and I messaged his gran to ask if things were ok. She said he has a doctors appointment Thursday to get more so he will be fine then. The thing is I know he hasn‚Äôt taken a single one since July, and doesn‚Äôt intend on taking any. He just going to please them. He has boxes of the stuff, claims it‚Äôs good to have a ‚Äúcollection‚Äù. Often talks about suicide etc but I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs joking or not as he has a dark sense of humour.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I want my boyfriend to trust me but at the same time I feel like I‚Äôm lying to his family. Do I just leave it and not get involved or tell them what‚Äôs really going on? I feel like he‚Äôs not going to ever get better if something doesn‚Äôt change.",22Dec2020,1
441," My partner and their ex broke up in November of last year, and we got together in December, and officially dating in April of this year.
Now I am usually not one that thinks exes can‚Äôt be friends, but we met right after they broke up and my partner still wants to be close friends to the point they said they‚Äôd resent me if I didn‚Äôt let it happen. My partner says that even though it was 7 years of bullshit and on and off, the root of them was always their friendship and even when they would break up, they‚Äôd be really good friends, so I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm just a place holder. My partner has assured me that they are done for good, and they agreed they should‚Äôve never dated to being with.
I know 7 years is a long time, but shouldn‚Äôt there be some sort of cool down period, otherwise it makes me think it‚Äôs holding on to the person and not the friendship. 

I want to be mature about the situation, but the way the ex gets mad if my partner isn‚Äôt available, or when my partner asks me if it‚Äôs okay for some things makes me feel it‚Äôs more than a friendship",22Dec2020,1

443,"I'm 22 (F) recently graduated, have quite a lot in savings, and landed a full-time job which started a few weeks ago. I have been living with my parents all these years and feel like I've been sheltered my whole life. Didn't move out during college as most people in Australia go to school in their city.

My very responsible family friend told me last week that she's planning on moving out so I told her I want to join her and she was fully into the idea. My parents used to really admire her but now they're blaming her for putting this crazy idea into my head. I told them I've always wanted to move out for my own personal development. I want to be able to pay my own bills, clean my own clothes, cook for myself. My dad thinks this is all an excuse and that's not the real reason. I honestly don't know what he's talking about but that really is my reason!!

Now they laid down a list of reasons why they don't support my decision:
1. They don't want me to pay rent as I'm wasting it paying for other people's mortgage
2. They want me to be safe during COVID. (I'm planning on moving out in an apartment in the city. There has recently been a small spike in other states but where I'm from there's 0 locally acquired cases so I feel like they're being too overprotective)
3. They're telling me that I can learn independence at their house by paying rent and doing everything I want to do by myself at home. (They've never asked me to pay them ever and I told them that even if I do that, I'm still in my comfort zone so again, I think this is a ridiculous reason)

Another reason I want to move out is that it takes 1.5 hours to travel into the city where I'm currently living and my workplace has announced that they want to transition to 2 days a week in the office and 3 days working from home by the end of Jan. I've had so many awkward conversations at work when I'm asked where I'm from and I have to say I live more than an hour away in my parents house. I really just want to be more independent .

My parents aren't the super strict Asian type. They let me go out for drinks with my friends, sleep over, and travel wherever I want. I love them with all my heart and I know they always want the best for me. They've helped me all these years, given me everything I needed for school, and have always shown love. But now they're taking it too far by saying I'm ungrateful for making moving out my top priority right after I graduated and am earning a lot more money when they've always supported me. I told them I've always wanted to move out as I think it will help me grow as a person. It was never a priority, the timing was just right as my family friend was already thinking of it and I never really knew who to move out with before that. My mum told me to wait 6 months when covid settles down to start looking for apartments but I honestly think that's just an excuse to keep me with them for longer and they would probably say the exact same reasons again after 6 months.

Back in the country they're originally from, the children don't really move put until they're married so I get why they don't understand my decision. It's just a shame that they think I'm betraying them. 

Please give me advice on how I can persuade them to let me grow up!",22Dec2020,1

I hope the link is visible. If not please read my last posts. I dont know what to do in this situation.  Anyway today my bf told me this : http://imgur.com/a/aymHxg2

Apparently he claims he is broke at the moment but he made great plan for the next month that would help him get back at his feet. He requested for some type of card like Walmart gift card for him to eat. Should I buy him one or no since all the shitty things that happened yesterday? In all honesty I feel like my parents lied to the police since they lied to the police about me but I dont want to jump to conclusions.  In all honesty I feel like he isnt bad. He has helped.me when I was depressed and what not. When I told him (my boyfriend) there is investigation by the police against him he said this: practically all is okay, albeit it's all dramatic (I dont have anything to hide) no police contacted me.

Seems to be a common narrative of people in their 20's, or people of any age who are still figuring life out/didn't have such a great start. Because of financial difficulties (just our economy TBH - I'm not special, in fact rather privileged!), I'm forced to stay at home with parents, one of whom is wonderful and puts in the effort to make sure things go smoothly (chores, food, fun activities to stay sane, errands, healthy communication etc), and another who is a giant man baby who can't be relied on to literally fold clothes without throwing a tantrum because he's been asked to do it 5 times. I've tried everything to make him understand how selfish, inconsiderate and hurtful he's being by ignoring his two other family member who have to live with him. He's barely worked since lockdown began but that's actually made him worse to be around, easy to snap, emotionally unavailable, in his own world. Men who treat me this way go straight in the trash. But I'm forced to live with him because I can't move out on my current salary.   


Currently I'm just playing the long game and saving up, but I'm turning to alcohol and drugs to cope with his behaviour, because I can't relax in this house, even when I'm alone.

So my sister ordered it friday from the official HP store and it was said to be delivered the next day. So i waited the whole saturday on my package because i was so hyped. Eventually i heard a door bell, i looked out the window and the dude says: package (in dutch is sounds better) in a casual way, not even asking for name or signature which i was fine with.  Also worth to note my sister was not home at the time and was working so she couldn't have checked. So my mother checks the package and it is too small for a laptop to be in it. My sister comes home and we discover it is a phone which we did not order and we got the wrong package. My sister calls the delivery company and they say that they don't know where the package is or what happened to it and say they can't help because it is weekend. So monday was my birthday which i was sad on because of the problem but didnt  spoil my day. Now the package is under ""investigation"" and i heard it could take up to 2 weeks which then my vacation will end (i'm still in school). So my vacation is probably f*cked and so is my christmas.

a few years ago I(F17) had a best friend that was like a sister to me but we parted ways because she started doing drugs. My mom always liked her but ever since she can‚Äôt let her go when I have and it‚Äôs so extremely frustrating to me. I can understand it since my old best friend lost her mother to cancer, but my mom just HAS to do the small annoying things that actually breaks me a lot more than I could understand.

I'm part of a religious family where alcohol and drugs are not allowed.

About 4 months ago I found an empty whisky bottle in my little sisters room (f18) at the time, I took her out to speak with her, which is unusual for her because we not really close. But anyway I had words with her and made her aware she shouldn't be drinking on the house and she should drink responsibly and not get wasted which what she was doing.

3 weeks ago my mum calls me and said they caught my little sister drunk to which she swore at my siblings and parents and called then she called the police as she said she's been mentally abused at home. 

Long story short we find out shes been dating a man from her work who is in his 40's has 2 kids and has been grooming her, buying her alcohol bottles etc. Whos also a dealer and went prison before. My sister ran away from the house that night and came two days later.

When we confronted her as a family she said she realised she wants to stop dating this man and its not for her. But part of me feels she is lying and saying that so we get of her back. Also my dad found around 10 bottles of alcohol from her room so its clear she's been drinking alone. 

I tried to open up to my sister and say I dont judge her and think bad of her and I want to help. But she seems like shes not showing me her real self and is always putting on a front and pretending shes okay.

I told her il pay a therapist to speak with her, she refuses and says she doesn't need it. 

I offered her to come around my house to train at my home gym. She said she can't be bothered.

If I sell a lot I get tons of money back, if not, I just get minimum wage. When I got home to tell the good news that I was hired the first thing that they said wasnt anything like good job, or finally, no, they said why dont you just get a normal job a the grocery store? Like what why? If I do bad at the job I currently have I get minimum wage and if I work at a grocery store I get minimum wage anyway. And now being a week ago that I got hired, I heard AT LEAST 1 time a day that I should get another job instead of the one I currently have because they dont think I can make it work.

Because I dont have any expenses cuz I live with my parents I like to go high risk high reward, even tho this isnt neccersairly high risk cuz it pays minumwage anyway.

To get to the point, may it be school, sports or jobs, I always get shit over me. I'd be fine with not getting any ""good jobs"" but if you're just gonna complain anyway why not just stop interfering with everything I do right?

Feel like I have a solid product at a super obtainable price point. However, I began running ads on TikTok which drove a decent amount of traffic to my website with literally 0 conversions. Is there anything about the site that turns you off when you enter? Anything from Grammar issues to photo usage/placement.

I fear my ad might just be engaging with too young of an audience due to the fact I had marketing on TikTok in mind when creating it. This is my first store and I finally got an Instagram Ad running today, I see within the insights that the primary age group engaging with it is 13-17.

keep in mind the TikTok campaign I ran was technically directed toward traffic rather than conversions only because the ridiculous recommended bid price of $22 CPA on TikTok. Its impossible for this product to have margins that big so I figured I'd try a traffic oriented campaign.

What I mean is the FUTURE, THE UNKNOWN. Something that you can‚Äôt predict.

477,"I postet this on other subreddits before but I haven't gotten any anwsers yet.
So I wonderd if someone maybe knows something about this.
Sometimes I get nervouse for no reason, okay cool nothing new here. But lately this weird thing happens were I am sitting or lying somewhere and suddenly I jump up in fear? It feels similar like getting jumpscared in a videogame or movie but there is nothing that really triggers it? Sometimes it's really intense like the jumpscare example where I am terrified for a second but then I'm okay again maybe a little bit shaken but a while latter it happens again?
Othertimes I only wince hard but I am barely afraid. 
Yesterday this happend about 15 times one of them being very intense. I was doing something on my phone and suddenly I just threw it away in fear and jumped up heart pounding only to then wonder what the hell just happend.
Does anybody has some simular experiences or maybe even an idea why this is happening?
I would be very gratefull for some advice on this.",22Dec2020,1

479,"(abuse cw) 

Didn't realize how fucked up this was until I started typing it out, but it's actually not as bad as it sounds. We're both 18, if that matters.

Anyway - my boyfriend and I were both technically virgins until we met eachother. I told him that, so he was confused when I. Well. Knew exactly what I was doing when I gave him head. He jokingly asked me ""where I learned that"" and I think I just told him beginners luck or some shit. Everytime I do it now, he'll ask or make some vague illusion to the question. I guess he thinks I lied about being a virgin and had a secret lover or something. 

Anyway, I don't really want to tell him I was molested as a kid and that's probably why, because that's a) fucked up and sad and he'll think about it every time, b) kind of mood ruining and c) private and I can't be bothered to deal with it.

Do I lie or just keep dodging the question? I could tell him to stop asking, but that makes it even more suspicious.",22Dec2020,1

483,"I'm a freshman in college and I'm about to make a decision about switching majors. My previous semester was very exhausting. I expected to do poorly but I made it in the end. By the end of the semester it was clear to me that I disliked my major. I had neither aptitude nor passion for my major. So I decided to switch majors. This time I've picked something that I find to be more meaningful/sensible. 

However, I'm not really interested in it. I don't really have passion for it. I have some experience with the subject but I'm not particularly interested in it. I'm just more comfortable with it than my previous major but that may change. In general, I'm not really interested in any particular major/subject. But this is my last chance. I can't switch majors again after this. So how do I decide if I want to switch or not? In the event that I switch, how do I teach myself to be interested in my new major? In the event that I don't switch, how do I do the same for my current major?

Outside of college, how do I learn to develop an interest for something on command?",22Dec2020,1
484,"So for context- I'm Robin, 15 years old, and I use she/he/they pronouns and massive trigger warning
So I deal with a lot of mental and physical health issues, I've been struggling with anxiety for as long as I can remember, and am currently struggling with an eating disorder. My parents refuse to get me diagnosed for anything, yet they had a psychiatrist prescribe me antidepressants back in June (I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for a long time, but I only came to them because I ended up having constant thoughts of overdosing) Things have been getting worse and worse, and I've just been losing all my motivation, quarantine hasn't helped at all. I broke up with a toxic and manipulative ex in August, and I've been scared to go back to school in person with her, she was always really sexual with me and consent wasn't really her thing- I don't feel like I deserve to be with my current girlfriend, I feel like I'm too ugly and sensitive to get to be with her, but I love dating her and she really is my favorite person. My grades have been getting worse and I honestly just don't care anymore, I'm convinced that I'm gonna die young anyway, and I recently stopped bothering to take my medication. My mom hates me, and my family constantly uses my old name when referring to me, but they get mad at me when I try to correct them. I'm not out to half of my family, and I honestly don't see the point anymore. I've just been holding on to the idea that when I get older I'll get cosmetic surgery and my life will start to get better, but I don't see the point in that either, it all seems like a waste of time. I don't get out of bed anymore because I have to see my family, and I don't go outside very much anymore because I'm so insecure about my appearance. My mental health has been completely going down the drain and my girlfriend has been witnessing it all, when I met her I was really happy and peppy and energetic, and now I have a hard time finding the motivation to get out of bed in the morning. My dad has been trying to find me a therapist, but my mom doesn't really like me all that much and doesn't see the point in trying to find me help, she's insanely religious and whenever I come to her with an issue, she talks about how I wouldn't be struggling so much if I just went to church more often and hung out with the youth group, even though I've been very clear that it makes me uncomfortable. My dad got me a hamster the first time he noticed something was up because he thought having a little friend would cheer me up, and the little guy has been there for me when I really just needed to calm down and sit with a pet, but he's gonna die soon, and is already sick. My parents aren't bothering to take him to an exotic vet, which I understand because it's expensive and they probably won't be able to do anything, but it still hurts to know that he's gonna leave me soon. Overall I've lost motivation to do anything, and it's been showing. My girlfriend gets worried about me more often, and there's always an underlying unhappy feeling whenever we talk. I don't want my issues to affect her, and I promised her I didn't need any help, but it's just been getting more and more difficult to ignore the problem. I don't want us to break up because of this, but it feels like I don't know who I am anymore when I'm with her, it's just so frustrating that I can't just act the way I used to with her, it's always too much energy or not enough and she gets worried about me.",22Dec2020,1

500,"So I (23F) have been best friends with my friend let's call her A for past 3 years.  So U and I became friends with this guy B (my boyfriend) in 2019 and as he was our batch mate we all became really good friends instantly. But then B and I had some different kind of chemistry while B always said for him both A and I were equal but everyone around us thought he was a little bias towards me. 

The fact that we met B when I was completely suicidal and was about to kill myself, he was the one who called me when I was trying to reach out to everyone I trusted even A and she said everyone was dealing with something or the other so I should know how to deal with my issues as no one can be always there for me. While A was going through a bad breakup both of us got really attached to B and then one day randomly B and I had a conversation about how we felt for each other and then ended up being in a relationship in short. 

We almost instantly told A about it expecting that as she is out best friend this will make her happy as we were happy. But she reacted in a very odd way. Started fighting with me, then called another guy friend and ended up dating him despite the fact that she humiliated that guy when he asked her out 2 years ago. 

Now for the past whole year A has become extremely cold with me and only talks with me nicely when we are around B. She also has actively tried creating misunderstandings between B and I by saying how he filled a void in my life and I don't actually love him or value his presence. She has also told him that I'm not the person one should expect a lot from as they'll get hurt in the end. 

She tried using my guy friend's name and said in reality I have feelings for him which is BS. Both B and I have distant ourselves from her as because of her we were starting to have numerous arguments and she used to smile and say that maybe B and I aren't as perfect as we show, when I was breaking down in university. But for me she was and still very important I don't like losing friends. And her not being around breaks my heart which has now started making B uncomfortable as he thinks I value A more. I love B a lot but I am still going through this trauma of losing A who according to everyone around me was a fake, selfish and jealous friend. 

She has also tried spreading rumors that I was found making out with guys while I'm in a relationship. I wouldn't have believed it if her boyfriend didn't say this to me on my face. The most annoying thing is her boyfriend tried touching me when we went to meet him along with that he keeps on flirting with me (I didn't mind it much as he was a good friend and usually used to randomly flirt which I thought was a joke) but now when he talks it is purposely to degrade my boyfriend and our relationship. They both act extremely fake, there relationship feels like it is a show for us which is very bothersome as I do care for A and I don't want her to mess her life.",22Dec2020,1
501,"Sorry this is so long... TL;DR member of staff uses very harsh language and aversive methods with a boy with Down‚Äôs syndrome in the school I work in. He also leaves him by himself when he‚Äôs supposed to support him. The child can‚Äôt report his experience as he can‚Äôt communicate well, and my reports of events seem to be falling on deaf ears. 


...


I am a very new member of staff at a mainstream school, and I work with students with learning disabilities in a big department. We all work with 1 specific child but sometimes we cover each other. I work with the same year group (9-10 year olds) as around 5 other members of staff, and we share a communal space where we can take the children out of classes to do tasks. I usually only use the communal area very rarely. 

In my second week of working at the school I took the child I was supporting into the communal area, and after doing some work I allowed her a break. I caught sight of a member of staff I hadn‚Äôt interacted with much before, let‚Äôs call him Clive. Clive has worked at the school for 5+ years. Clive was sat with a 9 year old boy who has Down‚Äôs syndrome as well as other specific learning disabilities. Let‚Äôs call him Tom. He finds communication very hard and communicates mainly by repeating words or phrases that you have said to him, and some sign language. He cannot yet read or write.

I was surprised that Clive seemed to be forcing Tom to read from a children‚Äôs book, which I know he‚Äôs not capable of doing. He can recognise a few letters and was trying to sound them out, but whenever he stumbled Clive would shout his name and reprimand him. When Tom looked away or showed discomfort Clive would grab his face to force eye contact, and reprimand him. Then (and this was the final straw) Tom began to become very unsettled and started to cry, and Clive told him ‚Äúyou are very stupid, I can‚Äôt believe you can‚Äôt read, you are a stupid boy.‚Äù Tom was hysterical. 

I really didn‚Äôt think this was okay. I regret now that I wasn‚Äôt brave enough to intervene, but I did and still consider Clive to be sort of a superior (even though he‚Äôs technically not and we have the same job.) Also I didn‚Äôt want to lose my job in the first month by getting into fights with other members of staff. 

I reported what I saw straight to my manager. She seemed very non committal/unconcerned but said she was would follow it up. 

Now, things didn‚Äôt end there. Since then (and in the last 2 months) I have seen the same situation play out multiple times with Clive and Tom. He uses a lot of abusive language when working with Tom, even when fully visible in the communal space. He calls him stupid, ugly, dumb, he says to him ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in charge of you‚Äù when asking Tom to do things for him. 

We are required to support the children all day (someone covers us for lunch) and always supervise them as many need assistance with basic skills and tasks. I have noticed that Clive often leaves Tom by himself in small rooms around the school intended for a quiet/break space. This is dangerous and cruel as Tom needs assistance with basic things, including things like opening doors and going to the bathroom. He cannot be left by himself. 

I made a follow up report to my manager about 4 weeks ago of these instances, this time in a detailed email with time stamps. I didn‚Äôt receive a response, so went by the office and asked if it had been received. Again I received a very non committal response, ‚Äúyes it was received, I haven‚Äôt looked over it yet as I am very busy.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs now looking like nothing might be done about this situation, and even that managers might be aware of it/fine with it. I know this kind of shit happens all the time in special education provision, but I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs okay and don‚Äôt want to let it slide. Obviously a difficult hurdle to bypass is that Tom is not able to explain his side of the story and can‚Äôt corroborate my version of events as he doesn‚Äôt have the ability to do so. 

What‚Äôs my next step here? Is this appropriate to report to safeguarding? I am scared I will be met with a lot of resistance as I am reporting something from within the school. How can I appropriately escalate this, and is it worth doing so?",22Dec2020,1
502,"I‚Äôm living in a 4 bed/1.5 bath with 4 people currently. One of my roommates friends is a big advocate for the BLM movement (as am I and I have done the work to improve my allyship). At the beginning of the year, one of her BIPOC friends was over and thought my usage of the word ‚Äúboof‚Äù (which I corrected myself upon immediately before being called out) was a micro aggression towards her as she claimed it was AAVE. Although I would never invalidate a lived experience of another, I wasn‚Äôt shocked that this person who hardly knows me didn‚Äôt address it on the spot and deflected to my roommate. I figured that she may be shy or anxious to call someone out, completely fine. I have since done a lot of researching and learning from my mistake.

My girlfriend and I (both 17) had unprotected sex about a week and a half after her period, I‚Äôve been nervous ever since.

507,"This is my first ever post on Reddit. I've only ever seen rSlash videos regarding it, so bear with me if I'm a little new or overlooked something. **Warning**: This post *does* contain some sensitive subjects and unpleasant imagery. 

I'm having some serious trouble trying to make a major decision. I legitimately have no one else to go to, and would really appreciate some advice from people who are outside the situation, because I'm in too deep to make a decision.

It requires a bit of backstory. I (19 F) live with my mother, step-father, and sister. I have a boyfriend of three years now that I love very dearly, who treats me with all the care and respect I could ever hope for. I admittedly have some anxiety problems, namely trouble with big crowds, cracking under pressure (real or perceived), unable to handle screaming, ect.

Up until now, my biggest goal in life was probably to graduate high school. It's what my parents always wanted since neither of them graduated, and it was a true focus of mine, to the point of not trying to branch out, follow any passions in a way that mattered, or even get a part-time job despite thinking about it. Graduating was ridiculously difficult, mostly because of some situations that came up in changes made due to COVID-19, but I *did* Graduate (with Honors).

Around one and a half months before I was done, my mother got hurt. We found out she'd been attempting to nurse a wound and cellulitis infection on her own as to not spend money going to the hospital. We weren't doing the best financially and had no health insurance since she was in-between jobs (my mom is the only one who works). By the time we realized how bad it was, she could barely walk, and we had to take her to the hospital in an ambulance. There, she was kept in *terrible* conditions in an isolated room, left drugged up and sometimes ignored to the point of staff leaving her sitting in her own urine. We weren't allowed visitation due to COVID, and eventually, they discharged her without ever knowing what was wrong. Even the nurse who checked her out was heavily confused, but we were just happy Mom was home.

Upon getting her back, we were horrified by her condition. She had many bruises from needles (my mother is overweight, so they tested her for lots of things that they could blame this on, even when she told them she'd been tested before and to look at her medical records). She also had terrible bedsores on the backs of her legs. She could barely even touch her knee without yelling in pain, and they'd given her *blood thinners* (which she **did not** need), no pain medication. Even now, she has permanent scars from her time there.

Outraged, we attempted to sue the hospital. The lawyer we told about the situation (a family friend) wanted to help, but advised that it'd never go through. In the area I live, specifically, there's a loophole in the law that's meant to protect hospitals. In our case, it just prevents us from getting compensation. There's literally nothing we could have done unless my mom had *died* while being ""cared for.""

Long story short, we've been taking care of my mother at home, trying our best (none of us have medical history except for her; she used to work as a physical therapist). It's been difficult, and she needs a lot of help throughout the day as she cannot walk at all. It's gotten a lot better since that first month since she was home, especially since she stopped taking the blood thinners (they only did harm). She can now sit up on her bed, move her leg, and even stand for a couple seconds with my step-father and I holding her up.

...Here's where the conflict comes in. My step-father, while certainly loving my sister and I in his own way, is a very difficult person to deal with. He's diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, and the stress has been very hard on him. Even before now, he's been known to have a short temper and break into fits of completely illogical thinking (mostly when feeling defensive). He'll often insult us, yell at us, belittle us, and even antagonize us if he's angry with something we said or did (or didn't say or do). He'll, at times, try to twist the situation in his favor or convince us that something is a certain way, even if it sounds ridiculous.

As you can imagine, putting a person like him in this situation has resulted in difficult days. Sometimes he seems fine, if not teasing a bit or play-arguing. Other times, he will intentionally make my mother's life miserable. He'll call her names, yell about her uselessness, and punish her in different small ways for having to help her (sticking things to her legs, making fun of her, telling her he would have killed himself by now, giving the silent treatment, ect.) He's made her cry more than several times, and once she starts getting emotional, he'll accuse her of being too dramatic or irrational to talk with and ignore her. It's escalated as far as them having to question if he even loved her, and whether he was staying to make it work or just waiting to leave her once she can walk again.

I'm admittedly the most patient with her, as my sister is only 13 and gets annoyed easily (although she's a good kid). I end up being asked to help often, which feels unfair at times, but at the end of the day I don't mind it. As all of this is going on, my step-father's pushing me to do something with my life, and Mom shares the opinion. Despite them always treating me closer to an adult than a child, I wasn't prepared for them to expect me to throw myself into something as soon as I graduated. Dad keeps telling me to take a college class, just so I can check the ""some college"" box on a resume. Mom wants me to try different things, maybe learn about a trade, and to take that class. Both have mentioned different job opportunities and the like. Step-father has taken it so far as to imply I won't be welcome if I don't do something.

As ashamed as I am to admit it, I don't even have my driver's licence. I tried to get it while in school, but my step-father stopped taking me to learn after a while. I *can* drive thanks to lots of practice, some with my Bio father (completely different shade of crazy, but I visited him once or twice a year growing up). I figure that should be the first step, but I have no car to practice with, as my step-father's car is fairly dead at this point (not my fault at all, btw). So I started looking for something I could do that I didn't need to leave home for, like that class. Or even a job that wasn't too far away from home, or my boyfriend's job, so he might be able to drive me there.

...But it's just too much. I love my step-father, he helped raise me, but I just hate being in the house with him now. He's continuously 'reminded' me that he still has control over me as long as I ""live under his roof"" (paid for by my mother), ""even if you're 30."" He tells me he's still my parent and can still order me around, punish me, and restrict certain things (like wifi and belongings) from me. It's clear he doesn't respect me, and has in the past complained that I'm weak and cowardly (I cry easily). He also once told me he ""failed me as a parent"" when I was 17. It's fairly clear what his views of me are. I was the ""first born"" that they screwed up on, and now they've learned form their mistakes and are doing better with my sister. (And yes, he said this.)

I've spent more and more time at my boyfriend's house, dreading coming home, but unable to stay away for too long without feeling very guilty about leaving Mom. I really want to get a job, and personally, I don't actually want to go to college (at least, not yet). It's a terrifying concept, since I'm trying to get over the more anxious and self-loathing sides of me, but I feel a deep-rooted need to just get away and start doing something with my life, even if it's just working somewhere part-time or feeling like I have a place that's my own. I feel weighted down by this house.

It's okay here right now with all the recent ""holiday joy,"" but I know the cycle, and it's going to keep repeating. He always oversteps, then back-peddles the next day when he realizes he went too far and Mom might actually leave him. Everything's fine for a little while, then it slowly works back up to shouting and crying for everyone involved, and him somehow feeling justified in everything he does despite claiming that he ""knows he's a terrible person."" I know Mom can't afford a live-in nurse, but I find myself constantly wishing I lived on my own or with my boyfriend.

If I just picked up and left right now, I'm certain my boyfriend would accept me with open arms, though I'd have to start working soon and pulling my weight (of course). But I can't just leave Mom alone with one less person to take care of her, especially when one of them left to help is my step-father. I also have the option of just leaving everything to live in Nevada with my Bio father for a while, who would let me take some time to myself (although is far more likely to push me into going to college for real, and judging me for not being exactly who he wanted me to be). That last one is an option I never really considered, and to be honest, I'm not even sure if I do now.

I'm so torn. I feel so unproductive here, like I'll never amount to anything, and I lose any ounce of motivation I have to pursue what I want to. I feel so much better when I'm out of the house, and have even gotten some writing/game design done while at my boyfriend's house. Then again, I'm reminded how much self-improvement I need when I start freezing up or getting nervous in public. I feel so guilty when I'm away for too long (3 days or more, sometimes less). I love my mom with all my heart, and I'm despising my step-father more and more.

So, please....what should I do?",22Dec2020,1
508,"If I'm out with my friends and I see some distant acquaintance or basically anyone who has even the slightest presence in my life (even if we've never interacted), I get super self conscious, I start caring a lot about what they think of me and how they'll perceive me/if they'll judge me etc. Idk why I do that but my behaviour becomes more guarded and reserved.

509,"I am 20 Male and soon to be 21 worst part that I am an Indian so you know the competition here. I am in a lower-middle-class family. The thing is that I never got any good grades since most of the things here just mugging up (you'll hear a lot of people say it isn't so but I promise you that ain't true) and that is what I can't do. Due to that I never got any good College and didn't even get my favorite subjects to study (yes we choose subjects and are selectable according to grades). And now coming to this age I am feeling lost I don't even know what to do next my family is already asking me, ""What are your plans?"" and I don't have the slightest idea what to do.

I feel super-insecure about my future since I had big dreams and worked and still work for them very hard studying what I loved from the internet but here in India, you need to show papers. God damn papers to prove what you are capable of! When I see all these people on LinkedIn studying in amazing universities and studying all those things that I wanted to learn forever I feel bad, destroyed, and feel like I have lost everything.

I even suffer from a chronic disease that has no cure (Psoriasis if you're curious to know), and it ruins my body and face. Now that makes me good for nothing.

I have seen and heard several people say that things will work out, good things will happen, and other shit. But it never happens it draws me even closer to anxiety, depression, and feel that I am worthless, a loser, and nothing but just a douchebag. All I can do is brag and say shit. I got no friends from the very start because of my disease, I got no money to afford some good education, I got no good grades to get into amazing colleges, nothing that makes me feel like me.

When I follow the advice offered on the internet that finds something that you love. Well, I love a lot of things I can sing and play guitar amazingly well (helps me deal with depression for a while), I can speak 4-5 different languages well (and learning more since they are fun), I can code in several programming languages well (I love computers and mathematics ), I can draw (draw the hell out of my mind makes me escape reality), and many things too. And I love everything.

But still, I feel lost, desperate, looking at how much others have accomplished at my age I feel like I have achieved nothing but pure shit. Sometimes I even complain that why were others given opportunities and not me. Why were others given maturity right at the time they needed it and not me. But then I realize that it is as it is and what gone is gone.

And here I am writing my pain out. I am not bragging since I can't, you're certainly better and way ahead of me. Every single day as time goes I feel even sadder that soon I'll end up in the streets and all my dreams are gonna go to hell. I will never be able to travel to places that I forever wanted to go, that I'll never be able to achieve what I wanted to.

Everyone seems to be happy and doing what they want and here I am doing everything and have done literally everything that I can do to figure things out but nothing worked. Did everything others said did everything my mind said still lost and now when I look forward towards my future I only get one thing in my mind, ""Boy! Get ready for a ride in hell!""",22Dec2020,1

Therefore, I have about three and a half years until that comes. I'm looking for advice on two different things:

1. How do I physically prepare? How do I go from the skinny, unfit kid I am now to the level of fitness I'd need to excel at OCS? What kind of exercises should I do? How much should I start out with and then build up to? How do I start? How do I stay motivated to continue physical fitness exercises?
2. How do I mentally prepare? How do I prepare for the intensity that is the military? How do I keep myself motivated despite so many struggles and challenges I will certainly face?

519,"A family member of ours is asking us to watch their kids while they are at the hospital giving birth to another kid. They wanted to write up an agreement of how we will care for their kids and for us to sign it. We already agreed to their do‚Äôs and dont‚Äôs of caring for their kids on verbally. They said they want it written down so there are no ‚Äúloopholes‚Äù, so we are all in agreement and there is no misunderstanding or going back on what was agreed, and because we are ‚Äútaking their kids‚Äù. Note: we did not ask for this. They asked us to watch their kids and to take off several days of work ourselves. 

Our concern is that we might get sued by them and end up spending money if they sue us for some reason. A thought comes to mind is if circumstances prevent us from helping exactly they way they want and then they may find a paid caretaker and then sue us for the cost of paying for that service. 
At this point, we don‚Äôt really know what they are thinking or what they might do in the future if they are upset at us. 

We asked to look at the document in advance since them asking us to sign it makes it a legal document in our understanding. The family member got upset and said we are asking for some time to review it is springing this up on them and causing them stress. I said it was a reasonable request to see a document before signing it, a courtesy that is usually given to anyone signing anything. We agreed to watch their kids for free (for FREE!!!) because we are family but we are feeling more like unpaid employees dealing with high, rigid demands, feeling pressured, and being made to feel like the bad guys.

520,"Hi everyone, my landlord has us pay our rent via money order only and has us drop the money orders off at their personal mailbox.

I was a really sick child, and as a result of doctors not being much help at the time, my mom developed some kind of fear or mistrust that snowballed. I'm not mad at her for that, especially since I'm an adult and can make my own medical decisions now. I understand how herd immunity works. I understand that while some vaccines are unsafe for certain groups of people, it's because of their age group or allergies. I have never been vaccinated. I am terrified of getting vaccines. It's not for any logical reason, it's just from how I was raised. I want to start doing the right thing. I am not planning on catching up on all of them.  My Dr and I are doing one at a time, and she has suggested a few I should get over others. My first one is meningitis, since I will likely be moving into dorms eventually. I keep trying to make the appointment and then I psych myself out. The people I know, with the exception of my doctor, that are super pro-vaxx are just as aggressive as the anti-vaxxers.

I never really considered myself to be a lazy person but for over five years now I haven't really felt like I've achieved anything. For example, I keep telling my self to revise for my exams and do my homework but I either end up wasting hours on YouTube or actually revise one thing, but then just stare at a blank piece of paper thinking about anything but what I should be doing. This issue also extends to sleep as I find myself purposely staying up all night even though I am extremely tired. I also noticed that I don't even really feel happy with anything anymore either, like there isn't even a reason for me to be unhappy as I have good parents and get everything I want. But its a different story at school, I find myself feeling very lonely at school even though I don't necessarily get bullied.

Coparenting with their dad has been either non-existent or impossible. I was the one calling or texting him to see if he plans on helping out with the kids. We would get into arguments because he doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs his responsibility to help with the kids. He thinks that if he does something for the kids it‚Äôs doing me a favor. He pays child support and feels that‚Äôs enough and all he needs to do to contribute. We went months without seeing him and he stopped paying child support. He comes back around months later and starts paying again. I ask him one time if he could get the kids some diapers. We were getting low and I wasn‚Äôt able to get any because of the snow. This was the first time in months I even asked him to get anything for the kids. So I didn‚Äôt think there would be any issues. He right away snapped at me and called me lazy and irresponsible for needing him to get them diapers. 

I‚Äôve been talked down to for 4 years by him and it‚Äôs all taking a toll on me. I‚Äôm stressed out because I‚Äôm doing everything for my kids on my own. Every single day. No break no real down time. I have no help at all. And the one person I thought should and would want to be there to help with his own kids, keeps tearing me down. He has a new gf and has moved on and treats us like we‚Äôre nothing. It‚Äôs getting harder and harder. I‚Äôm getting mentally worst and worst. My kids are my number one priority.

546,"A little background information: I'm F(25) my fiance is M(22). Right now our relationship has been wonderful. Hes funny, charismatic, extroverted, and full of energy. I'm very much a shy introvert, so having him in my life brings joy to me, because I admire people with those personalities. However, I have caught him talking to other women on social media. I've found very explicit photos and  conversations between him and other women during our relationship. It was a huge blow to our relationship, but since I love him, I decided to work through it with him. Since he never had any physical contact with these women I figured I could get over it. I never exactly did. I never held it against him or treated him any different because of it, but it would cross my mind every now and then. The ""what if"". 

Now this is what happened last night. I can't prove it because I don't have access to his phone but I started noticing him acting weird with his phone. I was on the other side of the room, my fiance was on his phone, and when I got up to go to the bathroom, which is on the side of the room where he was, I noticed he turned his screen off. I thought it was weird. And me being, well, me, I decided to test this. So I went back to the other side of the room and waited for a while, got up to pass him, and he switched his phone from snapchat to another app like really quick. I did it one more time after that a little while later. He did it again. When you have someone's snapchat location, it will tell up when they were last active on the app. It was showing me that he was active all of those times. So after the third time of him switching the app or closing his phone screen when I came near, I calmly set down next to him and asked him who he was talking to on snapchat. He said no one. He said he hasn't even been on snapchat since he got home from work. Which I know is a lie. I asked him to show me his phone and he refused. He said that he shouldn't have to and that I should trust him. He never got mean or defensive. Instead, he got overly affectionate. Like running my back and playing with my hair. If someone was  accusing you of something you weren't doing, wouldn't you be a little upset ?

I don't really know what to do. I feel really sad. Hes acting like nothing happened. This morning was just any other day to do him.

556,"Hello,

I just returned from university to stay with my mom for the holidays. I am 20 and she is 48.

Over a car ride I asked if my mom's work was going well. She responded with a mental breakdown and crying. It appears that my mother has faced countless times of verbal harassment and neglect in the workplace. Here's some backstory; 

In 2019 my mom was one of the highest achieving employees in her branch \[real estate\], coming out on 3rd from a base of 400 agents based on revenue and commissions. This was when she was on good terms with the Managing Director at the time. In the beginning of 2020, the Manager left and a new one was asked to fill in. During this time my mother has been shouted at, insulted and threatened on the loss of her job many times. It isn't only her that has faced this same treatment, another employee got into a physical brawl and others resigned, a in-office 'revolt' was held where many employees expressed their concerns about the new manager. In real estate your salary is based off of the commissions you make which depends on the listings the company provides you with. This new manager has invited his friends into the workplace and has decided to give them most of all these listings. It is as if he has developed a mafia ring within the company, meaning that my mother has to find other sources and is struggling to stick with her consistent returns. 

Currently my mother is scared to go to her office because of the treatment she might get. She has been working for over a decade in this field and has been one of the best performing employees over the past couple of years. Not to mention she is working in a male dominated workspace and is a single mom. I am quite disturbed that this treatment is going on, she has tried to contact the higher ups about it but no response. Right now my mom can't quit her job because of the times we are in and the effort she's put into the company she works for. At this point all I want to do is head down to her office, sit down with the Manager and have a proper talk about this as this is completely unfair. I want to help her out through this. Please leave any advice below.",22Dec2020,1
557,"I'm a 32 year old lady who has never had a proper full time job. I desperately need some career advice because I really feel like my whole life is just one big failure.

I finished my Matric (final year of high school) with straight As. Got into a great university, but dropped out after a year because I was desperately homesick. I'm not sad I left because I got to spend time with my childhood dog (I had strong attachment to the dog, I didn't have friends at school, just the dog), she died shortly after I got home. I went back to university 2 years later, but to a school closer to home so I could go home on the weekends. I graduated with a degree in Ecology, got my honours, secured a lucrative internship, which turned out to be the most awful experience ever. I was located in an office with 1 other person, my boss would only check in on us once or twice a week, and I could never find enough work to do to feel like I was doing something meaningful. I got a scholarship and went on to get a Masters degree in Ecology. I secured another scholarship to study towards my PhD, but I dropped out because I choose supervisors who I didn't click with and who I struggled to deal with. I tried for 3 years to get any kind of job, from teaching at a skills college for nature conservation workers, invasive species management, scientific writing editor, environmental education teacher etc. I didn't even get a single interview.

I decided that if I was going to have any chance of real employment, I needed to go and get my teaching certification, because there is always a shortage of teachers and for years people have told me I would make a great science teacher. I worked hard and got my certificate with distinction. But yet again, I have put out my CV to every school in my area, and applied for every single job I have found on the 5 teaching jobs groups I follow on Facebook. In all, I reckon I have applied to 75 different schools, and again not a single call back. 

I'm starting to give up hope. I have been on CV writing workshops, gotten professionals to look over my CV and cover letter and pick it apart. I edit my CV at least once a month to try and make it pop out of the pile. 

I'm currently working at a job a friend organized, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to be fired soon because I suck at this job (selling English education lessons).

What have I done wrong? I am beyond broke and owe so much money, so I can't just go and do another course. I thought I had ticked off all the boxes, got good grades, got a graduate degree, worked hard, but that hasn't seemed to have helped. I need some help finding the right direction.",22Dec2020,1
558,"Please help, I‚Äôm paralyzed in indecision and anxiety about this. 

Back in November I had covid (mild case). Feeling a little more confident now that I have antibodies and with the support of my family I booked a flight home to the US for Christmas. 

Now the UK has announced a new strain of covid and introduced Tier 4 restrictions saying that people living in my area cannot not travel abroad...dozens of countries have straight up banned arrivals from the UK. However, my flight is still going and is non refundable and I cannot decide whether to stay here or go. It feels like going and breaking the new rules is the wrong thing to do and id feel terrible if this new strain becomes a big problem and I was involved in helping it spread. 

Points for going: 

- Haven‚Äôt seen my family in six months and miss them lots
- Antibodies from having covid a month ago may still make it harder for me to contract the virus and pass it on, although unsure with the new strain 
- My parents are selling the house I grew up in so if I don‚Äôt go now I will never get to be ‚Äúhome‚Äù home again
- As a US citizen I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm at risk of being turned away
- I have young nieces who id like to spend as much time as possible while they‚Äôre little
- flight is still running and Fauci has said he doesn‚Äôt see reason to ban arrivals from the UK at this stage 


Points against going: 

- My dad is in his 70s and brother has Type I diabetes so may be at risk of having a severe case if he were to get covid  
- So much uncertainty with this new strain so not sure if I could still be a carrier despite having it so recently 
- Should be able to reschedule flight for March or April 
- I may be at risk of getting stuck in the US if flights are cancelled while I‚Äôm there (could work remotely for a short period but I‚Äôm really needed here for my job)
- It‚Äôs unclear if the rules are being enforced - I may be fined or turned away at the airport
- Unclear if getting caught breaking the law may impact future visa applications 
- I wouldn‚Äôt be alone here, could spend Christmas with my best friend/ house mate who also can‚Äôt go home because of the new restrictions 
- could save my vacation days for a time when I could do more while visiting home 
- going back in spring would mean my grandparents have been vaccinated so I could actually see them (haven‚Äôt seen them in a year now and they‚Äôre very dear to me so I‚Äôd like to see them as soon as they‚Äôre vaccinated) 
- too late to get tested in time for flight 
- case numbers are growing rapidly in my home state

Option A: Stay in the UK and have a Covid Christmas with my best friend/housemate who can‚Äôt go home because of the restrictions 

Option B: Get on the flight and just try to be super safe as I travel (N95 mask, hand gel all the time) and get tested a few days after I arrive 

Option C: Reschedule the flight for spring",22Dec2020,1

She is currently going between friends' places for the nights and has blocked all contact with her family as far as getting a new phone altogether. To my understanding she doesn't agree with her household rules or get along with family members well and she has a complexity about acting older than she is and lying about identity to an illegal extent. Currently she is using throwaway accounts to keep in contact with friends but at the same time she is also getting involved in almost weekly hook-ups with sexual males over social media. Regarding her home situation she feels neglected over siblings getting a better phone or similar situations and in terms of household rules there aren't many except for her mum being against her hook-ups.

573,"There's this kid on discord who told me he was nine. I'm not sure if it was a joke or not, but when I joined vc with him, he sounded like a little kid. He later claimed it was a voice changer, but I don't buy it. Especially because of the fact that he acts like a nine year old when he talks (I have a younger brother so I can kind of tell), and he continuously makes spelling errors. Maybe hes just a really good actor??? Idk. It first started getting uncomfortable when in vc he said he wanted to ""have sex"". I was alarmed by this, and also scared by the fact that a nine year old was saying it. He then proceeded to show me his face, and sent me his phone number (which I did not text). If he really is a nine year old., its incredibly dangerous for him to be on the app, considering the amount of creeps. He continuously says dirty things about me, and now has started telling people i'm his girlfriend. I have made multiple attempts to make it clear that I DO NOT like him and that I like someone else, but to no avail. I even got my friend to pretend to be my boyfriend hoping he would leave me alone realizing I was ""In a relationship"". It didn't work. My friends keep trying to message him to stop and are calling him out but he doesn't care at all. He also went onto twitter, and posted that I was under the discord TOS age and that my account should be deleted, because I was rejecting him (I'm not under the age). He keeps telling his friends that we are dating, and every time I reject him or call him out, he goes on some online site to bitch about it. Idk what to do at this point. I've tried reporting him but it hasn't worked, and I don't have any proof that he actually is nine. I'm feeling really upset right now.

574,"Has anyone else come back to normal after being really fucking dead inside? Anyone ever start feeling emotions again after feeling numb for years? How did you do it, what helped and how long long did it take? 

Back in 2016 I was on top of the world, and everything was going right for me. End of 2016 I got in a relationship with my ex, which was going great for about 6-7 months before problems started showing and, having shit self esteem since childhood, I forced the relationship to continue till November 2019. She decided to call it quits, but not before outlining everything wrong with me and the relationship in a pros and cons list. Now I probably wouldn't have let that list get to me under normal circumstances, but going into lockdown a few months later and thinking about it all over and over while being alone did a number on me. My depression has been around since mid-2017, and no meds or exercising has helped. I started meds again in August but since then (well, it was mostly all building up since mid-2017 anyway) I've just been feeling so dead inside. I've shut off from talking to all of my friends because I hate myself, dropped out of uni this year because I couldn't commit to the workload, and generally just feel like death 95% of the time. I had such high career aspirations just 4 years ago, a general idea of where I wanted to go in life, and I was a great friend to all my friends and popular as fuck at my university (small town uni and part of a few clubs so it was easy to know lots of people). I just want a sliver of my old self back, the past 4 years with the relationship/ break up took away my identity and I hate who I am today. 

Does anyone have any ideas/ advice/ books or anything on how to pull yourself out of this and just feel some sort of positive emotion to build from? Just a little bit of hope or excitement for the future is all I need to get going but fuck I feel so buried under the past 4 years, I really really don't want to waste my life away like this and do something worthwhile.",22Dec2020,1

584,"My (40+) BFs (40+) of 2+ years has a few kids that split time between his house and their mom and stepdad's place. The parents all have a good co-parenting relationship with each other so despite their divorce 8 years ago, it seems like everyone has adjusted well, at least to my understanding. The kids are all kind, polite, smart and there is no indication of any nefarious activity like interest in drugs and alcohol. They seem like adorable nerds with good friends and some outside interests and hobbies, except the oldest is more interested in video games and anime while his younger brother likes those things too, but also has too many hobbies to count.

The oldest (15m) has gotten very behind in his coursework and is failing nearly all of his classes. He's at the mom's during the week bc of online classes then comes to his dad's on the weekend where all of the kids are together, including some younger kids that are still at the age where they are LOUD. During this time, he has started staying up all night doing whatever, I think gaming, sleeping all day, then getting up around dinner time. On Sundays he tries to reset his schedule for the school week. 

That **** would definitely not fly at my house growing up, but times were different, my parents had a tougher parenting approach, and I'm just the girlfriend and am not a parent myself. It pains me to learn that this kid has not been completing assignments and has gotten very behind. He's not dumb nor does he struggle with ADHD or autism, but I think the lack of structure over the past several months and in-person friends has been difficult for him.  I think this might be a draw to gaming all night because he can meet up with online friends to connect. 

My bias: As someone who grew up lower middle class, I had to earn scholarships and take out loans to complete college. I've worked awful minimum wage jobs and I know that lifestyle means it's hard to afford being an adult. I don't think his parents can afford to send all of their kids to college so it's critical that the kids keep up academically. 

I'm trying so hard not to inject my opinions or suggestions as to how to help them but of course based on how I was raised and the fact I have little self control (I'm working on it) I suggested taking away phones and gaming during homework time and giving them back for 10-15 minutes as a reward, then back to coursework. Also to set up the kid in his dad's room during the weekend away from the loud, younger kids and put an end to the up all night thing. I said thus gently like ""maybe you can try this?"" but of course am kicking myself for injecting myself into parent problems when they're not my kids. 

But I'm worried this isn't enough. He is likely so behind that he doesn't know where to start as to how to catch up. I'm hoping that the parents set up a meeting with their teacher to work on a strategy for overdue homework, guessing some are too late to get a grade, but some might be accepted late, and figure how where to go from here. I feel like it's not in my right to ask if he is going to do this. 

Is there anyway I can be helpful or should I just unstick my nose out of it? Do I ask questions about his strategy or just stay out of it? I really like the boys and know they have a lot of potential, but am worried about their mental health as well as their schooling.",22Dec2020,1

609,"Hi all. So I'm in a wedding (bridesmaid) that's supposed to take place in on new years, and I feel like I've made a terrible mistake ever saying yes to being a bridesmaid. 

The bride is a old childhood friend whom I've kept in contact with over the years. She got engaged a few months ago, and just HAD to have the wedding this year. Which is her choice, but pretty much half the bridal party already has COVID currently and the safety precautions being taken is questionable at best.

The bride's whole immediate family is currently recovering from covid, as well as a bridesmaid, and the maid of honor. While they may be better by the time the wedding rolls around, it makes me really question what the other wedding guests have been doing. 

I asked the bride if anyone would be wearing masks, and she said ""you can if you really want to"". The bride is also mildly immunocompromised, but she doesn't seem to really care about COVID at all. If nobody is taking safety precautions, this will basically be a super spreader event. Lots of people in a small enclosed space with no masks.

I realize fully our friendship would be over, and it would make a lot of people very angry, but I am considering not attending. It makes me angry she decided she HAD to have a wedding two months after getting engaged in the middle of a pandemic. She could have waited, and I shouldn't have to risk my own health to make her happy.

At least, that's what I've been telling myself. Should I just suck it up and go anyway?

612,"Hi all,

I'm new to this board and have an issue I hope some people can help with. I recently got sick this Saturday 12/19 with a bad sore throat and fatigue. I went to the doctor and they suggested a strep and Covid test.  

&amp;#x200B;

In turn, my girlfriend and I (who live together) did an early skype Christmas with my parents to be cautious and safe. We were supposed to go over to her parents this Christmas who live about 2 hours away. Unfortunately the Covid test takes 3-5 days to get back. Her family is urgently hoping for me to get a negative result back so that we can still go over for Christmas. Meanwhile, I'm reticent to go regardless, given that A.) I'm sick ... and B.) Sometimes covid tests come back with a false negative. My mentality is a better safe than sorry mindset and hers not so much...

Any help is appreciated",22Dec2020,1

626,"I‚Äôm no stranger to the process of forgiveness, and especially in the past few years it‚Äôs been a major theme in my life. 

I have an aunt that wronged me many, many times. Many of those times were when I was a teenager while I was going through something serious, she minimized and mocked my pain. She also has a habit of bringing up all the good things she‚Äôs done for me whenever I would bring up something that hurt me. I forgave her each time, genuinely, even sometimes it was hard and took a little while, but I tried to start anew. Each time. 

About 3-4 years ago, she and my mom came home absolutely wasted, which is a trigger for me, but I went outside on the patio to avoid the mess and discomfort. Then I hear a commotion inside. My brother is standing, blocking the front door. She was trying to go drive home. Ended up me and my brother absolutely refusing, she could barely stand up. This led massive amounts of yelling from her, ‚Äúeff you all! All of the things I do for you, and this is how you repay me!‚Äù Calling us a bunch of nasty words. She ended up sleeping on the couch and I took a lyft to a friend‚Äôs house. I cut her out of my life since then.

I did the first Christmas after that and she was there, nothing really went wrong but I got nausea so bad and had a panic attack after. So after that I said no more. 

My mom has been urging me to forgive her, or at least find it in my heart to go over this Christmas. I have been genuinely trying, and examining myself and my role in everything. I have tried many different perspectives. I suggested maybe I call her and talk to her, but the anxiety was too much.

i thought about being a social worker, to being an environmentalist, to being an animal keeper, to being a cafe owner, to making bowls and pretty ornaments, to being a glass maker, to being a pottery maker, to being an animation artist, to being a webtoon artist, to being a musician, to being a youtuber with a music chanel, to being a farmer with my own plants, to selling my own art, to being a person who makes clothing, to a person who makes crafts, etc.¬†i'm also a bit shy and socially anxious person who doesn't believe that she can do these things BUT i'm trying to stay positive. i can doo thissss.

i think that if i die in 2 weeks, i would have regretted not reading as many books, and talking to as many friends and making happy memories and laughing with them. i would also regret not going to many places around the and seeing different sights. regret not walking that mountain and not trying that food at a certain restaurant. i would have regretted not pouring my soul into a certain thing. i think that i would not like to die without specialising in something. i think that if i were to die and i owned a restaurant, i would be sad that i wouldn't be able to tend to my restaurant anymore. i want to have created meaningful connections, and have helped people find their happiness as well. i want to have helped people. i want to know that those people also have the faith to move forward and be happy.¬†

635,"Hi,

I lost my job a few months ago. I've been looking but it's very hard amidst a pandemic. 

I've been living with my mom and stepdad, we have a good relationship. She pays for my healthcare and we came to the agreement that in return I would do her taxes and billing for her patients (she's a doctor).

My issue is my psychiatrist is no longer covered by my healthcare insurance, and it's pretty expensive. The healthcare itself is also pretty expensive. 

I've been thinking of what to do, because lately my stepdad has been complaining about the cost. Which is fair. I could switch to a cheaper healthcare but that would also mean no longer getting coverage for my psychologist.

I don't have a chance to get another psychiatrist because my town is that small. As per psychologist, if I quit treatment with her I don't wanna bother with someone else building up years of trust once again. 

Honestly I'm just a bit scared because my mental stability is not... stable at all. I attempted suicide two years ago and I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I've been doing okay lately but mental health is a roller coaster.

I can still get the meds from another doctor who prescribes them to me, but with no psychiatrist check ups. 

There's no goverment aid I can go to (not from the US just in case).

What do you think I should do?

- Keep the healthcare and psychologist, ditch the psychiatrist

- Ditch both

- Other magic solution I can't think of other than turning to crime for money.",22Dec2020,1

638,"I know you're thinking this is a Christmas impulse thing, but not really, we finally lost our good Boy this fall after a long happy life. I've been dragging my feet to replace him because, well, I'm that dad from every dog movie that knows he's going to have to do all the work. Also I don't know a lot about all the other breeds, and I've heard the dog we had before was very atypical.
I've taken all of the ""answer 10 questions and we'll tell you what breed to get"" quizzes on the internet and they've all come back with wildly different answers so I want to know what some real humans think. Here are the things I would like to see in a dog starting with the most important.

(1) Must be good with small kids

(2) Low strung/chill. Basically looking for the worst guard dog. Won't bark for 3 hours at every bump in the night. Would definitely rather lick you than bite you. If the neighbor comes over to borrow a cup of flour I don't want the dog that barks at this ""evil stranger"" for a half hour while we chat about the weather.

(3) Obedient. Our old dog would listen right away when we told him things, but I swear he also just KNEW what we wanted and aimed to please us.

(4) Somewhat independent. Don't worry this dog will get a lot of loving and attention, but I've got a job and the kids will be in school one day. I've seen other people with dogs that tear the whole house apart if the humans leave for a half hour to get groceries and I don't want that.

(5) Doesn't feel the need to do a ton of exploring or chasing cars or skunks. We live out in the country and I'd like to be able to let the dog out without a fence or a leash (probably not right away I know). You can go sniff where the squirrels have been but I don't want to have to send a search party after you.

(6) Preferably medium sized. The minute I said I had a big yard in the country, all of those questionnaires I took immediately jumped to saint bernards, greyhounds, great danes. Just because I have some space doesn't mean I need to use ALL of it. I don't see the need for a 200 pound dog just for the companionship. Big is preferable over small, though. The eagles and coyotes around here have been known to make a few cats and small dogs disappear. I've also heard that tiny dogs have ""short man syndrome""

(7) Minimal shedding and drooling

(8) It'll be a house dog, but we do live where it's brutal hot in the summer and brutal cold in the winter so a little temperature tolerance would be good.

As you can see I'm looking for a very low maintenance dog. I know somebody is going to say ""why bother, why don't you just get a pet rock?"" I'm well aware that all dogs, even the laziest, are a huge commitment, they do have needs, and they will get into mischief. I just want to minimize those things. I know two too many people that wanted a ""high energy, intelligent dog to take hunting"" and those dogs NEED constant activity or they go crazy.

639,"Background: So about 2 weeks ago my (M19) girlfriend (F23) of three years broke up with me. It was really bad. We thought for months and months until she ended it. She didn't treat me to good and it was really hard for me. 

She hasn't really contacted me but once since then. But that's another story.

If anybone is intrested in the details, there should be a post in my history.

Now, problem is this. After long thinking and back n forth with myself I still decided to get her a little something for Christmas. Nothing much, just two packages of her favorite choclate and I wanted to throw in a little Christmas card as well. 

It was just earlyer today that I noticed I'm at a complete loss on what to put in it. I want it to be a nice card. Nothing else. I don't want to envolve the breakup, anything that happened then or how it affected me. Just the typixal platonic christmas card. It sounds very easy, but everytime I start writing, I don't even know how to describe it, I just can't do it... 

It's weird cause I actually reslly enjoy writing cards. For christmas, birthdays, celebrations or even just like that. I just like giving people something a bit more personal in addition to their main present. Just a little personal note. Normally I'm really good at thinking of nice and creative texts too but this time ...  it's different. I don't find any nice words or good phrases anymore. I just get sad, hurt and depressed when I get into it too much.

To be serious, I'm not even sure why I feel the urge to sent her something for christmas after how she treated me and treats me right now. I can't really explain it at all, not even to myself. But I feel like this is an important step for me in order to heal and eventually get over this trying time. Like an signiture under a finished card? I really don't know

I really hope someone here can help me out. I'd be so thankful for some advice and guidence:)

I'm sorry for eventual mistakes I made. English ain't my first language. Feel free to correct me.

I left my family home unexpectedly this year because of my step-dad. He has always belittled, threatened and even put his hands on me. I believe that I was the scapegoat for my family.

The whole situation was traumatic for me. My mum and sister are insisting for me to come back home for xmas but I don't want to see my step-dad and have to put up with his BS. I'm really not sure what to do and I keep having nightmares because of this upcoming event. Does anyone have any advice?",22Dec2020,1

# My husband's family is a mess -- and his severely autistic brother is sexually attracted to me

First off, let me declare these things:

* I do not hate my husband's family
* I understand autism is not a choice, and it's not my brother in law's fault he's autistic
* I understand families handle things differently
* I mean no disrespect to anyone on government assistance or anyone with a mental health condition
* My husband and I are in counseling so our issues are being handled, but are relevant for my story
* I am looking for advice -- good, bad, and ugly.

Here is my situation:

My husband of 8+ years has an interesting family. They live a very off-grid/rural hippie lifestyle, which is not so much the issue -- but it's so far been proven over and over to be irresponsible to maintain. My 24 year old brother in law who is severely autistic went missing this year on their almost 90 acres of dense forest land on a freezing early spring night and a local rescue team found him 15 hours later -- and I figured this would be the wakeup call. It was, for about a week. Things slowly went back to normal -- mother in law ignoring her health (she's a chain smoker yet deathly afraid of the pandemic), allowing the land to go down hill (an ambulance couldn't even go down the driveway when my brother in law was located), and though she lives on government assistance, she complains constantly about how fucked up the system is, yet never asks us for help so we've finally just started DOING shit for her and paying for it without question (new phone because she never kept minutes on hers, new truck, driveway repairs, etc). But before we started doing things for her this year, things would go broken for months (we didn't even know her car was broke down for over two months and she had to ask the neighbor for groceries, and she hurt her foot and didn't tell us, her fairly new stove was taken over by mice and it doesn't work anymore -- things like that).

This year has been the hardest year of my marriage. I think my husband has more issues than he realizes due to his family situation (They've lived in a bus, a cob (mud) house, off grid, outhouse, no bathing options, etc) and the family literally DOES NOT communicate on important topics. Like my husband didn't even know how his father died(of AIDS) till he was 17 or so, and he had been sexually active since age 14. He didn't even know where he was BURIED. He wasn't -- he was cremated. Any information I've gotten about the family has been from family friends -- he has no relatives. It's heartbreaking because even though my family isn't perfect, I feel like we would discuss these important topics, but everyone just acts like nothing is wrong and it's normal. All of them have mental health issues (His sister has severe anxiety and is generally upfront about being ""useless"", his mother is his brother's caretaker, and my husband... he has issues with depression, lying, and communicating.) and his brother (my BIL)... it's like no one wants to talk about it. I know one day my husband and I will have to care for him, and the land -- I've married my husband knowing that. But I literally don't know what to do because his mother basically acts like nothing is going on. If she died tomorrow (GOD FORBID) and we had to take care of my BIL, I'd have no idea what to feed him. He's never bathed/groomed, he has no social boundaries, and can be violent occasionally. He is also basically non-verbal or will say singular words, so communication is hard. I've tried to get closer to him because I'm a motherly person and I know I'll have to take care of him someday -- but this past year, he's made me feel super uncomfortable and I just don't even know what to do because I know my husband feels bad about it. When I go to visit, he will NOT stop staring at me. He will move his head to get a better view of my lower half, and will get erections right in front of me. Everyone just ignores it or tells him to stop staring, but it doesn't do anything. I end up having to sit in a hunched over position all night acting like everything is chill while his brother stares at me and plays with himself. On occasion he will suddenly jump up and pull his pants down, or run up to me to try to grab me. He's a 24 year old guy -- taller and stronger than me and even though I know he wouldn't hurt me, It scares me. I don't just want to stop going to family functions, but it's getting really annoying and being as the family doesn't discuss anything, I know I'd upset everyone by talking about it.

What can I do? I'm going to have to suck it up and accept it, but I wish I knew better ways to help the situation.

Thanks in advance for any conversation on this -- I feel pretty alone in this situation.",22Dec2020,1
645,"Hey guys! So I have had a bit of an argument with one of my friends and this is something we've fought over before. Okay so the friend and I have been friends for around 15 years. In that time, literally over 90% of the time we make plans, she is either late (usually 1 hr or more), or bails on me all together. Now this has been going on for 15 years! And I personally am a little more organized than her with time management, so if I'm late places it usually less than 20 minutes late, and i'm almost always on time. So obviously we have very clashing personalities. But I feel like she's just taking me for granted because it feels like I am always the one having to wait on her.

Every time we hang out, I'll be excited to hang out, and she'll pull something last minute like how she's gonna be late, or that she can't hang out anymore and it makes me so mad, and she knows this because we've argued about this before. I kinda feel like she gaslights me, even if she doesn't mean to by saying things like ""stuff happens"" or ""its not that serious"", when she's late but Idk when someone is always doing stuff like this, even if their intention is not bad, the effect remains the same. And then this last time, Idk I just got so frustrated that I cried, and my younger sister saw that and texted my friend. My sister was def out of line, but she's also literally a child who saw their older sibling upset and got mad for me. My friend's response to my sister was so disrespectful and rude, and while I understand that my friend didn't appreciate my sister calling her out, I don't think its fair for my friend to expect my younger sister to respect boundaries if my friend who is almost 20, cannot act like an adult when talking to a 14 year old. I even asked my younger sister to apologize to my friend out of respect of the age difference, but it still makes me so upset that she spoke to my sister in that way. I feel like you cannot expect respect due to your age and relationship, if you cannot act your age. So everything in combination has left a really bitter taste in my mouth. Am I being unfair in my anger?",22Dec2020,1
646,"Ok so I am F21 and my little brother is M16, We live with our aunt and uncle due to family drama... My aunt and uncle have literally given us everything we could ever want under the sun, sent us to private school etc... You get it we are pretty spoiled.

Now saying all this our childhood was terrible, Im talking physical, sexual, and verbal abuse from our father terrible. We spent those years with therapists, cps, dyfs all of that. Now obviously when you are someone who has been through something traumatic it can have long lasting effects I had an eating disorder in high school/tried to commit suicide. But I can say today I am in a very healthy place mentally than I have ever been.

My brother on the other hand is a different story. We have a 5 year age gap so when we were kids he really never understood what was going on. Even after all that we went through he was still always so cute and sweet, polite, and well mannered. He had his occasional outburst which were understandable but overall he was a great kid. 

Now he's a teenager and Idk if its the hormones but he's changed into a completely different person and I hate it. He is extremely antisocial, he even admitted that he hated being around us (me, my aunt, my uncle etc..) He loves video games which there is nothing wrong with that but like he's way to invested into them its extremely concerning. He got this virtual reality set up with the goggles and that's basically his whole life. He lives in this virtual world and never comes back to reality its starting to become scary. The he talks to all these weirdos on discord that in my opinion have bad intentions, I looked through his messages with this one girl and she was like telling him how he should hurt himself some creep stuff. He is failing his math class and my aunt was angry about it and was talking to him and he broke out into this whole speech about how living in our house is torture and he wants to run away. Im being honest with my whole heart my aunt and uncle will do absolutely anything to make us happy, anything. We have tried to get my brother to talk to a therapist and he refuses. I also should point this out so my brother came out bisexual, my family is very open and loving we accept him 100%. But I think that my brother is ashamed of that part of himself, and Im not sure why.

Im just at a lost at this point, what can my family do to fix this?",22Dec2020,1
647,"I live in a house with 4 other people, 1 of those people hasn't done dishes in a month we'll call him ass, and is making the basement and kitchen smell. My roomates are 4 of my buddies from working childcare and for the most part have become better friends for it, everyone but ass. Ass doesn't include himself in any of our house activities, doesn't wanna would rather play video games, we invite him every time but he rarely accepts so I haven't grown as close to ass. Ass also doesn't like working, gets a job when he's flat broke, works as few shifts as possible till he quits or gets fired, this carries over to home life as his pile of dishes grows by the day. When we first moved in together 4 months ago we set up a system where we put our used dishes in allocated squares on the counter thus we know whose dishes are who's. 4 of the squares are always changing being emptied and filled on a day by day and wash by wash basis, except for Ass' whose just grows and slowly consumes all counter space. This has been going on since we moved in, the house has tried everything to get him to do his part for once but he just ignores us and goes back to his basement dwelling which now always smells of cat litter, old pizza, and sweat with clothes and personal belongings scattered over his room and the downstairs common area.

648,"I became friends with a girl a few months and the friendship started out great, but then very quickly it changed.  It started with her only talking about herself to the point if started saying something about me and my life she would pull out her phone and ingor me. Then she started only texting me if something went worng in her life and when she did this she would send me like 5 bloody texts permission how the hell someone can text that fast idk(God damn it this girl would freak out over the smallest things). I feel like I can never talk about my family of happy things in my life cause on the rare occasion she pays attention she always responds with ""I wish my family was that great"", ""you have great life Mines so shitty"" so on. The things is yes she's gone through some really hard shit but she has had ALOT of opportunities to make her life better in different ways but never takes them or she does then she half asses then and complains how hard things are. I've tried to stay her friend and support her but idk if I can keep dealing with her crap this is only the tip of the iceberg there is SO much more that she's done. What really sucks is that even though she does all this to me I don't know if im being unfair by wanting to leave the friendship....what do you guys think?

650,"Since I was a kid I never had any true passions for getting into certain careers. I always felt like I was drifting through life. I'll be turning 20 in a few months and I'm now realizing my 20s are going to be way different than my 10s. I never felt like I was in control of my life, I always felt like someone else was behind the wheel and I was in the passenger seat observing. That could just be my depression talking but I've felt this way for almost a decade. I got out of high school almost a year ago and since then I have been avoiding responsibilities by jerking all day, doing drugs, using the internet for hours, eating junk food, isolating, and basically living a very hedonistic selfish lifestyle. I am now greatly suffering because I realize I need to make something out of myself otherwise I'm not going to life a good life. I'm tired of my current lifestyle so I need a new environment. When I look for career options, I just don't feel passionate about any of the jobs. I'm not so focused on the pay, but I just don't see myself getting into any careers. I am slightly interested in psychology but when I see myself working as a psychologist, for example, I can't see myself being fulfilled in that career.

This is extremely concerning because I should do something with my life so it doesn't go to waste. But I also don't want to be in a career that I don't enjoy or feel passionate about, like a 9-5 office job. This is a little off-topic but I'm also getting thoughts of suicide because I don't see a promising future for myself. Why should I live if I'm not getting fulfillment out of life? Ya know? I've tried multiple meds and I'm waiting for my therapy appointment in a few months but other than that I don't have much to live for, I'm living life by a thread.

About a year ago I went through some psychosis and it kind of fucked up my mind although it wasn't nearly as bad as some of the mental issues I faced years ago.

So I'm 17 (M) my sister 25 (F) she raised me and we have been living alone for years now since she took me from my dad and Stepmoms house.

After mother was gone since 6 for me my sister was only one I ever had and considered as family and we have been happily living together for years now after she became my guardian and we moved in different city away from this so called father.

We are pretty well off financially her job pays alot and she even managed to buy pretty big apartment for us, enroll me and private highschool, bought a car and said if I finish this semester good academically she'll gonna buy one for me too.

She gives me monthly allowance but I wanted to do something for my sister with my self and my own money, so without her knowing I started working part-time jobs as dishwasher, waiter, car wash and with NGO organizations too all for getting paid and buying her a meaningful gift for Christmas, she doesn't know all this and as brother I decided it was atleast this much I could for her.

Doing odd-jobs and working with NGO organizations I managed to save up 1000$ for her gift but I'm lost and don't know what to buy for her, I want her to know that I appreciate what she did for me and all things she sacrificed to raise me.

The third, we will call him John, I dont know really at all. He is moving out very suddenly. I mean, let us know he was leaving and then moved a bunch of his stuff the next day and hasn't been back since.

John left his cat here. His cat, is very nice and we like him but don't want to keep him. I couldn't ignore him though and have spent everyday since December 9th taking care of him, letting him sleep with me, etc. I've cleaned his litter, fed him, filled his water, all the stuff a pet owner should do.

I am a bit upset that he neglects his cat this way. He keeps saying he will come pick him up and then doesn't. Furthermore, he hasn't gotten a lot of his stuff out of his now vacant room and its filthy.

I want to charge him for all the pet care I'm doing for him, but I'm sure he will decline. Overnight pet sitters charge $75 a night and I was thinking I'd even give him a deal and ask for $50 a night. That still adds up to $700.

Any advice?

Extra info: The cat had an accident while no one was home for about two hours and ended up hurting his paw pads. He got blood all over the master bathrooms floor, door, etc. Even sending John pictures of that, he never came to pick his cat up despite saying he would. When asked again he said he would come the next day. Did not show up.",22Dec2020,1

663,"For context I(16f) have been in love (no I am not using this word lightly) with this girl(15) who I will call Girl A since about 7th grade. We‚Äôre both in the 10th grade now. We‚Äôve had a lot of history. At the same time I first developed feelings for her I was incredibly depressed and hated my life. She did as well, we were very codependent on each other as my mother and step father were incredibly abusive towards me and she was also going through some things. I‚Äôm not going to go too into detail because this post would be super long but, the point is I ran away to my dads house, told him everything my mom was doing and he got custody of me. Long story short, I love my life now. I got into shape, developed healthier habits, made new friends, plus developed self confidence. I love my life so much more than I did in middle school, and I‚Äôm very fortunate to be alive, because I don‚Äôt know if I would if I had stayed living with my mother. stayed almost exactly the same, maybe even got a little worse and I know so because she came over to visit me almost 3 years after I moved away. I drove almost a hundred miles to go pick her up and while she was here, she did a shitty thing, I got pissed off, and she basically had a mental breakdown about how much she misses me and how she feels like she has to put up an act. I feel for her and I wish I could help, but I‚Äôm not a therapist. After that it was super weird and awkward, she didnt even come out of my bedroom to eat dinner with my parents, nor changed her clothes from the day before. When she left I texted her I wasn‚Äôt her therapist and that I wanted a break from being friends. We didn‚Äôt talk again for two months.
 This is where Girl B(17f) comes in. I work at a supermarket and a couple of weeks ago a new girl started working with us. She‚Äôs really cute and I think she has a nice personality, I don‚Äôt know if I ever had a crush ‚Äúcrush‚Äù on her though, but she seemed really cool. I asked her out about a week and a half ago and the date went really well, but I always feel weird touching her or flirting with her and get a little awkward when doing so. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs always like this when youre dating someone and feelings come later, or if I should be feeling something by now. We text everyday and I feel like we should be moving a little bit along by now. We go on our second date soon and I don‚Äôt know if I feel any chemistry, but she‚Äôs a lot more mature emotionally and shes also more willing to move at a slower pace which I kind of prefer. 
A couple days ago Girl A texted me about how she wants to build a better friendship, and I blocked her because I wasn‚Äôt willing to face that yet. I was still kind of pissed about what she did at my house while she was there. She later texts me from another account about how she wants to know why I blocked her and finally I just confesses that I‚Äôve been in love with her for 3 years and I don‚Äôt know if we can be friends without it hurting me, because believe me, it hurts and it makes me act out. She texts me about how shes had feelings towards me as well, she doesn‚Äôt know if she loves me but shes willing to try to fix our relationship. 
I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to hurt Girl B, because that would be shitty. I don‚Äôt want to hurt Girl A, but I just. I don‚Äôt know if a relationship would automatically fix the problems with her. But I also don‚Äôt know if Girl B is worth dating if I don‚Äôt necessarily have strong feelings for her yet . I don‚Äôt know what to do, I can‚Äôt talk to my parents because i‚Äôm not out as a lesbian to them yet and I can‚Äôt talk to my friends because they‚Äôre mutual friends with Girl B. I wish it could be and easy choice but I feel like my long history with girl A clouds things up in my brain. I‚Äôve known her for 4 years and I‚Äôve had feelings for her for 3. We tell each other everything, but I‚Äôve changed so much since I‚Äôve known her and she‚Äôs stayed the same. her circumstances aren‚Äôt ideal and I feel shitty for being upset with her for things that aren‚Äôt under her control.

Unfortunately this year for winter break my family chose to travel and to basically have mass gatherings with the rest of the family, and I‚Äôve found myself in a tricky situation. I decided to stay back, so I‚Äôm safe and on my own right now. However, when they come back, although they are choosing to quarantine and get tested, I will be in the home and going to work on the weekends. 

I‚Äôve thought of several solutions, the first one being wearing a mask around the house. But with air flow that really isn‚Äôt fail proof. I‚Äôve also considered staying in an Airbnb during their quarantine, since we can technically afford it. 

I really need some advice since my family seems to not care about the risk they are posing to the people I come in contact with every weekend. 

Thank you and have a great day :)",22Dec2020,1

Last year men were so respectful of me, never asked for sex, paid me for many lapdance after lapdance and guys even fought over who gets to pay me first.
I got glowing reviews calling me gorgeous etc.

I (21yo) have a summer internship at one of the largest banks. It‚Äôs not a role I‚Äôm psyched for but it‚Äôs something just to get my life going. However, one of my friends (S) who highly deserves it, just got an offer at Amazon. As soon as she told me she got the offer letter I was happy for her but then an obvious feeling of jealousy and bitterness came along too. This feeling stayed throughout our whole texting even tho I was actually happy for her. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt want to be in finance + she‚Äôs going to be making a lot more $$. 

Also, I know this gorgeous girl (T) who got an internship at a huge consulting firm who admitted she didn‚Äôt even want the position and halfassed her interviews and the case study she was doing so she could spend time with her boyfriend... she got the internship and didn‚Äôt do much and still got a full time offer. Somehow she was able to get a full time job at Microsoft and me and my friend (N) were so jealous... apparently she was in remedial math and we don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs naturally that smart... like what? I don‚Äôt feel as guilty because I‚Äôm not friends with T but like how does this girl get everything while not trying at all + everyone knows she‚Äôs stunning

But back to what I was saying, I feel like I‚Äôm never happy for others if their job offer is better than mine. I should definitely be grateful I have something for the summer at a big bank but even when others would congratulate me I‚Äôd be like.... eh thanks. Can someone offer some advice as to what this is about? Am I just a bitter person, obsessed with money, who can‚Äôt be changed?

673,"Hi guys! This might seem silly to most, but I genuinely struggle with horrible anxiety and overthinking and people pleasing.

Just a quick backstory, my brother married my sister-in-law and they have three kids. They don't talk to the rest of my family for various, valid reasons. They cut contact with me and I have been in the kids' lives the entire time. In the beginning they didn't want my family knowing I talked to them and I respected their wishes. This had been over the span of several years.

In the last year, they tried having a relationship with my parents again and it didn't work out. I continued to have a close relationship with them. I saw them literally the time and I was super close with my brother and sister-in-law.

This summer, my sister-in-law told me she wasn't really talking to anyone else and focusing on some personal stuff she had going on. I completely understood this and tried to give her her space. I never heard from my brother. It was very hard for me not to reach out, but I wanted to respect boundaries. I reached out a few times to check on them, because I just wasn't sure what was going on.

I only got a response one time. In October, I texted them wishing my niece a happy birthday and then sent one on halloween. I let my anxiety get the better of me and I texted again a few days to see how they were. I have been worried about about what's going on. I respect their boundaries 100%, but because I wasn't given much of an explanation, which they don't owe me, I wasn't sure they wanted absolutely no contact whatsoever or just more space.

My brother then sent me a text message explaining he hasn't been talking to anyone and they're focusing on themselves and their own little family. And that it wasn't personal. He ended the text message by saying, ""Once things settle down, we will reach out."" I sent a text back apologizing and left it at that.

I have been struggling a tremendously with this situation. I never know what the right thing to do is. I want tor respect their boundaries but I don't know if it's total no communication or what.

What I have been struggling with is, should I text them a quick text on Christmas and the kids upcoming birthdays (in Jan and Feb), or not? I don't want to push and look like I'm not respecting their wishes, but it also feels wrong to not text them on major holidays and birthdays.

I don't want to make this about me, I know they must be going through and dealing with a lot, but I don't know what to do. I want them to know I care, but I also don't want to upset them.

There's a lot more background but this is the gist of the current situation. I know to a lot of people this might sound silly, but I have been making myself sick over this because I don't want to upset anybody. I don't want to reach out when I'm not sure that they want me to, but I also don't want them to think I forgot the kids birthdays or anything.

What are your all's thoughts? Should I send a simply text on Christmas just saying Merry Christmas or should I not and wait until they reach out to me again?

Thank you!",22Dec2020,1

684," I don't know where to begin. I am 24 and at this point I just want peace for me and my loved ones. My parents are divorced for about 15 years now. When they were together my father abused my mother physically and mentally. He held a gun at her, beaten her with a metal pipe and etc. Things were so bad at a point that she tried to commit suicide. When those things happen my grandmother took me to her place to stay for the night. As that happened I naturally felt very safe with her and became very fond of her. My grandmother is my father's mother. During that time I remember that I was very scared of my father so much that I refused to stay alone with him. This is the time to mention he never abused me physically, but mentally. I remember when I was around seven he told me that I should choose either him or my mother, but if I chose her he wouldn't bat an eye for me.  
 As they divorced I went to live with my grandmother. Due to other things I couldn't live with my mother. My father was the one who paid for my education and somewhat other expenses such as my phone bill, but that's pretty much it. I  think I should mention that he exhibits the same behavior towards my grandmother as he did to my mother ( nothing new there I guess). During all this time until this day he treats me like garbage ( as he has called me one). He has manipulated me, held the fact that he pays for my education over me, pronounced me dead, my success was never due to my hard work, but only him and there is probably more. I am always at fault when they quarreled with my grandmother. He even wanted to denounce her as mentally unstable 1 mouth ago ( she has mild dementia) to which I opposed so I was at fault again. Now they're having a quarrel over property and guess who is the one the be blamed and denounced dead for the fifth time. So now I just want to break from this circle therefore I am planning to break all contact whit him. I am graduating university this year ( hopefully) and will soon be able to stand on my own.

I recently got a job offer for a position at a journalism company that reports on a field very closely related to what I studied in college.

690,"I will start by saying i am a very tall male and I feel like that is the root of the issue. I feel like i am constantly being judged when I go into stores and I cannot tell if it is because of my appearance or something i am doing that I don‚Äôt realize. The most common occurrence that I notice is women giving me sharp glares while pulling their children closer to them. 

Another occurrence would be getting watched like a hawk in certain stores. I went into hobby store looking for a sewing kit to fix a pair of pants. I went into the sewing section to browse the selection and multiple employees showed up near me to mess with the merchandise on the shelves. I was asked multiple times if I needed help finding anything but every time ai would politely tell them I found what I was looking for. I went to check a different section of the store and all of those employees followed me while taking quick glances as they shuffled items on the shelves. I ended up just making my purchase uncomfortably and left. 

I‚Äôve had to stop going into certain stores because of how uncomfortable the employees make me feel. Like the asian market near my house. The employees don‚Äôt let me use a basket and when im holding more than a few items they make me leave them at the register while i continue shopping. It‚Äôs a bummer because thats the only place in town I can get certain ingredients. 

The thing that absolutely crushed me was the time I was standing in line at a grocery store and a kid with his mom yells ‚Äúmom look out, there is a bad guy behind you‚Äù. The mom and I had an awkward laugh as she insincerely told her kid that was a polite thing to say as she picked him up and put him in her cart.

694,"Long story but hear me out. I have a B.A in a double major of political science and cultural anthropology and just got my Masters of Professional Communications at 23 years old. Right out of school I landed my first job at a small non-for-profit with only 15 people on the team. I was the only ""communications coordinator"" of the entire company, that was active and well known on an international level.

I was not properly trained (Assuming I am the only comms person), just thrown in and told to sink or swim. Most of my work was done relatively decently until they started piling up so much work all at once. I had 8 directors and a CEO give me materials of their own projects that I needed to work on in regards to its communications and it got overwhelming. Every task to every director and the CEO was a ""priority"" and my task list was overwhelming. I would get the job done but would make small mistakes in the details and directors and the CEO started getting upset and frustrated. I couldn't balance getting so much work off my desk quickly but also flawlessly. I spoke up to my CEO regarding how I felt but nothing was done and no one really cared about my workload and why some smaller and very careless mistakes happened.

Fast forward, the CEO of the company really was keen about me, he mentored me and then I started realizing that his comments would become inappropriate (commenting on my body) and would always find time to talk to me at my desk or in his office about his life, etc. We went on a business trip and he tried to hold my hand and I pulled my hand back and felt physically ill the entire trip. After that business trip, the CEO told me he can't talk to me anymore in a ""friendly"" way because people in the office spread rumors that he was ""favouriting me"" not even being there for more than a year that situation alone led to a few women in the office despising me. After this incident I was treated poorly and some even encouraged me to leave.

That is just a GLIMPSE of my past job, currently I found an AMAZING job with an amazing team of people and a boss who is absolutely incredible. I am SUPER happy. However I have a lot of issues that followed me from the experience of my last job. For example, beating myself up for small mistakes I make at my new job in fear of getting yelled at, worried about harassment from team mates, i find myself always overly apologizing for small mistakes or things i've missed that my boss sat me down and told me to stop worrying and that mistakes are normal. I have fears of being fired and I am extremely hard on myself if i'm not perfect at my job. I know I need to get rid of this anxiety or trauma from my past job but its so hard to shake off. Also past employees of my previous job have been looking at my linkedin profile constantly, i've deleted them and one of them even tried to re-connect with me a few days later. I want to shut that part of my life completely from the trauma i dealt with and move on. Any tips on what I can do to address this? its been constant anxiety everyday since.",22Dec2020,1

696,I have 3 more sessions of therapy left and then I‚Äôm done. I have been seeing a therapist every week since October and I still feel depressed. I‚Äôm not really sure where to go from here.

697,"I have a new position working for a union and the job is currently work from home. My role is to support /assist/organize the employees of an company and build a pyramid of leadership and support by building relationships with the membership. Prior to covid, the people who do this job that I have would be allowed on site up the members' facilities and would be physically available Face to face to talk and discuss things.

I started in October and I've been struggling to meet some goals, which I'm hearing through the grapevine that upper leadership doesn't really care if I'm new, that the goals will Be upheld and goals are pretty much all my work is, they set goals and we work crazy hard to meet those goals.

My coworkers have had the opportunity to be in person to meet their member leaders and build relations with them, while I have to do this all digitally (which is probably just an excuse I'm using for myself), and I feel a large disconnect from the members/member leaders at my facility although I'm still learning and trying to keep up.

I don't know if I took on a role that i can't keep up with, or if I'm just feeling discouraged. I love doing union work and helping people as much as I can. I want to do this job but the pushback from my members and the stress of not meeting these goals because of my disconnect from the members is really making me worry.

I'm just so unsure at this moment.",22Dec2020,1

Fast forward this morning, she messaged me saying that she is happy to go as friends, but she isn't looking for or wanting a relationship.

I feel like absolute shit. I really not sure if I want to go for coffee with her - or even continue to speak to her. I don't really want a friend, and I got a feeling it's going to create more hurt down the road. I spoke to my friends and they said I should still be friends with her.

I got super angry with my girlfriend when she said she won't come over, which, now when I think about it, is quite stupid. Every day I just walk angry.

I stopped smoking 6 days ago and now I'm wondering if this is a withdrawal effect or something. I also took a walk today to calm myself down, but it didn't help. Also tried to put all my anger out into physical activity, but that didn't help neither. And it's pissing me off that I am angry. I also lost all motivation in doing anything, because anything I do just pisses me off.

718,"Hello everyone.

About 2 months ago I became depressed (again) but this time even worse. I am in therapy and I think that I‚Äôm making progress but when it all started again I began abusing alcohol. It was ‚Äúonly‚Äù for 2-3 weeks but I got drunk every night and even just passed out in my living room twice because I was so drunk. I noticed that I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúhaving a drink‚Äù anymore and decided to stop drinking alcohol. I have not drunk any alcohol for about 5 weeks now and although it is sometimes very tempting when I‚Äôm having an especially bad day mentally but I have been holding up fine so far.

Now the problem is I will be spending Christmas at my parents house. My sister, grandparents, aunt and cousins will also be there. We usually celebrate with a lot of alcohol and it‚Äôs always a blast and just really a night I enjoy every year. But this year I am having my doubts. I don‚Äôt think that I will be able to hold up mentally if I get drunk or maybe that I will even be able to control my drinking. My family does not know about my mental problems and I will not tell them about them. If I don‚Äôt drink my family won‚Äôt stop asking me why and I don‚Äôt want to tell them the real reason. If I drink I might break down in front of them AND I will break my ‚Äúsober-streak‚Äù. I am not that concerned about falling back into old habits of drinking habits but obviously I can‚Äôt exclude this risk entirely.

I would like to hear your opinions on this. I know it‚Äôs a somewhat stupid question and really not that big of a problem but I‚Äôm just unsure what to do about it.

720,"Hi. I'm 28F and I'm not sure what I need to do with my life, that's the why of this post.

5 years ago I met the most amazing person ever on a community website similar to this one, we started talking, lived 1 hour away, started dating. He moved in with me on my city, but still went to work on his city, making 2 hours everyday in car or motorcycle. 

We were happy in our apartment, I had my mom and grandma that lived 5 minutes away for support and felt like home, but I started to get really sick of my job as a receptionist in a guest house (I worked there straight out of school for 7 years and I could not stand one more stupid guest) and put in my notice. 

I got a job in a IT company in his city, so he wouldn't have to make such a long commute. The job started ok but it was a small company, one person left and things started to get very stressful, mainly cause the bosses were really toxic and treated everyone like garbage. After seven months I put my notice.

My partner was great, always supporting me through everything! I got another job quickly, in another company in the field of IT as well, been there for a year. Things started out great but slowly I noticed that bosses also were a little bit toxic, the worst it definitely my immediate superior. I'm still there and I'm occasionally looking for other job opportunities but there isn't much offers.

It's not as bad as the job I had before but I still don't feel good and happy to go to work.

I think this has affected me mentally cause before I was a really neat, energetic, more outgoing person and I don't recognize me anymore. 

It hasn't been easy to be away from my family aswell. I've gain weight and I hate it but I don't have the will to lose it. My boyfriend tries to support me and when I'm down he makes everything to make me feel better but it just doesn't work. He compliments me a lot, he is very very VERY patient, he tries a lot to make me happy.

I feel miserable pretty much all the time. I wish I didn't had to work and I could just be with him and my family. He already suggested for us to go back to my city but I don't want him to make such a long commute to work and it's hard to find a new job at the moment.

723,"So I moved to a new school at the beginning of this school year (I'm not american so our school year might be different) and I still haven't made one friend. We started when COVID was already taking over our country, so we had to start the school year from home with online classes. It's really hard to make friends from home because we don't have recess and we're always on mute. We go to school twice a week now, but all the classmates who I'd like to be friends with always just talk with eachother at recess and I don't want to approach them to not seem annoying. I'm a pretty friendly guy but this entire year I just sat at my desk and didn't talk to anyone, I don't want them to think I'm weird.

724,"I(16F) don‚Äôt like my brother‚Äôs(31M) girlfriend (30F).I never thought it would get this far, that I would have to seek advice.This is going to be a very long post and will try to explain it to my best ability.I will try to make it into paragraphs. We will call my brother R and my brother‚Äôs girlfriend J, for simplicity.

This all started about 2 years ago (July 2018).My brother works with my parents and he still lives with us( parents and me ).He met a girl through a dating app.He met her and  fell in love her.She instantly started coming over and I met her.She seemed like a really kind person.I kind of considered her the friend I never had.I have to say that she does have Autism, which I don‚Äôt know if it will contribute to the story.She started coming over more and more.She eventually moved in, in about October 2018.Then, I found out she had 3 children.We got to meet them and they are really good kids

They moved in too, in about December 2018.We ended up with 8 people living in our small house.I didn‚Äôt really have a problem with this to begin with.I loved the kids and I quickly developed a motherly bond with them.Then the 8 people quickly became 9, as she became pregnant.It suddenly went downhill.There were many issues we had.I am going to try to tell as many as I can.

- J is extremely greedy.If we touch any thing of her‚Äôs, J will freakout.J will complain to R, and R will talk to us about it.Ever since then, I don‚Äôt touch anything that is hers.The thing about this is there will be times where we ask her about eating something that is hers and she will say yes.We eat said item and then J tells R that we ate it and complains about it.

- She tries to control who comes over to our house.There have been times when my cousin, D and his kids, have come over to spend a night or two.J will then tell R, that they need to leave.R will then tell D, that they need to leave.D has left numerous times just because J wants them to.My parents and I have told them that they don‚Äôt have to leave simply because J &amp; R ask them to.

- There was a time where D came unannounced and she was pissed.J &amp; R got into a really really big fight over this.The thing is my parents and I always tell D, that he can come over any time unannounced.D is our family, and we are completely fine with him coming over whenever he wants.Now D has to let J &amp; R know when he is coming ahead of time.

- J is emotionally abusive to R.She has told him that he is a terrible father, even though he does everything for the kids.She has said that if she doesn‚Äôt do what she says that she will take the kids away from him.She constantly threatens him.She also belittles his feeling.J is extremely controlling.He can‚Äôt do anything without her consent, that includes hanging out with friends.She has to know about everything he does.

- She is a terrible mother.She never does anything for the kids.She does feed them and make them meals.She never does anything fun with them.She never even plays with them.She never ever takes them outside.The kids even notice this, they say ‚Äú Momma never plays with us anymore, she only played with us when we were babies‚Äù.

- My parents and I provide the fun for them since she doesn‚Äôt.We constantly take them outside.I play with them every time they ask.I also let them make cookies with me, or anything they can come up with.I make them fun snacks as much as I can.We try to provide as much as fun as we can for them.I know that is isn‚Äôt my responsibility to do these things but I don‚Äôt want them to have a bad childhood.I want them to have good memories to look back at.

- I do this thing where I throw the kids an event day.For example, we will pick a theme such as, My Little Pony.We will dedicate a day to this show and we will watch it and I will make snacks and food based on the show.I had the idea to throw a Disney week for them and they were beyond excited.I let J &amp; R know on that Sunday, so they wouldn‚Äôt make any food plans.We woke up Monday morning, and the kids were really excited.R &amp; J announce that they were going to get Fast food and my plans were pretty much ruined.I tried not to make a big deal out of it but it still hurt me.
Tuesday morning comes and the kids are excited for the day.I tell the kids that they are going to have pizza for dinner.R tells me that I can‚Äôt because J is going to make chicken.I was beyond devastated that they didn‚Äôt care that I wanted to let the kids have fun.I called my mom and she said she would talk to them and let them know that I was going to make pizza.I come inside and J is pissed and yelling at R.
R tells her that she can still make the chicken and I will make the pizza.This sounds like the perfect compromise to me but not to her, she is hysterical.The rest of the day goes completely downhill.We try taking the kids outside but J tells them they can‚Äôt.My mom wants to hold the baby and she does.J gets really mad at R for letting my mom hold the baby. 
The entire day J is trying to ruin everybody‚Äôs fun especially the kids.I make the kids a special pizza, the pizza is ready and she says that they need to leave.R tries to take some of the pizza so they can eat it and J rudely says that they already had dinner.J ends up getting so mad that she takes the kids and they all leave to her grandma‚Äôs.She takes all their clothes and all her food, just to be dramatic.She and the kids ends up coming back after a couple if days.

- My parents hate that she is really really lazy.They call J a picture because when they come back for work J is in the exact same spot as before.She just sits around all day, she barely even does her own dishes.I will say that she does make food for her kids and R almost daily, so I will give her that.Besides that, she doesn‚Äôt really do much.She just watches tv.

- She takes terrible care of the baby, which we will call A.A is 1 year old.A constantly has a really bad diaper rash because she doesn‚Äôt change the diaper constantly.There will be times were she doesn‚Äôt even know where the baby is.She never really interacts with the baby.I play with the baby a lot so every time I come out of the room she constantly wants me to stay and will cry because I am the only one that plays with her.J and R barely bathe the baby, and she constantly stinks.They once didn‚Äôt bathe her for 3 weeks.

- One of the kids broke the T.V in the living room because he was throwing around a toy.J seemed completely fine about it, she didn‚Äôt even really say much.It seemed like she thought it was funny.R was very mad and my parents were too.

- Ever-since then, my mom said that they cannot have any plastic toys in the living room.She said all three of the kids cannot use any hard toys in the house but they could use them in their room.J was very upset with this.The other day the kids told us that they had a secret but they couldn‚Äôt tell us because J said not to.We quickly figured out that the secret was that they could play with plastic toys in the living room even though my mom said not to.My mom was pretty upset but didn‚Äôt let it get to her.

- After the Disney event, I did not talk to J for a month.During this month, she tried to turn her kids against me as much as she could.It was incredibly frustrating and it is the only reason I talk to her every single day and put a smile on my face.I just don‚Äôt want to lose the relationship I have with the kids.

I am just going to leave it at that.There are way too many situations I can list but those are enough.I am just really tired constantly and I feel depressed.I feel like I can‚Äôt do anything without her saying something about it.I just need help and advice.I will try to answer as many comments as I can.Thank you.",22Dec2020,1
725,"I'm going to start by saying I'm not sure if this is the best subreddit to post this, if there's a better one, point me that direction please.

I've bolded the ""**tl;dr**"" to try and make this wall of text easier to read... And added a real bulleted tl;dr at the bottom.

Okay, so, **2020 has been rough on everyone.** It's been way rougher on some than me, I realize all of that. But that being said, I'm at the end of my rope and don't know what to do. **I've cried more in this last two months as a 28 year old man than I think I did through my entire childhood. I feel pathetic and broken and desperate. I'm not coming here asking for financial help, I just need emotional help and someone wiser than me to give me some advice before I lose everything.**

So let's rewind 12 months or so. **I was living with my fiance (27/F) whom I love more than life itself. I was at a fulltime+ job that I hated waking up for.** I hated every second of every minute of being paid to be disrespected and follow orders given by people who thought they were too good to help with the work I was doing while asking us to give more and never appreciating what we had already done. Many people can relate with that. (Side note, may be relevant later: I was furloughed for \~2 months in March, during which I was on unemployment) **I fell into a dark depression but didn't give up and stop trying to pull myself out** (the job isn't the sole reason for that, obviously, but it definitely contributed). 

**While I'm a sad bastard, my fiance decides she can't take it any longer and we go through a 3 month or so dance of trying to make our relationship work but fighting over the smallest, pettiest things (oh god, if i could just rewind time and fix it for real...) and then we break up for real this time. She mov- oh wait no, in the most 2020 way because of financial reasons, we have to make the really tough call of trying to be just roommates. We've been doing that for nearly 6 months now. Some days are good. Some days are absolute hell on earth... As anyone reading this is screaming ""NO SHIT, SHERLOCK!"" at their monitor/phone.**

Now we're caught up to three months ago. An old friend of mine hits me up and says his **well-known to be a great place to work job is looking for someone.** I jump on it, go through the 3 interview process, **get the job**, and quit the job I hate. I've been working my ass off at the new place for three months or so now and everything's been grand (aside from the ex-fiance situation and the ""normal"" 2020 fuckery) and **managers have noticed how hard I've been working and given appreciation, a superb 60 day review, etc.** 

**Then last month my ex-fiance** (who I should note now was furloughed from her job in March due to Covid, then the business texted her in October and said they were going out of business, so she's been unemployed for 9-ish months) **asks to talk to me. She says she can't keep doing this** (understandable, me too; I think most people can understand that). Then tells me that **she can't pay rent** (we're on a month-to-month lease at the moment with a required 30 day notice to vacate.) **for January and will be moving out.** Alright, I have a decent-paying job now, I can manage the **\~$1400** or so by myself, right? 

Fast forward to **today**, **my manager pulls me aside, apologizes to me and says that they have to lay-off any new hires from the past few months, effective this Sunday the 27th.  They ""may or may not call a 'few' of us in the next week or two and offer us our job back"".** So there goes my one thing that I had going for me.

**Extra notes/a tl;dr (but with some details above missing because I'm too stressed to think straight, haha) :**

1. I told my apartment complex on December 19th (through a form on their webpage SPECIFICALLY for this purpose) that I would be vacating the property on January 19th (fulfilling the required notice to vacate). They stated that they cannot pro-rate, so I am on the hook for the full month of January regardless whether I leave on the 19th or if I leave on the 31st. Which leads to:
2. I'm going to owe my current apartment complex \~$1000 on January 1st. I don't see a way around that. I also have my normal bills to somehow come up with the money for.
3. I will need to find a new apartment. And pay a new deposit, etc. All while struggling just to finish the terms of the current one...
4. I lost the woman I (still) love more than anything because she could not handle me at my low point. I know reflecting on it that I probably dodged a bullet. But I still love her and want her and have to daily talk myself out of knocking on her door (we're still roommates 6 months after the breakup, thanks, 2020) and begging her to come back. She doesn't want me anyway.
5. I'm not suicidal, but I feel more everyday that I'm losing the will to live. Like I fantasize about a freak accident taking me out fairly often.
6. I finally got a job I enjoy waking up for and have been excelling at. Only to have the company (due to Covid) have to lay-off all new hires effective this Sunday, the 27th.
7.  I have no family (aside from my little brother who lives 2400 miles away) and no friends available to help right now (they're all going through major battles themselves right now) to help me out.
8. I don't have insurance so I can't seek professional help that with just a tiny bit of self-reflection, I'm fairly certain I could use.
9. I think I might end up living out of my car through this winter with the way things\^ are looking.
10. I'm trying to free up any cash I can by getting rid of any ""non-essential"" bills that I pay, such as Netflix, internet, etc.
11. I don't think I'll be eligible for unemployment since I was on it in March? Am I wrong about that?

**How do I get through this mess alive and sane? Someone please give me some advice, I'm running on empty and just trying to survive another month...**

**How do I keep a roof over my head or is that just a pipedream at this point and I should accept that I may have to live out of my car for a few months?**

**I sincerely apologize if this massive wall of text is too much or hard to follow. I'm trying with every last drop I have left and I know it may be confusing. I will gladly answer any more questions, comments, or concerns anyone has with my post.**

**And thank you for reading this. I'm just a guy who's really struggling right now to find a reason to get up in the morning and this is my cry for help because I cannot find any help or support anywhere else I'm turning right now... :(**",22Dec2020,1

With a guy (he say's he is (M14 we'll call him issy). But they have never even been on video. Nor have they ever called before. She says she is scared to call her own online boyfriend! This guy wouldn't even leave a photo of his face up. Once I got my friend involved and she got really mad and started to ridicule me for telling her to stop dating this weird guy.

I sent her a lot of Online Safety articles and she still wouldn't budge! Afterwards when I told her it wasn't safe for the 3rd time. She blocked me and told her to stop bothering her. Now I feel guilty for saying the guy was unsafe. I got another friend to help (F12 we'll call her august) She agreed with me on it.

741,"I've known this lady for years. 100% my best friend, hands down. We talk pretty regularily, and she generally raises me on discord for a chat or some gaming.

She's been super supportive whenever i've been down and has gone above and beyond whenever i'm depressed, and is unequivocally really the only person I like on this planet.

Here's the kicker: she's a maybe bisexual maybe lesbian who lives a fair distance who's been throwing mixed signals at me and for the sake of keeping around the only person I genuinely like, i've purposefully abandoned any preconception of romantic love for friendship in the hopes that what i can do can help keep her happy.

Don't get me wrong, there aren't any bitter feelings- it fills me with butterflies to know that she's got a smile on her face, no matter what i'm feeling. She's someone certainly worth any measure, as i feel.

But I do occasionally find myself pining, and although i generally manage to supress that in order for my beloved to be happy, I sometimes wonder if perhaps things could be more between us.

Should i continue onwards as i have? Or perhaps take a chance? I'd hate to ruin things between us and put her into a funk, but I could probably die a happy man if she felt the same about me as I did her.

746,"So I grew up working in my family‚Äôs deli. Now I‚Äôm in my thirties and I own it. Busy place, we‚Äôre an institution, and we‚Äôve been here for decades.

I‚Äôve dealt with this guy for well over a decade and I just hate him. Maybe it‚Äôs me. He really rubs me the wrong way. I‚Äôm not afraid of him he annoys me. He doesn‚Äôt even come in a lot. Other people in my community hate him too. I have a family member who is no longer with the business that was ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with him. He‚Äôd always give him discounts and free stuff. I think the guy thinks he‚Äôs super special and entitled. 

So the guy is this overly tanned, shaved head big tall guy. He‚Äôs in his fifties and he looks like he probably was a bodybuilder years ago. He‚Äôs always got veins popping out of his head. He‚Äôs always glaring at you. He‚Äôs always got way too much eye contact. He‚Äôs always got something smart assed or obnoxious to say. He‚Äôs gotta be the loudest guy in the room. He talks way too much. I know he‚Äôs harmless he‚Äôs an investment guy. He seems to be trying way to hard to act like an alpha or something. In my younger years I was a firearms training instructor for special operations military and police units and this guy is laughable. Nobody acted like him. 

1.) the guy pestered my family member to hire his daughter. The family member didn‚Äôt want to hire her but the guy was persistent. They lied to us about how long she‚Äôd be able to work. We never would have hired her if she told us she was leaving before a super busy two week span. They seemingly knew that and lied to get her hired. I was stuck with the staff working way more hours to make up for her.

2.) we had a girl working for us. This guys son started staking her. He‚Äôd wait outside for her to get off shift. She blocked him from numerous social media accounts. The father was sort of in on it. He‚Äôd come in with the son and try to hook them up. The girl told me about this later later and said she was afraid to say anything because she knew the guy was friends with a family member of ours working in the business. She‚Äôs like my younger sister. If she told me when it was happening I would have banned everyone with his last name from the business. 

3.) the older I get the more respectful he is of me. He seems to be afraid of me now. He seems to go looking for problems with my teenage and early twenties staff like he did with me years ago. He‚Äôs not abusive but he makes a huge deal out of minor or non issues. He also says weird obnoxious stuff and talks down to the staff.  He acts like he‚Äôs a very special VIP person and the staff should almost be afraid of him. The staff doesn‚Äôt like dealing with him. They say he‚Äôs super annoying, always looking for problems, and they say it‚Äôs weird and intimidating the way he‚Äôs always glaring at you. 

4.) He tried to come in with no face covering. He started arguing with me over it. It‚Äôs mandatory here and I can get fined and shut down for it. He was literally the only person out of my thousands of customers who gave me an issue over it. I told him to stop arguing with me and put one on or get out. He seems to be afraid of me now.

747,"I've wanted tattoos my whole life (I have one shitty stick n poke), and for a while I wanted to be a tattoo artist, but I don't have that kind of talent- anyway, I'm huge into art and want it to be my career someday and as such I want to be covered in art, maybe not head to toe but I'd like to have a good amount of rando tats and a half sleeve. 

There are a couple problems here though, and im hoping for some helpful advice on how to deal with them. First and foremost, my family- specifically my husband's family. They don't really know how into art I am and they don't know that my goal is to make it my job (they are big on going to college and academic stuff) they aren't the most judgemental people in the world, but they will definitely disapprove of any tattoos I get, and I know they'll talk behind my back either about how stupid the art is or how dumb it is to get tattoos for practical reasons. Honestly their opinions matter to me a lot so I know it will hurt my feelings a lot if they react badly. 

Second issue- my shyness. Not only would it be hard for me to hang out with a tattoo artist during the tattoos, but I also really hate people looking at me or asking me about anything related to my body. When I change my hair, I get a looot of anxiety about it just because people will say ""oh you changed your hair!"" I cant imagine how mortified I'd feel if people started commenting on my tattoos lol. Also, since I'm so shy, I can't imagine ever really wanting to go in for touch ups unless they're necessary- is that something that's unavoidable? I want strictly blackwork, which I would think would age better than colors but I know Jack shit so correct me if I'm wrong there. 

The third issue is I'm so self conscious that im scared even if I get the most badass tattoo that im going to hate it because it makes me feel ugly or something, or im scared that if I gain weight they will look like shit and then ill feel bad about having gained weight AND about my tattoos being all warped. But at the same time, when I look at my body all I can think of is how much better it would look with the tattoos I want. And when I see someone with tattoos, I get really jealous. 

Basically im indecisive as fuck and if im going to do this I want it to be when im still young and somewhat fit, but i also want to start working out more and get more toned. If I get tattoos, should i wait to have my ideal body, i.e. lose a bit of weight and get a little toned, or will that not matter too much?? Should I just do it? How do I stop being so embarrassed and shy about it? What do you think my family would think of me, and should that matter?",22Dec2020,1

752," 

I'm a 4th year at a top ten university in my field (hard sciences) and I'm an opiate addict. I was prescribed opiate pain killers when I was a teenager due to my wisdom teeth being removed. After that, I have had the opiate itch ever since. Nothing has ever compared to them, it felt like they filled a hole in my soul, if that makes any sense. Even though I never was a full on addict, I have felt the need for opiates since.

I have been on Kratom for a while since it is legal and imo gives a similar opiate high, but just toned down. I managed grad school while being a daily user even though it hit my finances and my time. I felt I had control over it, but I have delved into hard opiates. For the last 4 months, I have been doing heroin almost daily. About five days a week while the other two I'm doing kratom to stave withdrawal. I have zero motivation to work and I feel like I'm going to lose my job. I don't know what to do since I feel this is the point where things really deteriorate for me or get better. I have tried getting clean and did so for about a week, but I keep relapsing and I feel like a total loser because of it. I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't know how to move on from here. I REALLY don't want to be that student who got hooked on smack who ruined their life, but I feel like I'm an inch away from there.

I'm in a really low point in my life right now: I have barely any friends, no romantic relationship, and my work isn't going well which is most likely due to my addiction, I have depression to the point I can barely get out of bed, and I'm an addict on top of it.

My problem is that I lived a sheltered and spoiled life where I didn't even know the words self restraint or discipline. I'm passionate about so many things but I can't focus to save my life on the things I love. It's so much easier to just vegetate on Instagram and look at all the cool things until it's time to go to bed.

755,"So long story short anorexia nervosa struck me this march and made me lose 22lbs in a month, then another 5lbs in a about week, whenever I got up too quickly i'd immediately fall, my eye bags became really dark, and I couldn't walk on my own most of the time. Then I sort of went back to eating semi normal (2 meals a day  but better than one every 30 hours or so) since I wasnt able to lose anymore weight or gaining some.    

But now it's striking back again, with an average of 21 hours of starvation, and when I get to eat once every 3 to 4 times i'd make myself vomit my food, so bulimia came into the mix too, the same symptoms of before started showing, but another one got added to the mix, sometimes I'd feel like my heart is so weak, I'll feel like it's so fragile under my skin, and it's ready to stop at any time, can it?

757,"Last  night was our work Christmas party. I work at a dental surgery and this  party was attended by the dentists and support staff  (managers/reception/dental assistants). The incident in question  happened at the afterparty.

At the  party I  got waaaay too drunk and passed out in the living room. While I  was passed out  an individual or a group of people drew a large penis  on my face. I  had  no idea about this except that this morning I had  awoken and one of the  dental assistants had posted a picture of me with  the doodle drawing into a facebook  group chat which has everyone in  the surgery in it. I asked her to take it down and got laughed at by a  few people in the chat. I pm'ed the picture taker later in the day and  threatened to make a written complaint about her to HR, basically saying  this was humiliating, her actions were immature and best and could be  considered sexual harassment potentially.

Other  people  either don't care,have told me to laugh it off and  get over   it, or have mild pity.  One  person outright said that if I complain  then the entire surgery  will get  in trouble including the manager (who  I absolutely have no  problem with and would not want to get her in  trouble). The picture taker has seemingly shared my message to her  threatening to make a formal written complaint because the manager  called me and left a voicemail reminding me that it was not a work  function but a private event. I interpret this as being very defensive  and just pisses me off more, frankly. But I know the manager and others  are obviously worried and would not be happy with me if I took the  matter further as there could be consequences for all of us.

I  feel totally outraged  and humiliated by the picture taker's behaviour,  that it grossly violates my  boundaries  and and be construed as a  mixture of sexual harassment and  cyber  bullying. But I have been  called an ass hole already for threatening someone's job.

I'm still very angry  about this so I decided I should have some objective opinions before I do anything rash.

AITA  for threatening to complain about the incident or threatening to report  my coworker? Should I let this go to avoid future awkwardness?",22Dec2020,1

760,"My apologies for making such a long post but I have a lot to say.

When I was 5, my mom decided she was fed up with her complicated life with her family and my father, so she brought me and my two older siblings across the country to live with our new stepdad. He had two children of his own and as far as I can remember we all settled in pretty well. I like to think I had a really great life, I always grew up feeling like I had a true family dynamic and I never really wanted for much. I‚Äôve also never seen my mother and biological father together, so I loved seeing my mom with someone. I visited my father and mom‚Äôs family every few years but always felt like my mom did a good thing bringing us to live with my stepdad. Once I became a teenager I started realizing a lot of things were wrong about my stepdad, mainly how perverted he was. I was never actually abused but he did really awful things like put a camera in my bedroom and just other really perverted things a parent shouldn‚Äôt do. I told my mom about this for years and she would just cry and get upset, and then completely brush it under the rug. This went on for years and while I still love her, I deeply resent her for it. 

Just last November my stepdad did something gross and she finally decided to leave him after all these years. I was completely shocked but it wasn‚Äôt difficult for her to leave because she‚Äôs always made more money than him. So within a week we kinda just packed up all our things and moved into an apartment together. My older siblings had all gone off on their own at this point. My mom eventually filed for divorce but it still isn‚Äôt final. Around January of this year, I started encouraging my mom to make a Bumble account and maybe start dating or at least just talk to people. I did this mostly because I felt guilty about going out all the time with my new boyfriend and leaving her home. Eventually she actually did start actively talking to people and even meeting some of them which I encouraged because I thought it‚Äôd be good for her to try something new after being with my stepdad for 15+ years. She started telling me random things about her dating, which was only slightly annoying at the time.

Then the pandemic came. Since then I‚Äôve been trying to keep my circle fairly small with just a couple friends, my boyfriend, and the family I nannied for. I‚Äôm not perfect and I know I haven‚Äôt been 100% on top of the whole social distancing thing but I‚Äôve been trying my best to minimize the people I come around and the places I go. My mother, on the other hand, still goes into to work every day and is STILL dating. For a period of time her entire office had to work from home but now they‚Äôre back in office and she has a director position so you‚Äôd think she would need to set an example, no? When I say still dating, I don‚Äôt mean she has a guy she‚Äôs been seeing and they‚Äôre being safe and social distancing or whatever- she is actively swiping on bumble, talking to strangers, meeting them for dinners/wine dates/walk dates/movie dates/you name it. Multiple strangers too, not just a few guys she‚Äôs been talking to here and there. Sometimes she brings them home, sometimes they come into the living space and say hi, sometimes they just go straight to her room. Bleh. But seriously is she not even considering the amount of people she‚Äôs potentially exposing to covid by doing this? Especially considering she has a medical background. It just seems so incredibly inconsiderate to me, and like I said, I‚Äôm not perfect and haven‚Äôt been 100% social distancing either but she has literally been meeting strangers almost every single week that she has no idea who they‚Äôre coming into contact with.

At this point, it‚Äôs very unusual for her to come straight home from work as she almost always goes out on some sort of date. She spends almost the entire weekend out with different guys doing whatever and aside from just the dating, she‚Äôs just been an absent mom in pretty much every aspect. The reason this bothers me so much is not only because of the covid exposure but because this is a side of her I‚Äôve never seen and I somewhat feel like I provoked. When she was married to my stepdad, she always came home from work, they‚Äôd cook dinner together and talk about their day, after dinner she‚Äôd do some type of activity or crafty thing every single night. We always used to bake things together and watch our favorite shows together. Around the holidays we have so many traditions that we‚Äôve been doing since I was so little and this year she‚Äôs just completely disinterested because she‚Äôs always on dates. Last year was hard because she had just left my stepdad and was just really sad about the entire thing, but she still made time to put up Christmas decorations with me and bake cookies together. 

About a month ago I kept nagging her about putting up the tree and we agreed to do it on a Saturday. Saturday came and she went on a ‚Äúhiking date‚Äù around 1PM. I reminded her about the tree and she said she‚Äôd be home before 7PM to help. 7:30 came and she wasn‚Äôt home so I called and she literally whined to me like a teenager that she didn‚Äôt want to come home yet and that my boyfriend and I could start the tree without her if we wanted. I was so upset about her just totally neglecting the fact that we do this together every year so I went ahead and made it something new for my boyfriend and I to do together. She came home around 9PM, just as we were finishing and asked me why I was mad. Of course after I told her we always do the tree, she tried to apologize. I told her she wasn‚Äôt sorry because she knew I was upset over the phone and if she cared she would‚Äôve came home after being out for 6 hours with some random. I also told her that when I was 16 and had my first boyfriend (and was a brat that didn‚Äôt give a crap about the tree!!!), I STILL came home to do it because I didn‚Äôt want to upset her. She just apologized and I went to my room. I cried about it all night and woke up to this bogus note from her explaining how sorry she was and that she‚Äôs just been feeling lost and to ‚Äúnot give up on her‚Äù (eye roll)

At the time I actually felt crappy about making such a big deal and making her feel so bad so I let it go. I figured we still have the entire month of December to do Christmas stuff and I wouldn‚Äôt stay hung up on this. Hahahaha, no. Her behavior hasn‚Äôt changed one bit, I‚Äôm not sure why I thought it would but no she‚Äôs still consistently been on dates. She stayed home one or two nights the week after the tree incident and had nerve to tease me saying things like ‚Äúyep I‚Äôm inside tonight, wouldn‚Äôt want to upset my precious daughter‚Äù. She made comments like that a few times before I worked up the nerve to tell her I never meant I wanted her to stay in all the time, only when she makes plans to do things. Even now, when she is home, she‚Äôs just overly agitated about everything and acts like she doesn‚Äôt want to be here so I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter anyway. She never cooks or cleans anymore, I do pretty much all of that which I don‚Äôt mind too much because I love cooking, but help cleaning would be nice. She doesn‚Äôt even buy groceries, mostly just gives me her card and has me go do it. She‚Äôs always trying to tell me stupid details about her dating life and it just makes me so angry every time she does. The other day she came and asked me ‚Äúdid you know you can get birth control delivered from online? I‚Äôm going to get some‚Äù I DON‚ÄôT CARE. ‚ÄúI went on a date in the city last night and this stupid guy didn‚Äôt even walk me to my car‚Äù I DON‚ÄôT CARE. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going on a date with a new guy tomorrow and he has a really nice car‚Äù I DON‚ÄôT CARREEE!

I can‚Äôt even decide whether I‚Äôm more freaked out about her obsessive dating which is obviously just her weird way of distracting herself from dealing with divorce nonsense, OR her constantly and carelessly exposing the ones close to her to covid. My brother has been living with us since May this year and my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt live here but he‚Äôs pretty much here with me every single day. Every time I even try to bring up these issues with her she gets upset and dismisses me by saying she‚Äôs just trying to stay distracted (which I don‚Äôt think is a very good example to set for your daughter of how to deal with problems but whatever). It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs completely forgotten the fact that she‚Äôs been ‚Äústaying distracted‚Äù the past 15 years by choosing not to pay attention to my stepdad‚Äôs disgusting behavior and that distraction stuff is exactly what got her into this mess to begin with. I also haven‚Äôt even said this to her, but from the time I was 5, this guy has been one of my main parental figures and I do actually still care about him. I think he‚Äôs sick and needs get help and I don‚Äôt want much to do with him, but it hurt me so badly to just up and leave him on a whim and completely cut off the father/daughter relationship we had. She‚Äôs forgotten that this divorce affects the entire family and I‚Äôm also trying to deal with the effects of what he did to me and how I still love him somehow.

I know I probably seem so pathetic complaining about these silly things during a pandemic when people have much bigger issues. I just feel like it‚Äôs been a hard year for everyone and I wanted to at least take joy in doing family things around the holidays with her but she‚Äôs making it so hard. My boyfriend and I have been talking about getting a place together soon so I won‚Äôt even have to think about her nonsense everyday. I just fear resenting her so much that eventually I don‚Äôt want much of a relationship with her. Right now I still do but it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs blind. I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm raising my teenage mother but that‚Äôs exactly what it feels like and I just want to get as far away from her as I can. The reason this is so hard is because I know my mom is just hurting. I know she probably wants this phase of life to be over as much as I do. I know she doesn‚Äôt want to hurt me but at this point I feel like it‚Äôs not fair to me and it‚Äôs too much work to pick up all her pieces for her. It would be much easier to just move out with my boyfriend and leave her alone until she sorts her business out (or never does) but would that make me the jerk in the end? My older siblings are both very immature and hardly see anything wrong with her behavior so I feel like I‚Äôm the one that has to either do something or just get away.",22Dec2020,1

765,"2 days ago, I was out with a group of friends in a club, I was extremely high and drunk to the point that I was having trouble standing up. I was done for the night and I was about to leave, I told my friend that I'm about to leave so he followed me out with 2 of his female friends.

While we were walking out, one of the girl (who was with us) ex walks right up to me and asks me how do I know her? 

I told him that it's the first time I'm ever meeting her and I don't even know her name, this dude is a skinny guy, drunk af and tries to act all tough, he is like ""I can beat all of you people rn, but I'm giving you all a warning first"" he then.put his arm around my shoulders and said "" your muscles won't protect you everytime"" at that moment I started to laugh because I was high and the whole scenario felt like a movie, I told him that I don't want any trouble and I have nothing to do with the girl.

He started to abuse me and say everything vulgur but I tried not to hit him because I don't wanna be the first guy to start the fight, I waited for him to hit me first.

He keeps talking shit to his ex and when I told him to let her go, he puts his hand around my neck, I turned around and was about to punch him really hard in the face, that's when 2 of the bouncers pulled me back and that skinny guy was kicked out.

If I would've punched the dude, would that been ok?",22Dec2020,1
767,"I have a problem that I would like to have some insight on. First of I'm a Christian. I grew up in a Christian home and went to church daily on Sundays and sometimes on Wednesday. So, here is my situation. My mom (I'll call her M) and I got into an argument about putting stuff away in the kitchen. M was already cleaning in the kitchen and cleaning my older sisters stuff while she didn't put my stuff away which was only literally 3 bottles of condiments. I asked her to put them away since she was already over there and cleaning, but she proceeded to tell me no and that I should do it myself. This went on for about 2-3 minutes of me trying to tell her to just put it away since she was already cleaning at the kitchen. 

At the end I put them away and M thought I put them away harshly because at that point we were already annoyed at each other. We proceeded to argue even more telling each other how bad of a mother and daughter we are to each other. Whenever my mom and I will get into an argument she will always tell me to go away and get married or not stay in her house anymore. She started to say the ""go get married"" when I introduced my boyfriend to her in the winter of 2018 till today still. So going back to the story, she proceeded to hit me with her bag of jewelry she had in her hand and I trying to defend myself was kicking around and throwing my hands around. I got super angry that I literally wanted to kill M. But my bf held me back and my dad held M back (not really because I go hurt). I want to say my sister was at the dining table the whole time, she saw everything that happened. 

M told me to leave and I did. My bf and I went to a park and on the way there I called my aunts to tell them what happened. Racing in my mind the whole time was I didn't want to live anymore, I wanted to die. That was truly how I felt. M called my boyfriends mom and told her how bad I was, M told her that she didn't want me anymore and told them for my bf and I to get married. How did I know that? I knew that because my bf's mom called his and my phone and talked to us about what my mom had said. My bf's mom was probably fed up with my mom, because even before this happened M would sometimes call them (whenever M and I would get into an argument). My bf's mom tried to convince me to get married with my bf but I told her I didn't want to. That my bf and I were too young still just fresh in college. I still wanted my freedom and do what I wanted to do. We talked about this for 20-30 mins. I texted one of my aunt if I can stay over my uncle's place because she lived with her brother. She told me yes and that she was home. So I went over and talked to her about it. After we got done talking I asked My uncle and my uncle's wife if I can stay for a couple days or so. They both said yes so I stayed in my grandma's room. My grandma wasn't there because she went to my other uncle's house with to stay with my grandpa. 

After a while in my grandma's room, I heard my uncle talking to M. After some hours have passed I went out to talk to my uncle about it (he's a pastor). I had enough courage to tell him stuff, but not my side of the story.  I asked things like, why didn't you stop M? Do you think M should apologize to my bf's family? and so on. He told me, we (uncles and aunts) tried to talk to her and tell her but it's up to her to listen or not. He told me that it's not serious because M was a woman who had no real say into the marriage and that it was my choice to get married or not. He asked me if I wanted to get married and of course I said no and honestly, I felt like he wasn't going to try to help me or comfort me, so I left. I didn't want to be rude to him so I left and went to my grandma's room. I thought about how he didn't ask me how I was doing, how I felt, or asked about my side of the story. I felt like he didn't care about me to ask me any of those questions. 

That night I couldn't sleep at all. I was constantly crying and my head was hurting so much that it felt like my head was going to explode. It was the first time that I felt something like this. I've never felt so much pain that I couldn't go to sleep. I never felt so much pain that I wanted to kill myself regardless of me knowing God or not. I didn't even care if I went to hell. 

The next day, I met my bf and we went out. After an hour to 30 mins of hanging out I went back to my uncle's place to get my clothes and leave. After I was out with my clothes in the drive way, he told me why was I leaving and that he wanted to talk to me. I told him it was okay and thanked him for everything. I went into my bf's car and we left. I was planning to go to his house and I was ready to face his family. Not really of course, but I was ready to go and stay with them for a while, not to get married. But on the way there my grandma called me asking me where I was and told me not to go there and to stay with her at my other uncle's house. So I did. I went over there and she and my grandpa talked to me about the situation and what I would do if I didn't want to live with M anymore. 

That night my uncle came to me and talked to me. He asked me how I was doing and told me about his hardships and was comforting me. I didn't say anything and cried. He cried while telling his story/hardships. I was really grateful towards him for telling me, I knew he was trying to make me feel better. 

The next morning my parents came with my two little brothers to get me home, my dad came into the room and told me to go home. M never admits to her mistakes and my dad always cleans up her mess for her whenever M and I get into arguments. So, then I went home even though I didn't want too. 

Even after everything, I'm still not comfortable with my family. I'm still ashamed and embarrassed about what my mom did. I act different to them now, I don't want to help them do anything. I don't know if when I'm going to forgive everyone who has done me wrong. But all I know is that as long as I know God loves me that is sufficient enough for me. Even if people think I'm cruel because of how I behave when my other family members come over. I don't care anymore, as long as I have God by my side.

769,"My (22F) half sister (40F) got arrested recently. We can call her Z. This isn‚Äôt the first time Z has been arrested, but this time is significantly more serious. 

Z has already ruined her relationship with her oldest son who is closer to my age. She was supposedly on the right path and taking care of her second child. Z had a warrant out for her arrest in my home state but then moved with her daughter and my fathers first wife to a different state to ~start fresh~ with her daughter and mom, and get her away from her old crowd. That was about 5 years ago. Flash forward to two weeks ago, Z was arrested for two different reasons, but the more significant arrest has to do with drug smuggling. 

My sister and I have been spending time with our niece (Z‚Äôs daughter), who is 13 and old enough to know what is going on. We bought her a lot of Christmas presents and have been hanging out with her a bunch, but it‚Äôs nonetheless difficult for her‚Äî her mom is in jail (now house arrest because she is trying to get a plea deal). 

Yesterday, Z tries to contact my sister and I, and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. Z tends to get off miraculously Scott-free wayy too often, which is frustrating because I think spending time in jail would be best for her. I don‚Äôt know if I should call her back, the nature of her crime puts our whole family in jeopardy, but I am curious to know what she wants. I‚Äôd imagine it will be a request. ‚ÄúCan you get my daughter a Christmas gift and say it‚Äôs from me,‚Äù ‚Äúcan you try to get dad to call me back?‚Äù It‚Äôs always something. 

I want to help her, but I don‚Äôt want to be the weakest link in my family; Z and I are closer than Z and my other sister, or Z and our father. 

I this it‚Äôs best to steer clear, but if she does manage to get a reduced sentence I feel that I‚Äôll never hear the end of not helping her out when she needed it, and it will weigh heavily me. Should I call her? If I talk to my dad or sister they will say to ignore her.

TLDR: my sister was arrested for drug smuggling and is trying to contact me, I‚Äôm assuming she wants a favor which I don‚Äôt want to help with but I feel bad ignoring her.",22Dec2020,1

This morning I was looking for batteries in my brothers room,I found a cardboard box under his bed and I decided to look inside it.

But I don‚Äôt really know what he would be doing with them other than wearing them, Which I don‚Äôt think he would do because he is a very masculine boy and likes to workout,Hunt,Fish,Play sports, and he always tries to act tough and manly when he‚Äôs around girls.

The clothes are from when I was in 8th grade so they don‚Äôt even fit very well,So it‚Äôs not like I actually need them back,But I do want to know why they where in his room,so should I talk to him about it or should I just leave the clothes there and just forget that I ever saw them.",22Dec2020,1

This is kind of hard to explain but when the teleprompter would ask me to verbally answer questions it would always say that they couldn't understand before I even said anything. Also towards the end, I would hear the noise of buttons being dialed when I was asked to, but I wasn't doing it.

I got super freaked out and hung up, turned off my wifi and data, and went on airplane mode. Am I just freaking out and overreacting??? My whole life is on my phone please someone help.

PS I also read that battery shortage can be a sign and I plug my phone in all night and within an hour after waking up it's low. I also have an iphone7 tho and apple sucks so who knows. But yeah",22Dec2020,1

782,"My mother (43 f) is currently out of state and asked me to watch her teacup dog who is ~14 years old. The dog has had quite an array of health issues that my mother says she has been addressing, but I don‚Äôt believe her anymore. He has supposedly been on multiple rounds of antibiotics for his mouth/lung issues. She says he takes him to the vet but now that I have him I think she‚Äôs lying and this is why:

He lives in his kennel 24/7 aside from the couple of times a day he is taken outside for bathroom use. He does not get groomed, he rarely gets held or taken out of the kennel, and now that he is old he has difficulty moving. When I got him, his fur was overgrown and matted in some spots, poop was stuck to his fur, his nails were VERY long, and he only has two rotten teeth left. His mouth hangs open and he drools all over the place. I‚Äôve also discovered he has some sort of huge growth (tumor, cysts?) that is literally about a 1/4 of his body size growing on his private area. He has breathing problems and spends almost half the day whining/coughing/wheezing. I have to put a diaper on him and clean him multiple times a day as well as help him move around the house. 

I‚Äôm taking him to the vet tomorrow, which I really really can‚Äôt afford but I also can‚Äôt see him suffer anymore. I have discussed previously putting the dog down by my mother INSISTS he is happy and living a good life. My mother returns from her trip on 12/28 and I cannot fathom returning the dog to her. I also can‚Äôt keep the dog because he requires more care than I can give. I‚Äôm discussing euthanasia with the vet tomorrow but i‚Äôm not sure how to approach it.

She has had a really hard time getting over a lover for two years. By itself it seems crazy but she also abused drugs while with him and now in her mind she cannot accept any lifetime without the guy. I personally know the guy because we are actually close friends and he has already moved on so long ago. 

Everytime I bring this up to her, she cries and tells me not to. She says the only reason she hasn‚Äôt killed herself yet is because she hopes he will come back one day. Every day I have to restrain myself from telling the truth again or she has a breakdown on the spot

She says she is in constant pain. Just yesterday she threw up 3 times and cried all day. She has tried many medications, therapy, pretty much anything I can think of and none of it helps. She says she feels worse every day

Guys, I am not sure what to do. Every time something like this happens to my other friends, I help them work it out and things become better eventually. However, this crushes me because I do not see any happy ending here.

785,"(32M) I just cant stop messing up everything. I am so much irresponsible. Everyone is disappointed with me. 

Very often , for a reason which I do not know for sure but I suppose it has to do with my social anxiety most of the times I fail to do what I have promise to the others. I arrange things to do without thinking before, then I regret it(I find social interactions stressful), then I avoid to pick up the phone (when others search me in order to fix our meet) or I disappear for days..and then guess what ... I always find myself under the pre-apologised condition where I feel REALLY anxious to face those people. 

In this moment I have ghosted two of my best friends for more than a month. I just cant call them and tell them the truth. I feel like I CAN'T face them after that. Its not the first time. I can't apologise anymore. I hate myself for that .

Before this she was a wild child and basically burnt every familial bridge but me, the middle brother of the family. She lives in a trailer that she claims is rent-to-own and has a dog. Today, her landlord's ?landlord? came and told her she needs to pick up her dog's droppings. I thought this was a no brainer for her because she has had animals before. She also claims her place has been broken in to multiple times. I live in an apartment half the state away and cannot have a second person living with me, which she refuses anyway because she wants to live on her own. She's very paranoid and thinks people are out to kill her. I'm also a cop in this state and I know how hard it is to pink slip someone if they are refusing to see any mental health services, even if family want to get them help. She's talked about shooting up the whole neighborhood and although I know for certain she doesn't have a gun she claims she knows how to get one. I'm at the end of my ropes here guys. I've paid for her to stay at places and she just gets into fights with staff or straight up destroys the environment around her.

Our idea was getting other students as much involved as we can so we made several surveys where they can give us some funny quotes and facts about our year. 

When checking those quotes and fun facts I got really upset. Since I am gay and an ally to the poc community I always look out for discrimination. And there's a lot of racism in the quotes sent by the other students. Those quotes are mainly about one student, since our school is scarily segregated. This one student does not really care about this discrimination but I think we should not print racist quotes even if they are considered ""funny"". 

Now, the previously mentioned poc person wants to join the commission to create the year book.

810,"Earlier this year, a person from my uni added me on Facebook. I didn't recognize the name, but assumed he may be in my department. He turned out to be in a different, but closely related field. He had messaged me about what I study, and we had exchanged a few messages about my work. Then, some time later, he followed me on my Steam account and Instagram account, and infrequently would respond to my IG story. At one point I had a surplus of chicken eggs, and posted that I was selling fresh eggs, and he responded wanting to get a dozen. 

I arranged a meeting point (in August) at campus, and we had a less than 10 minute conversation that was a bit uncomfortable during the transaction. In October he contacted me that he would like to get more eggs, and also suggested that if I had time, he would like to find out more about the research I am working on. I was out of town at the time, and we didn't rearrange a time.

Last week he messaged me on Steam asking how I liked Cyberpunk -- and that is the end of conversations/exchanges.

Until last night. At 4am, I received an email from Steam that I received a gift copy of a game from him. The game is not very expensive, but is $9.99. From what I can tell, he does not own it nor has played it -- so the game itself is a bit out of the blue. And it included a note saying Merry Christmas, and to let him know if I can still meet up to talk about my research. 

Personally, I don't know how to respond to this, I don't want to offend him, but I do not have intention to meet with him, especially after this . Our conversations were primarily centered around our work, and I feel like this is stepping over the line of colleague-behavior (it is also very public on my IG and FB that I have a partner and a stepson if that matters). I have the option to Accept the Gift, Decline the Gift, and also could send him a message addressing this.

There was one instance this year about two months ago that after he somewhat mended his broken relationship with my mother that he gave me a ride to a doctors appointment and we talked for a while. 

My brother was not a good guy when I was growing up. Granted, some of it was my perspective as a child, which has changed, but still. He did a lot of drugs throughout his younger life, constantly stealing from his own family - either money or items he could sell or pawn. He was abusive and the cops were called for domestic violence situations involving him and his now ex-wife often. He would fight with my mom, lie to people, manipulate situations, never held a job, and was just overall not someone I wanted to be around. 

When I saw him a few months ago and we talked, he genuinely seemed like he was starting to grow up a bit. He talked about his kids like he was their father for once rather than just someone that knew them. This was just after he lost them, though, this time it sounds like his daughter lied to CPS and kinda started this whole thing. It‚Äôs unclear to me though. 

Anyways we haven‚Äôt talked since then, but he texted me this morning while I was asleep and asked if I would be a reference for him on a rental application.

I live in an apartment house. It's a bi-level basically two apartments on top and two on bottom. I live in an apartment on the upper floor. Recently a new guy moved in below me, I've been here a while so I like to say hello and let my new neighbors know if they need anything, to just let me know.

I've seen the new guy 4 times. Talked with him 3 times in 6 months. Each time I've talked with him, he was always super awkward.. I never put a lot of thought into it, some people are just like that yuh know? 

Here's where it gets weird: 

One night I was on the front porch having a smoke around 3am and I hear slamming. I turn and look down through his window and I see the lower half of someone (the shades were kinda closed blocking my vision kind of) and their legs are just slamming their heels on the ground - like a kid does when they throw a tantrum and lay on the ground.

Today not 20 minutes ago: 

I work from home and noticed he was home today because I heard him beating the ever living HELL out of something.... Through my floor.. Yelling at what sounded like into a pillow and the bass of heavy not-timed thumps. It sounded like some serious anger and thuds of heavy.... Something... Hitting something else. The apartments are identical so this all happened in his bedroom. Right below mine.

822,"Hi all, 

So, long story short, I'm definitely changing careers. My current job doesn't offer me a work-life balance at all and starting in February, I am set to retrain and (all going to plan) move into a new job by May/June. 

I'm unsure whether to keep my current job while retraining and leave once I have a new opportunity secured or whether I should keep doing my current job while retraining in order to not jump out of the one boat before having myself safely in another if that makes sense. 

There are positives and negatives to both.

I realise I'm fortunate to even have a job, especially right now, but the fact is I feel burnt out, unappreciated and feel like my passion for this job has been sucked out of me, while another opportunity has presented itself which seems so much more fulfilling, that I want to go for it. 

I'm also lucky to have a decent amount saved up to the point where I could theoretically get by for months after my course without work if worst came to worst and I was unable to find a new job, so that's a plus. 

By leaving my current job, I'd be able to focus more on my new course, potentially do better in it and then get myself into a better position with better job prospects in that new career path, while I'd also immediately improve my work-life balance and have some time to work on some other projects and my mental and physical health, which has taken a beating of late, as I'm fully aware is the case for A LOT of people. 

However, by staying in my current job, I retain a steady income for the coming months and have that safety net so I won't be stuck in between careers with no actual job at a given time. This would save me some worrying.

I guess most of my anxiety is centred around worrying that I'll leave my job, retrain and then not be able to find a job in my new field, effectively leaving me in a dangerous situation. I'm confident enough that won't happen but at the same time, things are crazy right now and I don't know if I'd be an idiot to leave my job without another one 100% guaranteed, so I'd like some second, third and fourth opinions. 

To be clear, I'll take nothing as gospel, and I'm not coming here to ask for someone to tell me exactly what to do, I've discussed this with friends and family too, I'd just like more opinions and figured here seems like as good a place as any and if someone could end up sharing something really helpful, so it feels like I'd be silly not to use this sub.",22Dec2020,1
823,"I don't know where else to post this question: 

I live in an apartment house. It's a bi-level basically two apartments on top and two on bottom. I live in an apartment on the upper floor. Recently a new guy moved in below me, I've been here a while so I like to say hello and let my new neighbors know if they need anything, to just let me know. 

This was about 6 months ago. 

I've seen the new guy 4 times. Talked with him 3 times in 6 months. Each time I've talked with him, he was always super awkward.. I never put a lot of thought into it, some people are just like that yuh know? 

Here's where it gets weird: 

One night I was on the front porch having a smoke around 3am and I hear deep thudding and slamming. I turn and look down through his window and I see the lower half of someone (the shades were kinda closed blocking my vision kind of) and their legs are just slamming their heels on the ground - like a kid does when they throw a tantrum and lay on the ground.

Today not 20 minutes ago: 

I work from home and noticed he was home today because I heard him beating the ever living HELL out of something.... Through my floor.. Yelling at what sounded like into a pillow and the bass of heavy not-timed thumps. It sounded like some serious anger and thuds of heavy.... Something... Hitting something else. The apartments are identical so this all happened in his bedroom. Right below mine. 

Not sure how to handle this....

TL;DR - my neighbor is super violent and is hitting and yelling at something. I don't know what to do.",22Dec2020,1
824,"Hello, my name is Ryan Flex. I am a vietnam war veteran with 2 purple hearts - suffice to say I've experienced a lot of scary events in those times.

In 1997, I experienced the strangest and most terrifying thing in my life.

I was sitting with my friend Mark White, we were having a helluva time, when suddenly, his face turned pale, and I felt a sinking feeling in my entire body. Suddenly, I felt like I became much smaller. Mark told me I had literally shrunk to half my size and that I needed to see a doctor. I returned to my original size by the time I got to see the doctor, but I had some scars from where my joints and bones had shrunk and expanded.

I later got a call from the doctor. He said ''Flex, you had shapeshifted.''

He later diagnosed me with Spontaneous Human Shapeshifting, or SHS. Since then, I've had this happen to me 3 more times and I'm worried the 4th may be my last.

Does anyone here know how I can be interviewed by the Discovery Channel? I want more people to be aware of my condition and raise some money to fund for research and a cure.

But then I also hate myself cause of it cause it just I feel like im being an asshole about it, like an overprotective bf or soemthing. I like, ok I‚Äôll give an example.

Why would he feel he needs to justify that to me?

I didn‚Äôt feel like he was attracted to me because he referenced to his hair change and I complimented as then I referenced to mine and he changed the subject.

He called my name twice and told me to look at him when my eyes were closed 

Yeah, my head did a flip and said ‚Äòhe likes you - and you know you like him.‚Äô

I realised I left  my mascara at his but I was going to see my friend so I got ready and I went to meet her and then texted him asking and he was being sweet saying he‚Äôs out but he‚Äôll check when he gets back and calling me pet names.

I said that was fine and thanked him and he said it was okay and I left him on read for 4 hours cause we were both out and I texted him when I got back and I didn‚Äôt get an answer for like 2 days and then I got a response off him and he made conversation with me and then he went back to ignoring me for a week after making conversation with me.

He then said he can‚Äôt find my mascara and made conversation just to completely ghost me again.

Since that crap I've taken care of my body, finished my degree, and got a solid job that allows me to accrue clinical research experience as I prepare to take the MCAT.

846,"_Some backround info I think is important, skip it if you don't like details_

My puberty was very early, I physically developed way faster then everyone else around me and I skipped two grades so I always got along better with older people.
That reflected heavily into who I had and have crushes on, but it did ""even out"" somewhat by now.

When I was 8 I had a nanny and her 12 yo daughter was my first sexual experience. She always encouraged me to get nacked and touch her or let her touch me. I liked it at the time. Now I mainly don't remember or care.
Maybe because of that I got interested in sex very early on, but I lost my virginity when I was 9. Don't want to describe that so don't ask me about it. Because looking back it was way to early and I don't want to give creeps online fap material. 

_here starts the important stuff_

When I was 11 I entered a relationship with a 15 yo old guy and we lasted for about a year. That is the first relationship I really regret.
Idk why exactly. I always consented and he never abused me or anything, but looking back I just don't have nice memories towards this relationship. It was just really awkward and the onky reason I ever dated him was because he had a crush on me and I didn't have the heart to say no. 
We did have sex, but it wasn't good.

So we broke up and when I was 14 idk what hit me, but I made a Grindr account and started texting adult men.
I hooked up with some of them and sexted quite a bunch. Some of them knew my age, some didn't.
They where all in their 20s, early 30s at the oldest. 
At the time it was thrilling, fun and exiting. But remembering it I just feel kind of scummy and dirty.

I always openly consented. Nobody abused me in any way. I flirted with those men.
But the memory just feels so bad.
Like I did something wrong. I feel like I actively hurt them all by flirting with them.
And I hate every single sexual memory I have. 

I didn't hate it at the time, not at all. I enjoyed the thrill. I really loved the attention and compliments I got. I didn't really get much attention in real life so it was great to have those men be all over me. 
But now it feels like a mistake. A big, big mistake. And I have no idea why my feelings on that shifted from overwhelmingly positive to ""I hate it"". 

Is it normal to start regretting things years after they happened? Even if they weren't really bad when they did?
Idk. I just started remembering all of that randomly because of recent relationships struggles and got really sad and angry at myslef for being so stupid.

What do I do with that regret now? Those memories confuse me so much.",22Dec2020,1

# How to get help from the Canadian Government/Police?

I have a big problem.

SO you guys don't get confused. I and my entire family are from Fiji and I myself live in New Zealand.

My sister (who still lives in Fiji) married a guy who claims to be working for the Immigration Dept in Canada. he has been mentally abusive to my sister and her 2 kids. he keeps punching my nephew and swearing at him and keeps making promises and claims that he never keeps and then he when he doesn't get what he wants he starts making threats to the kids and my sister that he'll get them Banned / Red flagged from ever travelling again anywhere.

He is living in my family home in Fiji since Covid-19 happened and living off of my sisters money.

my sister was able to send me pictures of the guys ID/Passport and social insurance number. But now i don't know Who to contact or how to get help from the Canadian Authorities to verify this man's claims. I need him away from my family but i don't know how to do it. I feel as though He is a fraud from the things he has said and done and how he treats my Sister and her kids.

857,"Right off the bat I take covid restriction seriously. Since it started I‚Äôve been at home a lot more and I started playing classic wow to pass the time. Occasionally I go for bike rides.

About over an hour got some great distance.I made a snap of myself biking. One of my friends whom I haven‚Äôt seen since pre covid sees my snap and calls me up since I was nearby. We agreed to catch up at a bar I like and I‚Äôm friends with all the bartenders there, so seeing them again was awesome. When I get home my roommate asks.. where‚Äôd ya go. I told him and he flips shit at me. ‚ÄúYa can‚Äôt go far it‚Äôs covid bro‚Äù. I said sorry I wasn‚Äôt planning on it, it was on spot plans.

869,"Hey, the situation is kinda tricky but still manageable so I do require help.

I'm the younger brother of a family of 5 (mother/father/(23) Brother/(21) Sister). My brother and sister are supposed to live together abroad, but due to covid they're back and unable to go back abroad (in the UK ^^'). My sister's been living there for 3 years and my brother joined her this year. Iwas looking forward for them to leave, because as a 16 y.o.  male I was starting to feel pressure from my brother, who couldn't take his independence quite as much as my sister, because he was still living at my parent's (he was 22). You'll quickly see why I describe him as an alpha male.

As you read it in the title, I'm starting to suffocate. Though we can get along quite well (he gave me a lot of his passions, we have the same hobbies), we can go through difficult phases. He always wants to show me I'm the youngest one: touching my face, taunting me, commenting my appearance and my choices (he tells he's joking, but him doing this all the time makes me think it's not exactly true). These apply to my sister as well, except for physical contact, he also seems to trust her opinions about life a little bit more. It can be unbearable, especially today.

Just before starting, notice that pretty much every negative detail I mention has already happened in the past.

We're on holiday away from home right now. We were playing a game together this afternoon. I was winning (which he hates, he can get real mad and he also can't help blaming it on the game). He quit the game, I tell him he's dumb because I was doing very well, and walked away. He then started to talk to me as ""this kid"" ("" this kid has to calm down""), though he knows I hate it, I stand up, and start getting angry. I still shut up, he shouts at me to sit down three times in a row. At this point, and knowing what happened every time in this situation, I'm in a dilemma: either I sit down, get frustrated, and he gets to taunt me even more, either I fight. He provokes me by telling me to come at him, and I did. After replicating to each move he did (so I wouldn't be the one attacking) , we got separated by our mother (and a kick in the balls, he missed his, I didn't miss mine). Time flowed by, I thought it was behind us. However, when playing again with our sister, he wouldn't stop sticking himself to my back and talk to me in the ear or criticisemy haircut. I didn't do anything this time. Right now we're in the same room, and we have to share the bed for the night, hopefully without a problem

I trully whink he needs to live alone for a while, or at least to leave my parent's house. Every one else in the family agrees on that.

Still, I don't know what he wants: he once confessed me that he would come back home every time he could, but when he comes back he takes way too much place for me to relax.

870,"So back when i lived in a different county in florida, I was about 13 and got a ticket for jaywalking which apparently I find out my dad didn't pay off until I legally changed my own address and got the heck out of town. Which, okay, fine, whatever. Just get it over with. 

So I paid for it...

Flash forward to today, I go all the way up to the DMV by my lonesome to FINALLY get my learners license test done. I go up when I find out my number, guess what? There was another fee I didn't find out about, since apparently I also had to pay a fee to un-suspend my non existent license because I paid it like 5 years too late. 

Which sounds like total bs and the lady telling me agreed. Like, can they even do that? I was 13, I legally couldn't even work. I didn't even know about the ticket fine until I was 18. 

So my question is, if I call when the county office is open (hopefully I won't be put on hold but I doubt it) will they just say they can't do anything about? Can they do that?

873,"So I've got a bit of an issue, my sister has had issues getting herself. And I'm not saying occasionally, I mean like 2 times a day and she will walk around it her dirty clothes until someone tells her to change. Shes worn those watches, gotten rewards for peeing, has been on a schedule and so on but none seem to stick. The second my parents lose track of the routine shes back to her old habit. This has been going on since forever. 

The thing is that my mom has taken her to a counselor as well as a doctor and she was told that shes fine. She gets very defensive when you ask her if she needs to change her pants and always says she doesnt need to go pee. She weirdly doesnt have any bed wetting issues. 

I think it's a more serious psychological issue but as the brother I have no actual say in what my parents do. I don't see how one session with a youth therapist is enough. Basically I have no idea what to do but I'm concerned that shes 11 and still wets herself",22Dec2020,1
874,"I apologize for the long story which is to follow: 

About a year ago I came home from work to find an empty house, my pet cat (a Japanese bobtail named Gnarly) was gone. The only two characters I found within the home that day were my mom and her boyfriend. My mother never liked Gnarly and had on many occasions threatened to throw her outside just out a general dislike for her (and she did throw her outside- to which I had to retrieve her). My mother and I were not in a good relationship at the time, I was 17 and living in a house alone caring for our pets (two cats, one of which was our beloved Norwegian forest cat who died a month before Gnarly‚Äôs disappearance) while my mom, a board certified psychiatrist was out partying, getting drunk, and bringing over random men every night despite having a boyfriend. She paid more attention to her boyfriends children than she did me, and it‚Äôs not as though I was a problem child, I was my mother‚Äôs favorite child supposedly (my other siblings are older and no longer live in the house), but she was bored of me simply out of the fact that I never partied, never drank, and never did drugs (which are typically considered part of the teenage rebellion experience)... I just never did any of those things, I was never interested. Going back to when I came home and my cat was gone I immediately asked where she was to which my mom became defensive and stated that I never cared about her anyway so I shouldn‚Äôt be asking... I never responded to her remark as I knew she was saying it just to anger me, but my mother was never home. I would be alone at home for weeks on end after I learned how to drive because my mom lived at her boyfriends house and only came home when she was angry at him and needed solace. She frequented trips to the Bahamas and even took one of his daughter‚Äôs to Santa Monica, California for her birthday (a place in which my mother and I used to hold dear, as it used to be where we would go and spend our days when I was young for mommy daughter time) and she didn‚Äôt even tell me. I very rarely had food in the fridge, and although I had a mother who was rather wealthy considering she was a doctor I had no food. I had no card to buy food. So of course I got a job to sustain myself and I couldn‚Äôt be home all the time to care for the cats because I had to make money to fill the fridge with more than a cup of yogurt to last me a week. So how could she say that I didn‚Äôt care for my pets? Up until the point where they were both gone they were all I had. The nights I spent crying they would scratch on the door of my room until I opened it so they could console me in their own way. They were my family. 

Regardless, when my mother said this I remained calm and simply asked where she was. If she was going to insult me, fine, but all I care about is if my cat is ok. My mom told me she gave her away to a couple and that she would be well taken care of and that I didn‚Äôt have to worry about it. Nonetheless I pursued and fervently asked every day and tried to figure out who these people were. All I got were first names. My mom refused to give me their contact and prohibited anyone from talking about it because she claimed ‚Äúthey were on vacation now.‚Äù That was the last time I tried, because my mom had told the rest of my family that I was being aggressive and assertive towards her and she felt threatened... to which my family responded by saying that my cat was probably fine, the couple she gave Gnarly to was animal loving and she should be living a good life... except she wasn‚Äôt. For an entire year I tried to tell myself that she was ok and that I should let it be because everyone I trusted (excluding my mother) told me this. However the thought that I would regret never really getting closure plagued me, so finally I started to do research to find out who these people were and to ask how my cat was. After a year a lot had happened. My mom had finally gotten out of her ‚Äúteenage rebellion‚Äù age and began acting like a mom to me again, she broke up with her ex enabling boyfriend and got married to a nice respectable man. It finally felt like our relationship was beginning to heal itself, until a few days ago when I finally retrieved the name of the husband in the couple which my mother stated she had given my cat to. I immediately contacted him and his response was almost immediate... ‚ÄúI know your mother but what cat?‚Äù He then gave me his wife‚Äôs number so I could ask her if she knew anything about my cat to which she replied with an astounding no. All of a sudden all of the lies I had told myself had come crashing down and then instant regret. 
The only other alternative had now been made clear to me. My cat was elderly and my mother considered her to have behavior problems. My cat was either taken to a vet and humanely euthanized.... or she was taken to a shelter as an owner surrender animal and deemed un-adoptable and ‚Äúhumanely‚Äù euthanized. You see, when an elderly pet is taken to an animal shelter they are already a not very likely candidate for the shelter to consider to be adoptable. Especially in a local shelter which is run rampant with overpopulation such as our local shelter. When surrendering a pet you must state the reason for surrendering them, my mom always spoke how my cat had behavioral problems and was aggressive (she wasn‚Äôt) which is I‚Äôm certain 100% the reason she would‚Äôve given. Behavioral problems are the number 1 reason for shelter euthanizations, the second is due to sickness or old age. If my cat had been taken to a shelter she would have been put down, this is certain, because she would‚Äôve been deemed as unwanted. 
It is now that I do not know what to do. I feel as though my family has failed me. I feel as though my mom and I reconciling our relationship has all been a lie. I just don‚Äôt understand how she could do something so cruel. I haven‚Äôt told anybody because I know once the family knows it will be a huge drama, but how can I keep this to myself? I can‚Äôt tell my friends because they will hate my mother again (they are finally starting to like her) and I‚Äôm afraid if I confirm this with my mother that I don‚Äôt think I will ever be able to talk to her again. She knew what the risks were and she knew it was cruel. I had both my cats since I was a little girl. When my Norwegian forest cat died he had to be euthanized as well. He had cancer which had metastasized and spread to his organs, he no longer would eat. I took him to the vet that day and the amount of loneliness I felt in his eyes all I could do was tell him I loved him. Imagining the same thing happening to my other cat but without someone who loved her even being there would tear me apart. All I hope is that whatever the circumstances she knows I didn‚Äôt abandon her and that I loved her. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt keep this truth to myself I just wish things would stay normal and that this was all a lie, but sadly I can‚Äôt ignore it. Does anyone have advice for me, please?

887,"So, 6, or so days ago, my friend told me that he wasn't feeling well, and hes gonna go get tested. I tell him to stay at home, and stay away from his family. He days hes isolating. He juts texted me telling me that he went to his parents place to celebrate his sisters birthday, with her Friends. I was in shock. This dude went to a gathering when he knew he wasn't feeling well. Ibwoupd personally stay in my home for 14 days, probably more, since I was showing symptoms. 

He texted me back, and said this

""I got better fast and last Friday my covid test came back negative. We wouldn't of done this unless I was negative, along with my brother""

That's good he doesn't have covid, but shouldn't he still be isolated in case he has a cold, or flu? I would. Also, do you think hes under the impression that i condone gathering during a pandemic?

889,"My first ever reddit post, I just need some advice.

So some context. 

I met my best mate (Dave) earlier this year in lockdown and we instantly clicked, like we had know eachother our whole lives, we then did everything together. Dave and his girlfriend (Becky) lived above me in the same block of flats so I saw them both everyday. I got on with Becky just as much as I did Dave, but naturally me an Dave just spent more time together because we liked the same things. Smoking spliffs, sports etc.

They were constantly on/off for the last 4 months or so. Dave then suggested we move in together to give their relationship some space. I wanted to move, it was a perfect idea. Dave was living with his grandparents for the last couple weeks at the flats, this meant I spent a lot more time with Becky who was living at the flats alone. We never hooked up at this time because they were still in a relationship.

Come moving day, Becky had broken up with Dave for the 3rd time or so in the last few months, but this one seemed final. Within a month of them breaking up, I had slept with his ex but genuinely because we had a really close bond already but I didn't tell Dave about it because he deep down still thought him and Becky would get back together. 

As always the truth eventually comes out after whispers between friends. I fucked up, I broke his trust, I told him everything after he had suspicions. I broke the bro code.

I want advice on how to make things right. I broke his trust and I value his opinion and help so much that I really want to make things right.

Has anyone else gone through this situation, if so, did you ever repair your friendship/trust? I have apologized, and have told him it's 100% truth going forward, but I understand if he never forgives me. I just need to try and make things right.

TLDR: slept with my housemates ex without telling him, how can I repair our friendship?

897,"I‚Äôve written into this subreddit before, so this may sound a bit familiar as it‚Äôs regarding the same situation.

My (20f) boyfriend (20m) is in the army. I have BPD. We‚Äôve been together for 5 years. Before the army he was the most amazing boyfriend ever. It‚Äôs been a year since he joined and he has just two weeks of training left, and I can safely say that it‚Äôs the worst thing that‚Äôs ever happened to him.

We have arguments over stupid stuff and I‚Äôve recognised that I was getting angry over stupid things, and I‚Äôve taken accountability, apologised, and made steps towards never repeating those unnecessary arguments. It‚Äôs only been a few weeks but it has worked really well and we were starting to get on amazing. 

The issue is that he has recently just completely changed. He will belittle me, say nasty things and when I reply saying why did you just say that, he will say he never said anything and he doesn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm on about (it actually makes me feel like I‚Äôm going crazy and I just start crying) I‚Äôm trying so hard to not explode with anger at him, and I‚Äôve remained calm whilst in his presence so far. I really feel like I‚Äôve made progress with my BPD. 

He has almost pretty much stopped talking to his army friends, and he only wants to spend time with me (context - he‚Äôs usually very independent and also he‚Äôs on leave right now). Just to clarify I can‚Äôt spend time with him all of the time because of my job, but he respects that and it‚Äôs never like he‚Äôs begging me or anything. He messages me throughout the day with pointless things like he never used to and is just overall becoming really clingy to me. 

He has also mentioned that there were a lot of suicides at this point of training. He has told me he hates it there, he is stuck for four years unable to get out, he‚Äôs had a new idea for a career... etc. The fact that he has just suddenly pulled away from all of his friends and everything army related worries me. I have asked him about how his mental health is doing because I‚Äôve noticed the change in his behaviour. He tells me that he‚Äôs fine and won‚Äôt let me discuss it anymore or he‚Äôll get really angry.

I‚Äôm so worried about him but I also don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm reading into a situation too much. I know he wouldn‚Äôt treat me like this usually, and I don‚Äôt mind him being clingy, it‚Äôs just not like him at all, and I don‚Äôt have the time to spend with him right now that I wish I could. He‚Äôs only home for one more week and I‚Äôm just scared about him. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

In both of our families, mental health has always been very hush hush because of pride, although his family way more than mine. Several members of his family are on medication for depression but they keep it such a secret and never talk about it. I‚Äôve tried to tell his mum that I‚Äôm worried about him but she just makes excuses saying that it‚Äôs a hard time for everyone right now. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do but his sudden change in character makes me worried and I‚Äôm just looking for guidance on if I‚Äôm reading into this, or if there is something I can do. 

(Also, I don‚Äôt want to jeopardise his position in the army by getting mental health officials involved)

901,"TLDR: patient gave me a worn 925 silver chain that doesn't fit him anymore and I didn't have the balls to say no and risk being rude even if his intentions are unclear.

I work in mental health as an Occupational Therapy Assistant at a psychiatric hospital. Today one of my patients was sat alone in the lounge where he usually is at this time while I was leaving, and flagged me down saying he wanted to show me something. 
For some background on him, he's your stereotypical tough guy with tattoos and always has a handful of silver rings and chains on. 
I've worked in this job for nearly 2 months now, and we've gotten to know each other and grow a trust over time where he tells me about a lot of his worries and ""delusions"" as it's called with his diagnosis. He's expressed these most often to me with the reason that I ""don't act like he's crazy"" in his words.

He takes out his wallet and at first I'm worried he wants to give me money, but then he pulls out one of his 925 Italian silver figaro style chains. 
These can come ranging from cheap to expensive depending where you get it, and the jeweler he got it from describes their prices as moderately priced (""$$"" on their facebook).
He insists that I take it since he was looking to get rid of it, saying that it was old and didn't fit him anymore, and that it would look real great once it's shined up. I was speechless to say the least, and I didn't know how to decline it if I should have. He's a big scary guy generally and would probably be insulted or upset if I had declined it to be honest.

What makes it worse is that I can't tell if it was platonic or not since he's french/italian/native and said ""je t'aime"" in defense of his decision, which in French can have different meanings in context. He obviously gets along more with me than he does with other staff in my department, so it would make sense if he said ""I like you"" instead of ""I love you"". Like a lot of my patients, he's a flirt to most if not all femal staff with me as no exception, although he clarifies he's joking sometimes. I don't want to give off the wrong impression if that was his intentions, but he gave me a fistbump after giving it to me which seems like a bro move. 

I LOVE my job and what I do with my patients so this does seem like a very sweet act to get rid of one of his old chains to me if he didn't want it, but boy oh boy there is some dilemma here. Should I tell one of my coworkers?",22Dec2020,1

903,"I don't know if anybody can relate to this situation but I would really appreciate it if anyone could help..

I will be starting college in 2 months and I'm already introduced to my seniors and political parties in college thru whatsapp. So there are two major parties in my college, one of which is the student wing of a huge national party(let's call this A). The other party(B) has almost the same ideology except it chooses to stay independent of external pressure/help from the national party so the members are free to criticise anyone if they do something wrong, even if they are national leaders of this particular party.

So I happen to be a big supporter of this national party outside the college so since I hadn't heard much about party B I assumed party A would be the right one for me to join college. And I told one of my seniors over whatsapp that I really love this party and would do anything to support it. So she added me to the party A whatsapp group and got me involved in its matters. I even appeared in a video that they made for human rights day.

But later on, I realised that party B is just as good plus they have much more freedom in college. Many people who support this national party outside are members of party B in college. And I now think joining B is a better decision. And that has put me in an awkward position.

Now I have succeeded in making most people think that I have been thinking of supporting both parties so far but that if I had to pick one, I wouldn't know what to choose. But the senior who got me involved me in this whole thing still doesn't know thay my view has changed. And I don't know how to tell her. I even helped her add more people to the party A group.

My father passed away last year and me and my mom, who's retired, have been struggling financially ever since then. She also had a part time management job to try and make ends meet, but lost it due to the pandemic.
I have an amazing boyfriend who I met this spring and since he's making a decent amount of money, has sorta been spoiling me since day one. At the beginning I felt so uncomfortable with it, but I realised how happy it made him, so I slowly eased into it. He asked me to move in with him a month ago and has been making me so comfortable in what he now calls, 'our' home. I am beyond blessed. I realise how lucky I am to have found such a generous man, who's willing to share everything with me and not ask for anything back.
Ever since we started dating, I try to contribute as much as I can financially, using half of my social benefits (which isn't much) for us and half for my mother.
I accidentally found out what my Christmas present is (saw a receipt lying on the floor) and it's something I could never afford for myself. I also absolutely love it!
I want to be able to give back to him and buy him something nice, but I don't have the money right now.
I also want to buy my mom a nice pair of sweatpants - there are ones she really really wants, but can't afford. And it's just sweatpants!
I also want to be able to at least afford any kind of gift for some of my friends and two of the children I used to babysit. I want to say thanks to all the people who made my life easier and more joyous after my dad passed away.
I have a gold coin my mother gave me (she gave me a few of them), which if I sold to a jewelry shop, would get me around 150$. Not much, but enough to buy gifts for the people that matter the most.
When my mom gave me the coins, she said I can do whatever I want with them - I told her I'd try to sell them as collectibles (they date from the 1800's), but soon realised that's basically impossible to do where I live (a developing country). I also had no luck online.
I'm not sure what to do and whether I should sell a 1860 gold coin for it's bullion value. It is also a bit damaged (chipped), so I don't see myself selling it for more in the future.
At the same time, my  mom is struggling to pay the bills and I'd sell it for Christmas presents. She doesn't believe selling gold is wise and would never sell the coins herself, unless she absolutely had to. 
This is why I feel guilty about wanting to sell it for presents.

906,"I (27f) am a carer for my gran and visit her almost every day to help with general life. My parents (who both work from home) also visit her too as she lives a 5 minute walk away from our house.

Under current guidelines in my country, 4 households are allowed to meet up, and households can form ""support bubbles"" with one other person who is living alone - for that it is my gran. Aside from shopping (while taking every precaution possible) we only have contact with her and nobody else.

Now in recent months, my gran has become quite lonely due to the pandemic. Although I visit her every day, it's a huge change from always having neighbours/granchilden coming in and out of her house all the time, and going out to bingo. 

I think as a reaction to this, she's become quite attention seeking. She's starting to do this thing where if I bring her a cooked meal she'll say ""oh there's no way I can eat that!"" but sure enough, the plate will be empty half an hour later. She'll also say that she's not eating (but she isn't losing weight, in fact she's gaining it) like she wants us to worry and say ""please eat"". 

Now with Christmas, it would literally just be the 4 of us, and just to be safe - me, my mum and dad are getting covid tests tomorrow. Whenever we bring it up she says that she doesn't want to ""risk it"", which just makes no sense because the only difference is that she'd be in our home instead of us visiting her.

Now we've all just giving her the answer she wants and say ""alright then"" when she says she doesn't want to come, but I really want her there. She's not particularly vulnerable, but she's old and life is delicate...

909,"I‚Äôm gonna try and keep this short but there‚Äôs a lot of stuff that has happened. My friend reported a former coworker for saying the n word a few months back. His defense was that he was quoting what her music said since it was inappropriate. Her music does consist of rap songs from black artists. The manager did nothing and he was let go without and repercussions. She ultimately ended up quitting the job for mainly for this reason and other reasons because she didn‚Äôt want to work with a racist. He also found out it was her that reported him as the manager gave it away. For context, she is white and so is the coworker.

My friend has many illnesses and disorders but for this situation, it‚Äôs her PTSD and morality ocd. So with that being said, she saw him at her gym lastnight and freaked out. She then concluded that she was going to leave. Prior to that she had spent $200 on another gym bc she was indecisive about whether or not to get a membership. So now she‚Äôs at a new gym and she‚Äôs been at this one for a little over three weeks and now wants to leave because of him. 

Awhile back when we were hanging out with a group of friends she overheard one of the guys say the N word and for uncomfortable. No one else heard him say it and when it got late, she had no way of getting home other than walking. He offered her a ride but she declined over and over. Everyone was confused and she asked me to walk her home because she was also high. My boyfriend was mad at that because we live in a semi dangerous neighborhood. I ended up walking her home with my boyfriend as he didn‚Äôt want me walking home back

A few days later she asks me what my boyfriends ethnic background was. I asked her why and she replied with a ‚Äúbecause he says the N word a lot‚Äù. I told her he‚Äôs Puerto Rican and half black. She just nodded. She then referred to that night where one of the guys said the word and was wondering why the two other black people weren‚Äôt offended. I told her that they were fine with him saying it as theyre friends. She said that she didn‚Äôt understand that. 

Lastnight I asked her if she really heard him say it and she said yes. I then proceeded to politely ask her why she felt the need to go overboard with all this and why she acts like it directly offends her even though she is white and not black.

This is when shit blows up. She starts lecturing me and tells me that I‚Äôm in the wrong and to REALLY think about what I just said. She said that it has nothing to do with her skin color but more about morality. My boyfriend and several other people think she‚Äôs got a white savior complex. I truthfully think it has to do with her morality ocd. 

She then tells me that her PTSD also is the reason why she wants to leave her gym even though realistically her former co worker wouldn‚Äôt do anything dangerous to her. But I understand the fear

I‚Äôve been there for her. There have been many many things she‚Äôs said that I don‚Äôt agree with but I am exhausted. Her personality has revolved around every mental illness she struggles with. She goes to therapy. But it‚Äôs not enough. And I don‚Äôt know how to cut her off as she said she doesn‚Äôt want to fight and really values the friendship. But I‚Äôm so tired.

910,"TW: rape

I'm sorry if I'm not doing this right, I asked many of my friends for advice but they all referred me to reddit to get a neutral perspective so this would be my first post on reddit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically as the title suggests, I was raped back in college 5 years ago by this guy I used to date. I never reported it because he would have lost everything and I didn't want to ruin his life; instead I blocked him on everything &amp; moved on. I met him again 2 years later and I thought I was over it so I agreed to meet to have coffee. We didn't mention that night it happened, we just had the coffee and that was about it but I never wanted to see him again after that. I thought I just forgave him and just let it be. Fast forward to 2020, I started therapy for another issue of mine and the event was brought up. I realized I was never really over it. Even re-telling the story of what happened and how I felt afterwards to my therapist was so traumatizing; I remembered everything vividly and cried for the first time in their office. I realized I wanted closure, that I just wanted him to know what he did and that he would never do it to another person. I happened to have my ex on social media already (which was a non-issue before; I never had any problems seeing his posts or him seeing mine) so I decided to message him. As you can imagine, he denied everything and called me a liar. I'm not surprised and I should have known this would happen. 

My concern is that he has a new girlfriend. I don't know whether I should tell her what he did to me. Because like I said, I just wanted to know that he recognized what he did wrong and would never do it again; but he thinks he did nothing wrong and I'm worried that he may do the same thing to her. She probably won't believe me, which is fine, but she probably will. Regardless, I don't want to ruin their relationship either.

912,"Hi so I‚Äôm kinda new here - literally feel like I have nowhere else to turn to for this kinda thing..

So I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend just over two years but our relationship is starting to fizzle out. He always tells me how much he loves me etc. I really couldn‚Äôt ask for a better boyfriend but I just feel like I‚Äôm not feeling it anymore? I find myself pretending to be asleep if he FaceTimes / calls and find our conversations boring. I‚Äôve felt like this for months now.

An old friend from school recently messaged me and I‚Äôve been thoroughly enjoying catching up with him. I haven‚Äôt flirted with him or anything of that sort. We just like a lot of the same music and often share things or talk about our lives. I always had a crush on this guy when I was in high school and he is so lovely. I feel like I‚Äôm enjoying my time talking to him more than I am with my boyfriend? What does this even mean?

I feel so anxious and uncertain and really need advice from a non biased source.

Thank you so much in advance to anyone taking the time to help me ‚ù§Ô∏è",22Dec2020,1
913,"Hey guys. Just before I start, I don't want this post to just seem like me slagging off my husband, because he's otherwise a great guy and I genuinely love him dearly. 

We come from very different walks of life. I grew up relatively well off with loving parents, he grew up in poverty with an abusive uncle. He has a very survivalist independent type views on life and obviously isn't a very emotional person. And that's fine, I married him knowing who he was, what he believed, etc. 

But lately - about the past 2 months - I'm worried about him. He seems more distant than usual and just...Very on edge. He barely smiles. He just goes from point A to point B completely robotically. I tell him I love him and he can talk to me about anything. He just says he loves me too and moves on. He has sex with me, but it's nowhere near as passionate as it once was. He still meets his friends, but he seems like he wants out as soon as possible. Still works, but you can tell he just fucking hates it now. Drinks more too. Sleeps more. Even got in a fucking barfight the other day (I didn't even know he was at a bar). I don't think he's fully depressed, but he clearly isn't doing well. He has never been like this. 

So I asked him what was up and if he was doing okay. He looked at me like I was insane and said he's fine, how am I? I said I could tell something was wrong and told him everything I've noticed in this post. He just said he would be okay and to - and I quote - get off his dick (jokingly, but still). I asked if he wanted to talk to someone. He laughed at me and asked what some overpaid stuck up cretin with a degree was going to do even if he needed it - teach him to breathe? I said it's not always like that and therapy can help everyone. He said I just thought that because that's how rich people solve their problems, by paying people to listen. He sounded so mad. I hate to admit it, but that comment hurt me a little. He's never been bitchy with me about that in our years of being together. 

I don't know what to do at this point. Wait for him to cheer up? Keep pestering it? I'm so lost",22Dec2020,1
914,"Sorry if this seems like a vent post but I‚Äôm pretty depressed atm. I (19f) have a small friend group who I really like to hang out with but there‚Äôs some issues that make me feel really left out when I do. I started dating my boyfriend 3 1/2 years ago and met his friend group which is now my friend group, all males, and while I love them all I don‚Äôt really have my own friends. The one friend I do have that I made myself (we‚Äôve been friends since middle school) is now part of this group and dating one of my boyfriend‚Äôs friends, which is great for them but I feel like in the process I kinda got left behind. No real connection with her anymore and now whenever I want to hang out with her it becomes a group thing. When we do hang out one on one it‚Äôs almost awkward as I feel we‚Äôre just growing apart interest wise. The only other friend I have (also from middle school) is sweet and we‚Äôre much closer but she just doesn‚Äôt initiate hanging out with me and she‚Äôs always canceling on me with some bs excuse. 

On top of that I feel really lost and dependent bc I‚Äôm living with my boyfriend and his family, no longer have my own family (foster care), and don‚Äôt really have anything else going on in my life. No real hobbies, failed work friendships, and no real outlet besides playing games. It‚Äôs kinda gotten to the point that I play a round of CoD in hopes that I have a nice teammate who doesn‚Äôt call me a whore as soon as I speak so I can have some social interaction. Idk what to do but I really would like to make my own friends, I just feel really awkward and don‚Äôt know where to start. Any suggestions?",22Dec2020,1
915,"19/F. 

Still kinda processing wtf just happened and I'm still confused. 

Work at a wireless retail store. We had a meeting today  to address some drama related issues we've been having at the store, because a lot of changes have recently been made and a lot of new people have been hired on. 

Like our store manager suddenly quit over night, so two employees here got promoted in his place. 

But today has been wild. We had about three different customers threaten to report us, and at one point had to threaten to call the police on one customer because he was so hostile and we felt very threatened. 

Then at our meeting, I'm just listening to what everyone is saying and the issues, and agreeing, because I was down with fixing issues in our store and changing things for the better. You know, because I CARE. 

Then my coworker suddenly chimes in, looks at me, and says, ""Yeah, and this is a *team effort* miss lone wolf, little miss ""I don't give a fuck.""

I had no idea what he was talking about so I asked, and apparently I have an attitude where I act like I don't care. And I'm confused, because I feel like I care too much on the inside. And I feel like I'm the one who's been saying ""we're supposed to be a team"" for like the past 3 weeks. 

But, I guess I was really frustrated or something, because I started crying and hypventilating. It was SO embarrassing, which made everything worse. And now, I'm at work, clocked off and waiting for my grandparents to come get me, because of this fucking douchebag. And everyone probably thinks I'm pathetic or something now. I've never dealt with this in my life at a job. He started saying ""you know I'm right"" and it pissed me off even MORE. 

Because I DO care on the inside, but I've never been a very expressive person and it's something I have been struggling with forever. I'm trying to act like an adult, be mature, and do things the right way but apparently I just suck at everything I guess.",22Dec2020,1
916,"I have my masters degree and two certifications in my field. I got a job with a local government and have been here 6 months. One may ask , ‚Äúwhy are you working for local government?‚Äù 

Because I‚Äôm a realist and jobs are hard to come by. This job offers growth, with little competition for higher paying spots, especially with my credentials. The only problem is, I‚Äôm 20 years younger than my coworkers, and I HAVE AMBITIONS. I mean, I want to be huge.

My older male coworker pretends I‚Äôm an ego maniac and I‚Äôm not. In my opinion, he‚Äôs bitter that he‚Äôs not huge, and takes his failures out on my ambition. He actually asked me if I was liberal or conservative, when I didn‚Äôt give him an answer, he labeled me as a conservative. If I express interest in listening to or being apart of higher up strategic meetings, he scoffs that I ‚Äúwish I was that important‚Äù.

My SO doesn‚Äôt seem to notice and their parents are the coddling type who don‚Äôt like to point out flaws in their children to avoid hurting their feelings because ‚Äúnobody is perfect‚Äù.

Whenever we‚Äôre in public I do notice glances at us from the brother‚Äôs volume too.

My brother imitates African accents sometimes and I just don't feel like it's right. He also say Arabic words like ""Allah Akbar"" or "" wAllah"" and my muslim friend told me it was disrespectful towards her religion. He says that his friends are ""retarded"" or ""autistic"" to mean that they are stupid and he says that he is not homophobic but when he thinks about it, it makes him want to puke.

919,Basically a person I knew from my old school decided to chat with me and he said if I would have sex with someone I knew which has him on tiktok and goes to my school and I send yes and he clipped it and put on tiktok and I have been have a rough time and I started bursting out crying like a baby and he clipped that and I beg him to delete it but he posted it and he said my name and send it to the girl and one of her friends who also goes to my sure send a laughing emoji so I'm guessing she send it. Thankfully I removed the audio of the clip saying I would have sex with her but people still saw it and the crying one is still up.

924,"My friend (f18) has been with her boyfriend (m18) for a few years now and our entire friend group doesn‚Äôt like the guy and have been hoping they would break up for a while. For some background: they‚Äôve been together for almost all of high school, she got together with him right after another relationship ended and we all assumed he was the rebound. In the beginning, he was cool and we enjoyed being friends with him but over the years he has continually become more difficult to be around. I think part of the reason is that they only spend time together and he hasn‚Äôt had to make any new friends so he‚Äôs lost some social skills. Some of the reasons we don‚Äôt enjoy being around him are that he is a know-it-all and always has to be right, weather it‚Äôs about politics, religion, or any small subject he shoots down anyone with a different opinion. He has also yelled at me in the past (in public) and it really bothered me that he would embarrass me in front of our friends. For a while there I stopped being friends with the entire group because of him but eventually came back as they are my closest friends (and I found out that nobody else enjoyed being around him and that it wasn‚Äôt just me who felt this way). I could go on and on about the little things he does that have added up throughout the years (some being minor things and some being bigger things). He also doesn‚Äôt treat his girlfriend/my friend that well, like I‚Äôll suggest something fun for a date idea, such as ‚Äúyou guys should go to pet stores in the area and look at the animals, it‚Äôs like a free zoo‚Äù and she‚Äôll say ‚Äúoh Boyfriend wouldn‚Äôt want to do that‚Äù. Just little things that show he is still being selfish even to her. I know these reasons sound very minor but everything has added up and I could provide more specific stories if anyone was interested. Basically, I was hoping they would call it quits after high school since she is going off to college completely on the other side of the country and he has a job lined up here in state. But they obviously didn‚Äôt end it and he has made an effort to keep her attached by constantly texting and FaceTiming and even visiting her a few times to make it harder for her to adjust to her new life and have some space and meet new people. At this point she knows how we feel about him and think that they should end it but I don‚Äôt think she sees him the way we do and she doesn‚Äôt realize the extend of our dislike.

But I can‚Äôt remember the last time I bought myself anything (or when he bought me anything). Yeah, it‚Äôs a selfish thought. But my blood is boiling because I just think of how many credit card payments his bonus could help out with. But his first thought is to buy the PS5, and that irks tf outta me. Am I wrong for feeling like his priorities are misaligned?

I know I need to talk to him. But he isn‚Äôt easy to talk to and I don‚Äôt want to come off as controlling. I know he‚Äôll get really mad and go ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs MY money‚Äù or just get pissy about it with me and constantly throw me into guilt trips over the next couple weeks.
