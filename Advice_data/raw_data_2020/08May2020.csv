0,"I was furloughed from my first job because of Covid and there’s nothing I can do about that. My second job, a job as a retail employee, I have been staying home from willingly. I have faced no consequences from my employer who said to call when I felt comfortable enough to go back to work. 

It has been a month now and Covid is nowhere near done in my state. The county where I work is the county with the most cases in the state and we’re not plateauing yet. I’m getting some pressure from my dad, whom I live with, to go back to work. He’s the reason why I stayed home in the first place. He is particularly susceptible to Covid because of cancer treatments among other things. 

Any advice? Comments? I would appreciate any feedback because I’m kind of stuck in a rut on this one.",08May2020,1
1,"So me (M27) and my wife (26) are having our first child. We both have good stable jobs and great family support system but now that it is getting more real I don’t want to mess this kid up.

I lost my father in my early twenties and he had a such a positive impact on me and I want to provide the same for my child. Since he’s gone I can’t really turn to him. Any fathers here have any guidance of what I should do or keep in mind?",08May2020,1
2,"Everywhere I've applied to for an IT position I've been turned down. I've had 2 interviews, and of course, was turned down. Is there a sub for IT jobs? Do you guys know anyone who wants to hire an entry level IT person who's in school? Thanks.",08May2020,1
3,"Basically my goal is to make him pay me so that I stop knocking on his tenants doors. I was conned. He had me do some small jobs and paid me right away. Then he wanted to have me do a lot of jobs at all of his properties as one big bid. He said that I should do everything that's wrong no matter what it was because he wanted all of his rentals to be up to code. Even the little things. I thought I was lucky during this virus pandemic because I had work.

 I spent all the savings I had in my LLC to do this for him. No contact was signed and all I have are text from him saying he will mail me a check like had before. Now he's saying he paid me in cash. 

I'll survive this either way but I want to make him pay me for it. Anyone have a better idea. I should have signed a contract but I'm easily swooned. He really seemed legit to me.",08May2020,1
4,"IPhone X user here with a non-original charging cable. I wanted to charge it and it suddenly froze and the Apple logo kept flashing. I wanted to forcefully restart it and it told me to connect it to ITunes. On ITunes, I tried to update it, but it kept making that ""USB ejected"" sound while trying to update the software. 

I tried several third party software to exit the recovery mode, but it keeps getting back to the flashing Apple logo.

I can't restore it and lose my data. I don't know exactly when it was last backed up, or when was Whatsapp backed up, but I was waiting for a very urgent text from someone on Whatsapp and there is no other way of contacting them. Over here it's 2 AM and I can't go to a store right now to fix it. Please help me recover it as before, or please tell me there is only a problem with the USB - worst case scenario I buy one tomorrow morning.",08May2020,1
5,"I joked around about wanting birds to see what my moms reaction would be since I thought she’d be absolutely against it. She knows they’re messy and noisy since she works nights and she’s very strict about cleanliness. She’s owned birds before. I joked about it one time while we were at the pet store to just to annoy her. She took that very literal and for Christmas, she decided to surprise me with 2 parakeets. I didn’t know how to take care of them nor did I have the patience to. I rarely take the time to tame them or interact with them and I don’t want to just make them stay in a cage all their lives. It’s been over 4 months and they’re still terrified of me. I’ve never hurt them or done anything to make them this scared and I take care of them. They have lots of toys and seem to be happy with each other. She makes me buy the food and treats for them which gets pretty expensive as I’m only 14. When it’s cold out and I’m unable to put them outside during the daytime, she tells me to cover them and leave them in the dark until she wakes up to go to work since they’re very loud. I don’t know what to do. I’m confused and I feel bad. I’ve let this go on for too long. Do I tell her how I feel? How do I tell her how I feel? Do I keep it to myself and try to tame them? How can I get them to like me?",08May2020,1
6,"So I (just turned 16 on Monday) have been fighting with my parents for a little over a year now with substance related things (weed and vapes in my room nothing terrible) but they’ve tried everything to get me to stop like rehab,threatening to move me to the middle of nowhere, taking everything but my bed from me,etc and now randomly out the blue I was told “you can have you things back, keep your location on and drugs out of my house but your 16 and gonna do what your gonna do I can’t control you”.

What do you do when designers start changing your illustrations? 

Is that a normal thing? It's the second time happening to me. Delivering a big batch of finals, and then receiving notes for corrections from designer to make ""little tweaks"" (they never little tweaks are they?) and when I compare the pdf they sent with the originals, there's resizing, rearranging and recolouring on several pages. 

Obviously, I prefer my versions.

19,"Hi all,

My bro seems to have confidence issues. He’s in his second year of college and I am concerned for him. He doesn’t seem to have many friends and I can see he feels lonely. Even when I bring him out, he stays quite quiet. However if this were five years ago, he’d have no issue talking to people. 

What is concerning is he really misses his childhood and doesn’t really have a positive outlook on life. The childhood part is probably because he had a lot of friends and company back in school which he has lost. He also easily doesn’t see that some people are bad as he just wants some company who aren’t his immediate family which I can understand, but what if it ends up with him getting conned out of his savings.

I don’t want him to commit suicide or anything. My parents are old and if one of them were to pass, it would definitely break him. 

What can I do to help him? Would therapy bring up his confidence again. This virus isn’t helping either.",08May2020,1

She started touching me more (rubbing her finger down my chest, whispering in my ear, and biting her lip and touching my hand) now this is where it gets blurry due to my extreme alcohol blood levels. She ask me where a room was so I went to go show her, I stopped her and I either asked her to kiss me or just made a move for it but didn’t do it. She asked to see the bathroom and I showed her and then tried to kiss her, I pulled back. I don’t know why but I did. Her boyfriend then walked in. After this I was completely black out. From now on in the story, this is all from a few of my buddy’s eyes 2 out of 3 were sober. I was laying on the bed passed out and she was talking to her boyfriend and rubbing my chest.

22,so about 2 months before the pandemic my sister boyfriend got into a fight with his entitled mom. it ended with him having to break back into his own house to get his stuff out. while he was there he decided to grab his cats. i told him not to bring them here as i'm deathly allergic and have bad asthma. i was actually recently out of the hospital due to complications with asthma during this time. he insisted on bring them here because he was moving in to this house. he said it would only be for 2 days because he has a plan to keep them somewhere until he moves out. i finally let up and said fine. he brought the cats here and i dealt with the allergies. the 2 day mark came and i reminded him that he needs to find a place for the cats. he said it would take more time. i was mad but i let it slide. i complained to one of my friends who has cats and he said he could help me out. i told my sister bf and he was happy. my friend and sister boyfriend talked and my friend agreed to take the cats for a month while my sister bf decides a more permanent place to keep them. l was overjoyed because finally i would be able to breath fine. my friend got his mom to drive over with 2 kennels for each cat to bring them to his place. everything was going smoothly until about one month later when my friend had to drop the cats off. my sister bf had nothing planned for these cats witch pissed me off because he had so much time to figure it out. this was the last straw i bitched at him and warned him to get rid of them or else. it's been like 4 months and the pandemic is in full swing. these cats are making my life hell. i went through more inhalers in this time then i've went through in my life. these cats are putting my life at risk. i don't know what to do. i can't just tell my sister and her bf to get rid of them because no ones willing to take them during this pandemic. please help,08May2020,1

24,"\[Bit of context\]  
(My mom is not a tech savvy person and knows practically nothing about iPhones other than that they're expensive and have good cameras)  


So my birthday is on the 10th and I've been in need of a new phone with my old phone barely working and my mom decided to get me a new one yesterday from Metro (our provider.)    


She knew that I like the iPhone 7 a lot (but would really take any iPhone) so she went to the only Metro store in our whole city and tried to buy an iP7, they told her something along the lines of they didn't have them or they didn't have them unlocked or whatever. So she decided to go with the 32gb iP6s  (which is a good phone) she came home, waited a day before realizing she had to leave and wouldn't be back for a couple of days to go look at a house on the opposite side of the state, so she decided to give me the phone early. The phone had a passcode on it (which was just 012345) and we got confused and decided to look at the receipt, now, I only saw it for a few seconds but my mom confirmed it was the price they gave her, $699.   


Now, Amazon and Wal-mart charge around $150 for the phone with other stores offering around the same for it, on the Metro website it's listed for $450 (if you don't switch to Metro for it) but we've been with Metro for a while and we have (should) upgrades available (if they even do that there) the biggest problem here is that they told my mom it was ""literally the same thing"" and that it came with AirPods (which it obviously didn't) marked up $699 for it, and said that she couldn't switch my phone line for that one and would have to add another one for about $182 (according to the amount due text I got from Metro) and now she's gone for a couple days and I don't know the return policy for Metro, any advice on what I should do?  


(I'd be fine with the 6s if I knew they didn't charge my mom that much for the phone as we are not a well-off family that can just throw money around like that, in fact, I didn't even expect her to spend more than $2 or 3 hundred on my birthday itself, but she was trying to be nice and I believe the Metro employees took advantage of her naivety.)",08May2020,1
26,"I live in Albania,a small country.Its a beautiful place to visit but it has its own good and bad side.
Albania has very religious and judgemental people.They judge every step you do,especially if you’re a woman.I hate how I can’t be free because if my parents give me enough freedom to see my friends on the weekend then people will say that they lost control of me and now I’m a wh*re as they would say for every girl.

I can’t date until I’m 20 or older and even if I date someone before that age then I’m probably getting engaged or locked in the house.I can’t post cute pictures or have guy friends.My parents think that our reputation is the most important thing.

I can’t wear these cute new crop tops because I’m fat and that would make me a h*e.What would people think?Being overweight here is the worst thing for girls.People will always say “There is no man that’s gonna marry you if you don’t lose weight”.

“If you don’t cook and clean then why are you useful for”-says my mom 
I’ve always worked hard on my grades and I’m a good student but that’s not enough for them.


Besides that I’m not even allowed to wear tampons or period cups because i would lose my virginity like that ,even though I’ve explained to my mother that it doesn’t work this way.

27,"Some pretext, I bought a copy of dark souls 3 about a year ago. I made this transaction via steam. Upon giving steam and then inevitably Bandi Namco my money I was granted a license to use my copy of dark souls 3 in a consumer capacity.

 In addition, I was granted the digital code that is dark souls 3 and a promise of future access to said code via steam.

As of today, Bandi Namco has disabled the ability to lend the game to another steam account via steam's ""family share tool"" 

Some more pretext, while family sharing a game to another steam account the original owner cannot access the game until the lende stops accessing the game. What this effectively amounts to is 1 copy of a game being shared between friends.

Up until today for over 4 years you have been able to family share your copy of dark souls 3 to another steam account. As of today, you can no longer do this due to a decision made by Bandi Namco.

Are they within their legal rights to restrict what I can do with a good I purchased from them or are they violating their end of the EULA.

For context, if I had bought a physical copy of dark souls 3 rather than a digital one I would still be able to physically give my friend my copy of Dark Souls 3. Excluding the delivery method, both versions of dark souls 3 are identical.",08May2020,1
28,"My parents are pretty strict. They’re all about proper education and whatnot. My siblings have gotten full scholarships to college and passed with great GPAs.

Me on the other hand, have always been seen/called the “disappointment” of the family. Always one step behind them education wise. I got into a pretty good school but got little to no scholarship at all. My family insisted I saved the money and went to community college but I felt insulted and felt it was their way of calling me the idiot of the family. So I said no, and took a loan and started paying for it myself.

I’ve never been a school kid, never will. Don’t consieer myself to be incompetent, I took AP classes in highschool and did fine, but school is just not my thing. Plain and simple.

Come my first year at the school, a month in, I get terrible anxiety. I’ve had mild anxiety here and there growing up, but who doesn’t? This one was different. I would have really bad panic attacks and even wake up from nightmares following a panic attack. It got to the point where I didn’t sleep often because I was too afraid to. I started going to therapy towards the end of the semester but didn’t get very far with it because my school’s mental health department is very weak. I remember I would always tell my therapist when I saw her, “I’m convinced I’ve died and I’m in hell”. 

Obviously with this panic in my life, I could not complete schoolwork. I stayed on the internet during this and tried doing something productive as I felt hopeless. Since then, I’ve made my own income online (which I’d like to keep anonymous just for my own privacy). I do pretty well financially now.

I was kicked out of school. I applied for my classes to be withdrawn, but my response went something amongst the lines of, “Although we empathize with your situation, we do not hold responsibility and cannot take this as an acceptable reason to be withdrawn from classes”. Always thought that was fucking bullshit but I was always too sad to even try to dispute it.

I haven’t told my parents for 2 years now. As I’ve always been seen as the “family disappointment”, I don’t want to tell them my biggest disappointment yet. Even though I had the anxiety, my parents are foreign and I know them well enough to say that they will call me a liar and that it’s just a bullshit excuse.

It makes me sad just thinking about telling them. I used to cry over it but it’s been too long for me to dwell. I just still don’t have the courage to get it out of the way. They’ll hate me.


TL;DR: Family disappointment. Strict and foreign parents. Kicked out of college because of anxiety. Don’t have the balls to tell them I’ve disappointed them again.

29,"This might be too much to explain. I’m a lesbian- I want to meet a lesbian like myself who’s honestly just a lazy pervert. But tbh any girl that’s been near my level psychologically and pervertedly has unsurprisingly also been unfaithful. In a way it might go hand in hand that a pervert, who’s even remotely attractive, and smart enough to play head games is more likely to be someone who tricks others- but on a moral sense- if I can have that- I want love and a humble family life eventually. But I’m so frustrated and bored all I want is to talk to some girls and not have any idea who or what they want so there’s no danger of being lead on- I’m not sure where to even do this. Ive tried anonymous dating sites but I quickly become bored and I’m not sure how to progress the conversation into something more sexual with any of them as most dating apps are for hooking up in person or dating. I just wanna talk and masturbate in peace. Maybe this is the wrong place to ask this- anyone have any ideas of where to start?

32,"I’m a senior in high school and I just received my financial aid letter from the college I put in my deposit for and it’s a lot more expensive than I was expecting. Like 10k+ more expensive. When I was looking to commit, I forgot to think about room/meal costs, book costs, transportation, etc. I can’t believe I overlooked something like this and I feel so stupid. I was finally feeling happy about where I committed and I was coming to terms with everything and now all of that is gone. I can’t pay 38k a year for four years. I know I should’ve checked my financial aid stuff before I put in my deposit but I had just gotten off the waitlist for this school and I didn’t realize how much everything would cost. 

I guess my options right now are community college, National Guard, reserves, or going to that college and hoping that I can get an ROTC scholarship by the time I graduate. After I got accepted, I was just thinking that I could go for the 3 year ROTC scholarship my sophomore year (don’t have my citizenship yet) and get the rest paid off. But there’s a chance that I won’t get the scholarship and I’ll have to pay for everything. I can’t risk that. Before I got accepted, I was leaning towards joining the national guard or another military branch so I guess I back to that.

34,"Hey everyone, I'm 19M, my boyfriend is 20M. We've been together for five months now. Recently due to worldly circumstances, I had to return home from college to my home country. We decided to continue our relationship long distance, even though I'm not going back to his country anymore for college.

I'm going to college in my country in the fall (as long as the world stops ending). He asked me if I was open to him moving to where I'll be going to college. After a bit of deliberation, I gave him the go ahead. When we first started dating, I told him that I'd be moving at the end of the school year. It was both of our first relationship, and I told him my intentions were to get some experience dating, since I missed out on dating in high school due to the environment I was in. I  knew he realllly liked me, and I really liked him too. So when it was time for me to leave I told him that if he wanted he could join me in the fall. 

Staying in touch online has been very difficult for me, and he often brings up insecurities he has in our relationship. These insecurities often being about how I'm not the best at responding. If I'm being honest, I know I'm not as invested in this relationship as he is. If things ended abruptly I'd be very upset, but not nearly as much as he would be. I'm starting to wonder if him moving is a good idea anymore. I really need to focus on school as the degree I'm going for has a larger than average course load, and I failed two of my eight classes this semester as a result of online learning (I'll need to make these up asap).

Part of me wants to end things, and focus on college. Maybe start dating again when I have better study habits. I've thought about it a lot and if I ended things, when I started dating again I don't think I want to go back to him. I'm a musician, and I'd love to try and date somebody with similar interests (for better or for worse, I'd love to find out).

When it comes to dating, I feel like I just want to gain a lot of experience from different types of relationships. Like I said, I didn't have the option of dating in high school. I want to get to know myself by experience.

I've explained this to him before, and he's gotten pretty upset that I would want to explore other relationships someday. He's told me he's in love with me. I love him too, but I don't think I'm in love with him. I don't think he would fully understand why I wanted to end things.

I feel like I've been upfront with my intentions, but I think he may be a bit (a lot) blinded by love. I only want the best for him, but he deserves someone that loves him more than I can right now. I don't really feel like he'd be satisfied with why I would want to end things.

Do I have enough reason to end things? I've never broken up with anyone before. I hear they often end in fights, but we don't ever get mad at each other. 

I've noticed that he hasn't been looking into moving at all, which is confusing to me because I know he really wants to move to where I'll be. I'd be worried sick about how the heck do I immigrate to a new country if I was him. Idk if he's not doing anything because the world is shut down, or if he knows I'll end things before then.

I guess my main question is: do I have good enough reasons to end things? Or am I being stupid and not realize that I shouldn't give up on a relationship that's working fine for the most part?

I feel like I've been stuck in my head and need to hear this from a different perspective to be able to make a rational decision.


TL;DR Is it okay to end the relationship I'm in to focus more on school and to explore other relationships, even though our relationship is going well for the most part",08May2020,1
35,"I (21F) messed things up with ex (25M) badly 6 months ago. I said things to him and he broke things off. I was going through a dark time a few months after and texted him some mean things out of hurt. He got mad obviously. Then I blocked him on everything and told him never to I contact me. I feel terrible. I hated myself at this time. My feelings for him are gone now yet I have such a guilty conscious. I think it would be healthy to apologize but I don’t want to call or message as I don’t think that kind of communication would be best. Would writing a letter be to creepy? I just want to apologize for all the things I said with no intent to be replied to as a text or message would imply. I simply want to say my piece and feel less guilty. What do you guys suggest? 

I think a letter would help me heal and would also allow me to get rid of this guilt. I think it might make him feel less guilty too as he knows shortly after our break up I attempted to hurt myself. I think he feels guilty for it but it was not due to him but due to outside issues. I want him to know this as well in the letter. 

Any suggestions? It’s been 6months since the breakup and 2 since texting/blocking him. Do I seem crazy obsessed if i write a letter like I can’t move on? I don’t know what to do but I think about how guilty I feel once a week...

TLDR; bad breakup, blocked now, want to apologize in letter format to help us both remove our guilt but am not sure what is best?",08May2020,1
38,"Hey, so i need urgent advice on something that happened today.

So we were taking an online class, and i decided that i want to laugh, so i unmuted my mic and put porn and everyone laughed ( we use microsoft teams) so then my teacher, who is a female, started saying whoever put that sound, in meaning, has shitty parents. So after the lesson she filed a complaint to the school and the school took a look back on the recording of the lesson and found out that me and 3 other people had unmuted mics during which the sound had appeared. So the the school blamed it on me purely based on assumption even though it was me, so they told my parents and I denied everything, so now my parents believe me and stood up for me because they want to give me a formal warning. Should I continue with the lie because they assumed it was me and defend myself or should i tell the truth. If I tell the truth I would have put my parents in a very shameful position and lose their trust, but if I continue I might get out of this mess. Also they said they will do a thorough investigation about who did it, but can they actually know who did it, like can they contact microsoft?",08May2020,1
39,"Hi, I have this problem that is causing problems in my relationship with my SO. The problem is that I can't forgive my mistakes. I hang on to every detail. Today I got angry for the wrong reason ( a thing that happens daily, still working on that.) I hate myself everyday and regularly want to die bc of how i misplace my anger and how I am driving others away bc of it. I wallow on my mistakes and the effects they have on others.

Anyway, the problem we will solve today will be this, How can I stop beating myself up over things? How do I stop myself from going down a dark hole of self loathing?",08May2020,1
40,"So this one will be a bit of a read but I'm at a dead end and I really don't know what to do next.

To preface this; I am a 27 year old living in Las Vegas, Nevada USA.

About a year ago, I was working at a call center for a major bank. I was miserable and literally got to a point where I was contemplating suicide. My doctor at that point told me to take a leave of absence and got everything in order for me to do so. He told that during that time, I need to take the month to find a new job because even with a month off, I would just be going right back to the environment that was causing my mental health decline.

So I took the month of Leave paid. During that time, I did find a new job that started a couple days after my leave ended, so when I went back to work at the call center, I actually quit right then and there. No two weeks notice. I went on to work at the company I was hired at. This company was a small, family owned business that hired me as an outsider, and it was the first time they had ever done so. I excelled at this small business, making great sales and client relations, but things rolled in to motion to where my position was no longer needed. They ended up letting me go with a severance and told me that the only reason was because of business needs. I %10,000 understood this and held no ill will toward this company, as there is no reason to.

I attempted at that point to file for unemployment. At this point, they denied my claim because I A.) Was not working at the small business for more than 16 weeks and B.) I left my previous employer for new employment.

Thankfully, the severance pay from the small business kept me afloat until I found another job. I worked this job up until 4/15/2020, when COVID-19 struck. The job I was working at was forced to furlough all part-time employees which is where I fell. 

I then attempted to re-activate my UI claim with this new information. I have been filing my weekly claims, but have not seen a single dime of money. 

Today, I finally found buried in the website a statement from my last week's attempt at filing the weekly claim stating that I would not be paid out because of my previous issue with the bank; wherein I left the bank for new employment.

Calling Unemployment is a royal dead end. I have tried for a week straight, waking up at 7:30am and calling nonstop to only receive a busy signal. I would call from 8am to 10am, every day. I have never once gotten through to a human being. I always am met with a busy signal.

I am at my last rope. I have maybe $150 to my name. My credit is terrible so I cannot get approved for any credit cards. My wife is still working but her paychecks are thin and extremely hard to live off of and we are at the point where we have no idea what to do next. Calling UI is leading to nothing but wasted time and effort.

I am not sure what to do now. I have tried everything I can think of. I have applied for around 400 jobs in the last few weeks with no call backs, which doesn't surprise me too much.

I am stressed, depressed, anxious, and quite frankly frustrated beyond belief. I need something, anything ,to get a hand up in this situation, but I cannot find it.",08May2020,1
41,"I (Female) have been in love with my (Male) friend (B) for the past five years and I can’t bring myself to tell him. I’m gonna give a long back story before actually getting to the part I need advice on. 

Five years ago, he was my younger brother’s best friend and we were close considering our 3 year age difference, because he had a pretty shitty home life and was always around our house. My brother got a girlfriend, and B and I started getting super close as my brother was always with her and B was always at our house. We would watch AHS and horror movies together sharing a duvet, we would get stoned and drunk together, we just spent all our time together. We had some flirty banter and honestly, I was started to fall for him. 

I really trusted him, which is difficult for me because I have severe trust issues that come with having a verbally abusive and manipulative alcoholic mother. He had been through some serious shit growing up, with an actively suicidal and severely mentally ill brother. B wasn’t dealing with it all very well. He was doing hard drugs like coke and I think he was dealing too. He was a part of the local gang, who used to go around beating up other gangs and randos in the street. Despite all this, he was a genuinely nice person who cared for my family and felt safe with us. He just got involved in the wrong crowd and was finding it difficult to leave it behind.  

[TW: rape] This doesn’t involved B, but it is pretty important for context. In the summer five years ago, I went out for a friend’s birthday and ended up getting really drunk and hooking up with this friend’s coworker. It started off consensually, but then the guy started trying to force me to do anal and I really didn’t want to, and I was trying to push him off and was saying that I didn’t want this and I wanted to go home. He didn’t. This was my first time having sex with a male. [END]

Two weeks after this happened, my brother, B, their friend W, and I were hanging out and getting drunk at mine. I went off to my bedroom to sleep and the other three stayed downstairs, where they’d be sleeping. Before I fell asleep, I got a text from B asking if he could come up to my bedroom. I asked why and he said he wanted to fuck me. I said no. He then said that either I let him up or he was going to bring W up with him. I think we can all read between the lines there on what that meant. So I said B could come up. He immediately starts kissing me and we get naked. I sucked him off and he licked me out. Tbh this is what I’ve wanted for a while at this point. Then he asks to fuck me. Keep in mind what had happened two weeks prior - I hadn’t even processed it as rape yet - and what B had said to me before coming up. I was just flooded with anxiety and I said no. He listens and he leaves. I calm down from the anxiety and I realise I’ve just said no to something that I actually wanted. So I message him saying to come back upstairs, and he says, “this was a mistake, I’m your brother’s best friend”. 

After that night, he stops coming round as much and when he does, it’s pure awkwardness. By the end of the summer, I go to university and tbh, we barely talk for 2 years. During the summer after my second year at university, I come back and I’m in a terrible state mentally because I’ve just had a potentially friendship-ruining falling out with my two best friends at university. B starts coming around a lot over the summer and things seem to be friendly again between us. One day, I pull him aside and apologise for what happened between us two years ago and he says something along the lines of, “oh don’t worry, I’d forgotten about that”. The rest of the summer is shit for me (because of the university friends argument continuing over social media), but B is there for me constantly, listening to me rant and get upset. He honestly became my rock and at this point, I’d fallen in love again. By the end of the summer, I’m gutted I have to go back to university, even with the argument with my friends resolved. 

We casually chat every once in a while whilst I’m at university, and he frequently asks when I’m coming back home so he can come and see me. I graduate from university and move back home, and we spend a lot of time together again. I start pining over him almost obsessively. My family had moved house at this point, so we were 30 minutes away from each other, but I drove to pick him up and we’d have fun car journeys together several times a week. We’d spend our time getting stoned and watching movies. After I graduate in the November, I get a job and he’s passed his driving test and is working too, so we don’t really see each other much except on Fridays, when he’d drive up to see us. I just really enjoy his company. 

Since I’ve graduated, we’ve got closer again and he’ll come round and we’ll get drunk and watch Netflix shows. He’s changed massively as a person. He’s stopped the hard drugs, he has a small friendship group of pals (including my brother and I), he’s completely left the gangs behind him. But he’s still majorly repressed as a person. He doesn’t show emotion, unless it’s anger. He won’t talk about his problems. He’s an almost compulsive liar. He’s flakey. I know I’ve painted B in a relatively good light throughout this, but he honestly is a bit of a let down. It was a lot worse 5 years ago; he was manipulative and quick to anger. He was very selfish and would take a lot without giving anything in return. 3 years ago, he was a dickhead. I shaved my head and he told my brother I look like a dyke. A year ago, he told me I was way too sensitive (major trigger point for me, as I spent 7 years in complete silence about my depression and anxiety because I didn’t feel like I could express my emotions and I nearly ended up topping myself). 

But I do believe he’s becoming a better person. He had a breakdown about 9 months ago and started confiding in me about his emotions and how overwhelming they were for him. Just before the lockdown, he called me up sobbing because he’d gone to the train station and was going to ‘see what happened’. I drove down to pick him up and he just collapsed in my arms and said that he was scared and he didn’t know what to do. He didn’t acknowledge it for a week or so, but then he thanked me for being such a good friend to him. 

I’ve been going to therapy for a few months now. I’m quite an open and intuitive person. I want to be a counsellor, so I’m quite clued up. But I’ve been racking my brains almost every week at therapy looking for the reason why I’m in love with this fool still. He’s not the best of people. He hasn’t treated me with 100% respect over the past 5 years. He’s actually been a pretty big let down and a pretty shitty friend for the most part. But sometimes he acts like he might fancy me. Like I’ll feel him just looking at me if I’m talking in a group of people, or he’ll make a comment that I’m his favourite or that he’s lucky to have me in his life. He once said he wouldn’t date me because he doesn’t want to risk our friendship. I don’t know how to describe the feelings I have for him. It’s like I can rationally acknowledge that he’s not the best for me, yet I feel drawn to him constantly. I keep coming back to him every fucking time. I don’t know if it’s because of the fact we never actually slept with each other (I can’t cope with the incomplete), if it’s because I have some fucked up attachment style (thanks mother), or if he’s just my ‘safe choice’. I’ve never been in a relationship. I’ve not really got much desire to be in one. But I know that if he confessed feelings for me, I’d be in a relationship with him so quick. I can’t figure it out and it’s driving me nuts. 

I know the only way for me to move forward is to just tell B everything. To just confess that I’ve been pining after him for 5 years. To ask him if he ever liked me romantically then and if he likes me romantically at all now. Just get my answers and move on. But I just can’t bring myself to do it. He’s renowned for walking away when he’s scared and I’m renowned for not being able to cope with an emotional rejection as it triggers my abandonment issues. I don’t want to lose him as a friend but not telling him is driving me insane. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to broach the subject with him. I’ve written down everything I feel in letters to him (I still find it hard to verbalise emotions), but I feel like giving them to him is a cowards way out. Over the past couple of years, he has become one of my best friends. After everything, I still trust him. But I just can’t take the risk on this. It’s not so much that I have a lot to lose, it’s more I have a lot of emotional scars I could be opening if he rejects me that I don’t know if I’m ready to deal with yet. 

Does anyone have any insight? Any ideas? I’ll take anything at this point. I just need to tell him how I’ve felt and how I’m feeling, so I can move on. I just wanna be my full authentic self.

Thanks.",08May2020,1

I was super nervous to answer this question because I can tell he’s so much more experienced than me. I truly felt Embarrassed, not only because I’m w virgin but because I’m older than him. I was tempted to lie, but since I really like this guy I was honest and told him. Ever since I told him, I honestly feel a change, he is dry, replies after 30 minutes and even leaves me on read. This is honestly not like him because when we first started texting he would answer within a few minutes and was super sweet. I think I might’ve weirded him out.",08May2020,1
46,"I'm not sure how to start this as I've never posted to r/legal advice before, but here goes! 
 My elderly aunt lives in/owns a house (she has paid it off)that her two also aging siblings live with her. They have  no contracts or renters agreements and to my knowledge do not pay rent or contribute much beyond buying groceries and some light housework (barely). My aunt has rapidly advancing Parkinson's and is mostly housebound due to the pandemic and that she has trouble walking even with a walker. One sibling, sibling A, has lived there for over a decade and he is kind of a mess, perhaps an alcoholic or has some anger management issues. He has a job. The other sibling, sibling B,  moved up here a couple  years ago and never found employment, she is very stubborn. 

Sibling B helps out a bit with my aunt's home care needs but isn't very nice to her and often thinks that my aunt should just be able to do it herself. Sibling A only does things when asked and only if he is in a ""good"" mood. 

My elderly mother goes over to this house daily to help my aunt shower and get dressed and make sure her needs are met.
 
Sibling B refuses to wear a mask and doesn't believe in the coronavirus. I don't even know if she practices social distancing or hand washing  when she goes out. She is putting the health of my aunt and my mom at great risk. No amount of begging, asking will change her mind. 

Sibling A got angry at my mother last week when she asked him to help with something. He physically pushed her! She was scared. My aunt and sibling B avoid him when he is in a ""mood"" I guess. 

Basically my mother feels that she can no longer go over there and help my aunt out with these new developments. My aunt doesn't really want these siblings to live there anymore but she is scared and sad and not sure what to do. She doesn't have a lot of money beyond social security. Also my aunt needs help with every day care! My mom feels awful.

I should also add that my mom has helped out her siblings SO much over the years, since they don't have insurance or much income or any other family. Dental care, hospital stays, clothes, glasses. She even helped clean their house! I wish she wouldn't but she's the oldest and worries about them.

How can I help my mom and my aunt? How can I get these siblings to not be so awful? Do I talk to them calmly? Will that make it worse?  I know a lot of the problems stem from emotional immaturity and deep conflicts that siblings can develop, and there is only so much I can do.

 This might not even be the right subreddit, I'm just so frustrated and feel helpless and directionless. These siblings would probably be homeless without my aunt's house, which no one wants but they are both so terrible to live with. Edit: location Washington State.",08May2020,1

48,"So I’m currently 28 years old and I have been wanting to move to a city for a very long time. I’m currently in a small town with not a lot going on. The beaches are nice but nothing ever happens here. 

All of my best friends have moved away. I don’t have anyone left here that likes the same stuff that I do. I like arty type stuff but there’s no one here that likes the same stuff as this so it’s hard for me to make lasting friends. I also want to get into Graphic Design, and would love to work in a studio of some sort. But I need to be in a city to increase my opportunity for employment.

I’ve been telling my wife for the last two years that I wanna move away and move to a city, and she openly says she wants to, but I’ve noticed she comes in and out of being on board with the idea. 

When our lease ran out two years ago, she told me she didn’t want to move far away as she wasn’t sold on the idea of moving until I had a secure job.

When our lease ran out last year, we were about to get married so I was happy not to push it as hard. But we ended up moving to another suburb in our area, which infuriated me because if we could do that why couldn’t we move to the city. I didn’t want to start our marriage out in a weird spot so like I said I didn’t push it as hard.

This year, she’s saying we might not have enough money due to coronavirus. I know I can get enough money - but my suspicion is that she doesn’t want to move away from her friend that’s here. They’re very close which is nice - but I was just as close with my friends and now they’ve moved to Europe.

The thing that makes me frustrated the most - is that this city is 40 mins from where we live. I’m not asking to move to a different country or even a different state - it’s only 40 mins away.

I’m going stir crazy. I want to move because I feel like I’m not getting anywhere in this town. But I don’t want to lose her because I love her very much, and don’t want to come across as selfish.",08May2020,1
49,"OK, here's what happened.
I live in Texas. Iv rented a few apartments in the past with no problem. No huge issues anyway.
My boyfriend and I applied to an apartment complex, got approved and we were waiting on the lease.
The person who was working with us on this at the time of scouting for the apartments said ""oh yes! I do actually have an apartment that you'd love and it's in your budget"" sweet right? We saw the unit In person, hardwood floors, washer dryer hookups and it's a first floor unit of 750 square feet and the rent is $881.
Awesome dude. So fast forward, we apply to the apartment, get approved with all your regular fees, admin etc.
We paid for the application and what not and they said yes that unit is locked in for you for that price.
A couple days pass. No lease.
We call and call and call then finally after a week we get the lease. There was a few discrepancies with the lease so I called the office to ask about it.
She said we'll, those residents are actually thinking about staying in the unit. I panicked honestly. Our move out date is June 10th.
She said even tho they could still stay, our move out date is still June 10th, to go ahead and put in the notice for these apartments we are in, and to pay the admin and all those fees. The apartment we get just may be a second floor or something.
My questions are, how can she guarantee a unit for that move out date. Should I pay those fees without a having signed a lease there yet? And is this even right? This has never happened to me before but also they're reason for staying is because of the pandemic.
So I understand that. But how do I know they won't do this again with a different apartment?
I'm so confused. We still haven't given notice to our apartments because we don't know what to do. My dad's advice was to just say screw and go find a different apartment complex. Help",08May2020,1

This is going to make me sound like a huge douchebag, i probably am. She asked me if i had done my homework three times throughout today, i have done homework but since she had asked twice earlier in the day i accidentally got a bit snappy with her and she yelled at me. I dont know whats wrong with me, but im so fucking sad most days. Im either angry or sad, or hiding the fact that im sad, and i dont know why. Most of the time i want to kill myself, or start cutting again. I cant do either because i dont have the means, and my parents would notice if i started self harming again. I have no fucking right to feel like this. I live in a middle class neighborhood with virtually no crime, i have a few friends, my parents are great and they're still together, nothing is wrong in my life. Im just sad, sometimes ill be ok for a few days but then it just goes back to everything being boring and me being sad. Most days i have crying fits and i just cry and lay on the floor for hours. Im such a bitch. Anytime anyone does something that even slightly bothers me when im on one of my sad periods i just cant handle it and i go from 50 to 100. I have to leave wherever i am and go somewhere else so i can cry. I dont know why im like this. My mom yelled at me and i couldnt hold back tears so i excused myself and went upstairs to try and do some work, but i couldnt since i couldnt stop crying so i just sat there. I think about killing myself all the time, so i was crying and listening to music because i really fucking hate listening to myself cry, and my mom came upstairs to check on me. I didnt want to make her upset, or talk because if i would have talked i would have started crying, so she asked me what was wrong and why i was upset, i cant answer that since i dont know myself, so i just mumbled an ""i dont know"" or some rude shit like that and as she was leaving she started talking about how everytime she talks to me i seem upset and she doesnt know why then she made a comment about our relationship falling apart. This really isnt a big deal, but i feel like shit. I want to kill myself, but i cant. I feel like for the first time in my life im actually ready to go through with it and plan it out and shit, i just dont know how. Im sure as hell not telling her im suicidal, she already knows anyways, but i hate that she thinks it her fault im like this. Im such a bitch. I cant fucking stand how moody i am.

54,"So at my work we having two places we can park. Outside of a gated yard (the gate is left open during the day for clients to park) and some open reserved parking outside of the fence. I like to park outside of the yard since I can leave my work faster and I don’t have to get stuck closing the gate after everyone. I like to back my car when I park so the front of my car is facing the road. Well today a guy approached my car. 

He approached my car twice. The first time he was trying to ask why we were all just sitting in our cars waiting. (There is a support group of some sort across the street from my work). When he saw the logo on my shirt he said “oh nevermind” and walked away. After about 5 minutes he came back and started asking me for my name so he can add me on Facebook. I’m a 20F and I hate confrontation so I said yes. Obviously I didn’t give him my real name and the guy actually looked up the name I gave him. When he wasn’t finding “my profile” I told him that I haven’t used Facebook in such a long time and my account must be gone. He said he would keep looking and add me when he got the chance. Then he left. 

After a few minutes of me trying to calm down I figured I should move my car into the yard. I slowly pulled forward to look around and the guy was in front of my work. He was still looking on his phone so I backed up into my spot and waited. I was so freaked out cause I didn’t think he would hang around. I called one of my coworkers and asked if they would walk into the building with me and luckily they were able to. The guy watched us walk in together. 

When we got inside we immediately told our supervisors and manager what had happened. One of them even said that they noticed him trying to get their attention as well but they were able to ignore him. We were able to call the police or anything since he technically didn’t do anything wrong. When one of our other coworkers overheard our conversation and the name I gave the guy they said, “Oh, so you were who he was calling about. Yeah a guy called and asked if we could give his name and number to you since he wanted to be persistent. We told him that no one by that name worked here and we hung up.” After that we went and made sure that every door was locked and I wasn’t allowed outside unless I went with someone or if I told someone first. When my shift ended someone walked outside with me as well. We haven’t seen or heard anything from this guy yet. 

This was a few hours ago and I’m still freaking out. This guy knows where I work and what I drive. I love my job way too much to quit and I don’t have enough money to buy a new car. I’m going to start parking inside the yard now and I’m going to start carrying a weapon with me. I’m also going to try to start taking my dog with me whenever I can since I work in a place where that would be okay. What do I do now though? What if he comes back tomorrow looking for me? I’ve had similar things happen before but this guy just gave me a really bad vibe. I’ve been telling everyone I know about this experience that way they all have an idea if something does happen. I’m really freaked out about this. 

Does anyone have any advice or has anyone else had a similar experience? What should I do now?",08May2020,1
55,"i dropped out of poly last year and started working full time at a retail store. i never meant to work for so long and wanted to go back to school this year after working and giving myself a break. but i really like working and honestly, i don’t think i can go back to the school life. my only concern is that if being just an o level graduate will affect my promotion? will i still be able to be promoted if i work hard enough? i don’t have to become really successful or lavishly rich or anything, i just want to have a job that can support my family and i in the future. 
really just need some insight and opinion on my situation right now and i wanted to see if there is any different route, other than education, that i can walk in for my future :)

56,"In my county we have leash laws, and several neighbors let their dogs run loose. 

I've talked with the neighbors, (they've all told us to shoot them if they get in our yard. Some claim that they just feed them and house them ""they're not their dogs"") 

I called animal control probably 30 times now because of them killing my chickens, which are legal in my county (they legally don't even have to be in the coop but they are). They won't do anything, but tell me to buy a gun and shoot them. I don't want to kill the dogs, but I've had them kill 15 hens out of 20. And I don't know what I should do.

I wish I could just take the dogs as my own, obviously they don't care about their dogs with them telling me to kill them",08May2020,1

58,"My partner and I have been dating for a little over a year now and we’ve had very open conversations about my past struggle with anorexia. He encouraged me to go to a therapist to get help and I am in the recovery stages. 

Now about 2 weeks ago he mentioned how he didn’t think he got enough to eat and the next day he liked how skinny he looked. He’s continuing this cycle of eating less and less and since he’s already pretty skinny, I’m worried he’s going to have to be admitted into the hospital. 

I reminded him about my experience and that he could end up in the hospital because of this. He doesn’t seem bothered and tells me he doesn’t need help and has everything under control. 

Today we were on a FaceTime call because we can’t see each other in person and he got up to go get something and the amount of weight he lost was very noticeable. I tried to ask him about it in a way that wouldn’t make him upset and he quickly ended the call and said he had to go. I understood and I thought nothing of it. A few hours later I asked him about it again over text and he dodged my question and changed the subject. 

This has put stress on our relationship as well. We get into more arguments because he isn’t in the greatest mood from not eating. I know I can’t make decisions for him or force him to eat but I’m genuinely clueless as to what to do or how to help. 

I’ve asked him how I can help so I know what he needs without assuming anything but he says there’s nothing I can do to help and there’s nothing that he needs. 

What do I do?",08May2020,1
59,"So my roommate is disregarding any precaution regarding COVID and thinks it's not a big deal. I've been out of the apartment with my at risk girlfriend for two months at her parent's house and we are set to go back to work on the 15th. I will be extending my LOA but my girlfriend wants to go back and just take necessary precautions at work. 


My issue is our roommate is not taking it seriously. They are having people over and going out to eat almost everyday. Also her brother is living there now unemployed while we aren't there. Before this month I had paid reduced rent because I make half of what my girlfriend and our roommate makes. She demanded I paid a third despite not being there for two months. I don't think it is fair her brother is there doing nothing and contributing nothing. 


I went by the apartment yesterday and our cat's litter box was really bad and I learned they hadn't cleaned it for two months because it isn't there responsibility in their mind. 


I really don't want to go back to the apartment. I can be on leave for however long and I am not the lease so I have no legal obligation to do anything. I can't even bring myself to talk to the roommate. I have anxiety issues and she is extremely immature and loses it if she doesn't get her way. 


I don't know what to do. I don't want my girlfriend in danger nor do I want to be in that environment every day. I have the option to go live with my parents without her but I don't want to be away from her. 


My ideal situation would be for the roommate to get another roommate and we can just be on our own. I hate living there and I have lost all respect for them.


My stress level is at a 10 and really can't handle anymore. There doesn't seem to be any good solution without losing my mind.

When people ask me if I want to do something, I tend to just be like ""I dunno"" even when I clearly know I want to go somewhere. If someone offers me a strawberry I have trouble just saying ""yes"" even if I definitely want it. I don't know what's wrong with me, it's like it's a button.

62,"So, in july of 2016, when I was 22, I was depressed, and thought it would he a good idea to get a dog. I adopted a 5 month old pitbull. I had. I idea what I was getting myself into, and knew nothing about dog ownership. I grew up accepting that essentially beating dogs was okay. I wouldnt say I ever straight up beat her, but one time, when I was trying to sleep, some if my Brothers friends came over. She kept moving around, and whinning, I assume because she wanted to go say hi. After a couple minutes I lost my temper, and hit her with a hammer fist on the neck. Not as hard as I could but enough to let her know I was pissed off. She yelped, so I knew I fucked up. I started pacing around the house considering suicide. I came to the conclusion that I lost my temper, and made a mistake, and it wont ever happen again, and it didnt. I gave her some slaps here, and there on the butt, when she wouldnt calm down though. Also, when I first adopted her, I would keep her in the garage. I blocked her off from the rest of the garage, so she wouldn't chew on things, so she was convinced to a 15×7' space for hours a day. That was only on rainy days. I would keep her out in the fenced yard on nice days. Eventually my brother, and I bought s mobile home. By this time, she was 2, she still wasnt house trained, and she still chewed on things. It pissed my brother off that we couldnt leave her inside, without her shitting in the living room, or chewing up the cushions, so I kept her outside, when i went to work. It was a pretty big area. I wouldnt keep her outside if it were under 40 degrees. She did have an insulated dog house stuffed with straw, that I placed in a large shop, we had outback. I don't know if most people would find bat cruel ot not. Also, I never really worked on her recalls so she was always running in the streets and through the neighborhood. Eventually my brother considered a shock collar. I thought that sounded reasonable. So I got the shock collar. Took her out on a led line, and shocked the hell out of her when she began to run torwards the street. I dont think it hurt her, because it was only on 10, and I tried it on myself before hand, and it didnt hurt. I still had no idea what I was doing, and I could see how I was being cruel, so I stopped using the collar. I forgot to mention, before that, I took her to thr river with my brother, to work on her recall. I brought my lead lined, and when she wouldnt come, my brither told me to slap her. He had a well behaved dog, so i listened to him. I slapped her pretty hard, but they didnt even seem to be phasing her. Sometimes when I took her on walks. She would pull in the leash, so I would get mad, and yank her pretty hard, sormtiens to the point where her feet would leave the ground. I knew that eas wrong at the time. I was just too mad to care. just wish I would have pulled my head out of my ass, and started using positive reinforcement training earlier. About 6 months before she passed away, I started taking her out on a led line, and when she came when called, I would give her a treat. After only a few sessions of that, her recall was perfect. Also, worh the chewing, when I caught her chewing on something inappropriate, I would replace it with one of her toys, and she learned quickly. She passed away from mast cell cancer shortly after. I made sure she knew I loved her. I took her to the park everyday, gave her lost of cuddles, and at that point I hadn't so much as slapped her for a year. I'm pretty sure I know the answer to this, but just asking.",08May2020,1

65,"I'm doing this on a rubbish account because there's a lot of personal info needed for context.

I live in Australia, and the benefits system is Centrelink. I submitted a claim for youth allowance independent (a payment for full-time students, and independent means it is not docked based on your parents' income) on the 5th of Mar and here I am, 8th May.

I lost my job due to COVID-19 and was not entitled to job seeker payments (employed casually for less than 12 months), so I tried to get youth allowance. When I first applied I was still living at home (with parents). Because I couldn't pay rent though, I was kicked out mid-April. By mid-April I now owed my parents $1050 in unpaid rent, which I will need to pay them before I can move back home. 

Centrelink made me follow up in the end, after repeatedly telling me to NOT follow up because they would tell me when they need something. When I followed up, turns out they wanted a form. If I'd known to submit this a month ago I might not owe my parents so much. Once I submitted the ""unreasonable to live at home"" forms I was rejected, and given youth allowance dependent, which is $65 a week (around USD40). This alone is not enough to pay rent, but in addition to the coronavirus payment, it is. Obvious problem is, I don't get the COVID payment when COVID is over. I absolutely cannot live on $60 a week, and even with COVID payments, it's going to take me about a month to save up enough to pay off the rent debt I owe my parents. I'm not sure how long my friends' charity will last. I am currently couch surfing and eating other people's food, and using other people's utilities. These people are losing their jobs too.

Even though it was rejected the first time, I pushed again. The first time, I was told that there needs to be ""extreme family breakdown"" and ""parents have a social expectation by the government to support their kids until they are 25"". So parental refusal to live at home was not enough. I spoke to my counsellor about this, and she was of the opinion that there was extreme family breakdown. She wrote a letter detailing it which I agreed with, I guess it's just difficult to air something you're still going through therapy for to a complete stranger that you do not trust. I thought that the issues being explained and coming from a professional would be enough, but it wasn't. I had a reply to my claim within hours, it was as if they didn't even bother looking. At this stage, I was wondering whether the lady handling my claim just had it out for me. Apparently the breakdown has to have lasted a year, and even though it has, I've only been seeing my therapist since February so it ""doesn't count"".

I'm honestly at a loss at this point. Am I being entitled? I know there are people out there much, much worse off, but I still think I'm entitled to the independent rate or even the dependent rate that isn't docked by my parents' income.

TL;DR Welfare office will not give me payments because I am not experiencing extreme family breakdown. I will be struggling to live on $60 a week, but during COVID payments, I will technically be fine (once I've saved up enough to pay missed rent). My counsellor is of the opinion that there is family breakdown and it would be very detrimental for me to move back home even if I can pay. Have only seen her for 3 months so welfare office is not counting her opinion.",08May2020,1

67,"Even before the stay at home orders I found started distancing myself from the people around me.  First recoiling from social media, then avoiding interactions with people outside of my circle.  For me, it seems that no matter what subject I bring up or how benign the banter, it's a matter of a few exchanges before the conversation becomes politicized and then it's a tight rope walk to avoid conflict.  

**Example:** A friend passed away last weekend (not COVID related).   I mentioned it to a neighbor who had met him a few times.  It wasn't 2 minutes before it turned into, ""Yeah and I bet the hospitals are claiming it's COVID to get more money because this whole thing is just a corporate cash grab.""  Which then launched into a political rant about corona-virus.  

**Example:**  I posted a picture on social media of my kids and I en route to the pharmacy with bandannas for masks.  No caption, just a picture of us in the current state or the world.  Within a matter of minutes I had two ""infringing on our freedom"" related comments and I think there's still a heated conspiracy debate going on which has nothing to do with my kids or me.  

**Example:** I called a buddy in town to ask about helping me do some work on my car.   He told me that he couldn't because he was busy cleaning his guns and organizing his ammo because ""shit's getting nuts around here"".  It's not.  Not even slightly.  But then I was berated because I'm not prepared with my arsenal of assault rifles to protect my family against the ""threat"".

It's not that I don't have opinions or that I don't care about others opinions.  I just miss having adult conversations for more than a minute or two without having to jerk the metaphorical wheel to avoid the ""Fuck Trump"" rant or the ""Stupid Liberals"" diatribe.  Long term friends have either disappeared or been cut off because they chose their opinions over civility and friendship.  I miss adult social interaction, but not enough to expose myself to all of the negativity.

70,"I've wanted to be a writer since I was a little boy. Growing up, I was always writing, reading, planning--anything to help me achieve my dream. I studied writing at school and practiced. I did not do well: usually B's to B+'s in my classes. At my school you had to apply to get into the advanced writing courses, but I wasn't considered good enough to get in. After school, I have continued writing and doing by best to get published. I have had no success.

I'm thirty-five now, and I have yet to get anything published. I haven't had any sort of interest. I share my stories with friends, and the responses usually range from ""polite"" to ""this is okay,"" but sometimes hating it, sometimes sorta liking it, and never complete enthusiasm.

Because I've never been able to get any sort of traction--or even a grade in school or general statement that I have what it takes--I have become pretty depressed about writing. It's not fun for me anymore. However, not writing is also painful. When I'm not writing, I feel bad that I'm not being productive, and when I am writing, it's painful because I think I'm not good enough.

So, my conundrum is, should I keep writing? I have a job that pays the bills; my writing doesn't interfere with that all. It's just that we live in a society that constantly repeats that we should ""go for our dreams,"" but some people don't make it, and never will.  

How can I know if I'm good enough to keep trying? When is it time to say ""this has been your dream for thirty years, but you're just not good enough?""",08May2020,1
71,"It’s hard, and it’s getting to me. My girlfriend in my eyes is literally the only person that I always have positive thoughts about. She’s my best friend and I love her.

I just find myself constantly having negative thoughts all the time, just always thinking a lot about how I’ve been brought up or how I’ve been treated both in my personal and professional life, and I want to escape these bad thoughts.

On a personal level, I heavily resent my parents (especially my dad). I still live at home but I’m in the process of moving out within the next year. But the older I get, the more I feel that they didn’t do a great job of bringing me and my brothers up at all. My dad just doesn’t seem to give a shit about his sons, and only cares about his old eldest stepson (my half brother) and his family. I feel like I hate him. I even once told my mum that I’ve had suicidal thoughts, and she totally ignored me.

I also keep having negative thoughts constantly about my old job. Yes, you heard it, my OLD job. I actually loved my old job, I loved the customer interaction and I was pretty good at it, but i hated my boss (nice lady, but very lazy), and I felt as though I had a glass ceiling directly above my head, and others who came in after me got opportunities that I’d been asking for, and felt like I earned those opportunities. I just felt like I couldn’t talk to my old boss, she was very bitchy and I just hated the relationship. I get it, that’s life, but for some reason it still affects me. I actually juggle with the idea of contacting her superior about how I feel, and how many of the customers used to feel. My supervisor also wasn’t a particularly nice person. 

I’m not sure if it’s normal, but I honestly can’t help but constantly feel awful about my old job and my former colleagues, even though my new job is amazing, better pay and it’s in the industry that I want to work in.

I just want to escape this negative cloud I constantly feel. Honestly, it’s been affecting me for about 3 years now, and I don’t know what to do. I’m not even sure if it’s just me needing to “wake up and realise that this is what life is”, or if there’s more to it. I’d appreciate any help.

TLDR; I resent a lot of people in my life, particularly people that were in my past. I want to try and move past that.",08May2020,1

CW: sexual assault. This is going to be very long, my apologies. 

This event happened three years ago, but it has lived with me almost every day since. I apologize for even posting this, but I have to gain some perspective from others. I have been going to therapy for quite some time now, but things are getting really tough. I am starting to not feel safe with myself, and will be discussing with my therapist tomorrow. 
I had been talking to this guy on Tinder for a few months, we will call him X. One night, X said he had an allergic reaction to a wine he drank at an event. I asked if he was alright, and asked him if he wanted to bring him food or Benadryl to help with the reaction. He said that if I wanted to I could, so I did. When I got there, we talked for a while about random stuff. This was the first time we ever hung out. We were sitting on his bed (me on the opposite side), and I remember him telling me that I could come over to his side. We both were laying down at this point, listening to music. I don’t remember who initiated it, but we eventually started making out. That led to me giving him head. He told me to “stop sucking him off and do something else” so he wouldn’t cum, which I did. Everything happened very fast, and I do not think I ever received verbal consent from him. After the fact, we sort of dozed off. After we woke up, I ended up going back to my place for the night, because he said he had to be up early that day. After about a day of not talking and receiving short responses, I asked him if something was wrong. He said that he was drunk when we fooled around, which I didn’t know. As I said, I knew he had a glass of wine, but I didn’t think that he was drunk as he showed no signs of intoxication when we were talking for an hour before anything happened. I apologized profusely, and offered to contact the authorities with him. He told me that I was overreacting, and that he thought it was simply our time together coming to an end. We have not spoken since. 
To this day, I am struggling with my actions and am concerned not only for my own well-being, but his. As I said, I have not spoken to him in three years but I feel as if I should message him once again, to apologize. I am beginning to feel suicidal as a result of this, and I am conflicted as I feel like I partially deserve this. I would never intentionally harm someone, but I feel as if in this situation my intent does not matter. He never outwardly said the words “assault,” but if he claims he was drunk he could not consent (and like I said, I’m not sure if verbal consent was ever given in the first place. I am sure I relied on cues). Do you think I should message him? Does anyone have any advice on how to move forward? Should I report myself?",08May2020,1
73,"My brother and I’s relationship has been rough. I was paralyzed fairly recently and I’m going through rehab, he’s an active guy who likes sports and is a bit of a gym rat.

I don’t want to stop talking to him because he’s the only person I really get to talk to aside from nurses and other staff at rehab, but honestly it’s really upsetting to me. I’ll never work out again and here he is talking about how he’s so frustrated that he can only do 30 push-ups in a minute when his friend can do 35.

74,"I just recently got my first job in over a year (was out of commission due to injury and was in school). I’m trying to work full time this summer to afford housing next semester—so I definitely need a job.

Here’s the thing. My injury makes it harder to work and I have gone home extremely sore for the last 3 days (this often carries over to the next day and slows me further). Honestly I’m also struggling to stay motivated, maybe that’s just part of starting over, I don’t know.

Personally, I had hoped for something more like an office job—or something more sedentary. I don’t have anything lined up, and I know my parents are disappointed in me for even thinking about finding something else after taking this position. Frankly I’m disappointed in myself for feeing like calling it quits already.

There was no interview process, and I’m only a temporary employee because of the pandemic—I said I was still interested when they called and then I was hired on the spot.

How should I decide what to do? I struggle to adjust to new work environments, so I wanted to give it at least a week or two to see if it was a good fit. I’m worried I won’t be able to find anything else, or that the kind of slower paced job I’m looking for won’t be hiring at entry level.

75,"I've been with her about eight months and our relationship is generally pretty great. I love her a lot and we respect each other but there's just one thing that's starting to get on my nerves. It sounds stupid but allow me to explain. When I met my girlfriend I was upfront about the fact that I smoke weed and occasionally do psychedelics recreationally. To me, these things kind of help me figure out my life and see things from a different perspective. I've never had a panic attack or freaked out from doing drugs and I don't do anything that I consider ""hard drugs"". The only drugs I've ever done are weed and occasionally acid and LSA, a plant-derived psychedelic. When we first got together my girlfriend had a sort of ""not my business"" attitude about my habits, and I smoked weed pretty much all the time and was going through a phase of doing acid like once a week. She did make it clear to me that she doesn't approve of these things and wasn't keen on doing them herself. Eventually 420 came around and she tried weed, freaked out and had a panic attack and since then she doesn't want me doing ANYTHING anymore. She's witnessed me do these things and has never seen me freak out and I always go back to normal afterwards. Since we got together I started cutting down ALOT on weed, going from doing it every day to less than once a week, and since the 420 incident I haven't done it at all because she gets super anxious about me doing drugs and every time we talk about it she cries. It's been a number of months since I did acid or any other drugs. I'm not addicted to any of this shit and am perfectly okay with not doing it, but I'm also perfectly okay WITH doing it (if she ever decided not to be against it anymore, until then I have not and don't plan on doing anything behind her back that she's not okay with). Now here's the thing. I grew up around hippies and alternative lifestylers and I don't see anything wrong with taking a break from reality every now and then. Life is stressful and to me, these things are just like drinking (except I prefer not to drink because I struggled with alcoholism throughout my adolescence and it is generally not an enjoyable experience for me). However my girlfriend is perfectly ok with me drinking alcohol, but absolutely opposed to me doing anything that gets me ""high"". All of my friends smoke weed and she's worried about me hanging out with them now because she thinks I'll be tempted. It does feel kind of stupid to be with my friends and be the only one sober when everyone else is smoking and I don't see anything wrong with smoking occasionally. Every time we talk about it she says it feels like I'm trying to ""convince"" her to be okay with it, which honestly I guess I kind of am if you want to put it that way. I never pressure her to do these things and the one time she tried weed I made sure she was comfortable with trying and that she didn't feel like anybody was forcing her to do something she wasn't comfortable with. I got invited to a party this weekend and I want to go because I want to spend time with people I like, but I also feel like it won't be any fun because I know everybody else is going to be smoking weed and having a good time and the only thing I'm permitted to do is the one thing I hate. If I DID smoke or do acid or something, it would just feel awful because then I would be betraying her trust. I promised her I wouldn't do anything unless we're on the same page about it. She is NOT controlling and has even said she feels terrible because she feels like she's taking away my freedom. I know she's only doing this because she cares about me and is worried, but I feel like there's nothing to worry about. Is it selfish of me to wish that she understood that I'm not harming myself by doing these things \*OCCASIONALLY\*? I feel like I have no good reason to give to her to advocate for my own substance use because she thinks I'm a crackhead or something and I know it sounds really stupid to her. But it also feels like, idk... if I tried a food she likes for the first time and had an allergic reaction or something, and decided from then on that I don't want her to ever eat it again.",08May2020,1
76,"I dont live with her, but she still manages to tell me things that I never need to hear. I'm posting this because this evening she sent me messages that she meant to send to the person she is talking to at the moment, and then called me telling me not to tell my sister because she would be mad (lots of history with the partner). 
I moved away because she was toxic for me when I was in high school and experiencing depression/anxiety, and went no contact for a while. I accepted her back into my life because there is physical distance between us now, but now I'm unsure if that was the right decision because she's still manipulating me (asked me to not tell my sister things multiple times in the past). She thinks that everything is fine between us now because she cant see that her actions are what led to me moving away.

77,"I’m 14 F as of writing and... well the title is pretty self explanatory. I’m afraid to post this because I am afraid of the answer I might get. I just remember being a total piece of shit in elementary school. I wasn’t mean to everyone, just some people who I decided I didn’t like. There was one girl who I went to an out of school daycare and I just decided I didn’t like her. We were and are the same age, just going to different schools but ultimately in the same district. I was sort of the “leader” of the daycare because I was the oldest and I always just sort of suggested games or something. I remember always being scared of her and that she would replace me and I would end up alone... so I was mean to her. Not like straight up beating her up- just-
I didn’t even give her a reason. I never verbally went off or anything- just stupid glares or if I started singing and she would join I would stop. I don’t know why I was so mean, and when she joined my elementary school in the fourth grade- I don’t know why I was just more mean. I guess it was because she “annoyed” me and I felt like I was at least safe there with what little friends I actually had, not to mention we were both art kids. Looking back at it now, it should seem like stupid, laughable shit, but I just really feel like I did something to permanently damage her. Or another girl that I knew. She was also the art kid, so of course I was threatened. I wasn’t ever like- brutally mean or anything, just petty. Back then, my personality was really boisterous and very much extrovert- in the hopes I would attract friends of course. Where as now, I am very quiet, I keep to myself, and I avoid a lot of social gatherings. I feel really bad about it and I am currently discussing it with my therapist. (Please keep in mind I stopped any of this behavior a long time ago which is why I am just so shocked and disappointed in myself. I really, REALLY fucking hate myself. My therapist said I have symptoms of OCD where I get a thought that is either or intrusive or something I feel guilty about and then I can’t not focus on it.) I don’t want to believe I was as nasty as my brain is telling me I was (again, I have been known to demonize myself and my memory is absolute shit.) I just feel guilty. And yes, I have apologized to these girls multiple times hoping it will relieve some of the guilt and hopefully make them feel any sort of relief. But I just hate myself. I feel disgusting and I feel like the worse person on the planet. So here you are, Reddit. Enjoy. 

Summary for anyone who doesn’t want to read a book:

I feel bad because I wasn’t the nicest person to everyone at school. I was intimidated and feared I would lose friends (which, I didn’t have much to lose but-) because of these people, so I was petty. No outward bullying other than like once or twice of telling my friend group not to talk to this person because I was afraid of them replacing me. I apologized to them multiple times and I still feel bad for what I did. I fear that I might be the reason they don’t pursue something important in their life or have low self esteem. I was never physical or anything like that- just being shady.",08May2020,1

I've read quite a lot of those tips people give for focusing on homework but none of them really seem to address the problem I'm having. 

My phone is not an issue, I could be in the most clean and distraction free area possible and still have this issue. I'm already decently organized and take breaks. 

My problem is that, if I don't understand something or am not interested in doing it, I literally cannot process it anymore (like if I need to do a math question, I can reread the question multiple times and still not know what it said. I can literally no longer read at that point. I'm not dyslexic btw) 

Or, 

I cannot focus on it at all because I get urges to self harm instead, usually out of frustration or confusion. 

I've never seen any advice regarding this type of issue, it's always just ""phone bad, turn it off. Good luck"" so I was wondering if anyone had any tips, I usually don't have this problem but more that there's a constant flow of work with no break due to quarantine, it's becoming very overwhelming.",08May2020,1

92,"I'm giving my 2 weeks notice to my employer tomorrow. There's going to be a lot of panic, as I'm the only person trained in performing a major type of testing that's essential to the business. 

To train a replacement, it would take at least a month if we rushed and cut some corners. It's impossible to do it in 2 weeks, but I know my bosses are going to try and make me do it. I could probably train a coworker 50% of the way, but that would leave him in a very bad spot where he would have a ton of work/responsibility/pressure put on him when I leave. If he isn't trained properly, he will be stressed out like crazy and will likely make a lot of mistakes, which will put even more stress and pressure on him and turn into a vicious cycle. 

Should I refuse to train completely? If I do, this will put the pressure and stress on my bosses, who are the primary reason for me leaving. Should I threaten to leave immediately instead of working 2 more weeks if they try to pressure me into it? I'm really at a loss about what to do. I want to avoid putting my coworkers in a bad spot, but don't care about doing that to my bosses. 

Everyone would be in a really bad spot if I left immediately, which I don't want to do. But for some reason, I could see my bosses threatening to not let me work my last two weeks if I refuse to train. I really want to work my last two weeks though so my coworkers don't suffer.

95,"This might be less of a request for advice than it is a need to vent and have some support but advice is appreciated. There's a lot more supporting details but that would take way too long. I just need something. I hardly ever cry, but I am as I write this. A little background is that I am a freshman in college, she is a Senior in High School about to graduate. We will still be at the same college next year. This was my first attempt at dating since Freshman year of high school after a bad experience.

I (m/18) matched with a girl (f/18) right around the first week of quarantine on a Tinder. As a rule, I use apps/texting to set up dates and don't get into lengthy back and forth 'get to know you' stuff, but because of corona, this was different. After a few initial texts where we were hitting off, we moved to snap. After about 2 weeks of this, I asked to Facetime.

Long story short, we both took the initiative to keep the convos going, and to hit the other up first , 50/50 effort, and she was fun/funny/interesting to talk to and pretty quickly over the last 50 days this developed into getting to know each other through about 4-5hours of almost daily facetimes, to the point where we got so close that we, often initiated by her, talked about our future, in which we both eventually promised we were in it for the long haul, and would get married one day, as well as her confessing her love for me (before I had told her I loved her) while crying tears of joy . We actually (boo on us) broke quarantine twice to meet, nothing fancy, honestly met in a parking lot, couldn't stand distancing, and made out a bit. Our ideals, philosophies, and thoughts matched up perfectly. She introduced me to her friends (online) and they liked me a lot.

Since the Facetiming became a  almost daily thing, we were both upfront about the fact we didn't want to waste time on anything but a serious relationship/I'm the only one she was talking to and she expected the same, and to my own surprise, she actually asked me to be her boyfriend after we first met in person, which I agreed to

We were seemingly obsessed with eachother.  We were pouring our hearts out to eachother, talking about how 'we fit together', being a couple etc. She was talking to me about how she wanted have a boy and a girl with me, and we talked about names, about how we would travel together and live together when she was a Junior and I was a Senior. She told me her weekly counselor told her that she had been the happiest she had seen her since they began having appointments, and counselor attributed it to me.

The one negative in this all though was that she tended to have mood swings. Not common, but they happened. In her mood swings, she would not be the same. The vibe felt different. Talk about how she had been hurt, an how she felt we were moving too fast and she said I was ""too perfect, and no guy like me existed"". She claimed she was waiting for the other shoe to fall. She would mention how she felt like she was self-sabotoging.  I pointed out the fact that she was the one intiating most of the fast paced stuff, like telling me she loved me when we first met in person, to which she agreed. Again, these crazy mood swings really only happened like 3-4 times in 50 days but I remembered all of them. In her last major mood swing, which was only 2 days ago, she was getting angry at me for mentioning things, saying it was too fast, despite the fact that she had mentioned them first already like meeting parents (which she claimed she was really excited to do without me even talking about it first, hanging with eachothers friends , etc"" I pointed that out, to which she verbally agreed. After that moody discussion, which I talked to her about how yes it was still new, so we're both just getting used to eachother's quirks, she agreed and said her married friends told her the beginning was always hardest,  she was back to her completely bubbly, lovey dovey self and we hardcore flirted like we always did, she ended the conversation by telling me she'd always be my girl, and that she loves me (she said it first). Fast forward to last night, she is acting real off. She doesn't talk about any problems or anything, I just sense something is off.

Well, it turns out I was right because she facetimed me today with the sole purpose of breaking up with me stating ""I always felt that college should be a place where you find yourself, and everyone should do their own thing, and after thinking about it, I feel like this isn't real, and I no longer want a relationship, not just with you, but anyone throughout college."" Obviously that means that she doesn't want to have to be exclusive, which I get, but how did someone who was clearly in love switch to that so fast? It ended just like that, and she blocked me on all social media. I respected her decision, but I am incredibly sad and heartbroken, and confused. How could a girl, who's friends I always texted with and were telling me how they hoped for me to be like their big brother, and a girl who told me unprompted that she loved me, wanted to marry me, and have kids with me, many times, but less than 48 hours later emotionlessly tell me she didn't want a relationship? Again, I'm mentally destroyed, angry, and feel as though I have been lied to and played. Does anyone know what could have happened here? Even if you just have some support or something, anything would help. Thank you. This wouldn't hurt nearly as much if she hadn't said all of those things to me and just said early on that she didn't want a relationship, instead she gets in one with me, talks about the future a lot, and loves me, and then she just doesn't? What the hell. It will take a long time to recover from this, if I do at all, and decide to try and go beyond just hookups.",08May2020,1
96,For around half a year I started having these random bursts of sadness. They happen at least every other month and it starts with a minor inconvenience but then it spirals into something so much worse to the point where I wish I was never born. The first time it happened it kept me up for hours until I started to consider just jumping off the railing from the second floor of my house and trying to land on my head. Luckily none of my bursts of sadness have been that bad since but every time it does come around I usually come to the conclusion that the world would be better if I was never born. Since each incident happens 2 months apart I don't think I should call it depression but I just want to know what it is and what I should do.,08May2020,1

My mom is awesome and helped me build credit when I was 18. She took a card out in my name and established credit for me. Super grateful for that because by the time I was 23 I had a pretty decent credit score. 

However I’m almost 30 now and I’m still an authorized user on a card she holds. I don’t use the card, but because I’m an authorized user it reports on my credit. She says it’s to help my credit; but she’s using about 70-80% of that like of credit. Several times my score has dropped because she was using more and more of that credit. 

I’ve asked to be taken off and she says she will, but never does or says “Fine I’ll take you off but it’ll make your score drop.” It’s been at least 6 months.

My childhood was really tough, I have divorced parents that despise each other, the constant arguing has never been easy on me. I don't want to make this long, but I've just always been really insecure and sad. I have reached out for help before ( due to my anxiety and depression), and it's helped a lot. But due to the current situation, it's hard to get help. I've always been really suicidal and sad, but nowadays, it's on a whole new level. It just feels like my entire life I have just been kind of shit on. I was abused, bullied from peers, discriminated again, etc.. and I'm just tired. But I don't experience these things anymore.

A bit of backstory I guess: 

I've been living with my sister for the last 7 months because we don't have the best parents and she wanted to help me have a better life. I don't know anything about the world because I was sheltered by my mom, I'm pretty much useless when it comes to anything. 

My sister was going to teach me how to be independent and put me in school and help me get a job but none of that has happened because Corona kinda put my life on hold. 
Yesterday she texted me saying she's moving to the United States (we currently live in Canada) because her husband got a job offer there and they're taking it and leaving me behind. 

She told me that I have 2-3 weeks to find an apartment and that I'm going to be on my own from now on. 
I don't know how to do anything or make appointments. I have a lot of trouble communicating with people because I never know what I'm supposed to say. I'm not professional at all and I have no idea what to do.

They'll be leaving around the end of the month and I've been looking at apartments and found one I like but I don't know what I'm supposed to say to get it, The rent is good and I have a bit of savings so I can pay rent for a few months but I really need to get a job as well, there's a problem with that though. 

I have no education because my mom homeschooled me my entire life and I never finished school past 6th-7th grade. I've also never had a job before so I have 0 experience. 

I really just feel like giving up on life because I don't know what to do anymore. I have depression and lots of anxiety and it's hard for me to do anything. I don't know where to even start.

106,"I have a lot of ex-friends and ex-boyfriends that I still fuss over a lot. Obviously, it's hard for me to just get over it, but it's about time I at least try to rip the band-aid off. I'll give a few examples of some of the main people I'm trying to move past:

Jae, whom I dated for about eight to nine months and broke up with in late 2019. We had on-and-off sexual relations after the breakup a few months later, which eventually lead to me cheating on my then-boyfriend. I know how bad cheating is and if I'm being honest, the fact that I did it makes me feel incredibly depressed, even months later. For that reason, I request that when making your comment, please don't harass me about it. I apologized to the person I cheated on and explained what had happened 5 or so minutes after the cheating had occurred, and we broke up soon thereafter. I haven't spoken to Jae since the cheating happened. Nonetheless, I'm still hung up on the situation, and it makes me upset to think about.

Hansel &amp; Gretel, who are boyfriend and girlfriend. I was friends with Hansel for years before he met Gretel, and after that, it was already off to a bad start. Gretel really didn't like me at first and would talk shit about me behind my back, etc. Eventually we worked through it and we became best friends. Then we had a fight, and after we stopped talking, I started dating Jae (Jae was Gretel's ex-boyfriend. Gretel had tried telling me he was a rapist, but that just wasn't true, as she had admitted it to me when we started talking again). Jae and I broke up, and she was there for me. Then, out of the blue, she called me a crazy bitch and said I needed to kill myself, so I cut her off. I actually had another Reddit account I used to vent on r/depression about them. Didn't use names or give any identifying information to link them to my posts, but Hansel &amp; Gretel tracked me down and told me I was still insane and lying, and they especially but emphasis on me *slandering* them. Obviously, slandering needs a definitive identity to be called slander, so it was pretty dumb. But, anyway, thinking over that situation also makes me sad. It also doesn't help that they try their best to contact me and harass me in any way they can. They even went as far as to join a roleplay server I had hosted on Discord just so that they could get past my private message setting (had to be in a server with someone to receive messages from them).

David, whom I cheated on. I still have feelings for him, and although I haven't spoken to him in a month or so, I still feel horrible. I often stare at our saved messages on Snapchat out of habit. It's incredibly unhealthy, and he obviously doesn't want anything to be with me (I cheated on him, duh) so this is the most important person out of the three that I need to move on from. I don't really text him anymore, but with my obsessive thinking, it'll probably happen eventually. I'm trying to nip it in the bud before it happens.

I have a bad habit of looking at old messages with these people which makes it that much more painful to think about. I've thought about making new accounts on social media, which would probably work, but I'm not sure if it's worth the hassle of getting all of my friends in order, y'know? There's also plenty of other people I don't want to just delete messages with, since those are precious memories to me. I've had my Discord account for about 3 years. That's a lot of stuff to just put down the drain.

Yes, I've blocked Hansel &amp; Gretel and Jae. But my mind takes a hold of my emotions and I end up ruminating about them. Eventually it gets so bad that I *have* to look through our old messages, otherwise I'll get even more anxious. But if I look at the messages, I'll just get depressed and start crying. It's a double-edged blade, and I'm pretty sure the only way to fix it is to just make a new Discord account. I don't know, Reddit. What would you do?",08May2020,1

Sure it said ""deleted"" but it had my username in the ""description"" below the link so everyone would know that it was me that poted it.

After a couple of dates, just when I figured things were going well we got to the 'how serious are we' conversation after an argument. He tells me he doesn't find me attractive enough to be serious about this. We decide to end things on the relationship front but still remained friends. I wanted to understand what he meant by him not finding me attractive, so after some persistence he lets on that prefers lean and fair skinned girls. He said he wouldn't have taken it so far but he wanted to see if he could make it work but he couldn't. He is darker than I am. It wasn't relevant to me until he made  that statement. Even though we aren't on talking terms anymore it still bothers me that my skin tone could decide whether I'm attractive or not. I haven't really been this insecure about it before. I tell myself he wasn't the right person and that I should be confident in who I am but I seem to be latched onto that. It'd be great if someone could bring to light some nuance to this that I've missed. I don't think he's the bad guy in this scenario. I'd just like to move on from this.",08May2020,1

R and my fiancé-N have known each since elementary school. R is a really sweet guy and I really like him. So we def want to invite R but the question is to give him a plus one or not. He won’t know most of the other guests, so plus one right? But if we give him a plus one he will bring his gf K which is the problem. It’s not simply that I don’t like K which I don’t and neither does my fiancé. It’s the fact that I was roommates and friends with K and she was rude and disrespectful to me which is why we stopped being friends. She said and did a lot of mean things to me and N. So I don’t want anyone at my wedding who’s treated me and N like that. On the other hand it’s polite to give R a plus one since he won’t know anyone and he’ll know we’re specifically inviting him and not her. We’re not in the same group of friends anymore so there’s no potential backlash there but we don’t want to offend R either. I know it’s ultimately N and my choice and if we send the invite to just him, he may still come and if he doesn’t he’ll at least know that we wanted him to.

At the end of the day we would always talk at night when everything has calmed down, for a couple of hours at least. 

A couple days ago something I suspected that was happening might’ve been confirmed. This friend has been ignoring me to talk to another friend he’s closer to. Or at least on some occasions.

Ever since I found out I realized that I shouldn’t depend so much on someone who sees me as a second choice, someone they can just talk to when they have nobody else around. 

Besides that, I’ve still been trying to make an effort. I try to text him a tiny bit throughout the day and we still talk at night like always, but only after his other friend falls asleep.

These last few weeks have felt very different, I feel like I’m obligated to still talk to him. Which is why I do it. Although part of me still wants to be his friend because he IS an amazing friend. 

Now I dread the night time a little bit, because I just don’t want to talk him to lately. But at the same time I do. It’s just hard, and I don’t even know what to say anymore. I feel like I have to say all the right things. I just want some space maybe, and I don’t know how to tell him.

I don’t even know if I want space actually, but yeah, it’s all so weird. I feel like I already know what I am to him, so I’m sorta just, withdrawing little by little. 

I mostly like to spend time with my family and others, as well as spend time alone. Which is an improvement for me, because I used to never be able to spend time alone.

I don’t know if I should keep “trying.” I feel annoying randomly texting them late at night, I lowkey feel obligated. But I still want to be friends. But how can we be friends if we stop talking? I just don’t know.

He calls the police on the most ridiculous things. He's called the police on children playing. He's called the police when her dog was barking.

The suburb she lives in is literally \*known\* for their prompt police response and this guy has a reputation now, yet has never been fined or anything.

Now, he has called and gotten their three chickens taken away. He made a noise complaint, and because the chicken coop is 20 feet from the ""structure"" (house) and not 35 feet, they have now been told to get rid of their chickens within 30 days.

It’s not like I parade it around, I just feel like when it’s winter, and I’m not wearing shorts, it’s not really necessary. I’ve also got wavy/curly hair, and I’ve been using the “curly girl method” to enhance my curls, and to make my hair healthier. 

Here’s where I need advice. My entire family basically thinks I’m disgusting. They make me feel like a disappointment basically. They’re constantly telling me to shave my legs bec “that’s not how ladies are suppose to look” and they claim that “I’ll never find a man who will like me”. They think I’ve “let myself go” because I don’t flat iron my hair anymore, like I used to. What are some good clap-backs I can use to get them to shut up.

Some current arguments I’ve used regarding the situation. I’ve tried explaining to them how I’m embracing my naturally curly hair, and that not every day will my hair be frizz free and beautiful. I’ve said that flat irons and heat in general will make it worse, and make my hair unhealthy. I’ve said that if a guy doesn’t like me because I choose to have leg hair in the winter, he’s not worth my time anyways. I’ve also asked them why it’s gross for me to have leg hair, but my brother’s leg hair isn’t?

Any new argument tactics will suffice. Or even if you have news ways to phrase my current arguments, that’ll work too. Any advice is appreciated.

123,"So, my parents are just not very good people at all. My mom is extremely derogatory towards a lot of my friends. A few examples are one of my best friends had to leave college in the middle of her last semester, worked her ass off to get back and finish her degree, and she's done that now. My mom doesn't like her because she's not white collar enough. My best friend went to the same university (I live in a college town) and got a general studies degree. He's pretty rough around the edges in appearance, and he's an absolute goofball, but he's got a heart of gold and he's one of the most genuine people I've ever known. My mom has met him and thinks he's absolute trash because he got a general studies degree and he's not in a white collar job. He's always been employed post graduation and has a job he loves right now.

I don't ever talk about my friends around my parents, and on the very rare instances I ever mention anything, I don't name people and I keep it vague because it hurts me and infuriates me to hear my parents absolutely degrade them. These are people I know very well and that I love, my parents only know them on a very surface level. My friends are not bad people at all, they're just not white collar future CEOs and business people.

So, one of my really good friends works at a place that my mom shops at on occasion. When she went there earlier today, he told her that he's really good friends with me and knows one of my brothers. I know I'm probably too sensitive to this, but I didn't like it at all. The best way to describe the friend my mom met is a Christian Arkansas hippy.

When I was around 12 I found naked pictures of men in her phone, and caught her cheating on my dad for the first time. I was too young to really process it, so I kept it to myself for months and finally one night broke down in tears and told my dad. I love my dad so much, he is the sweetest little angel, and puts up with a lot. It broke my heart to see him so sad. After that we never talked about it again, but then again a couple years later I found more pictures and Skype messages. I never told my dad about these, but confronted my mom. She denied everything??? Which doesn't even make sense because there were literal text messages and pictures. Well while my mom and sister wee in Europe last summer they had a huge fight and my dad had told me that my mom said it was just my sister being petty, but my sister finally admitted to me that she had caught my mom messaging with European men and confronted her at the dinner table (My mom travels internationally for work all the time, so she has no shortage of contacts). I guess my mom just started crying and told my sister she is just so lonely and blah blah blah. I don't know what to do because I know that it's my parents relationship and not mine, but I just want to protect my dad.

So, I met this guy on Tinder, met up and just clicked instantly. Went back to his place to hang out and ended up having sex. Things were fine, we were hanging out regularly and then about 3 months in he tells me he’s also been having sex with his ex for the past few weeks. We weren’t in a relationship or anything but it hurt my feelings because he explained that he told her about me and that she was fine with the situation, but he didn’t bother to say anything to me until he had already made the decision to sleep with her for several weeks. Later, we get an STD scare from said ex and I’m just furious and scared because I have other health conditions. He decides he’s not going to have sex with her anymore. 

Few months go by, seems like we’re getting closer, but then he kind of starts distancing himself from me in February. When the pandemic started, he decides to tell me he’s been seeing another girl for a few weeks and has a crush on her. He says because he’s hurt me and others with how he deals with sex, he wants to stop having sex with me so he can open up the potential for a non serious relationship with her.

135,"Hello. I just began my sixth semester of college two and a half weeks ago. I’m studying art education with an English education minor. I want to teach either high school art or high school English (preferably high school art). Although I had a great GPA in high school (graduating with honors and receiving mostly all A’s), my GPA in college is absolute trash. I’ve failed 6 classes throughout my time at college so far. I didn’t fail because I wasn’t capable or smart enough to pass them... I failed them because I just kinda stopped caring. I stopped attending, stopped doing the work... it just didn’t seem worth it to me. I’ve been fighting depression and anxiety throughout these semesters at college, and that’s made it extremely difficult, as well. Now that I’ve started this new semester, I can tell that failure is going to happen again with a couple of my classes. I haven’t even been going to some of the Zoom meetings.

I just have no motivation. Growing up, I loved drawing, I loved reading, and I had big dreams. I wanted to write a novel; I wanted to work as a concept artist at Nintendo... but once I reached college and saw the “real world”, those dreams were quickly dissolved. I changed my major and minor to education because I knew becoming a teacher would be feasible. Both my parents are teachers, and so I figured it would be a safe choice.

Part of my lack of motivation has to do with the fact that I’ve gotten into some bad habits during quarantine. I sleep in, I eat mostly junk food, and the only things that bring me happiness nowadays are playing Animal Crossing on my Switch and scrolling through funny things on the internet. I guess I’m addicted to those things because they give me immediate happiness or whatever. I hardly even read my scriptures anymore, and I’m a very religious person. All of these things with my mental illness on top makes me feel like I’m hardly even myself anymore.

The thought of continuing school makes me want to cry. What’s the point? I don’t even know if I’ll like being a teacher. High schoolers are mean, and I’m sensitive as hecc. But what would I do if I didn’t become a teacher? My art and my writing isn’t good enough that I could make a career out of it. I absolutely love video games and making videos, but I doubt I’d have much success being a gaming YouTuber/streamer because, again, I’m not very good.

140,"Hi everyone! Here’s the story: 
Before COVID, we had extended our lease from end of April until end of May. After COVID, we no longer needed the extension because my boyfriend and I would not be physically graduated and we also aren’t working as we are non-essential. We asked the landlord to cancel the extension and he said no. 
That’s fine, we tried to find someone to sublet, but no luck. 
The landlord was able to find someone that was interested so I sent videos of the apartment and also emailed with the prospective tenant at the request of the landlord. They even came and toured while we waited outside. Now, the prospective tenant has backed out.

The other day I overheard my neighbor saying things like ""I think he's hitting her"" from my room ect. In reality we were horseplaying on her bed and I ended up making her mad at me. I ended up eavesdropping more (bad idea I know) but when I did I heard that they heard a loud thump downstairs and were debating calling the police. They didn't end up doing so, but now at night I feel like anything I do will seem further suspicious and might make them think that it's true. 

A few days later I was out on the porch after carrying groceries indoors and heard them say ""He's such an asshole."" I avoid crossing them in the halls, or seeing them to avoid dirty looks, it's starting to make me paranoid. Nothing about what they think is remotely true but I don't know how to convey that to them without them knowing I overheard. I feel unsafe in my own home. I keep feeling anxious and find myself listening to them to see if they say anything else. Should I write a letter? Just to ask them and explain what they heard?

My mom is asking me to RSVP for reception head count now, but I’m so torn.

I recently started full time work, I had only a week in the office before having to work from home due to COVID-19.

155,"Hi everyone, sorry for formatting I’m on mobile. My cousin 13 years old and has already been sent a trauma/stress center 2 times in last 4 months due to my aunt and his father (uncle) arguing and yelling. 

This has been something my father, sister, and mother has been conversing about, but do not know how to handle. They have had bad places in their relationship before where she and my cousin have gone to live with my grandparents for a couple weeks but it always seems to repeat itself after things cooled off between them. 

Currently my aunt and my cousin are living with my grandparents because the living situation at their house has grown so uncomfortable. My uncle has reversed the locks on the door so there is no privacy. He takes the new puppy and hides it in the room he sleeps in so the dog won’t be familiar with my cousin and aunt. He has broken several of my cousins electronics that he uses to interact with other people, which is a big deal since he is an only child and kind of socially awkward. These are some of the things that has sent my cousin into such a panicked state where he has had to go to a stress center and even said that he was going to kill himself.

I don’t know if my aunt will consider getting a divorce or counseling even. I don’t know how to talk to her about this as we are not very close do not talk very often. I talk to my cousin sometimes, but not nearly as much as I should. Despite this I cannot stand to see my cousin in so much pain and it is emotionally breaking me. He is only 13!

159,"I (22M) was raised by my grandparents. I'm an only child and my grandma died when I was 15, so it's been just me and my grandpa for 7 years now. We live near a college town, and when I started college in 2016, I decided to go to school there and live at home instead of going somewhere further away for a couple reasons. The first reason is that we live on a ranch pretty far out in the country (our closest neighbors are like 8 miles down the road) and neither me or my grandpa wanted him to have to be out there in a big house completely alone. The second reason is that I worked on the ranch all throughout college, so it was really convenient to just live there.

I just graduated college, and I'm still living with my grandpa and working on the ranch. My plan is to get a better job and then eventually build a smaller house on the property a couple miles away from the main house so I can be a little more independent without leaving my grandpa completely alone. Then I'll get married (I have a serious girlfriend I've been dating for five years) and we can live in the smaller house until my grandpa either 1) passes away and leaves the big house to us or 2) gets older and wants to move into the smaller house and lets us move into the big one.

Anyway, I feel like this is a good plan, but it also feels kinda weird. It makes me insecure when people find out I still live with my grandpa, and the thought of moving out but not really ever truly moving out in the future makes me kinda insecure too. But at the same time, it's what I really want. I love the ranch more than anything and my grandpa said he'd sell it if he had to live there alone, which is something I really really don't want to happen.

Is my plan bad or small minded?",08May2020,1

161,"Mandatory ""this is a throaway account, don't rage at my name"".


I've been left out of everything my whole life.
I have no friends. Nobody is willing to talk to me, I can't talk to girls (Stuttering and pretty much everything relating to anxiety), I'm bullied at home and quarantine isn't helping, and there's just so much stuff I can't keep control of.


My brother pretty much enjoys telling me I stink. I shower every day, I wear cologne, I wear anti-perspirant deodorant and normal deodorant every day, I use body wash, I just can't get over it. I feel like there's something wrong with me and I don't know what. I know I don't stink but it sure seems like I do.


I had 3 breakdowns in the past two weeks and it's not getting any better I feel like I might have something like anxiety but I can't put my finger on it. My brother stalks my social medias and checks my phone whenever he can. Recently, I've broken my collarbone while I was out skateboarding, and my brother takes the liberty to go through my entire phone. Contacts, SMS messages, call history, everything. I don't have privacy in my own phone or home and I sure don't have privacy here.


I can't pursue any physical activity (broken collarbone), I'm too young to get a job and meet people there, I'm too young to make myself better. I've been the weird kid for 14 years. 14 years of me, constantly being picked on, being thrown around, and I'm just tired of it. I'm not gonna do anything crazy (I can't hurt a fly) but its the truth.



My only friend doesn't have a phone. I've just been through a nasty breakup and I've had the fear that I'm going to die young. I don't know where, but it's been looming over me.


People here have been giving me advice, like ""Find something that makes you happy"", or ""You'll get through it."". It doesn't help, but I appreciate the effort.


This has just been a vent, but I want to ask the real question right now.



How do I get friends and keep them? How do I get style? How do I talk to people of the opposite gender and the same gender better and how do I hold the conversation? How do I not stink and what can I do to make sure I don't? How do I get people to like me? What do people look for in a friend and what do people look for in relationships?",08May2020,1

163,"First off, let me start off by saying this; I am in no position to be complaining about anything in life. I live relatively care-free as of late. My history kinda goes as follows: I was born into a low-income family with parents that really didn't care what happened to me. (not going to go into the sappy-depressing shit, although a-lot of people have had worse backgrounds than me) At 13, I started feeling down, like the, ""I want to die"" type of down. The feeling subsided quite a bit when I turnt 16. At 16 as I started working 2 jobs (full-time 4:30am-3pm, 4pm-11pm)  in the summer, then 1 job during school season (4pm-11pm) so I was always preoccupied for at-least 15 hours a  day. I got the jobs to give back to my parents and for some other stuff I'm about to get into. Now, at the ripe of age of 16, I started smoking weed (which was wrong I know!)  It helped out quite a bit with me and my alone time. As time played out, I required more and more of it for the same high, which is a red flag. This brings me to present day; no job because laid-off due to stupid virus. Now, under the circumstances all I would do is smoke, but, now since I've done it for so long and I got so much free-time, It affects me little to none. I have hobbies like playing my PlayStation and playing basketball, but neither of those inspire any happiness in these present conditions. Not even the things that I once that were pretty fun and entertaining, can bring out the littlest shrivel of hope for me. I'm so bored, not depressed. Bored to the point of depression, maybe?

Just to see which approach works better. The Nice guy me we’ll call NG (Nice Guy) and the Asshole we’ll call AH (AssHole). Well basically AH got in her DMs and basically started sexting her. Now at this point she’s only been a nice innocent sweet girl to me. NG and AH are both talking to her on Snapchat. NG is talking to her about dogs (which I love) and AH has been sexting with her. She basically wants nothing to do with NG and is all over AH. As AH, she will do whatever I say and lives to please me basically. It’s only been about a week so it’s still early, but after talking to her I really really like her. Like tonight NG flirted with her and she shut me down while she was sexting with AH. I really don’t wanna lose her but I don’t see how I can come clean and still keep her. She started out as an experiment but has now turned into an amazing girl that I genuinely have feelings for. 

To make matters worse, the AH snapchat I made based on my ex’s ex to see if she’d message him back if she thought I was him... it was a failed project but now she calls AH by my ex’s ex’s name...

177,"So to start off with, my mom raised me by herself. My dad didn’t believe I was his child until the DNA swab came back with a match. To his credit, he faithfully paid child support after that until I was 18. I am 28 now. I’ve never gotten a birthday card, text message, or anything from him; I’ve never even seen him. It bothered me a lot when I was younger, but I told myself that if he didn’t want to be in my life that I didn’t need him.
Unfortunately, I came to realize over the years that I needed to find some closure. I needed him to know who I was, and I needed him to acknowledge that I am his child. So, i started doing some digging. Long story short, I found him. Today, I found what I thought was his phone number. On a whim, I decided to text that number, explaining who I was. I didn’t expect any response, but he actually called me a few minutes later. 
I’m not a crier, but when I heard his voice, I bawled. We had a long talk, and he told me he’s been looking for me since I was younger. I’m the only girl out of his 6 children. He wants to have a relationship with me. Of course I want this too, but I don’t know how to go about it. I feel very strongly that there need to be boundaries put in place and that I want to take things slowly and at my own pace, but he seems so excited to have found me. I don’t know what to do and I don’t want him to be upset that I can’t jump in to calling him “dad” right away. It’s just so overwhelming and scary. 
Of all the times I thought about this reunion in my head, this isn’t what I expected at all. I told myself I’d know how to act in any scenario that came up, but now that it’s happened, I’m just in shock. How should I move forward with this? What the heck do I do now?",08May2020,1

The problem is, I'd like to surprise her and be waiting with a 'welcome home' sign, but I've literally never been inside an airport. Where would you go in the airport for that kinda thing? is there a specific area, or is it just in like, a main lobby? 

It seems like such a minor thing to worry about, but I'd really like to not mess it up and it's kinda giving me anxiety about it. Any help is appreciated, and thanks!",08May2020,1

180,"So I wrote a children's book a while back (I know, competitive field), and I want to get it published. However, I don't have an illustrator for any of the pictures, and haven't published anything before. My options from what I can think of are self-publishing, literary agent, or send submissions. I'm trying to figure out the best option for me. I've been thinking more about self-publishing and just finding an illustrator on fiverr or something like that, and then advertising the book to the school I work in and social media etc. 

I want to do what's best for my book, and then thought someone on here might had experience with this.

181,"I'm a 33 year old guy with a job in a niche field that I like, in a city that I absolutely hate. I've lived in this city for 8 years working my way up and finally getting to a point where I found the job/career I want to be in, but I don't want to live here anymore. This town  has just never felt like home for me. I cringe when I think about settling down here or buying a house.  My job is relatively cushy, easy to get complacent, but the work interests me and I could see myself doing well in this field if I stay the course. The pay isn't anything great, I won't get rich in this field but I'll always be relatively comfortable as it's a secure job. 

 While I feel that I've grown professionally, personally I've been stagnant here for years as I have no family, am still single, and do not have a close circle of friends in this town. I've learned to make it on my own, but I've  become a bit of a loner in the process, and I'm worried because I'm becoming more content with being alone. I know I am not as happy as I could or should be. I go back and forth from wanting to hand in my 2wks notice and leave, to worrying about making a terrible mistake by walking away from my secure job and what little I have built out here over the last 8 years. I worry a lot about starting over. Right now I'm somewhat important in my role, I worry about having to start again from the bottom.

I've been saving up for the last 4 years (this is a high cost of living area) to buy my first home so I'd have something to show for my struggles. My thought was, maybe I'll enjoy the area more if I put down roots and have something to show for my sacrifice. I scrimped and saved up 100k and paid off all my debt, so I'm finally at a point where I can put down a big deposit on a nicer home, but I'm terrified to do that. Part of me feels like sucking it up and just living here would be the safe option, but I know I'll never be truly happy if I do that. I'd be sacrificing happiness for security. I am an anxious person by nature, and I know it's my heart that wants me to leave, but my head is what's pushing me to stay. 

Sorry for the long story, but I have no idea what to do. I literally change my mind about this a dozen times through the course of an average week, avoid making any kind of decision, then just do nothing and put it in the back of my mind. I've been doing this for many years and I'm growing tired, and depressed because of it. I know I can't keep putting this off much longer and I'm hoping to get some advice on what to do, and how to start over.",08May2020,1

They did it to me and it didnt sound like a joke at all so i ended up fighting with 2 boys there. I ""made up"" with one but the other just kept pushing it making fun of me because i ""dont get"" the sarcasm. I explained that i do, but i dont share the same feelings about 'roasting' other person to get a laugh. 
My bf said very little on the matter with one girl i had an argument 2 days before too lol. She understood my feelings and tried to end the fight, mind you that helped to make up with the guy that started it. Of the other 6 persons present nobody said anything, I felt wronged and just very out of place, so i left the sv. 
But some of them dont make me uncomfortable and I feel bad for that, but on the other hand even if I encounter them on a multiplayer match I get really upset. How can I overcome this feeling? I have a hard time forgiving people, even more when I dont approve of their ideas at this level. The guy that apologized to me and me to him doesnt get me super uneasy, but its not super likeable. On the other hand the other guy just makes me feel really awful. It kind of triggered memories from past bullying experiences that were similar. 
The very bad thing is that I dont like how my bf behaves around them... For example that day when he said nothing to me afterwards and just overall he acts quite like them when trouble arises (they dont talk about it, or just ignore it, expect it to go away or minimize it) and im feeling those same vibes from him.

197,"Hi! I've been trying to map out my move-out plan since early January of this year, without having my parents involved (if you'd like to know why I won't have them involved, please take a look at my post history - they're narcissistic and incapable of separating themselves from me).

I have about $700 in a savings account as far as I know, and I haven't held a job since I was 16. This is a problem because I haven't been able to get a job since. Due to the coronavirus, my search for a stable job has gotten increasingly harder and seemingly impossible. Although I've had some success and landed a phone interview with a shipping company, I've been waiting for a call back from them for about three weeks now. I think my chances of getting this job is slim to none.

The average price for a studio apartment in this area is $1200, furnished or otherwise, excluding utilities and other misc. billings.

I tried looking for a roommate within my circle of friends, but they're all attending college in the fall, and plan to remain dependent on their families if they're forced to stay at home (or do the traditional dorm setup if things are up and running again by the start of the term). So, I have to stick this out on my own. I don't trust Craigslist and similar services whatsoever, especially as a transgender man in Texas.

What should I do?",08May2020,1
198,"My husband and I just moved into our first home together and my husband decided it would be a good way to save money if we let one of his best friends move into our 2bd/1ba home.

I told him I didn’t really care for roommates (based on past experience) but if he thought it would be a good way to save money, why not? 

About a week before move-in, we all sat down and had dinner together and we went over the house rules:
1. Absolutely NO shoes in the house (I like to walk around my home barefoot and I’m like a super clean freak)
2. No food/drinks in the bedrooms or on carpet (my husband and I both agreed we didn’t want to start a bug problem, or want to go through the trouble of having stains removed from the carpet)

Pretty reasonable rules, right? 

Well our roommate agreed to said rules without any issues and moved in right away.

Things were going fine until I noticed him coming home from work and not leaving his work boots at the doormat. Now I can understand maybe 1-2 times, but it was becoming a habit.. something he did every day..  in my face. 

So not only is he disrespecting the rules my husband and I set in place, he messed up our dryer and didn’t even TRY to fix it. My husband and I are “renting” our washer and dryer for about $50 a month. Brand new set, not previously owned. Our roommate left a pen in his pocket and stained the entire drum of the dryer. Mind you, these are rented items so we may possibly have to pay more for this later on.

I brought this up to my husband and told him that he needs to remind him to take his work boots off at the doormat and also try to fix what he did to the dryer... 

Roommate had the nerve to tell my husband, “I think it’s stupid how I pay for half the rent and I have no say so in anything, I can’t even take food or drinks into my room, I was thinking about moving out” 

That made me LIVID. Firstly, you’re a grown man living in someone else’s home in which you agreed to all responsibilities and expectations PRIOR to moving in. My husband pays for EVERYTHING else in the house; internet, the  washer and dryers, all cleaning supplies including detergent, dishwasher pods and soap, and even keeps the fridge stocked with food! Neither one of them cleans because I do all the cleaning in the house because I feel like if they did it, it wouldn’t be up to my standards (which isn’t a problem because I love cleaning and having a clean home). Roommate stays in his cave all day and night playing video games, comes out only when I cook dinner (I cook for my husband every night but every once in a while I’ll offer him some- mainly because we can’t afford to feed a third adult, especially when they make no effort to chip in outside of their share of rent). 

My husband said he completely understands where I am coming from, and agrees with me. I work hard to maintain this home and he works even harder to provide for it. However, my husband is so much more laid back and gets bothered by pretty much nothing (a very go with the flow kinda guy which makes me feel crazy when things like this bother me). 

So I wanted more opinions on this, am I overreacting? How would you have handled this?",08May2020,1

210,"Hi there

First time posting. I hope i get it right. I think the title speaks for itself but perhaps i should provide some background info. 

I’m a secondary school teacher and I’m taking a part-time degree at university to improve my qualifications. One of the courses this year is about how to be a professional teacher, how kids learn, etc

The assignments for this class are (A) confusing and (B) repetitive. For example, the instructions for the final essay were 6294 words long, spread over 15 pages. The requirement is that we write 2000 words. Like seriously, how convoluted can you be? Also remember, we’re full-time teachers taking an evening course! Honestly i don’t have the time to read all that. 

The tasks were also repetitive. E.g. we had to give presentations every other week, and at the end of the semester we had to upload yet again a narrated presentation on ... drumroll ... a topic we had previously presented in class. Mind you the in-class presentations aren’t even graded. 

I can give you so many more examples of things that went wrong with this class this year, it’s ridiculous! 

So I’m obviously not pleased with what’s in the curriculum of this class but what made it worse was one of the lecturers (we had two, they had divided the work equally). 

From the start it was clear how little interest he had in teaching. He played YouTube clips, didn’t provide us with the guiding questions which we had to answer for one of the ongoing assignments, didn’t even show up for some classes, made his assistant do most of the talking, gave super generic feedback on our work (if at all he gave any feedback). The list goes on.  

So i typed up my evaluation for this course and this awful professor in which i lay out everything i think went wrong this year and all the unprofessional transgressions of this lecturer. Of course no foul language but it’s pretty strong-worded. 

Should i hit the submit button?",08May2020,1

213,"This is going to be long, so get ready. And sorry if I have any difficulties, I'm new to reddit. Also gonna say that I'm aware that snooping is wrong and I probably have a problem.

I \[17f\] am half Asian from mom and half white from dad and live with my parents and brother \[15\]. Throughout this I will not be saying what Asian race for privacy reasons. Dad is a decent person and father (although emotionally not there for us - most likely due to him being the leader of a local chapter of a large volunteer organization that takes up lots of time and energy to the point of him neglecting his family), but has never been an amazing husband, doing close to no housework and watching TV all day.

This started when I was 11 or 12. I asked to use my dad's phone to play games while he was talking to another organization board member, as he tends to talk for a long time. In the drop down of google I saw a website called \[our county\]sexlife.com or something along those lines. I tried to forgive and forget and it took awhile but I forgave somewhat.

A few years later my family was in a supermarket and they left me in the car. My dad forgot his phone and I knew the password (he never cared to hide it) so I went through his search history. Mostly work, programming, and organization stuff but I found a strange website. Looking it up back home, I found it was a sugar daddy website. I was enraged but again tried to forgive and forget since I had no hard evidence besides this.

I also found out that my mom had suspicions of him cheating back in 2008 when I read her journal, so he has likely done this type of thing before.

I do not have my own computer so I use a Chromebook that belongs to the organization (dad rarely ever uses it). Thus, it is connected to his organization google account. I was checking my emails, and usually I just click to switch to my personal, but a weird email in his inbox caught my eye, saying something along the lines of ""\[random name\] sent you a message"". Later, I found out it was a dating website (what a surprise). I also realized I could access his fake profile through his email. From reading messages, I found out that not only was he sending greasy messages to dozens of women for the past 4 weeks, but these women were all \[Asian race\] and he only talked in badly written \[Asian language\]. It appears that my dad has yellow fever, which has caused him to develop a fetish for \[Asian race\] women. This made me sick to my stomach. Reading more, I found that his goal was to get these women to video call him on a different app, offering to pay if they asked. It disgusts me that he would spend hard earned money on this. To be fair, he has not followed through on any of these offers (yet). I have been alternating between numb and angry and for the first time ever hate myself for being mixed race.

My conflict is who to tell, if anyone, and what to do. It seems my mom knows of his perpetual unloyalty but is not aware of the current situation, and stays with my dad for familial and somewhat financial security (she makes a decent amount more but probably not enough to sustain us on her own). She is also religious and against divorce. My brother afaik has no clue and I want to tell him just so that I can empathize with someone, but he has a really good relationship (although still not emotionally deep) with my dad and I would hate to ruin it. This would also cause him to shunt my dad and push him away even further than he already is from the family. My dad may know that I know as I have been pissy towards him since I found out and we may have been on the website at the same time as it has been ""glitching"" between pages. I want my parents to get divorced just so my mom and me can be happy (she is amazing and deserves so much better) but I am applying to college soon and don't know if this would hurt my financial aid situation. I don't know when I would tell anyone because I don't want to deal with it now and I don't want my brother to deal with it by himself while I'm at college.

But he ""accidentally"" falls asleep without getting to say good night almost every night and I'm feeling really bothered about this because he doesn't do anything in his spare time than eat, sleep, and watch series. He doesn't have pressure at all, meanwhile, I have a stressful job with a stressful boss and I never sleep on him? But I could be in the wrong mindset. Is this a red flag?

219,"I have a 5 year old male cat who is neutered. 

For as long as I can remember he has walked around the house meowing but only maybe once  a week. 

Since we moved 6 weeks ago, he has meowed while walking around the upstairs of the house for HOURS. He often will just lie by the top of the stairs and meow for no reason. 

For context, all family members moved with. He is an indoor cat and has been for all his life. He has free reign of the backyard during the day but must be in at night. It has been this way his whole life. 

He has a female cat who he has grown up with. She sleeps through the night. 

He has good food in a bowl that he can access, his own personal water fountain, plenty of toys, scratching posts etc. 

We have a great relationship and he follows me around, sleeps on the chair next to me and I brush him everyday which he loves. His litter box is clean. He dosen’t lack attention nor affection. 

I have tried staying up later, going to bed earlier, settling down earlier etc but no difference in his behavior. 

He Dosent go downstairs to meow so I don’t believe there is an animal around disturbing him and the dogs and other cat sleep fine. He also has a good relationship with them and they clean each other’s ears regularly. 

I’d also like to add under lockdown we haven’t left the house in 6 weeks so I feel all the animals have settled and accepted this as their home.

226,"I have a really hard time when people respond to stuff I post (here or on other social media sites) with criticism that I don't think it fair. I try hard to be self-reflective and to think hard about everything I post, and I consider myself someone who's willing to concede when I'm wrong. If someone accuses me of harmful behaviors or arguments (racism, sexism, defending bad behavior, whatever), I think hard about what they've said and, if I agree with them, do better going forward.

However, when I *don't* agree with what they've said, I have a really hard time letting it go. For example, I recently made some fanart of fantasy characters, and I was accused by another user of whitewashing one of the characters in a context when I don't think whitewashing necessarily applies (the characters have racial categories different from real-world ones). Rationally I can understand that it's okay for us to disagree about this, and it really doesn't matter what some random person online thinks of me, but I have a hard time shaking it off emotionally. I feel like I've been unfairly accused of something I haven't done, which is particularly frustrating when I do think so hard about things I post.

How do I care less about things like this? How do I brush off people I think are being unreasonable or unnecessarily confrontational?",08May2020,1
227,"So, just as a little background, this neighbor is creepy. She stares into my house just because, and I made a mildly infuriating post about her open driveway but hogging all the street. But now she has gone too far. 

I usually go to school every day, but since this lockdown started, I've been home. I have been at relative's houses every day, but yesterday I was home alone for the first time of this lockdown. I have had my kittens for about 6 months now, and one was sleeping next to me while I was doing school. I then saw my neighbor come over to my window, knock loudly multiple times, and yell kitty kitty kitty! I looked straight at her, and she ran as fast as she could back to her house.

I told my parents, who decided this would be a good time to extend and replace our old fence. That neighbor was the only one who didn't agree to it. I think she may have been doing this the 6 months we've had them, and I want my kittens to be able to sleep in peace. Does anyone have any advice I could use to stop my kittens from being disturbed.

So, i[18] met a guy[20] on reddit, and we have been talking since a month. I feel like i have really strong feelings for him. Well the problem is that i have not seen him and neither has he. I really love his vibes when he texts. I have already told him i really really like him. He was really happy (as it seemed through his texts) and he actually said he likes me alot as well even though we dont know each other much. But the problem is that we dont have things in common. We talk and love the conversations but sometimes i run out of topics to talk about. I really want to get closer to him but i dont wanna give too much info like my face and number. I dont want to escalate things alot but at the same time i want him to put more efforts. Today i confronted him that he doesnt put much efforts in the convo ( but he says he misses me alot) but i feel like he really likes me. He told me maybe thats his nature. Im really okay with however his nature is. But i dont know how to get closer to him? like having better relation as friends and then try to escalate things after a few months? pls any type of suggestions or advice will be helpful.

When I (15F) was between the ages of 7 and 13, my brother usher to s*xually abuse me. When it first started, I had no clue it was wrong. I just thought it was playfighting since it hurt. It got worse as I got older. He would force me to give him oral, he would grope me, and he left hickeys, cuts and bruises that I had to hide. It hasn’t happened in two years, and I know I’m safe from him now because I can both defend myself and he has been taught boundaries that his autism prevented him from understanding before. I opened up to a friend of mine, telling him what happened to me. He told his mother, who sent an email to the school. They then called social services and the police. I’ve dealt with socials in the past for unrelated reasons, so having them in my life again is frustrating in itself.

232,"How can i tell if someone is toxic or not or if I’m just being over dramatic? It’s been years that I’ve questioned our friendship. Years of her doing things that friends shouldn’t say to the other. Most of the time, I find out from my mom just how she really is as a person because her mom is always on the phone with mine. Calling me dumb while my mom is on the phone with hers. Getting upset for buying myself an expensive prom dress. She used to call me “dumbass” as a nickname, and that wasn’t even behind my back- that was just straight to my face. And when i confronted her, she just called it me being “butthurt”. Me sleeping over at her house, her room being freezing cold, then her and her mom share a warm comforter while they toss me a bed sheet. I don’t know why i still hung out with her. She has always had this subconscious way of talking and acting and living as if she is better than me. Both my mom and I feel it. She has to be the prettier one, she has to be the smarter one, she has to be this and that and i just be the one in the back supporting her. This friend is graduating high school, so my mom drove up to their place to give her her grad gift. No “thank you’s”, no “i love it”, no nothing. Her mom did say “She doesn’t like black and white, she likes pink better”. And my mom left with no thank you’s. 
I keep wondering, and my mind is so conflicted, on whether or not its just me being sensitive, me having commitment issues, or if she is actually a toxic person and the way i feel about her is valid. It’s not even just me, my mom usually is the one to bring up how messed up her and her mom are. And that reassures me. But still, Ive never really had that many friends, so i dont know what a real friend is supposed to act. I even left her for 2 months back in September because i wanted to cut her off. I came back after 2 months because my grandma was getting sick and i didnt want things to be messy if she ever had to come to a funeral. But ever since i came back, things have been so weird. She treats me like normal i guess, which makes me feel even guiltier about leaving. I ask myself if i had overreacted, and if she actually does care about me? I dont fuckin know. It’s so confusing. She always prides herself on being kind and good at giving advice, and wow she even talked someone down from suicide according to her... That is amazing. Wow. Good. Where is all of this kindness and good heart and advice giving when you are aware of my awful mental health issues, my anxiety, me staying in the hospital for a week straight to take care of my dying grandmother, etc??
I just dont know if i’m actually crazy or if she’s actually toxic. What even is the meaning of toxic?? Idk man.

236," This will probably turn into a rant, I'm just so angry and scared and frustrated right now, and this has been a long time coming. I'll try to make a TL;DR.

I'm dating a woman I know I'm going to marry. We've been dating for 2 and a half years, and we've just always got along, everything's always just felt...right. She's the most amazing person I've ever met, and she has the kindest heart I've ever seen. Even my parents approved after meeting her, despite the fact that neither initially approved of our 3 and a half year age gap, and my mother took issue (before we even thought of dating) when she heard from a friend that she is bisexual (long story about who knows who, not important). And my girlfriend and I have broached every topic, from moving in together, to marriage, to kids, to pets. The only one that kind of scared one of us was the pets one, because I never had one growing up and so harbored a bit of a fear of dogs until I met hers, and I'm still a little unsure of dogs I don't know. I'm definitely willing to work through that for her! Everything was going swimmingly until we stopped being able to see each other 2 months ago because of this shitshow going on right now. She has anxiety, and I have gastrointestinal issues to do with stress, so not seeing each other has led to panic attacks for her, and me feeling almost constantly nauseous and barely being able to sleep. I have finally been granted permission to see her from both sets of parents, but the police in my town have been checking plates to make sure people weren't having parties. Great, so I bike, and get caught in the rain or just can't go because of piss-poor weather half the time. And her parents don't care if we go for walks, but I'm not allowed in the door and we have to keep to the 2m distance. Anyway, our states have sort of improved, right up until as little as the next day sometimes, but it's still improvement in the eyes of my parents.

So I live near a certain well-known city in Québec. You know, the city with the most coronavirus cases in Canada. I don't understand how our government say they're reopening elementary schools, you know, where kids spend one half of their day with their fingers shoved deep up their nose and the other with their fingers shoved in their mouths, then, in the next breath, they say ""gatherings are still illegal"". Explain to me how you think forcing me to go to my shitty cheap-shit retail job with all the randos that come in and touch everything, but I can't get together with family (\*ahem\*, my girlfriend) I haven't seen for 2 months, who I know and trust to 1. not show up (or tell me not to come in the case of my girlfriend) if they're sick, and 2. keep themselves clean enough and distance from others enough not to get themselves, and then me, sick. And if ever I comment that on an article, I get people either saying ""too bad for you, poor baby"" or ""move the fuck out"". Anyway, if I don't stop there, I'm never going to stop ranting, back to the point.

As much as I bothered my parents about it, at the beginning it was ""oh my God what's wrong with you? This codependence isn't healthy"" (to which I have to say, my parents haven't spent much more than a week apart at a time in over 22 years, they have no idea what it's like to only see each other once in a while to begin with, then not at all) also, anyone who says any variation of that has no idea what it's like to not have everything with them to weather the storm, and with health issues to boot. They're cushy in a nice house with the SO and possibly kids and pets, and they don't need anything else besides food. Or they're total loners and content to live isolated from everyone in a shack in the woods with their dog. My mother's next argument was ""FaceTime, it's exactly the same!"" (nope, no it's not!), or ""people are dying \*alone\* in all these care facilities, palliative care blah blah blah"" (whenever I made my mother's FaceTime remark back to her, she gets so angry. But these people got screwed by the government and their budgets before I even had the right to vote, I can't change that. I \*can\* prepare for my own future. I can also get hit by a car tomorrow and nobody will have seen me for 2 months. Or I could get run over by a steamroller at work, nobody will have seen me in 2 months. That argument is completely invalid).

Now that they've let me go see her, it's ""if you don't like getting caught in the rain, take your car!"" (my mother also doesn't like when I say that if I she says my only option is to take the car, I'll forward her the tickets), and if I ask for a better solution, I get ""she can take the bus!"" (no, they barely run at the best of times, hours have been reduced now. And it's $5 for a 20-minute ride. Also, I would not go on public transit right now). My girlfriend doesn't drive yet and never learned how to ride a bike, so either way, I'm the one who has to go out. SO, since my mom always says she's ""like another daughter to \[her\]"" and that she's ""welcome any time"" and that my mother ""always just makes a little extra for supper in case"", I figured I could suggest she stay with us for the time being. Boy, that was a screaming match and a half... Even when I suggested that we could do our own laundry and I'd pay for her to be there (for food and shit). Her father is not even super comfortable with us seeing each other because of all of this, so that suggestion at her house, or any variation, would go nowhere either. She also lives with constant offhand comments by her father and stepmother that vary from making her uncomfortable to making her cry as soon as she opens up and talks about them on a call at night. I live with my parents being completely unsympathetic, and as soon as I open my mouth, there's a screaming match. My little sister has a snooty attitude and looks for fights, then goes crying to mommy when she finds one (and guess who gets yelled at?) and my little brother just tries to avoid conflict, which is rife between everyone and I and everyone and my sister, so he's pretty quiet.

So now to the title of the post, a friend told my girlfriend and I that she received a message from her college saying the fall semester will be all online, and school will be closed. I din't tell my girlfriend, because I know she's not sleeping well and is worried as is, but now that's got me worried that we're still not going to have our rights back come the fall. And then I can't bike over, and school makes us both feel like shit. We've talked about moving out, but we both have shitty minimum wage jobs and barely any savings, even though we've both been saving since we started working. We're also both students, and I will be for another 2-3 years of university, unless I decide to do a masters, as my teachers suggest, which would take another year at least. She's got college to finish, then she has a bachelors and she needs a masters to be taken seriously in her field, so she has a while, too. We also have to stay close to where she currently lives so she can continue working part time since she doesn't drive, and I'm not sure I'd be able to drive her all the time. I also don't want to rent out a hole for much more than it's worth (or at all, really; I'd rather own it, however small, I've heard too many horror stories of shitty landlords), but I have no idea if we have enough for a down payment or even enough income to be able to pay off a mortgage. There's also both our university, which should add up to about $1500 each per semester, and her driving school, for which she's stuck in limbo right now. We both have atmospheres at home that we are completely done with and want to move on and try to make it work, but we don't want to both end up in mom and dad's basement with no money 6 months from now. We're both stuck: we want to get out of our home environment and get into an environment that includes each other, but we're both broke. And I did an excessively rough budget, finding that we'd be $7000 in the hole after our first year with our salaries. If I get the other job, we're in the clear by $1000. Note the difference in salary. I only calculated for myself, as I know she makes slightly less than me, but that doesn't change much if we're still both $3500 under. If I get the other job, it might be realistic if we split things well enough. I'm torn between wanting this a lot, but not having the resources or knowledge of how anything works (mortgages, down payments, landlords, etc.) to get it.

\*TL;DR\* (sorry, the end's the same as the end of the last paragraph): we both have shitty part time jobs that laugh in our faces (I'm hoping to get a better job at the end of an internship this summer, but I'm not counting on it; I refuse to get my hopes up to then get disappointed), she doesn't drive, so we need to stay near her work. I don't want to rent because of horror stories I've heard of landlords, but I have no idea if we can even put a down payment on a less expensive (and much smaller) place we could find, or if our income would even start to pay off a mortgage. We also have university to pay, and driving school for her. We both have atmospheres at home that we are completely done with and want to move on and try to make it work, but we don't want to both end up in mom and dad's basement with no money 6 months from now.

How did I get a brain that makes me lonely in a crowd of people. I just want a real connection with somebody, whether that be me getting a girlfriend or just a really close friend, it would be great. I feel like I can’t have a meaningful conversation with anybody. I have friends, and close friends at that, but I don’t really get emotional fulfillment from hanging out with them. I had a real connection with a girl two years ago, but I got rejected. And really we were good friends anyway.",08May2020,1
241,So I’m in high school and if you don’t know me you’d generally probably think I’m quiet or reserved. I don’t date and I don’t really go after guys just because I’m awkward and not rlly interested in dating atm. Earlier this year I developed a crush on a guy I’d never even spoken to but had heard of so I knew who he was. I followed him on Instagram and added him on Snapchat. One day I finally got the courage to message him so I did. Long story short I had no idea he was in a relationship and he responded to me with a picture of him and his girlfriend (who I also go to school with) he unfollowed and unadded me and I’m so afraid to go back to school in the fall this is literally driving me insane I feel like an awful person and I’m so embarrassed. It’s all I think about all the time and it’s ruining my life tbh. I just feel like a total idiot.,08May2020,1

I don’t know if that’s it or if I’m just scared and don’t have confidence in myself that I can do that as a job.

248,"!WARNING LONG POST!
let me start with some background:
my sisters &amp; i suspected my mom was doing something shady for years, but i personally never confronted her because i had no strong evidence. i would occasionally see her messaging someone and sending hearts, covering her phone, etc. i was very young when i began seeing this, but my sisters were both in high school so they understood what was going on way more than i did. 

my dad also suspected something and would even argue with her for hours about it. she didn’t tell him where she worked, what time her job closed, or any other basic information that i believe a couple that’s been together for 20+ years should know about each other. she would manipulate him and put thoughts into his head that led him to believe he was crazy. about 4 years ago, they had a very rough period and my dad was eventually diagnosed with depression. my sisters believed my mom’s unfaithfulness to be one of the causes of his sadness and stress.

i didn’t know this until about a couple of days ago, but my sisters have previously confronted her about this multiple times. all of those times, she denied it and continued making them think they were crazy &amp; delusional. i knew what was going on to an extent but i never knew it was this bad. it impacted my sisters’ relationship with my mom in a big way but they decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. they stopped questioning it because they also didn’t have any hard evidence against her and it eventually passed.

my mom’s family also knows about this. my sisters discuss it with my uncle any time they feel that he should know about something. my grandma has mentioned before that my mom was very manipulative in her teenage years, and her siblings have mentioned that they wouldn’t be surprised if she did something absolutely crazy one day. 


now onto present day:
about a week ago, my friends and i were texting in our groupchat that we have on snapchat. we’re teenagers in high school so obviously there’s scandal everywhere around us. my friend sent a post from a snapchat account’s story and told us to look at it saying how it was so gross. depending on what settings the snapchat account owner has on for their account, sometimes people who don’t have them added can’t view their story. in this case, you had to have them added to see what they posted. i added the account because i didn’t think it was something too bad. i presumed it was one of those accounts that posted fighting videos (something like worldstar). once the user added me back, i could view what was on it. the user was posting a bunch of pictures, videos, and snapchats of random girls across the city and exposing them for being “hoes.” the account would specifically post pictures in the following order: the snapchat account and username of the girl, a selfie of her so everyone could see how she looks, then they would proceed to post nudes/videos of them. the post that my friend sent was a random girl and we all sort of ignored it. 

later on, i was in my room with my sister and my dad looking at baby pictures of us (very ironic). i went on my phone and opened up snapchat, and i went to go look at people’s stories. as i was tapping through them, i came upon the exposing girls snapchat account and was quickly skipping through it because that’s not something i would want to see. as i was skipping through, i saw a picture of my mom.

at this point, i froze and i didn’t know what to do. i had to go back and see if it was actually her, and they had it all. her snapchat account was posted, and a selfie of her too. after this was a video of her clearly cheating on my dad with someone else. the man wasn’t in the frame so i couldn’t identify who it was, but i definitely knew it was my mom. the woman in the video had the same hair, makeup, watch, &amp; tattoo as my mom. basically, i knew that this was her for sure. i went back to the groupchat of me and my friends and i told them to quickly unadd the account because i didn’t want them to see it. NOTE: i have posted my mom before &amp; also sent “funny” videos of her to my friends so they all know how she looks. when i was looking through the messages, i saw that one of my friends had already discovered the post. she sent it to the groupchat and said “omg this looks exactly like your mom LMAO,” and she laughed because she simply thought it was someone who looked like her. i typed and told her to delete the message ASAP and she did. i later told them what was going on, and luckily i have friends who won’t judge me or look at me differently even after finding this out. i know i can trust them. they took it very well and were there for me throughout the entire situation. i still apologized to them for having to see that especially because it’s so embarrassing. i think anyone would be ashamed of having to find out through their friends that their mom is cheating, and especially that they had to see something so gross and explicit as that. 

i quickly threw my phone down and as soon as i did this, my dad got a call saying that the pizza we had ordered was outside. my sister &amp; i went to go get it and as we were outside i told her that i needed to show her something. i was shaking and clearly did not want to talk about what was going on because it was so utterly disgusting and i felt embarrassed. we left the pizza on the kitchen table and went upstairs to my room, locking the door behind us. i explained everything to her and she gave me a serious look, followed by asking me to see the video. i showed her and we both looked at each other in disbelief. she told me to screen record it just so we had evidence of what she was doing. as soon as i did, she immediately called my uncle to talk to him about it. as she was explaining it to him, my other sister got home and knocked on my door. at this point, i was bawling my eyes out and she demanded to know what was going on. she was very confused but we told her everything as soon as my sister got off the phone with my uncle. after we finished telling her, i could tell that she was raging inside. she had a built up anger against my mom for this specific reason and she didn’t believe that she would do it again, at least not to this extent. as we were talking, we decided that we needed to confront my mom that night so she didn’t have time to think about different scenarios or excuses. 

it was around 10 pm when she arrived home from work, and my dad was in the kitchen happily waiting for her to arrive. he even waited until she got home to eat himself &amp; he hadn’t eaten all day. as soon as she got home, he jumped out of his seat to serve her food and give her whatever she wanted. this small gesture made me so angry especially after knowing what she was doing. i tried containing myself because i knew that if my dad suspected something and he found out right then and there, it would be a complete mess for all of us. we were most focused on my dads mental state and how he would feel if we were to tell him or if he were to find out himself. we decided that that night was not the night to break the news to him, so we waited until he went to bed to talk to my mom alone. 

my sister’s boyfriend was also at our house at the time, so we couldn’t just talk about it in the living room. we decided to tell my mom that we had to “tell her something” and take her to talk outside in the car. she agreed and we all got into my sister’s car. as soon as we got in there, we started telling her things like “please just admit what you’re doing, we already have proof. there’s no need to lie at this point.” she put on a nervous voice and kept asking us what we were talking about, so my sisters decided to show her what we found. my mom looked at it and was completely silent. then shortly after, she had the audacity to deny that it was her in the video. she had no place to do this especially since IT WAS CLEARLY HER. my sisters &amp; i looked at each other in astonishment and didn’t even know what to say. my sisters laughed and my mom sat there expressionless. my sister began yelling at her and shaming her. one very important thing i noticed was that as my sister was doing this, my mom didn’t yell back. if these accusations were false, my mom would have been screaming at the top of her lungs at my sister for disrespecting her and accusing her of such a thing. but my mom was completely silent. i knew she was silent because she knew that she was guilty. my sisters kept giving it to her, and eventually i wanted to say my part. 

i had to explain to my mother that my own friends saw this video and that they were the ones who notified me about it. i also told her that they knew how she looked, and so do thousands of people now. accounts like that do not just receive a couple hundred views, they receive thousands, from people all over the city. i asked her how she would feel if one of our family members such as a cousin or an aunt saw that. my family is filled with teenagers, and especially boys who are very prone to seeing things like this every day. she simply did. not. care. i also told her how this can impact my future and my reputation being at a new school with new people. my sisters pointed out how hard i’ve worked to get into the school that i’m in and how she was basically ignoring all of that because she didn’t seem to think about the consequences her actions would have on us. we talked about what my dad would think and how he would have to deal with it especially with his depression. she didn’t shed a single tear when we explained how we felt to her and she didn’t seem to care about what her reputation was now either. i tried getting her to see what she was doing but she wouldn’t budge. i said things such as “how do you wake up in the morning sleeping next to the man who gave you everything, knowing that you’re cheating on him?” and she wouldn’t say anything. 

my father gave my mom everything. he provides for her everyday and is the one that pays the bills, mortgage, everything. he buys her expensive gifts and jewelry, he gives her anything and everything that she asks for and treats her like a queen, and she still has the courage to go out and do things like this to him. she doesn’t even wear her engagement ring anymore, claiming that she can’t wear it to work when she wears rings every single day. 

anyways, we continued bringing up different points with her during the confrontation but she did not do a thing. we got tired of her and eventually she got out of the car because she said she needed rest. when she got back in the house, my sister turned to us and pointed out that it was awfully late and it was suspicious that she was coming home at around 10 pm. she looked up the name of my mom’s job and it closes at 7 pm. it’s a one hour commute to and from her job. her job is also closed on saturday’s and sunday’s, and earlier in the day when we were eating sinner, she had mentioned to my dad that her manager asked her to work on saturday that weekend. my sisters and i didn’t know that it was closed these days, so after finding this out it made us even more angry especially since she had spent countless hours on saturday’s being somewhere else while making us think she was working 13 hour shifts. 

ever since, my sisters and i have been purposely ignoring my mom and trying to spend time with our dad as much as possible.

after all of this, we talked to my uncle and eventually my aunt about everything, trying to figure out how we should deal with the situation and seeking advice. how do we tell our dad without it putting a large strain on his mental health? are we being too harsh on our mom? what would you do if this happened to you? what should we do?",08May2020,1
249,"I have a flatmate whose room is right next to my room. He has clothes hanging clips attached to his door and because of those the door is making a loud banging sound when it is opened and a little less loud banging sound but loud enough to disturb my sleep at night. 
He is intentionally opening and closing the door several times after midnight in order to hurt my sleep because one night at 1am I was woken up by his activities and got so frustrated that I wrote a rude message to him. I wrote a rude message subconsciously because I don’t like this guy for he is not cooperating in keeping the common areas in the apartment clean, among other reasons.
My message was : First and final request -
Fix your room’s door! Either you’re deaf that you can’t hear the banging sound your door makes or you know it and are knowingly not fixing it. The least I can expect is to be considerate to others. So, next time when my sleep is disturbed by loud bang of your door opening and closing, I’ll be forced to inform the owner.

To this he replied : Really ? Thanks bro for letting me know whats on your mind at 1 in morning I got your point loud and clear Could have been great if it was polite and gentle . We are here to live with peace , first of peace out. Secondly, I''ve no intention to ruin your priceless sleep hope the same goes for you ! So sleep and let sleep. Chill.
After these there were few more exchange of messages. From this point on, he didn’t do anything to fix the door, instead he is deliberately moving in and out of his room at night to cause me anger and frustation.

What should I do to stop him? Should I return him the taste of his medicine by doing the same (and sacrificing me sleep in the process)? I’ve informed the owner about the problem and he can do nothing. I can vacate the room in two months but I can’t tolerate this much longer. Please I need a good advice.",08May2020,1

I expected it to be honest because I've failed every class that I've this year (I'm a first year student). I was actually doing really well my second semester but after covid-19 happened I was forced to study and do my exams in my extremely toxic home environment. So any chance of doing well was basically gone.

I've had a really rough year this year. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety which didn't go over well with the family, and part of the reason why I'm depressed is because of them. My parents are against medication for things like depression and anxiety because they ""change your personality"" so I was never able to take meds. My parents are going through a really nasty divorce and there's always fighting in the house. My dad is a real piece of shit who's essentially been draining all of our money and cheating on my mom every chance he gets. He blames their problems on me and has been verbally abusing me every chance he gets. My grandma's been diagnosed with the most aggressive form of lung cancer there is and doesn't have much longer to live, and my mom can't be with her because of covid-19. She's really stressed and upset and if I tell her what's going on I think I'd break her. Everything's been going downhill and somehow I can't help but feel like it's my fault.

I'm so upset with myself because I know I should've tried harder and pushed past everything that was going on and just studied. At this point I don't even know what to do anymore. I wrote this post because I have absolutely no one to talk to. I don't know what to do with myself.

I have dual-credit classes (Basically college-level courses but in high school) and I tell her I have trouble sleeping all the time. She keeps waking me up at night to do laundry at 2 am and I keep telling her that I need to sleep to keep up with these classes. I don't know how many times I've had days when I'm just so tired from sleep deprivation, I'd just skip school some days. She still keeps doing that though and slamming my door and turning on my lights at 1-2 in the morning. Every time I confront her about it she keeps misconstruing me trying to get my sleep as ""attitude"". Then she gets mad for at least 3 days about it. This has been going on all throughout high school.  She also gives me very bad advice and she gets mad if I don't do them. Like for example, she tells me that I don't need deodorant, rubbing alcohol is better. She gives me the same response to everything that I confront her about, saying that I'm ungrateful and that I don't love her. She makes it so hard for me to talk to her. I can't ask for a screwdriver without her losing her temper for 5 minutes. At one time I was sad and I just wanted to talk to her about my feelings. That I was trying to keep up with my grades but it's hard and just so many other things that I don't share with her about because I knew she would just freak out. But I gave it a shot for just this one time and I sat down and talked to her and she just tells me that I'm not doing my best for her because I'm sad and that she can't work if I'm like this so I should deal with it.

The military pays for you to live off base so they can get room for more newcomers. With my group of friends of 4 (including me) I made a deal to move out with 2 of them(let’s call them “A” and “B”) So three of us would be roommates together. The last guy already had plans to move out with another roommate(I’ll call him “C”) In order to move off base you need to get on a waitlist and once your turn is up, you get the pay increase and about a month to move out. “A” and “C” have been on the waitlist for a while and their turn to move out is now. But I only recently put myself on the waitlist meaning about another month until I can get the bonus pay. I would be able to move out too but since my turn isn’t up I won’t get the pay increase (rent still wouldn’t be a problem since we split it) “C”s plans to move out got cancelled and he got accepted to move out with us without my knowing and all of a sudden “AB and C” are moving out together and I’m left in the dust. Since renting among 4 people is hard to do only 3 of us can realistically find a place together and since I’m technically getting the pay increase last I got shoved to the side slowly.

268,"So, a bit of a backstory to this fuck up. I started crushing on this girl in my class a few weeks before the Big Q and we all got trapped inside. We sat next to each other for a few weeks and we got along well enough that I thought maybe she liked me or was considering me or some shit (looking back she was probably just being nice to me, and I was just interpreting our conversations WAY to optimistically, and projecting some kind of ideal of what was really happening which was probably just her being nice or wanting someone to talk to so she wasn’t bored). 
*Btw it’s not like we even knew each other that well. We only had first period together, and I didn’t even talk to her or notice her before we got sat together. I usually just sat by/talked to my friends and got through class. So when we sat next to each other and I talked to her and realized, “damn, this girl is hot!”, I starting crushing on her. I was excited to see her in class and shit, and I’m fairly confident but I didn’t really go out of my way to start conversations with her because, get ready for the bullshit I came up with to justify this, the boring-ass class was either “too quiet” and I was either too nervous or couldn’t come up with anything to start talking to her about, or the teacher would always be talking and I wouldn’t get a chance anyways. This didn’t happen 100% of the time, I mean the last time we talked she tried talking to me about something that I guess made me laugh (that was one of those things that made me think maybe she liked me, cause she went out of her way to talk to me, which normally never happened so of course like a fucking idiot I read into that shit). 

Fast forward and at this point it’s been a couple MONTHS since school ended due to covid and I actually got to see her in person or even talk to her. I’ve never been into social media, and on Instagram I’ve got less than 100 followers/following less than 100 people, and I have no posts. I’ve just never viewed it as important, I mean I just use it to text friends and send stupid, stale memes. I mainly try to live my life outside of social media anyways. 
This is relevant because the girl that I liked has over 1,000 followers and is following, like, 5,000 accounts. It’s pretty fucking intimidating and I guess I’m afraid she might think I’m weird or socially awkward or something. 

Anyways I’d been thinking about this girl, going through the standard motions of a crush and shit, but I didn’t think I should contact her. I figured I would just wait. That was back before they pushed quarantine back further and school got cancelled. One of my friends followed her and I’m really not proud to say this, but I may as well just fucking admit that I stalked her Instagram account. I never did anything but look her up, glance at her pictures and fucking regret it for being so god damned weak willed about it. I realize this is some creepy shit, and because a lot of people do it I know people might say it isn’t, but to me it definitely is, and I really, REALLY regret giving in to that. 

Let me stress that I would have done this if I could have seen her in person. My plan was to ask her for her number in person. If school was still happening, I definitely would not have felt the need to reach out to her like that, but I guess that’s what lockdown did to my brain. 

I realize it’s been a wall of text so far, and thanks for those who gave even the slightest shit about what I’ve said so far, because you really don’t have to, but I think I just want to get this off my chest so I can move on. I don’t get how reddit will fucking help but what the hell. 

Here’s the part where I’m 99% sure I fucked up and made a mistake. I was hanging out with that same friend a couple days ago, and I just decided that I would follow her, at like, 10:30 at night. Surprisingly she did follow me back a couple minutes later. I texted her hey (about the smoothest thing I could come up with. It’s a pretty shitty opener, but I’d literally never tried to dm a girl before lmao it was bound to fail). A few minutes later she texts heyy, and I over analyze the shit out of that extra y (btw I looked it up after and it means ‘I’m somewhat interested in what your doing’, but I should’ve known this shit for a high schooler). Again, wait a few minutes and I send how’ve you been (keep in mind that I’m asking my friend through this whole thing what I should say). She says she’s been good and asks me how I’ve been, and I tell her I’ve been bored (also, probably a shitty response, but not wrong). She texts samee (with the two e’s, I didn’t bother trying to decipher that shit so don’t ask me, IMO it was probably a typo). I was feeling kind of good and my friend told me that I should ask for her snap, and that’s where I fucked up I think. I never use Snapchat and have a hella low score (like below 50), I’m not even sure why I still have it tbh. I asked my friend how I should ask, and I told him how low my score was and he told me to say that I just got it so it wouldn’t be as weird (a lie, and I literally said that at the time, but I guess I was being fucking stupid). So I sent her this, after like 3 messages, “So I just downloaded snap, you got one?”. Me and my fucking friend put our heads together and came up with that terrible, stupid line I guess I thought was smooth or some shit. Hindsight is best sight, because I realize now that makes me seem like a loser lmao. After this she never texted me back, never even opened the message, and it’s been a few days. I’m pretty fucking certain this message killed it (not that the conversation before this was good or anything, I just figured it was a start at least). 

I don’t really know what to do now. I haven’t sent anything as a follow up and I don’t plan on it. I feel like if I do I will make things worse, there’s just no recovering from that. My question is, does it really matter? Texting is just so much different than talking in real life I always feel like I fuck it up. I’m just not good at it. I don’t expect any kind of fucking epiphany to come out of this post, I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. Maybe some advice on how to just not care/move on? Any chance that because she hasn’t opened it because she genuinely hasn’t seen it yet? (Very doubtful though, because it’s been way too long IMO, especially for someone who seems to be on social media a lot. I guess to be fair she probably gets a lot of dms and I’m just simply not priority). Is she worth continuing to like? Should I text her again or not? Does it even matter what happens over text instead of actually talking to her?",08May2020,1
269,"I’m 22 years old and I’m currently living with my parents. For the past 4 years we had been dealing with my older brother having cancer. He relapsed once and he died almost a year ago. The first time he was hospitalized my dad suggested I take a semester off of school to help take care of my little brother and just be of use at home. I did. Because of this, I dropped pre-medicine and decided I would do a post baccalaureate after college so I could help my family as much as I can. I ended up graduating on time. For a few semesters I had to deal with my parents being out of state while they sought care in another state. This meant I had to take and pick up my little brother from school, help my dad with his work (writing proposals/invoices for him) and cook for me and my little brother all while being a full time student.

I have had depression officially for three years now, and before I was diagnosed, I had tried to kill myself three times, most recently a couple months ago. I went into therapy a couple years ago and it was amazing until my mom said we couldn’t afford it anymore (this is a lie) and has since made me stop. 

Ever since I started dating a (wonderful, amazing) black man, they have treated me different. They have called me a slut, a useless idiot, and more. They have called my boyfriend (not to his face) much much worse. I have defended him every step of the way and have tried to get them to understand that they’re being disgusting and racist but they won’t change. This behavior fizzles out every once in a while, but it always culminates into a huge fight after not very long. I’ve started to withdraw more and more every time until I got to the point that I didn’t respond to them when they would try to argue, and I stopped crying and instead have become stone faced. I guess I’ve just given up. 

3 weeks ago I had a bit of a breakdown at home after one of these arguments and I just wanted to end it. But I thought of my lovely little brother and my amazing boyfriend and decided I couldn’t do that to them. I decided I would stay with my boyfriend for a few days instead. So I left immediately in the middle of the night and had been staying with him until this morning. It was amazing and I haven’t felt so good in so long. He had been paying for everything so I felt like a huge burden so I came back today. My father told me that I’m not his daughter anymore and he told my little brother that he wishes my older (dead) brother were here instead. I tried to tell them how I felt and they would not listen. 

I am doing my post bacc now and still rely on my parents for everything. They don’t want me to work, and between shadowing, research, and school, I really don’t have the time. Now that the semester is over I’m thinking of just getting a job in a supermarket because my other job searches for my major haven’t worked out. After, i hope to transition into a job in my career while I continue my studies. I am going to get loans for my next semester for tuition but I can’t pay for my car insurance, phone, and the very expensive rent in my city, with that kind of salary. 

Sorry this is so long, I feel like I’m at the end of my rope and I have broken down several times today. I’m just looking for a little guidance. Thank you",08May2020,1

271,"I grew up with the idea that family is always first. But for me, it’s always been tough since I’m usually the punching bag for my mom and sister. Throughout my childhood, my younger sister (3 years difference) and my mom have always been a team. They’re closer to each other than I am. I’ve always tried to keep my distance as best as I can since usually they would make comments about me that would make me uncomfortable. Those comments would usually be about my weight, how I dress, taking my life seriously, etc. I admit, I am a little overweight and I’m trying to lose some of it. I prefer to dress in comfort (usually it’s t-shirts and leggings) over showing skin. I’m currently a junior in college and had a rough time in my first two years because I got pushed into a field that required math (something I’m not good at) and never really branched out to find what I’m good at. This school year, I broke up with my ex boyfriend of 5 years and started dating someone new. My current boyfriend never made me feel like I was stupid, tries to always remind me that worth it, and says that I can never be replaced. I also realized that some of my friends were more like family to me than my actual family. When I’m with my friends or boyfriend, I never felt like I was being beaten down or anything like that. Instead, I would feel like I belong and that I actually deserve the happiness I was getting. Whenever I’m wrong, they would correct me and didn’t make me feel awful about it. When I’m with my mom and sister, they’ll always talk bad about me behind my back and in front of my face. I always felt sad or tried to shrug it off as if I didn’t care because anything I said, they would always team up together to break me down. My mom recently told me that I put my friends in front of family. The only reason why I try to spend my free time with my friends or boyfriend is because I never felt awful with them. My mom thinks that I only prioritize my friends over my family but I don’t know how to explain why I do to my mom or sister whats going through my mind because I know they don’t get it or understand from my point of view. I lack a lot of self esteem and never have confidence in myself. Quarantine has made me feel trapped with no escape since I’m home all day with them. I usually just lock myself in my room and FaceTime my friends or boyfriend to try and stay sane. Often in doing so, I would hear them talk about how I’m always spending my free time talking to my friends or boyfriend instead of spending time with my mom and sister. One of my family members who is close in age with me has told me that my environment at home is toxic and that they don’t understand that what their doing is just driving me away more. Not every moment with my mom and sister is terrible, there are just a lot more negative moments than positive ones. Is there anyway for me to have this conversation with my mom without her having to turn this on me (sort of blaming me)? Is there any advice anyone can give me on how I can handle this situation?",08May2020,1
272,"Hi there,
I am hoping someone can give me some advice here as I am at a loss right now. *it's a long one*

Let me just break down first the events that have led to me to resent the person I call Mum.

- for as long as I can remember my mother has been cheating on my Dad, numerous times with many different guys. Dad had to basically raise us girls alone. 
- when I was about 9 she 'broke up' with one of her side things and he didn't handle it well. This resulted in him coming at me and my sisters, tried to enter our home, and I had to slam his arm in the door to prevent him getting in (this haunts me to this day). Unfortunately my Dad was at work when this happened. Mum lied to Dad about the circumstances of this incident and we were to scared to speak up. 
- on NYE we received a call from her latest lover who advised they have been having an affair for 11 YEARS. This was a guy we had all met at different points as she brought him into our lives. (under the guise he was a work friend) 
- Mum was sucking money out of both my Dad and this other guy (she didn't work nor look for work). While she went on to sleep and date other guys as well constantly. 
- Mum threatened suicide on New Year's day and so Dad rushed home to stop her. After he helped calm her down she had the audacity to ask Dad if it was okay if she went to queensland to see her NEW BOYFRIEND!! Literally a day after Dad found out she had been lying for 11 years. 
- My parents are FINALLY divorcing thank heck!! (don't know why Dad didn't do this earlier) 

There is so much more to this but I would need to write out 20 chapters worth.

What I need advice on is how I can move past all the betrayal and lies? My older sisters seem to be coping much better and are able to let Mum into their lives like before but I can't seem to forgive her. I can't stand the thought of speaking to her and I fear if I don't move on I will be the one isolated from family events as they all can move on but me (recently missed out on a family call because she was included and I couldn't bring myself to speak to her). 
Any advice would be amazing! I hate my Mum but I don't want to fracture the relationship with my sisters and Dad because of my hate for her.",08May2020,1

277,"Without getting too into it, in the past year or so (about the same amount of time we've been living together), our sex life has taken a significant hit. We used to have a really active and exciting sex life, but lately we haven't been clicking. When I make advances, I repeatedly get turned down. She never initiates like she used to frequently. I used to describe our sex life to others as the best it's ever been. But now it's nonexistent. 

She's a very reasonable woman who is open to talking about any of our problems, but this issue seems to be the one that gets the weirdest response. Usually we have constructive discussions that result in solutions we are both happy with. But for whatever reason, this conversation is a difficult one. I do my best to be considerate with how I approach it, and often have an okay time out of the gate, but then we get into her insecurities and how that triggers a cyclical pattern where she doesn't feel confident in her body or her ability to perform, and so on. Then she places blame on herself and kinda beats herself up for 'not being able to please her partner' essentially. Which is actually incorrect (which I've shared with her). I still believe the sex we have is definitely the best its ever been... when we \*do\* have sex.

I try to have her understand that she shouldn't carry that burden because it's too heavy, it's unfair, and  again it's just incorrect. She says she feels bad, but can't physically bring herself to have sex when she's not emotionally or physically into it, which I definitely understand. I never persist, because consent, of course.

Again, we have a very healthy line of communication between us. We can talk about anything and everything. I tell her things I've never told anyone before and she shares her privacies with me. We always figure out our problems together, but is it unreasonable of me to ask her if I can have her permission to have sex with another woman? We've had discussions in the past about infidelity, threesomes, swinging, and have shared our fantasies, so I think she'd hear me out, but what if I'm wrong? What if it makes her feel worse about herself, our relationship, etc?

281," I hope this post is ok, since this isn’t about one specific incident, though it definitely has its exigence, if not I will remove it immediately. Throwaway for obvious reasons. With all my disclaimers out of the way, let's get to it. 

Let's look at the cast:

* Me (17F)
* Mom (55F)
* Dad (56M)

Now let me acknowledge something (again), I’m a lazy person. I understand that. I also, however, understand that I’m 17. To me, staying up late and sleeping a lot during the day is just normal for my age, especially with not having to go to school. I say that not to excuse wrongdoing but to give you a frame of reference for my mindset. In my mind I’m being relatively normal, even if on the extreme side of ‘normal’. Enter mom. She does not share my sentiments about my sleep schedule’s normality. She does not want me sleeping at all during the day (she isn’t thrilled about me staying up either but she’s fine so long as I’m sensible about how late ‘late’ is) to the point where she will come into my room just to see if I’m asleep and if I am to wake me up. She also doesn’t like how I spend my waking hours either. I’m a relatively private person, or at least as private as one can be at 17. I like to spend my time in my room and watch YouTube, look at Reddit, play my switch, and text my girlfriend. She wants me to come out of my room more, but the thing is when I’m out of my room everyone is just on their phones anyways. I mean sometimes a conversation will arise, sure, but I end up just sitting there most of the time trying to think of something to talk about. My mom really stresses about these two combined facts, no matter how many times I try and tell her that I’m just doing what I like and that this is normal (or at least I think this is normal) for my age. Well today it all just kind of...snapped. My mom went back to her room after waking me up for the third or fourth time in a short period of time (I don’t know how long, I was drowzee and dazed because once I fall asleep waking up is a sisyphean task) because I was supposed to go practice driving with my dad (in my defence I was ready and just waiting for him to get home from work)(yes he is an essential worker)(yes I realize I just put multiple parenthesis next to each other). He was due in at first five minutes, then fifteen because of traffic. After the last time waking me up she went back to her room and fell into a breakdown. I assume she started crying first, but that’s only an assumption because I wasn’t in the room yet. Then came the scream. I rushed into her room and dumbly asked “are you alright?” to which she obviously replied no. I asked what was wrong and I don’t remember what she said. The next thing I remember is me being on the bed hugging her as she is off and screaming at the top of her lungs like she is being stabbed, later when I was texting my girlfriend about the incident even the memory of the screams gave me a headache. After she is done screaming she goes off on me, her voice raw (her voice wouldn’t recover for the rest of the day) telling me how she always wants to scream like that because that’s just how bad on her mental health I am and how because of how much I sleep and stay in my room I’m a vegetable. I told her I didn’t want to go driving because I didn’t want to leave her alone to which she accused me of just wanting to get out of driving (it's well known that I see learning to drive as a chore) and that I needed to go, and against my better judgment I did. 

Now that brings me to my dad. Something about him just brings out my most irritable. And a good portion of it is indeed my fault. I don;t like being asked questions like when I last texted so and so or what we talked about in said texts. I’m hoping this is just teenage angst and that it ends soon, because god I hate being like this. I want to be normal and be able to respond to questions like that without feeling embarrassed or like I’m being asked private info but I don’t know how. But also my dad likes to push boundaries, it’s his sense of humor. He knows I don’t like to be touched, so he touches me by with his feet while we are sitting next to each other or similar things. He’s constantly calling me disrespectful and miserable to be around, which are fair accusations, but the latter is because I’m miserable (not necessarily because of him, I have mental health issues). He wants (expects?) me to change my flaws without actually reflecting on what the cause of my flaws are. He thinks I’ll stop being depressed and tired (see; staying up late) if I just got outside.  

Now the final addition to the trilogy; my transhood. I’m transgender (MtF) and have been out as some form of trans or other for over a couple years (had to place that one with which grade I was in at the time because of the whole time thing I mentioned earlier)(I briefly identified as NB.) I actually told my mom in elementary and then again in middle school, but both times it got ignored until I scared myself back into the closet. The final time I came out in Freshman year I came out for good. To be fair neither of my parents are ecstatic at having a trans daughter but I expected that. My mom is even using my new name and sometimes pronouns now. My dad is...taking more time. Whenever I correct him when he deadnames me he’ll roll his eyes and say “oh my god” like me asking him to call me by my new name is some unreasonable demand made by a bratty little kid that he’s fed up with.  He also loves to call me son. Now I understand that we’re from the south so calling younger “boys” (put in quotes for the fact that I’m not one) son is like half our dialect but I keep asking him not to call me son anymore because I’m not a boy and he brushes it off by saying it’s hard and that he called my brothers son since before I was born.  So Reddit I look to you for advice. Should the need arise I’ll add edits for clarification of course. What can I do to be a better daughter? I don’t know what to do.",08May2020,1

288,"I’ll give a short rundown of my relationship up until this point.

I’ve been friends with my girlfriend for 2 1/2 years now. We started dating about 6 months ago, and at the beginning it was great, but after a while I realized that my feelings for her kind of went on and off sometimes. 

I talked to her about it and told her that I wasn’t sure if I wanted to break up with her or not. I decided against, and that was about 4 months ago. But it’s definitely given her a lot of anxiety. There’s a few other issues with the relationship, and they literally all stem from things becoming chronic issues from things that should’ve been resolved, and it’s all because of her anxiety. I know that she can’t control it, but I can’t fix it, either.

Now, I’ve debated whether or not I would break up with her a few times over the law couple months, but I always end up chickening out because I don’t want to hurt her. I also don’t want to lose our mutual friends and I don’t want to do it in quarantine.

But I know that I have to do it once this is over. What am I supposed to say for the reasons I broke up with her?

She just stopped asking, so I decided to let it go through and keep texting her as if nothing happened, until she stop answering. 

I didn’t think anything about it, since she does that sometimes and she just forgets to answer or gets tired and stop replying. After that, she has texted me asking for hw ir something like that, and when I answer she just leaves me on sent.

About a week ago one of my close friends asks me to do a cover art for him for his album. I pride myself with photoshop and have been self taught since about 2013 ish, I say yes and it takes me a couple of days to make the cover art but I think it looks amazing. 

He then tells me thank you but another friend has made the cover art let’s call this friend G. My friend shows me G’s cover art and it is insane, probably one of the best cover arts that I have seen in my lifetime, he tells me that next cover art that I can do his but I decline. 

The thing is G has only been using photoshop for about a year max and his stuff looks way better than a lot of my artwork. He post his album and almost have all of the school retweeting and posting his stuff even from people who never posted his stuff before. I can genuinely say that most of these retweets are because the album cover looks nice, as the songs are the same quality from his other projects.

But I just need some advice. I’ve been working hard for years just to get outed by someone with a fraction of my time dedicated to photoshop.

Of the several girls I've dated steadily, there have been only two that I've broken up with myself. The rest broke up with me, hurt me, and betrayed my trust, but somehow I got over them, and I'm fine. I'm either on good terms or friends with most of them.

But, strangely enough, the 2 that I broke up with, the 2 relationships that I've ended, haunt me. I either have nightmares, or they cross my mind and I feel overwhelmed with guilt, and anxiety.


Context may be important. Somehow, by sheer coincidence, both of the times I've ended a relationship have had eerily similar circumstances. 

Both were valentines day break up.
Both were with girls who had, in one way or another, broken my trust. Either by cheating or by talking to other guys. 
I forgave them both, and made it work, and things got better each time.
Each time, I ended up having to move out of state, for reasons beyond my control, and It was always sudden. Like a weeks notice. 
Each time I moved, I would try to keep the relationship going, either by visiting when I could, or by constantly talking over the phone, and keeping in touch, swearing that I'd move back as soon as I could.
But both times, on Valentines day, I ended up breaking up with the girl. 


Maybe it was the distance that I just couldn't ever handle, maybe it was the lack of trust, especially given the distance. 

What kills me is that I remember how those two people loved me. They really did. They were both devastated when I let it go. 

The thing is, I loved them too. I just couldn't keep going. I think it was a combination of the poor trust and the distance. But it wasn't because I didnt love them.


As of now, I'm happy in my current relationship, and it's the longest standing one I've held. Things are good. But some nights, I still hear them crying. I still see hear the drunk calls. And I still see the good times had. The passion once shared. 

It kills me, everytime, and I dont know how to cope with it. 

If anyone has been through something similar,  or can offer any bit of advice, I would greatly appreciate it.",08May2020,1
292,"Title sounded lame, but i promise i’m not some 12 year old trying to get a girl to fall in love with me. We all know what corona has done, especially fellow college students. I met a girl in my lab during spring semester, we got along very well but unfortunately had to part ways when corona hit. She lives around 1,300 miles away... so... not close at all. My problem is I have this mega crush on her... usually I don’t think much about thoughts like this, but she is a GEM.

I can usually tell when someone is into me, but she’s confusing me. Some days she snaps me endlessly (i love those days) and other days i barely get anything from her. I really don’t know if i should shoot my shot now or wait till we get back to college.... i guess i’m really asking if anyone here has any ideas? most my friends are spit down the middle; its either wait or go for it. I really don’t know what’s logical tho... so.. please help?",08May2020,1

294,"I don’t know if this is the right place for this but I would like some input and maybe someone else has dealt with a situation like this?


I’m a pretty quiet girl and I can admit that I have RBF so I look pissed off whenever I’m not smiling. So many people have told me I’m intimidating because of this.  I will also add humbly tho, I consider myself to be pretty kind and got nominated for nicest person at my school so, I didn’t have a rep of being a mean person at school. 


I feel as if most of the people I knew from high school didn’t like me because no one really tried to talk to me or hang out with me like they did with everyone else. Like, in extracurricular activities I found everyone was chill with everyone but I didn’t feel like I fit in with that. I tried to be nice to people and try to talk to people first but they never seemed very receptive to it. There were guys that were friends with my friends and if I saw them talking I would come up to my friend with a smile on my face and try to join in on the convo so I could become more familiar with them. The guy would a lot of the time tense up when I would come over and then stop the convo and walk away. Another time, on one occasion a group of the same guys were sitting with my friends and when me and my friend walked over they got up and left. It always made me feel so confused and insecure because these people were ALL so friendly with each other and would even avoid eye contact with me. 


I could maybe equate some of these situations with me being intimidating (tho, I am a tiny girl who is shy and doesn’t have many friends while these people are pretty popular and confident) so I feel like that just doesn’t make sense. I went through high school believing that I wasn’t enough for them and that there must’ve been a reason or rumour that went around that made people stay away from me. 

Now that I’ve graduated high school I’ve had two of the popular girls admit to me that they were intimidated by me because they thought I was so cool and pretty and always wanted to be my friend. Both were out of the blue so I don’t know why they would lie but also like why didn’t you ever try to be my friend in high school??? 



As for the boys, my friends are convinced that they thought I was hot and didn’t know how to act around me even though these boys were known as the hot boys at school and it makes no sense to me that someone like me, someone so quiet and harmless and I don’t even consider myself hot to intimidate guys that I know have big egos because of all the attention they get?  


So overall: a lot of people have told me that they thought I was pretty and cool in high school but didn’t tell me until after high school but didn’t even make any effort during school? Like actions speak louder than words to me. Why wouldn’t these girls be receptive to me complimenting them and trying to start convos? Why wouldn’t they ask me to hang out since they did that with so many other girls? And why did these guys act so distant and hostile with me? None of them ever admitted to being attracted to me so I don’t think that’s the reason. When has a good looking girl ever made a boy stay away? Why didn’t they try to talk to me? What could be the reason people didn’t seem to be receptive to me but after high school admitted this stuff to me? It still effects me because I felt so disconnected from people at my school and it caused a lot of insecurities and anxiety.",08May2020,1

296,"I (18f) live in the south and have decided to move to my college town as I will need to take summer classes to graduate on time. In my hometown I worked at a really popular grocery chain in my state and took an educational leave of absence during the fall and spring semesters of my first year in college (meaning I would still be on their payroll and have job security if /when I decided to come back). I was able to put in my transfer for the store in my new town and went through the application and interview process. I was really excited because the store I transferred from was 10x as busy as the new one and I would be getting paid an additional 2$/hr because of the pandemic. 

I initially had a phone interview with one of the department managers. She was incredibly sweet and about 30 min after, she called me to tell me I would be moving on to the in-person interview. 

I signed up for a day and showed up on time. The manager who would be interviewing me was about ten minutes late. No biggie, he's probably a busy person. Then I got in the office with him. Because of covid, this store requires that all workers wear face masks when they are on the clock. He sat down and immediately took it off, saying ""you know... they tell us to wear these but..."" and shrugged his shoulders.  I immediately got a really bad vibe from him. His comments and questions were in a tone that was dripping with a superiority complex and condescending. It was very off -putting. 

One of the questions he asked me was how I would deal with a customer in a certain situation. I gave my answer and he sort of looked at me with a ""stank"" face. He asked me, ""and?"" I didn't really know anything to say.  The way I answered had worked for me in the past. I sort of stuttered and he moved on. He kept reminding me that just because I was already working with the company didn't mean my position was guaranteed and that my current position wasn't what they were looking for (I checked before and after the interview and my position does match what they were hiring for). At the end of the interview, he asked me if I had any questions for him and I said no. He asked me two or three more times and I guess he got fed up because the last time he sort of rolled his eyes. 

I finished, got my group interview (there was three of us as opposed to ten of us and we were all at least six feet apart), and got the transfer. 

Before we are hired, we have to fill out our availability. I put all open (since they are a 24 hour store this means 168 hours of availability), forgetting I had two prior obligations. My first shift (this past Monday) I asked the nice manager I initially talked to and asked if I could correct it, even if it was policy that new hires were required to stay with their initial availability for the first 90 days. She said yes and I filled out the form. The next day, I got a call (and voicemail) from the other manager in the morning telling him to call him. I did, and he answered with an accusatory tone. I explained my error and he sort of snapped at me: ""Well. Everyone on MY team is held responsible for their availability for the first 90 days. That's why we hired you."" I again explained my error and told him that it would only take my availability down by 10 hours. ""Well. Is this going to be an issue?"" I told him that it may but I would likely be able to work around it. He sort of cut me off and ended the call by making sure i didn't let this ""type of thing"" happen again.

My second shift was today. I was paired with a friendly girl and asked her opinion on him. She looked around and quietly told me that I would need to be careful about who I talked with about him but that most people don't like him, that I should avoid him at all costs,etc. After my shift was over, I contacted one of the girls who transferred from my previous store before me and asked about him. She told me to not get onto his bad side as she's heard he will write false disciplinary reports on those he dislikes.

299,"So a good friend of mine (18 year old guy) has had substance abuse problems for a while, both pills (Risperidone) and alcohol. He's been to therapy, tried both AA and rehab, he says they didn't work for him. The important thing is that he kicked the pill habit a long time ago, but he unfortunately never stopped drinking. Over the past several months, I have helped him taper off his drinking and eventually he became completely sober. I answered all his late night messages, pumped him up, motivated him to cut these vices out of his life, and tried my hardest to help him through his troubles in life as best I could.  Throughout all of this, I've tried to keep it all relatively low profile in order for him to save face in our community (cadet commander of the Air Force JROTC unit at the school, volunteer firefighter/EMT in his free time), but I always reminded him that if his behavior ever got out of control, I'd send an email to the relevant people within the school district and his fire department in order to ensure he'd get the professional help he was reluctant to seek on his own. Everything was fine until recently. He had been sober for about a month when 2 days ago, I recieved a text message at approximately 1 AM from him telling me that he had relapsed on pills. We discussed it, and I told him that he needed help beyond what I could provide, and told him that he had 72 hours to set up an appointment with a professional before I set into motion my aforementioned email plan. Today, he texted me a picture of him with a wine bottle in hand. He said that he had a stressful day and needed a drink (gay guy in a conservative part of Texas, he's now faced with choosing between his fiancee and his family). I reminded him that it was not a healthy coping mechanism, not to mention illegal. He got upset with me, said that he was done and didn't want my help anymore. I understand his predicament and his reluctance to seek help because of the impact it would have on his home life and career, but I'm deeply concerned about the path that he's going down. Is it morally justifiable for me to send that email out and get him the help that he needs, or do I just have to walk away and let him spiral downwards? I don't want to destroy a friendship or overstep my boundaries if possible, but above anything else, I want him to get the help he needs in order for him to live a happy and healthy life.

303,"My fiancé has struggled with anxiety, and also has really intense nightmares. A few nights ago he had one that caused him to wake up having a panic attack, I woke up to him hyperventilating. This isn’t common, but it’s happened before so I wasn’t as freaked out as most people may be. I walked him through some breathing exercises and such to help him calm down. I didn’t notice until after he was breathing alright but he was sweating an excessive amount and was shaking. I got him some water and when I came back he said I “deserved better” and said he was gonna sleep on the couch. I told him that wasn’t necessary and I know this stuff just happens sometimes, It’s okay. But he was adamant about sleeping on the couch. I figured he was in a weird headspace so I didn’t fight him further. 

I should say that my fiancé is the sweetest, goofiest man ever. He rambles a lot and the next morning he was uncharacteristically quiet and down. I tried talking to him, I asked if he wanted to watch a movie etc. He was pretty unresponsive, said he wasn’t in the mood so I figured I’d give him some space. It’s been a few days now and I’m really worried about him. He’s still sleeping on the couch, I told him if he wanted to sleep alone he could take the bed and I could sleep on the couch, but he said it was fine. I’m concerned he’s going down a very dark rabbit hole. Quarantine has not been kind to him, he got laid off and because he was laid off he stopped therapy which is very concerning but neither of us have the funds to support a lot of things at the moment.

I think the nightmare was some kind of trigger, but I’m not sure what the nightmare was about because when I asked him he said he didn’t want to talk about it.

312,"Hello !

So last year, there was someone who complained abt her parents (that she hated they wouldn't understand when she said she didn't want their gifts because she doesn't like waste or smt like that) and me, I was just there listening, but then like an idiot I started talking.

 And for a bit of context, I left home when I was 16 and am earning most of my money on my own since I turned 17 and I was spending lot of time on the relationship-advice forum. She is not especially my friend(I didn't had much contact before or after) but it was a long discussion tho, like one hour. 

And so I was saying things like ""you know, if someone doesn't bring me happiness, I cut them off generally. Like I almost don't speak to my family, and I feel fine "" so I was quite implying for her that she could just drop her parents (did not say it directly thought). Now, each time I see videos of relationship that people can have with their parents, remembering this discussion makes me feel bad.

Also, I was just turning 18 and she was smt like 20, so I guess she knew it was a bit of teenager talk (it is, right?), but still it's ""2am invasive thought"" that comes back from time to time since, and I'd like to send her smt like that:

""Yo, this is random, but I was just thinking about the discussion we had abt parents last year, and if you remember it, uuh, it's better if you remember only the part you were saying you ! I was reading a lot the relationship-advice reddit forum at the time (where people are like ""cut off ! leave that person !"" all the time) and I think I was a bit projecting (myself, who knows why, they didn't do anything terrible lol, I often distance myself from my parents), but yeah, all around I think I would have been a better person this day if I had just listened without saying anything. So yeah hope I didn't degrade your relationship with your parents!""

Would that be a terrible idea to remind her of this story? Like is it selfish? And I wonder how much do you disagree with the idea of cutting peoples that don’t interest you? There is a lot of persons that I admired and loved dearly (non-romantically) who rejected me, and from that I got the idea that one should not lose time with people that are not your type, but where is the limit between using your right to not be friend with someone and the one of being an AH?",08May2020,1
313,"Please excuse me for my bad grammar.

So, a little bit about myself: I'm 22, male, a Vietnamese. When I was a little kid, I was a kleptomaniac and small animal abuser, which caused a lot of trouble. But outside of my family, nobody knew it. At school and neighbor, I was a bright, good kid who wouldnt harm a fly, and everybody looked up to me, which made me sick.

At 17, I won a 4 years scholarship to study in Finland, which everyone include myself considered a blessing. But what went wrong after just 2 years? I didn't know. All I know is that I lost control of myself, I locked myself in the room and played games for days and never went to university, I lied to my parents about getting a part time job - I never did have one even now - but still told them to send me money. I knew exactly what would happen if I kept being like that, that I would be expelled, but I didnt stop to fix myself. And then I got depressed from the doom that was definitely coming to get me, and all the responsibilities that I would have to face. But I couldnt be expelled if I quit.

So I lied to my parents again. I lied to them about how working part time made me exhausted, about how hard the studying was, about how I was trying to keep up but I couldnt. And so, I returned to Vietnam after just 2 years abroad, without a degree and now my family is in debt with other relatives becaused my parents borrowed their money to send me in those 2 years.

That was 2 years ago. I ran away from my responsibilities  at Finland, but now there's a big debt on my family. My parents borrowed money again to get me to a private school to get a coding degree to start again from scratch. I thought this time I would care more if it's a field that im interested in (I love games) unlike in Finland where I study Electrical Engineering. But nope, the same shit happened again. I have no control of myself whatsoever, I locked myself in the rented room near school and played and ate and played and ate...  Back when I was 17 I was a slim, argubly handsome guy but now I'm a fat, creepy guy. I cant even walk 5 minutes without panting. I hate myself so much.

There's 1 thing unlike in Finland now that I study in my home country Vietnam and that is, my school can contact my parents. And they did. And it happened on a monthly basis because I skip school too much. Everytime, my mother would call me and cry and then I would promise to never skip school again, and then the same shit happened.

Until yesterday, my mother called me and said school called again. She also revealed that she had a tumor in her stomach that she didnt know how much time she had left, and she told me to quit school all together to be a labor worker like my dad. That was when I realise I didnt love my family, only pity them. I didnt feel anything but pity for my mom when I heard that. Then I feel so so so disgusted at myself, I went out to the drug store and I bought tons of sleeping pills, then I downed them all.

Then I went to sleep slowly.

My heart was banging so loud in my chest, I can feel it slowly quiet down while I was thinking about all the disgusting things that I did in the past, and how people always looked up at me. I feel pity for my family and I was fully prepared to be burnt in hell for thousands of years.

But morning came, and I woke up. My body reflectively went to the bath room and threw up all the undigested pills because my stomach was so uncomfortable. And then I went back to sleep.

Later that morning, my father came to my rented room to visit me to advise me to keep studying, despite my mom telling me to quit (he probably didnt know about my mom's tumor) and that if I quit and be a labor worker, my fatass wouldnt make a day, and my younger brother ( yes I do have one, he's 16 and he loves games just like I do, but not as obsessive) would be turn out to be just like me. Im so lost on what to do now, I wont try to die again because that feeling when I was slowly fading away was so horrible, i dont want to face it again.

But the reality is too grim. My family is in heavy debt (26k usd) and I dont know jackshit about what im studying or studied, and my mom has a tumor. Please, I beg of you, give me some advices.

315,"I know this sounds mean but hear me out. I’m a classical pianist and have been teaching my little brother piano for 7 years. He loves the piano- it’s his favourite instrument and he’s always willing to learn when i teach him so I pass on the knowledge and skills i learned from years of piano lessons to him.

What kills me is that he always wants the easy road and doesn’t put in the effort to practise ATLEAST 30 minutes to an hour a day. When he plays, it’s all about speed. Any pianist on here knows that piano playing is not just about speed, but when i tell you that instead of playing canon in d minor for example, nicely and softly and with any emotion at all, he plays it at what sounds like 215 bpm. No pedal, no emotion, just fast noise. He doesn’t put in the effort to learn new music because it means he’d have to read and study the sheet music, and still, after 7 years, he wants to play fur elise of all songs with an emotion that sounds like anger. He keeps going against everything i teach him and i don’t understand why. If there’s a song where he needs to stretch his hand out abit and put in some effort and practise to master it, he’ll take the easy road and just play an octave. 

He likes pop music and I teach classical music, and i figured okay well maybe he doesn’t understand classical yet. let’s do some pop. i taught him pop songs and he still doesn’t understand them. he plonks block chords as if he’s mad at the piano instead of playing the arpeggios i taught him because its easier to play block chords. sometimes he’ll just sit there and play 4 chords over and over again and count that as practise.

i understand that he might not be as serious as i am about the piano, but it just hurts abit because i’m the one who taught him and it feels like he just hasn’t taken anything from my years of time and effort. I’m not the greatest pianist ever but i can play and i understand the instrument, so it kills me to hear the piano which i hold so dearly to my heart be disrespected by my student... yes that may be a harsh word but that’s what its like. it’s like someone kicking a basketball infront of an nba player. I know that music is music and there shouldn’t be a right or a wrong but it’s getting really difficult to listen to when he plays.

I STARTED learning piano at his age, so he’s got years on me so i just don’t understand what’s gone wrong. And what’s worse is that he thinks he’s really really good. I think that’s partially why he doesn’t put any more effort into it than what he’s already done.

I know) She is literally the most perfect girl i could ever Hope for in every way of the word. We play games, watch movies and tv shows together and Lots of other things. She has the most beaultiful smile that i've ever seen in a person. She cares about others, is hardwoking and talented, and she sees the world in such a different and beautiful way and... Yeah, every thing in her makes me want to love her more. She likes another guy... That liked her for quite some time. He has the same age as her and he is basicly the standard of beauty. I dont like him AT ALL. Not cuz i like her, but because hes kind of an asshole. She says she loves me but It was never romantic ir anything like that. I guess. I have no hopes for me and her. I have depression and this shit reeeeally Hurts. Im crying basicaly every day, but with ALL the reasons, this one is the worst. Back in 2019 i use to think there was a chance due to how close we were, than this shit wear came and She tells that She actually like that other Guy. We Still getting closer, we can se one another during the pandemy, but not the other Guy.
She is a really shy girl, i believe that it was a big efford to Tell her friends that She liked him, but he doesnt know. One of these days i was making a joke abount them being a couple, and She Said She was over It. I dont know if its cuz She is shy af... I dont know anything anymore, i Just feel pain. I was thinking of telling her How i feel but i dont know if its a good Idea. Every time a see her smile a get sooo fucking happy, than i remember... And its Just pain again. I really REALLY dont know what to do.


Unfortunatelly i started crying as i typed and dont know if a missed any important details.

317,"Long story short when I was 15 things started between me and my stepdad and between then and now (turning 19 soon) its happened on and off periodically. There was never any intercourse and when I was younger I used to even initiate it sometimes so I can't even consider it to be what it feels like but now I'm seeing things clearer. 

Now continuing to just allow myself to be touched and manipulated into doing things I don't want to do isn't something I can just passively let happen anymore. My body feels more like my own again after being away for several months over the winter. Before I just zoned out and let him do whatever he wanted but I always thought that he would stop if I said no and he would when I used to in the beginning. But when I would push him away or tell him to stop he would immediately withdraw from me and act all hurt and say I used him. So I stopped saying no because I started to believe that I was the bad one for denying him. Well I can push him away now and not care when he sulks. But tonight when he was touching me and kept trying to kiss me and I kept trying to move his hands away they wouldn't move away for a second and that scared me. How he looks at me when he wants me scares me. He always says that I saved him. I don't want this anymore. I'm sick of the mind games and I'm sick of hiding my disgust and desire to runaway whenever he touches me. 

I could live with my real Dad if I wanted to and on the night when I got back here after being there for a while and he had me on the bed already I knew that I had made the wrong decision to come back. I want things to work here. I want to stay with my Mom and my dogs, but I don't think I can take this anymore. I know it's obvious, but how should I even go about telling my Mom that I want to live with my Dad? How would I break that to them both? I really want things to work but I just can't keep up this act any longer. My depression has already come back in full force and this is just making it so much worse.",08May2020,1

319,"My ex (17m) was overall insanely incompetent when it came to dating. He was a mixture of inexperienced (okay) and neglectful (obv not ok). I have given him 6-7 chances throughout our relationship. The reason I broke up with him was a feather on the camel’s back sorta deal.

I had a mental breakdown after work one day. I already wasn’t really in love with him, but this just set me off. I tried to go missing. I walked 1-2 miles away from work and gave up, but he simply said “I’ll miss you. Text me if you ever decide to come back” after I tell him to not tell my brother what I’m about to do. The next day of course, I confront him. I have to convince him three times total why that’s shitty and then he pulls out the sad and guilty card. 

Weeks, maybe a month after, I get into an argument about it to him. It was less an argument and more him being submissive and obeying my every will as if he were a servant. I hated that. I wanted him to tell me to stop being so mean. I wanted him to not bend to my every will. I brought up my brother, asking if he’s apologized. Nope. He’s only apologized to me. My brother almost lost me and he hasn’t said shit. I broke up with him and we remained just friends. Maybe I’m nitpicking but all the other six times I tried he begged and made me feel shitty so I didn’t, but it’s probably because I was being bitchy he was like “yeah we aren’t doing too good let’s take a break”. Despite that he spoke as if we were going to get back together.

At this point I’ve been ghosting him and he’s been texting me non-stop.

I have many chat logs if anyone would like to read them.

This is a tough situation and I’m hoping that I can get some helpful advice to move forward. Sorry if this is long or confusing. I’m able to clarify anything in the comments.

My grandmother lives in her own home (California) and has maintained independence for much of her elderly life. She had a major stroke several years ago that she miraculously survived with only a few residual issues that still linger today, mainly with her mobility. Her cognition is not completely there but I would say she’s at 90-95 percent.

Unfortunately, one of her daughters has been living with her for the last few years. She has been a parasite latched to my grandmother all of her adult life. My grandmother has certainly enabled some of this behavior to some degree. Multiple incidences of theft that have been swept under the rug and she was even briefly charged with elder abuse due to another living situation she was in (long story). They lost their house and were planning to stay with my grandmother just while they “got back on their feet”. This is now several years later and we all see she has no intention of leaving my grandmothers house. This is because she pays no bills, no rent, and barely does anything to contribute to the overall function of the household. She has two young adult children and one very young child, as well as her partner staying there with her. They are running the house into the ground. The condition of the house is dirty, smelly and unclean. She is having to try clean on her own within the capacity that she can, but because she is being forced to clean after EVERYONE, the house stays in a poor state. She has even said she is doing the laundry for everyone in the household. She is constantly being manipulated into babysitting the youngest child when she doesn’t even have the mobility to keep up with her. 

I speak with my grandmother on the phone regularly and others are aware of the situation not being ideal.  However, after today’s conversation, I am feeling compelled that this situation is now completely untenable. She sounds dejected, hopeless, and so frustrated. She mentioned casually that she is unable to locate her stimulus check and is planning to use the check to pay for new linoleum flooring, as her daughter’s pets and family have ruined it. What really sent me over the edge is that her daughter and her family are not following proper precautions during the current health crisis and potentially exposing her to the virus. She feels helpless in this regard. To me, this is now unquestionably compromising her health and safety. I’m worried there is financial shadiness happening, as well.

I’ve brought this to the attention of other concerned family members and we are now formulating a plan to make a report to Adult Protective Services. How do we lay out the complaint and what else can we do to come out of this situation where my grandmother is able to regain her independence and be free from this horrible living situation? One big concern is that she may refuse any assistance from APS. 

She claims she doesn’t want confrontation with her daughter when her other children bring it up, but it’s no longer a situation that can be ignored.

What are our options here? How can we be prepared for this process? 

Thank you in advance for any help!",08May2020,1
322,"Warning: this will be extremely long lol. Im sorry for that. 

Im 14 years old, Female, in case that affects my advice lol


So I wrote a Reddit post like a week or two ago about questioning my sexuality. And I still am. I honestly can't tell if I'm straight and going through a gay phase, gay but denying it because of feeling pressured, or Im bi erasure. To some people, figuring out their sexuality is easy. From day one they know they have an attraction towards the opposite sex or same sex. But not me. When I was younger I felt attracted to men kind of. Sometimes, I'd think about having a boyfriend but it was like this: 'Yeah one day I'll get a boyfriend I guess.' or I'd straight up be like 'ew.' When I thought about having a boyfriend it was never like I actually had a vision of a man in my mind

What I mean is like, I never attached a certain profile I guess. Like maybe if you was attracted to guys with beards or maybe a guy with dark hair or blonde hair youd think of a 'dream' guy sort've, lol. Well I never did that. I would just think up personality traits. Like 'They better be nice. Funny. Have a dark humor. Like video games. Star Wars. Mortal Kombat. Nirvana.' Also, I'd constantly be telling my mom since I was like 5 that I'd never have my first boyfriend until I was at least finished with college. She would tell me, ""Oh well when youre a teenager most girls start liking boys."" And its always felt like accoding to adults, you HAVE to start having crushes when ure a teen

Well, now Im a teen and I still cant find an attraction to guys completely. Like heres an example:

Ill see a guy and for a moment feel attracted. But then, it just goes away for some reason. Or I'll instead want to become their friend. Like, I'll think theyre cool but not feel all blushy around them,shy or anything like that. I just feel like.....inspired to be like them? Makes no sense. You know how girls will look at a famous girl singer and be like ""I wanna be like that!"" Well, I'll start to feel like that about a dude instead of being normal and being like 'tHeyre cUte'. 

With females, Im also confused. I'll look at them, think theyre pretty and nothing more. Only when I get to know a female more, I start to feel that weird way but not an actual crush. Its like this curious feeling I get. Like there was this girl I knew and she disappeared from my life and now reappeared. I feel kind of like I wanna impress her. Like one day I was thinking, 'I wonder if she'll think Im cute if I post this pic of myself....well nevermind, my acne looks ugly.' I know its not a crush though because I hate her. Reason why: She was extremely clingy, and when I had a guy friend she spreaded this rumor I liked him, then said we were dating and both were false.

This is the gross/embarrassing part. The first time I ever thought about the birds and the bees, I was thinking about females and only females. I was disgusted by sex, but was thinking bout like tits and shit like that....(im so sorry this is getting gross)

So I’m currently gaming on my Xbox One X and I’ve been streaming on twitch a lot. I really like using OBS and I want to get into it more. The only way for me to steam is using an el gato and when I use it I can’t play in 4K I can only play in 1080p. I know that Twitch doesn’t allow steaming any higher than 1080p so I understand but with the news about the Xbox One Series X coming out and how it is basically a PC I’m debating if I should buy that or if I should just upgrade my PC instead of buying the new Xbox. If I played on my PC only and streamed from that I think I’d be able to play on whatever graphics I want to play on while the stream will stay at its 1080p. My main concerns are my friends play Xbox and are most likely getting the new Xbox.

329,"I recently moved in with my boyfriend and his long term roommates in January of this year. These are his friends of over 10 years and previous roommates from Pennsylvania (he now lives in CA). The roommates are 40F and 24M, I'm a 29F and my boyfriend is 34M. So they've always been messy and disregard other people's property. This is a side note from the main issue, but comes up later. The 40F would go out to bars and all night every night so I would never have to see her. With the shelter in place,she has been staying home more. Initially, a big confrontation had to be had (she was bringing her bar mates over and turning the dining room into a bar, leaving trash everywhere, and getting obnoxiously drunk). I don't like having people over EXCESSIVELY, especially during a pandemic. She then began seeing a woman. She stated it was casual and she wasn't her type, but continued to see her. So on my birthday, same thing, except the woman was over.They stayed out there all night, had obnoxious sex and 7 AM which woke me up, and trashed the dining room. My birthday was ruined, I still hold a grudge (this was March 28th) but have somewhat moved on.

Now to two weeks ago, she was on vacation. She had the girlfriend over 3 out of 4 days in a row with no notice. I was working from home, the girlfriend is loud and annoying. My boyfriend had a ""talk"" with her, which she stated wouldn't happen again (this conversation happened to avoid the roommate meeting I said we needed to have).Since then, the same thing is happening (albeit they are avoiding  me which I approve of). The girlfriend is over again, the first day with notice and today without. So I'm really pissed off, but I know it's a culmination of many things.

1. States ""it's not serious, she's not my type"".
2. Brings over other women she has had past flings with while still inviting this other woman over.
3. The other woman is either oblivious or okay with it, which doesn't make me like her anymore.
4. The aftermath of the ""dates"": Trash left out, with me ending up giving in and getting rid of it because I don't want to live in filth.

I guess point 4 also adds into another dimension of the problem and my reaction. She does not pick up after herself  at all, then brings this person over  (the 40F has not cleaned a thing in 2+ months). Also,  they ruined my toothbrush. I know I'm getting a running list going here and I should of said something initially, but here I am.

&amp;#x200B;

She can tell I'm pissed. She avoids me, and before she does something that she knows will irritate me she offers to ""pick something up from the store"" or offers food.

Im fourteen and female first of all.

Im gonna be straight up: I hate having to feel like I must date.

I always see books and movies and all that fabulous stuff talk about romance and Im still like 'ew.'

I alway hear my mom and brother talk about how one day when I get a boyfriend or husband or worse, kIds what theyll do or ill do.

Ive had a girl ask me about if Ive had a crush, I said no, and apparently 'no' means Im lying and I definitely had one, so I gave up on saying no and made up one guy from our class. And another girl insisted that I was crushing on my guy friend, which I was not and she spreaded a rumor that we were dating.

And I hate it.

Do I really have to get a boyfriend?

I had a guy like me (he was the guy that my friend insisted that we were dating) and since I give up trynna not look like Im lesbian, im thinking bout asking him out

When I dont have a boyfriend or ever had a crush on a guy, it makes me weird and family thinks im gay

If i was to have one,suddenly im too young to be having one probably or my family will think im causing problems because now im a boy crazy girl.

If i tell my mom Im questioning if im gay, its a phase.
(And my brother would think its a phase too and say I just havent had a boyfriend and need to get one before I go calling myself gay and that how come everyone thinks theyre gay nowadays)

If i tell my parents i think i may be bisexual, i am a disgusting perveted pig or whore or im being influenced by people

Im tired of having nobody to talk to about this.
Im tired of feeling like I must choose my religion or sexuality.
Im tired of being young and not understanding.
Im tired of cryimg every night about this.


I feel like In using my guy friend, he did in fact have a crush on me,and I still care about him as a friend only, and i feel bad that he told me how he was being bullied for being fat, but ill still pretend that i like him because im a horrible person and i need to not feel like an outcast and ashamed for feeling unattracted to guys 


i wish i could have a girl open up to me without me not openig up to her because of my anxiety, but i know that wont happen because Im very hard of a person to get to know since Im quiet and love being quiet lol and that i could have parents that i felt i could confide in, or a brother who wont treat me differently because of what i feel, or a friend who didnt use me for once, but i know its not reality.

if no one is there for me, ill be there for myself. Ive always been alone and always will.

339,"Sorry for the rant and grammar issues. 

First timer here on this subreddit I just need advice from others. From the title my mom has been going through several diets either they work or fail, but most of the times they fail. I’ve joined her on one which was drinking tea and a good amount of water with it. Though the results were good I just felt depressed doing it so I stopped and even though I told her I didn’t like it she kept persisting until she stopped doing it. 

A little info on me when I was young I was skinny turned chubby and later lost a ton of weight on my own and a few years after I regained weight back and stayed like this. I been my biggest now and had trial and error trying to get back on losing weight like before, just been losing track to keep it up. Because I’ve lost weight on my own I felt comfortable doing things on my own without anyone’s help.

Now she’s doing a new diet with a nutritionist which is great for her but because it’s been working so good, she has been raving about it to family and friends and has now persisted me to join. Saying how good I’ll look like I did before, how beneficial it is to me, and that she’ll do all the cooking and I do the grocery shopping. When I say no and that I’ll be sad doing it and it’s only for her benefit she becomes furious telling me how she’s doing it for me and not for her and that I’ll look like myself like before. 

Now the reason I don’t wanna do it is because my mom likes to use us to promote what’s she’s doing just like my aunts and uncles. As in saying “oh my daughter lost sooo much weight doing this, so you should do it to.” I don’t want my weight loss to be her gain or anyone else’s I want it to be my own. Though I keep telling her no she keeps persisting, but recently my mom has went behind my back and messaged her nutritionist with of photo of my current self and how they can help me. I’ve lost it I don’t know what to do anymore I don’t even wanna follow up with my own plan of dieting and exercising because of what she did.

I’ve never not worked hard a day in my life, sure I admit I’ve had some privilege, but I’ve had to work my ass of to even get to where I am today. And I feel at least half the BS, depression/anxiety, economy, whatever, was inherited. As if had earlier generations had been a generation later they wouldn’t act, or deal with the same problems.

I checked the 16year olds insta and he’s liked all her pictures going back to 2012.. which means maybe they’ve been talking for a long time, and at some point; he was 18 and she was 13. he never has commented on any of her posts. They are for sure dating because I’ve seen pictures in his car of them cuddling, etc.

To me it’s so weird. I asked my therapist and he said its a big sign of immaturity. I have cousins I grew up alongside, who just turned 16 as well. They are girls and they’ve finally hit this point of tasting freedom for the first time by being able to drive. Knowing that he’s dating someone that young makes my moral radar buzzing like crazy. 

He’s like my best friend. I initially thought it was just rumors but then I found out it was true after doing some digging. So I’ve known about this for a little while but it’s becoming more unsettling to me because he’s comfortable enough with me to talk about her- I haven’t asked at all how old is she, or any detail questions. But he says stuff like “oh I’m going to my gfs house now, night man,” when we play video games. 

I worked at a grocery store with him and the 16 year olds parents come in and talk to him sometimes. They seem to have a good relationship. It baffles me how her parents are okay with it. 

So what can I do? Should I confront him? Because otherwise he’s a very good friend to me. We hangout all the time and play video games. I wouldn’t even imagine him to be the type to do that but I think I just wanna convince myself he’s not as guilty as he really is...

Tldr: best friend is dating a girl who is a minor. I’m not sure how I feel and ignoring the problem hasn’t alleviated anything. Should I confront him- I don’t want him mad at me either.",08May2020,1
342,"My friend is pretty mentally young for his age. He plays roblox simulator games and likes to say ‘yeet’. He’s a bit cringy, but he’s a genuinely nice person. I don’t judge him, no, I mostly respect what people like. I played roblox a few years ago too. Who am I to judge him?

Recently, he started a YouTube channel. He posts videos of him playing roblox and minecraft, and gets like 3 ~ 8 views per video (which half of is me and my friends...) The latest video was a trail giveaway in a roblox game of some sorts, I’m not too sure. He gained around 10 subscribers from that video, and now he boasts that he gained 20 subs in the matter of months while it took me 5 years to get to 50. (You should know that I don’t post videos, except that 2 joke videos I have.) I would congratulate him, but his videos are completely unedited and not that well made. Again, I don’t judge him. He’s still like a kid in his heart, and that’s normally what kids do... boast about subs.

But he is getting older now, and I somehow need to tell him That this isn’t right. Then again, I can’t really he mean to him because he’s really nice in general, just young. How should I do this?",08May2020,1

But after the first two weeks on a night i was having trouble sleeping and I heard ryco barking and I realized he wasn’t in my room, I go to check it out it’s my mom feeding him whole hotdogs and teaching him what she was teaching him. Of course I’m mad because that’s some of the rules she’s breaking and she knows it’s wrong but she’s doing it for whatever reason she never explained it to me I yell at her and take Ryco inside and go back to bed and when I wake up he’s not in my room. I go knock on my parents door and ask if Ryco is in there they say no but I hear him sniffing at the door I say I hear and my dad says I’m mental and my mom goes silent. So I just say ok and go back to my room then I hear their door open and Ryco run out but I can’t say anything because I’ll get kicked out if I stand up to my parents. So this continues for like 2 months and he’s been getting worse he longer sleeps with me no longer comes to me when I call him and always growls at me on the fourth month one time I was playing with him until he just snapped and tried to bite my neck but I stopped him with my arm and he wouldn’t let go until my brothers rushed over and stopped him I started walking away but my parents stopped my brothers from hitting Ryco so he takes that as an opportunity to run back up to me and bite in the Center of my back I go up stairs and clean it up the next morning my parents say how mad they are at him but after a week all is forgiven from my parents but I’m left with these scars on my back and arm. Its been quite a while since that and there have been multiple bites on other family members but my parents just blame it on us for getting bit.

344,"Soo, i'm 15 and i'm from a city in Victoria, Australia and I really want to drop out of school and work and save some money. My two best friends also want to do the same thing, because we are planning on getting a van and traveling up the east coast of Australia. I'm not really 100%. sure what I want to do with my life, but I have a basic idea, I just need some time to work on myself and grow before I figure it out. I have a job at my grandparents bakery which I have been working at since I was 12. My mum is okay with me dropping out but she says I have to have a plan, she really wants me to do a course at TAFE or The Gordon (Google if you don't know what it is) and she also thinks I might have to keep doing school until i turn 16 (which i'm pretty sure is the legal age to drop out of school in Victoria) but the thing is I don't turn 16 until November and I haven't done any school work since March because when quarantine started I started working a lot and just slowly stopped doing school work. I am in year 10, but I actually do mostly VCE classes, which if. you aren't from Victoria is the equivalent of a-levels, or HSC. ect. I'm pretty sure I have missed a bunch of assignments and exams for all my VCE classes that are compulsory to complete otherwise you don't pass the class, so I think I might have already failed anyways. Now my teachers are noticing that i'm not answering emails or submitting work or anything, and i'm way to terrified to even look at my emails because I know they are gonna be so angry. It might also be important to note that I only started at this school at the start of the year, so I don't really have any strong friends from the school nor do I know my teachers that well. At myold school I was not really the best student either, but at my old school I was in the accelerated learning program, so when I moved schools they put me in their accelerated class at the new school, so I wanted to be seen as a good kid so I did all my work and stuff, so my mum is getting all these emails from teachers, saying how they are confused because I was going so well or whatever. The accelerated learning program was originally made so you could skip year 10, so technically I have the equivalent knowledge as a year 10 student, so I might legally be able to drop out.But anyway my mum said I have to email my teachers by the end of today and apologise for ignoring them, and ask for my options. I agree with her and I want to send the email, I just don't know what to say, and when I ask for help she keeps saying that it has to be my words and not hers. I have thought about running away for a few months or something along those lines but it seems like a lot of hassle. I don't really get along with my mum though, and I've been reading a lot of other peoples stories about running away and how it worked out for them. At the same time though, I'm scared that the police might come after me, or that i will just get caught straight away and embarrass myself. 

So if anyone has any advice I would be super grateful and I'm open to anything at all! Thanks :)",08May2020,1
345,"TLDR AT BOTTOM

In high school, I had a friend who was a year ahead of me. (We’re both in our early twenties now.) They were always super nice to me before we became close, they sat with me at lunch, walked with me in the hallways, etc. As time went on, we became very close friends. We would often skip lunch and sit in the hallway and talk instead. When we had classes together, we  a l w a y s  sat next to each other even though we had other friends in those classes. We would hang out outside of school as well, they even tried to get me involved with their after school stuff. I think apart of me would’ve suffered through high school if it wasn’t for them. 

But like I said, they were a year ahead of me. And they graduated. They went to college and we ended up drifting apart. 

They worked at a local store and every time I ended up in there, they’d always make the effort to have a conversation with me. 

But the problem really lies within that I’m super self-conscious of myself, not usually in my appearance. But really in my personality, the way I conduct myself. I just feel that I was “weird” and I look back at a lot of things I did in high school with a bad taste in my mouth. And I know that the way I see and feel about myself isn’t the same as how others see/feel, but I can’t help but be self conscious about those things. 

Whenever I think of my old friend, I’m happy. They’re a good person, the type of person I miss being around. 


Basically, I’m asking if I should try to reconnect with this person or not? I just. I keep going back and forth on it, and even though I truly want to, I think the self consciousness is holding me back. I guess I’m just scared of judgement.


TLDR: Old friend and I drifted apart after their graduation with no bad blood, and I just want to reconnect.",08May2020,1
346,"I (23M) have a friend (23M) who I’ve known since I moved to my current city since I was 6. We basically grew up together, as he and I attended mass at the same church, often sleeping over at each other’s place and playing video games in our younger days. We went to different high schools but saw each other at church and occasionally hung out during those years.

I went to University out of the city and kept in touch every now and whenever I’d be back in town for break I find myself always initiating hangouts and stuff. Quite often when I hit him up I get super late texts or no response at all sometimes. I see him hanging out with some of his HS friends (I’m friends with them too, though not as close since I went to a diff HS) on social media and it makes me feel sad. Makes me sad that I’m kind of an afterthought despite me hitting him up 99% of the time and I can’t get prompt responses or even be invited to hang out too. I consider him one of my best friends yet I don’t think the feeling is mutual.

A lot of the friends I made in University aren’t from where I am, so it’s quite lonely back home. I want to express my feelings of sadness to my friend but I don’t want to make things weird. How should I go about this?",08May2020,1
347,"My grandma died recently and kept the will simple: everything she owns goes to her only child, my mom. After selling her house, I imagine the total was somewhere around $400k. I'm not sure what kind of conversation my mom had with my grandma before she passed, but my mom has alluded that she wanted that money to go to ""the family"", which includes me and my brother. There's no legal record of anything like this. So my mom decided $60k would go to each of us. 

So here's where I'm kind of uncomfortable. I don't like taking money from my parents. When I was financially dependent on them (at the start of University), they used it as an excuse to be extremely controlling. Any decision I made ""affected them too"" because it was their money financing my life. And they weren't really wrong, so I always felt too guilty to go against them. I've been financially independent for a few years now and I love being guilt-free with any purchases I make, and I feel in control of my life. If I take the money I'm being offered, I'm worried there will be lots of strings attached. My mom has already alluded that the money would have to be used ""for a good reason"", like a down payment on a house. Honestly sounds awful to imagine my house be considered as ""basically theirs because they paid for it"".

At the same time, $60K could be pretty life-changing for me right now. My bank account has like $5k in it. 

I'm not sure if I'd feel morally okay with letting them give me the money, and then rejecting any strings they try to attach to it. I can't figure out if this feels like actual inheritance that my grandma would have wanted to leave me, or if this really would be a handout from my parents. Any input?",08May2020,1
348,"Hi. I'm back and better now (for anyone that helped the last time)

I have the full story on r/heartbreak.

Summary:
I met this girl through Kik (yeah yeah) and she was a sweet girl. She was feeling down, so I started talking to her to cheer her up. I began to have feelings for her (that are now gone).

I never realised I was actually depressed until she showed me what it was like to be happy again. We still talk a lot, because we have nothing better to do and her other friends (according to her) don't really care about her. 

If there is some way to get her to understand that she helped me a lot, and I want to help her as much as I can as well. It can be a song, poem, points to get across in a conversation. It doesn't matter. Any tips to show her how much I appreciate her in these times of mine.

i've never and still to this day dont have any problems with girls

im attractive and always have girls liking me

well, not to be a narcissist but im exceptionally attractive, so that kinda helps i guess.

i dress really well, like, literally better than everyone

god, im sorry again if im giving off narcy vibes, but its just how it really is.

i sound like a douche lol

but, i've never had a girl

and honestly, i dont even mind.

again, i dont struggle with it, i dont care. i havent met anyone right yet.

&amp;#x200B;

okay, tbh that fact tho still is messing with my mind, deep down

and its because how virgins are portrayed

autistic losers who go on a killing spree, pathetic people who dont achieve anything in life

and it fucks me up, cuz i cant help but associate myself with them.

even tho i have nothing in common with them, i still do.

and i cant help but feel like a loser

&amp;#x200B;

now, literally 99% of the guys around me, have lost it to prostitutes, and still, whenever they wanna do it, its with hookers. im saying it cause, again i dont have a  reason to be jealous.

well, i do have experience with girls, kissing/touching them, etc.  from a very young age actually.

well tbh, i was around like 9 when i had oral sex with this girl

she was my age, and no, it was nothing forced, we both wanted it.

it just happend. i went down on her too.

and yes, i know it sounds hella unrealistic, but i've been watching porn since forever. even tho physically didnt feel nothing, i still found it pleasurable mentally. its weird. but anyways, i knew exactly what to do. it sounds weird, but i was really good at it. and even now, i know that i am.

i mean, i could be a virgin my whole life, and i wouldn't care. but, its not even about that

i dont know

i feel like people can sense it;

well, honestly, its more of a question

can they?

and i mean thru like everyday behavior? like the type of person you are..

have yall ever known someone that you'd never think that they'd be a virgin?

tbh, i know people who literally have every ""virgin"" quality, but they actually aren't

He was a senior I was a sophomore and uninterested, but I figured we only have 5 months of school left, maybe i could just entertain and distract him from sexual things.
He tried so hard for stuff like kissing, nudes, and sex. I only gave in to a single kiss. Wed chat and I'd joke but I'd talk to him how I talked to my other close friends.
Anyways eventually i didnt give enough (whatever lol) and he just stopped texting.
I didnt really care cuz this was right before corona so i figured I'll never hear of this again and hes the one who wanted it a secret so no one would have to know either (not that I cared too much).
Anyways a a month later I start hearing things that he told a mutual friend of ours. I wasn't really bothered just wish he told me you know.
But then I find hes talking about how in love with him I was and how over giving I was and honestly all I can do is laugh because he went so out of his way and to me it's like hes making fun of himself.

This might be a bit of weird question but I am completely exhausted from life stresses. The passed 2 years have been hectic for me and I’ve done so much self improvement I’m not even sure where to look next. Right now it’s all about maintaining. I didn’t do this for a “reward” mainly to prove to myself that I was better than where I was when I was 17-18 I’m now 20 turning 21 in august. I’ve completely changed my life around from where I was. The thing is with all the hard work I’ve been doing I just feel like I’m not getting the right amount of reward for it if any. I’m constantly alone, I don’t have many friends and the ones I do have aren’t the best influence for me. Maybe I’m being to entitled but I feel under appreciated. I just feel like all this hard work was for nothing, I mean I’m better off than where I was but I still have the same feelings and I still have the same issues kind of. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve come to a point where I’m starting to give less of a fuck about shit. It’s not a good feeling, the things I cared about 3 months ago aren’t so important now. I want to stay on this path, but I also don’t want to be non stop working with out having any realise or fun. I can’t remember the last time I had proper fun as well. I want to save up an travel to get away from the stresses of life and just live like a monk. Am I being entitled or weak minded when I say I don’t get the reward for my effort. Because my effort is second to none and my reward is very little. Right now a reward for me is a cheat meal or a iced coffee. It’s sad lonely and depressing. Am I being to entitled???

352,"For context my family is from a third world country that we visit each year. It was one of my relatives (74 year old). My parents were discussing whether or not to call an ambulance, and I knew that the ambulance services were quite efficient in the area, but I didn’t tell him that intentionally (he was under the impression that they’re not). But then he anyways was asking (to everyone, not to me) “what’s the ambulance number”, when I told it to him, he said, “never mind, let’s take her by car, an ambulance is at least gonna take half an hour to come”, which I genuinely at the time thought was a valid point, so we took her by car, which took around 25 to 30 mins, and according to my dad, she passed away just before reaching the hospital. 

Now, after I checked on google, the average response time for an ambulance in my area was 17 minutes, which means that had I told him that the ambulance service was more efficient, he would be more likely to call an ambulance, which would’ve arrived, 10 minutes earlier than the time it took for us to go to the hospital, and she would’ve been alive at that point. Also, in the car she was sitting, which I think means that it’s harder for oxygen and nutrients to reach the brain, esp in the case of a heart attack (which she was having), so she could’ve lived even longer while in the wait for an ambulance (while lying down at home). Plus in an ambulance they have stuff like defibrillators etc.

I have spoken to my family about this, but they said that “while you were wrong to have those thoughts and not tell us, it wouldn’t have affected the outcome”. Also, my dad believes that the 17 minutes response time statistic is made up and in reality the time is much higher.

I know therapy is a great option, but unfortunately I cannot seek it because of a lack of money, and my parents are very much against the idea of therapy, as they’re religious

353,"So, I've got two brothers. One older than me, one younger than me.

For the past 2-3 years, each night has consisted of them being up as late as they can playing games. Which isn't that bad.

My older brother is fine for the most part, a little loud here and there, but if I ask him to be quiet then he'll try be quiet.

My younger brother though, currently 13, is causing havoc. At first it was annoying but bearable. He would play his game often, getting excited as he normally would while playing a game, then get off it when told to. 

As the years passed, it just worsened. He's up until absurd hours- often 4am or longer, playing his game. My mom moved out about a year or two ago, so it's just my dad, and my two sisters (adults). My dad falls asleep quite early and isn't really woken up by my brother yelling, unless it's very loud.

Along with each night getting louder and louder, the language is worse. F-slurs. N-slurs. Lots of swearing.  He puts his friends down often. Reminder: he's only 13.

Normally I would tell one of my sisters and ask them to get him off his game/tell him to be quiet (my dad often works late/I feel bad waking him up), and at first it worked okay. Later on, my younger brother started to use the ""you're not the boss"" thing. He still does. When my sisters say they don't care and will take his console or whatnot by force, he calls one of my parents who often let him stay up a little longer (they side with him).

I don't know what to do. Right now it's 2am and he's still up. I've messaged my sister asking if she can do anything and she messaged him to get off but he still hasn't. I messaged my parents asking him to get off (my dad's currently gone) and my sister called them both without answer.

He has not been allowed to drive for years and is not mentally aware enough to drive. He has also wandered off in the middle of the night on multiple occasions, often hides things like car keys and wallets around the house, moves furniture even though he is a fall risk, finds her credit cards and orders things online (he currently owns 8 ipads😅) and forgets major details in his life (his daughter died about 6 weeks ago and he still asks every few days where she is.)

I’m currently getting divorced from my wife, we broke up because I couldn’t have sex with her anymore. I was physically and mentally unable, I mean I could do it but it was repulsing me. So I guess ‘I didn’t want to’ maybe is more accurate.

She was a very pretty slim girl who I loved, I just couldn’t do it. I feel terrible about that. 

I don’t know how I can go forward. I’m ok being single for a bit, it feels nice and relaxing. I like saying I’m divorced even, because it means I had a wife. 

I tried the dating apps but I can’t keep my profile set to looking at men, I’ll message a few ladies with hardly any reply and then there are about 20 messages from men. 

Before the Coronavirus I was going to meet a really nice girl for a coffee. She was the full deal, super pretty and smart. I didn’t but I wanted to.

I think I am slightly using women as a shield to protect me from gay men. I was sexually assaulted and abused by men. I don’t like the idea of them. But I also really know deep down I’m attracted to men and I like to think about having a boyfriend.

Then I just need a wife because it feels really nice and safe to have a girlfriend. I’m a good husband so it’s not like I’m using her is it. It’s not like she is a ‘beard’ because I don’t care what people say about me, they can say I’m gay, my problem is with gay men near me.",08May2020,1
360,"So my heritage is Mexican/Hispanic but I live in the U.S

I grew up speaking both English and Spanish at home. When I reached middle school I began to take French classes since the only other option for foreign language classes was Spanish.

I took French for 5 years straight until my sophomore year of high school. I was able to actually able to get gain a comprehension on the French language (a huge part of that was due to French and Spanish being similar). But after 10th grade I stopped taking French classes.

Now I'm a junior in college. A couple of months ago I signed up for RosettaStone and began taking French lessons. I was surprised at how much knowledge I retained of the language so catching up didn't take long and now  I'm expanding on my knowledge of French.

French isn't the only language I've been trying to learn. Lately I've been trying my hand at leaning Japanese. I want to learn Japanese because I hope to visit Japan someday and I want to try and learn a language that isn't anything similar to English or Spanish. Plus I love anime lol.

So far, I've learn basic numbers and now I'm trying to learn harigana.

Unfortunately my family likes to make me feel stupid for learning both French and Japanese (more so for Japanese). My parents think it's a waste of time to learn French since I live in the U.S. and my sister calls me a weeaboo for trying to learn Japanese.

I mean, it's not going to stop me. But as I sit in my room taking lessons I can't help but feel stupid.

A few months ago, while at work, an African couple came in and there English was very broken. Eventually the gentleman pulled out his phone to bring up Google translate and I noticed his language setting was in French. I was actually able to help him with the limited French I was able to speak.

She didnt explicitly state it so but its safe to say she's a Muslim. 

I'm not religious nor do I mind dating a religious person, although i prefer someone non-religious. I attended bible studies with a friend and discussed the Quran with another. Learning about religion always interests me, just not practicing it of course. Anyways, muslims dont exactly permit dating, besides halal dating (with intent on marriage) let alone an atheist. I'm not sure how religious she is but I'm fairly confident her household would forbid it.

So given the circumstance, should I try to move on and perhaps be her friend or just leave her alone?",08May2020,1

363,"I know this sounds really gross and weird, but I have a bad habit of tearing off my toenails. It started with just cutting them short, but after awhile, I just started tearing them short instead, often going a little too far (like cutting to the quick) and drawing some blood. Now, with some of my smaller toes, the whole nail often comes off when I pull, sometimes with little to no resistance. Some of them are growing back strangely, too (either too small or in weird layers). 

I’ve tried painting my nails to stop myself, since I don’t want to ruin the color, but regularly painting them to keep them looking nice is a bit of a pain. Plus, some of them are so small, it’s almost pointless. 

If it helps, I used to bite my fingernails, but stopped because I like longer nails. I think that’s about when I switched to tearing off my toenails. I also have had other habits like tearing off the skin of my lips and ears to the point of scarring (which I have stopped and now only bite my lips, not touching my ears anymore). 

Basically, I don’t know what to do anymore. My toenails are hideous and I’m worried I may have done permanent damage because I’ve been doing this for many years now. Any advice?",08May2020,1
364,"Ive always been shy.  I never had a lot of friends but ive always had a few at least.  The last few years however, i cant seem to keep friends.  They usually last about 2 weeks to maybe 3 months.   I honestly do t know what im doing to run them off but they all go away completely with no desire to stay in touch at all. 

 At the beginning everything is fine.  I am generally considered smart, funny, kind, and thoughtful.  I try to be helpful and considerate.  I dont ask for things if i can help it.

I frequently make social faux pas that i guess are the problem.   Perhaps the annoyances just build until they cant stand the sight of me.  I dont know.  No one has told.me.

Each time, things end on pseudo good terms (""I'll call you"" then i find I'm blocked for example).  It just makes me so sad.  It keeps happening over and over so it has to be me but i cant get amyone to tell to me what the problem is.

I also have trust issues that go through the roof. I know I’m young but iv been cheated on before and it sucks and I don’t want her to feel like I’m not interested in our relationship because I really really am  and 14 is a really young age and I don’t know a lot yet. I love her a lot and I don’t want this to flop I obviously can’t go to my parents about this because my parents are extremely judgmental and they haven’t met her yet we’ve been together for about 11 months any advice would be helpful.

Is there something I’m missing with the simple fact that they can’t do that or something I can tell him to tell his landlord so that he doesn’t get screwed?

368,"A little backstory, my parents both raised me to believe what I want to believe as far as religion goes. My mom is Christian and my dad is a atheist. There has been problems between them about it before, like when we found out my mom was donating 30$ to a church every week, but it's never been a huge deal.

But two days ago, I think I said something that was negative to religion  (I don't exactly remember what it was). My mom heard this and got really upset, saying that I'm too young to say I believe in a religion or not. I talked about with her for a bit and I thought it was the end of that.

A few hours later I was in my room when she came in, she sat down on my bed and said the same things from earlier, I'm too young to know if I believe in something. I said that I just down believe in God and she has to accept that.

After I said that she started sobbing saying that I have to have a open mind about religion and I need to ""feel"" if I believe in God. I said that I personally don't believe in God, but I have an open mind about it. I suppose that didn't satisfy her enough because she kept saying the same thing until she adventually left.

It's important to note that my mom was the youngest  of seven children in a 4 bedroom home. Her and all of her brothers and sisters were raised Christian. 

I have only told my brother about this, mostly because I know he won't do anything about it.

374,"PLEASE READ; I am desperate and seeking advice through this difficult time in my life. I am using this account as a throwaway and deeply want to maintain anonymity when writing this post. I have never had the proper means to discuss these issues my family and I have faced and I am hoping to get some meaningful advice on here. My sibling is a popular streamer on the website Twitch (I wont say how many subs they have for anonymity’s sake) and portrays themselves to be charismatic, entertaining and kind-hearted. However, my sibling has been heavily abusing my family and I for the past 8 years both verbally and mentally. My sibling has belittled, degraded, criticized, manipulated, name-called, gaslit and tried to harm the characters of every single member in our family and I finally am done with it and need to take action. I need to defend my own honor and the honor of the rest of my family. My sibling believes they are untouchable, speaking both physically and in terms of public opinion. My sibling has diminished the self-esteem and self-worth of myself and our older sibling to the point of us both becoming profoundly depressed and traumatized. I have been told I am puny, retarded, worthless and a nobody. My mother has been called a f***ing b**ch, a c*nt and a failure as a mother by my sibling. When my sibling is confronted by our family, they have explosive and scary outbursts where they are speaking over everyone, screaming and yelling in our faces and foaming at the mouth from how angry they become. My sibling is a toxic abuser who manipulates their family and I can see it slowly killing my mother’s psyche. My mother breaks down crying when my sibling has their explosive episodes and I cannot handle seeing it ever again in my life. I am DONE. I need to know what the best action to take is. My sibling has prompted me to hit them in the past during their outbursts, but I never have as I don’t want to get the police involved or have our fight be traumatizing to our mother. I have been belittled for never hitting or touching my sibling, and they believe they have superiority and power over me because of it. I am physically more fit and athletic than my sibling and can seriously hurt them/hospitalize them if I wanted to. I have also deeply considered egging my sibling on to hurt me and then I can call the cops on them and get them arrested. I have also considered releasing audio of one of the most vile and hurtful outbursts my sibling has ever had towards our family to expose them and destroy their career. I am so distraught but I need some help in making this decision. I can no longer tolerate the abuse and have to defend myself in some way. I understand that most of my options involve ruining my relationship with my sibling for the rest of our lives, but if it means that my family will be safe, maybe that is a sacrifice I am willing to take.",08May2020,1

I will remember something cringe from my past (there's A LOT to choose from) without being prompted; just randomly at some point in the day. This then makes me start to say one of the following:

\-""I hate my life"" or ""I want to ddddiiiiieeeeee"" (don't actually want to for the record)

\-Some unintelligible noise of frustration.

I texted them back saying that we couldn't because there's 6 of us.

B: Um, it's fine

Me: I'm not getting arrested or fined.

B: You won't. It's one more person. (Not sure where she was getting her info but that's unimportant) Not a party. Those are the people who get fined.

(Another Friend: G) G: Oof. I sad. I wish we could see each other.

(Yet another friend: Y:) I was with a friend and then cops approached us. We said we were triplets (This is a lie, she has a twin but the third girl was unrelated. Also I believe in my country it's illegal to lie to officers) But I mean we had masks.

G: Wow.

Y: And we were social distancing.

G: Lucky.

B: Yeah it's fine, lol.

Me: (Copy and pasted measures:) **What are the new measures?** Public gatherings of more than two people will be banned. There will be exceptions for families and those living together.

B: Bruh there are like 10 people together outside. All the time.

Y: Yeah my neighbors have play group things.

B: Yeah.

Me: Well their just terrible people.

Y: That's kinda rude.

B: Its fine it's not like we are high and drinking with ten other people. And they are not.

Y: If anything don't hang with people inside at all.

Obligatory apology for formatting as I'm on mobile. I'll try to fix it later if I'm able. 

I'm in a bit of a pickle. I'm one semester away from finishing my general education at a small community college before I start degree work. When I started school in the fall of 2018 I thought I knew what I wanted to do and that was to be a psychiatrist because I love the idea of helping others. 

However, since then I've changed my mind more than once and I still don't know what I want to do. This is because I wanna help people and society in general, but at the same time I dont like large groups and prefer to work alone. I'd love to have an artistic career, but I want my career to be stable and so I can live comfortably. I'm terrible at math, so that closes quite a few avenues for me. Like, it's bad. I'm not too keen on a super active career as I have an injury that makes lots of extra fast paced activity excruciating. I love the topics of history, English, media, and science. I'm highly artistic and I'm incredibly passionate about it, but I know that it's not enough to survive off of.

I've done quizzes, looked at various careers that I might be interested in, talked to my school counselors, but nada. I feel so... IDK, apathetic I suppose you could say to each suggested career path. I've been struggling with this for a really long time and I just don't know what to do. I wanna do school right the first time because I'm paying for it all out of my own pocket and the last thing I want to do is incurre a mountain of debt. However, because school in the US is so expensive and I can't seem to commit to a career path, IDK how I can avoid that.

386,"I'm 22F living with my parents during this pandemic. I'm still dependent on them because I go to university and they pay for my appartment. I have anxiety and depression but stopped treatment because my parents said it wasn't helping me. I've recently been feeling worse and worse. I've relapsed to hurting myself and I think about suicide a lot. I can't stand living with my dad. He's controlling and yells at me which I can't handle. I have constant anxiety when he's around. He took away my key to my room so I don't even have any privacy. He doesn't knock. Everytime I hear footsteps outside the door I get jumpy. He always has a reason to get mad. I didn't clean my room. It is mostly clean to me which my mom agreed on. But apparently it has to be spotless? I didn't clean the kitchen enough. I stay in my room all day trying to avoid him. But he complains about me being in my room. Even if I do schoolwork. Which I basically do all day now.

He hurts me physically sometimes. He scratches my arm and acts as if it's no big deal but it hurts alot and leaves red marks. He puts me in headlocks. Slaps my butt which doesn't hurt but I really hate him doing that. He pokes me with his little wooden sticks that are for removing food from your teeth. He does things like that to my mom too. 

He gets angry when I look sad or mad which I sometimes can't control. He once got mad cuz I looked too happy because I'm not allowed to smile when I'm doing bad in school. I smile when I'm uncomfortable sometimes and he gets mad at that too. 

I haven't been getting any good sleep in weeks. I slept in today cuz I dont have any classes and he came into my room and yelled at me ""Does it feel good?"" I was still confused so I asked what? He just yelled the same thing then left. As soon as I got downstairs more yelling. Demanding to know what I do all day cuz he didnt see me after he came home from work. Questioning my about my grade demanding to see proof I haven't gotten it yet. 

I just want out of here. I wanna die.

Also, a lot of my family members are very overweight which is frowned upon in japan highly. I know I REALLY do sound like an asshole, but I can’t help but feel ashamed of that.

I don’t know what to do but I know if my boyfriend met my family he would never look at me in the same way again and I don’t want him thinking  “what kind of people are they”. people can say I’m overreacting or I’m wrong but if you know Japanese people, you KNOW they’re all mostly well educated, super thin, polite, and quiet. The opposite of my family. Sometimes I really feel like downright white trash. I’m sorry for the offensive language but it’s how I feel. I want to just run away from my family and recreate myself.

I'll be posting this both on r/Advice and r/legaladvice since it's escalated, and it will probably end in divorce.

This morning, we were supposed to be heading to my grandmas house like we do biweekly. I usually don't like going there, but I still bear with it. My grandma is an ok person, but my dad isn't, and he makes the trip awful. My dad was watching the news, and I wanted to ask him ""How long does it take to get from here to my grandmas house?"". He paused it and I asked him, but I was met with yelling.

He was yelling ""Don't fucking ask me questions related to Ajman"", and ""I know you don't want to go, you selfish fuck"". He started swearing in Arabic too, which I don't really know much about. He told my brother to pack his things and drove him to my grandmas house. He would've left me alone here, but my mom stood up for me and said she wasn't going either if he didn't apologize for blowing up over nothing.

My dad didn't take my mom either, so we're both here. My dad threatened us, saying that when he gets back, we're ""ruined"". My mom was crying. I couldn't believe this coward of a man would leave his wife like this, with only her son to comfort her. I tried my best and I stood by her, but she's having some difficulty coming to grips with ending a 20+ year divorce.

I know I have to respect my moms decision, but I feel like divorce would be the best option here. But here is the thing, if they divorce, even if my mom keeps the house and kids, we would have to leave the UAE since my mom doesn't have a work visa. Here are some details to help with the legal side of things:

I'm only 14 so bear with me hear, feel free to ask for more details in the comments, any help would be greatly appreciated.

\-My dad is the bread winner, he's still paying of some stuff for the house they recently bought

\-My mom is dependent of my dad financially.

\-I'm 14 and my little bro is 7

\-My dad will probably be diagnosed with Narcissistic personality disorder

392,"When I(18f) checked my school email today I opened an email that basically told me I'm required to withdraw from my University. I don't know what to do and I can't tell anybody because I've been lying to everybody around me and telling them I'm a good student.

I expected it to be honest because I've failed every class that I've this year (I'm a first year student). I was actually doing really well my second semester but after covid-19 happened I was forced to study and do my exams in my extremely toxic home environment. So any chance of doing well was basically gone.

I've had a really rough year this year. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety which didn't go over well with the family, and part of the reason why I'm depressed is because of them. My parents are against medication for things like depression and anxiety because they ""change your personality"" so I was never able to take meds. My parents are going through a really nasty divorce and there's always fighting in the house. My dad is a real piece of shit who's essentially been draining all of our money and cheating on my mom every chance he gets. He blames their problems on me and has been verbally abusing me every chance he gets. My grandma's been diagnosed with the most aggressive form of lung cancer there is and doesn't have much longer to live, and my mom can't be with her because of covid-19. She's really stressed and upset and if I tell her what's going on I think I'd break her. Everything's been going downhill and somehow I can't help but feel like it's my fault.

I'm so upset with myself because I know I should've tried harder and pushed past everything that was going on and just studied. At this point I don't even know what to do anymore. I wrote this post because I have absolutely no one to talk to. I don't know what to do with myself.

I have the opportunity to appeal the withdraw. If anyone has experience with this- though I doubt many of you won’t, I’d appreciate if you could help.

If anyone has advice on what to do I would really appreciate it. If this is the wrong sub I'm sorry. I posted this on another sub but I need all the advice I can get. Thanks.",08May2020,1
393,"I’m a second year uni student sharing a room with my boyfriend in a 5 bedroom flat with 4 of my friends. Out of the blue my “friends” decided to make a group chat without me and talk about flatting the following year. They decided to flat without me and with another one of my friends. After we’d already decided that we’d all flat together. They went back on their word and it’s honestly just so shitty of them. It gets worse because the girl who I thought of as my “best friend” in the flat said that she didn’t want to flat with two couples (there’s another couple in the flat already but they’re not sharing a room this year). Her reason for this is “because of the rent” but the rent doesn’t change at all if you’ve got two couples. I just don’t understand why they’ve done this. I’ve already asked how they feel about me and they say there’s no issues there so idk. I’m a decent flat mate, I do dishes, clean, and cook for the flat so I’m hoping someone could help me figure out what’s wrong. Either they’re just really shitty people or idk. Unsure what I should do, I’m juggling between moving out for next sem, or bearing living with people who betrayed me.",08May2020,1
394,"So here's the thing, we're final year architecture students, and we had to submit our thesis work by last Monday and we did, but today when I saw our grades I was shocked. Because my friend scored way way more than I did even after submitting a half assed, incomplete, poor quality thesis work. Whereas I poured my heart and soul into it, did a quality job, didn't sleep for days, pulled dozens of all nighters, and still scored considerably low.

I can understand if my poor score was due to the fact that I couldn't give a proper presentation over a zoom call because I was sleep deprived but still shouldn't the actual work matter at all? Even if my friend were to give a proper presentation shouldn't her work be considered incomplete and hence be given the score she deserves?

Pardon me if I'm being a little unclear I'm still a little sleep deprived and I'm angry, and I don't want to be angry, I don't want to hold this against my friend, I don't like how this thesis is causing a rift between us. 

I know a lot of you would say that score doesn't matter but know this, if you've poured your heart and soul into something, if you did something out of passion, and then still you score some decent grades, you'd be pretty unhappy because all this hardwork leads to higher expectations. And now someone, who didn't do anything at all for months, suddenly completed their work, correction, half assed their work in 2 nights and still managed to score more than you, you'd be pretty angry too.

And this isn't the first time this has happened, it has happened previously but I didn't care for it before because she did work hard back then, or we put in equal amount of effort. I always shrugged it off because she's a girl and I'm a guy of course she's going to score better than me, because those pervy professors love to give higher grades to girls. But this CROSSES THE LINE because this is our life's work(so far). You can't just give her better grades because she's a girl, because when she shows this to some firm when she applies for a job they won't deem it to be acceptable, because it's that poor. She admitted it herself that she did not care for it when she wrote it, so how can you grade it to be an A+ thesis when there's literally half the stuff missing.!? 

Here's for all the architects out there,(if any, sorry for nerding out) she didn't complete her thesis report, she didn't render her plans, she didn't put in grids or measurements, she didn't render her sections, and she didn't even make a 3D model. And that's her thesis work.

Honestly, I'm loosing my mind over it, my parents are asking me to let it go, they don't mind if I get bad grades, but it's not about them, it's about what's fair. Even another friend of mine whose work is far better than mine scored less than my best friend. 

What should I do about it? Should I ask my parents to talk to the professors? Although I don't like to snitch her out like that or put her in focus and make a big deal out of it, because I hate being angry and jealous of my friend, who did nothing wrong. 

Sorry if you don't understand half of it, like I said I'm not in my senses as of now.",08May2020,1
395,"Hi reddit, I need help with a big problem. I didn’t really know where to post this but as I’ve been feeling sad/guilty about my situation. I’m 21 living In NJ &amp; come from a loud Italian family(grandparents born in Italy)if you’re from Nj/ny you know what I’m talking about. Lots of slang. watch the sopranos or  Daniel franzese on Instagram and his Italian mom series. They grew up in the city and say things like “that don’t make sense” or “I don’t want nothing from you” instead of using proper English grammar. They greet people super loudly and Scream out in public, make scenes, &amp; have thick nj/ny accents. I love my family and I don’t care how they speak. However, I’m not like my family. I’m articulate and have studied Italian in uni and am fairly well educated. Im not boasting about myself, however I want to make the contrast between my family and I apparent. We live in an area where a lot of the working class people moved out and now “yuppies” are moving in. I feel embarassed by family to where I don’t want to in public with them. Ive thought about moving  away to a new town/state bc my family really gets around and knows a lot of people in this town and the surrounding areas and I’m terrified they’ll approach me in public if they see me with friends and ask embarrassing questions or make a scene. My bf of 1.5 years is from japan &amp; the culture difference between Japanese and Italian American is HUGE. he’s super quiet and his family is all well to do, he loves me and accepts me but I do not want him anywhere near my family. Also, a lot of my family members are very overweight which is frowned upon in japan highly. I know I REALLY do sound like an asshole, but I can’t help but feel ashamed of that. I think I would be ok with them being  loud bc I could tell them to tone down their speech and try to act “normal” but the weight problem can’t just go away. Some uncles in my family also have mafia connections, that also petrifies me. I don’t know what to do but I know if my boyfriend met my family he would never look at me in the same way again and I don’t want him thinking  “what kind of people are they”. people can say I’m overreacting or I’m wrong but if you know Japanese people, you KNOW they’re all mostly well educated, super thin, polite, and quiet. The opposite of my family. Sometimes I really feel like downright white trash. I’m sorry for the offensive language but it’s how I feel. I want to just run away from my family and recreate myself. Only problem is all the Job opportunities are on the east coast. I’m so sorry for this post being long and if I sound dramatic but i can't talk about this topic with anyone as they have no idea I feel this way and would judge me. I hope I did not offend anyone by this post and I want to make it CLEAR I love my family if it were not for them I wouldn’t be in this world Please try to understand where Im coming from before any judgement.",08May2020,1

400,"A friend of mine mentioned that he learned that theres a belief that we as individuals accept what we are by being alive. Its a ""social contract"". In other words, by you and I working, going to school, accepting our ethnicity, class etc we are agreeing to be part of this world. Maybe im wrong in the way i heard him explain it, or maybe im wrong altogether. But these doubts have been growing in me for a while. 

The more i see the news. The more i study in school. The more I think about ""whats the purpose of all this?"" I feel more alone. I feel like im the only one thinking like this. Why do i have to study? Why do i have to work? Why was I born? When did i agree to be part of all this? The world is full of pain, greed, and suffering of all types. Why would a life like this be considered a ""blessing""? And why would i be here to ""learn""?  Learn what? To be a good person, for what? To make me ""feel good"" that im helping people? 

What is the reason for all this? Why am I here? Why do i have to sit, listen, and be part of a society when I know that my time here is finite? What guarantee is there that all of this isnt in vein?

How can I know that this life that I have right now is even real? How do i know that any of this is even real? I feel so alone, yet im surrounded by friends and family. And im grateful for it. But whats the purpose of all this? When did i sign up to be alive? 

To live for a couple of decades. Go to school, get a job, raise a family and then just die?  And at the same time just work and study while theres shit like war and famine happening everywhere and we just sit there like its normal? 

My own existence here on this planet  causes the world to die a bit faster. I feel like a parasite thats aware that its part of a species thats killing its host. And at the same time i question my own existence in all this. 

I never remember signing up for this. I know it probably looks like a rant thats going in all types of directions and im sorry. I just want to know if anyone else feels like this too. 

Thank you for reading if you did.",08May2020,1
401,"For the longest time I've always felt like I didn't belong, that I didn't fit in. Surrounded by people but always feeling alone. I had no sense of direction, just letting life come to me with opportunities, riding that wave and never really choosing a path. I've failed alot of things, as a husband, as a friend, as a son and as a human. I wish I could have done things better, chosen a direction and made something of myself. Always following the path to least resistance. Dropping out of college and terrible grades all led to an uneducated future. An uncertain future. The place I grew up is a blackhole where any sense of moving forward in life is non existent. Maybe I never got the teachings I needed to have a chance at a decent life but I don't blame anybody but myself. A family, a place to live, a car, a dog and a cat, all the milestones in life felt out of reach. I needed to get out and had originally planned on immigrating to Australia or New Zealand but settled for Canada.

For a time I was so happy, Canada brought so many hopes and I went there to see what would happen, to begin a new life, as a new person. I never had any intention to stay or to leave just to experience life, and if I liked it then I would stay there. The warm summers, the cool winters, the landscapes, the food, the people were everything I dreamed of and I fell in love with it.

I started working in construction and really liked learning about the process and creating. But I got an opportunity to work in a gym. The owner made me feel like I could be somebody, that I could do something great even though I hadn't got qualifications but had experience, he gave me a shot. I loved it there. I am forever grateful that I met him. The people, the community, the lifestyle, it was everything I was searching for. It was like an American dream so to say. 

I found a person there that I immediately took a liking to. She was so full of energy, so much kindness and exuding confidence everytime I watched her teach or workout. I will always remember the day I met her. I came to the gym looking to try a class, and even with experience she insisted I attend a fundamentals class. I came off as a cocky shit, when in actuality, internally I was the complete opposite. I remember at the beginning a class she approached me from across the room and introduced herself, that had never happened to me before. I was awestruck. The more I got to know her the more I wanted to know about her. She fascinated me. We ended up becoming close, but I couldn't commit to her as I was already in a relationship. It was hard for her, not knowing exactly where you stand. Feeling like you're the second option. It was hard, not wanting to hurt someone I knew a long time but wanting to discover everything I could about her. She has always done her best to help me, to make me feel special, to make my life easier. She had my back, wrote funny cards to me, on my worst days she would always bring me back up by just smiling and hugging me. She would always try. I don't think I've ever laughed as hard as I have then when I'm with her. The adventures, the hikes, the road trips, late night walks, cooking and baking together.. 

When I felt homesick she arranged tickets for me to visit home and a gathering at the gym, to this day nobody has ever done anything like that for me, such a selfless kind act.

When I was back in home that time, I couldn't stop thinking about her, and I said to myself ""I want to go home"" then i realised i was talking about her and Canada.. My home was where she was.. 

When she visited her home country with her father I missed her everyday!! I fell so in love with this girl..

In the years together I genuinely felt like I had found the one I wanted to have a life with, a family, a future. I have many regrets, words that I said that I didn't mean, petty behaviour, not doing enough for us, not doing enough for her, not my absolute best to stay so I could be with her..

After the gym had closed I chose to follow her and not go with the chance of sponsership with Kalev, another wrong decision. Maybe with Kalev I could have stayed through sponsorship but who knows. It was me who didn't do the necessary things to keep me in Canada. And my Visa expired and I chose to stay rather than leave, sealing my inevitable fate.. 
I became resentful of how easy other people seemed to have it, but it was my choice not to follow that same path, and my choice to act bitterly. Spending all day in a gym with no clients is stressful, wheres the money coming from, how do we get business, but she stood by me and we made it work. She helped to find a place to live after the demolition of my current place at that time, a beautiful place near her parents so we could still be close. We almost lost that apartment and I reacted disgracefully, I'm ashamed of my behaviour, I took out my frustration on her. I wish I did that differently. She started working in a womans shelter to help make ends meet and was working an ungodly schedule and hours plus helping me at the gym. In that time I should have done more for her.. 

We had our first big fight at then and I remember it.. Shouting at her in the rain and walking off and her crying, it breaks my heart and I feel so bad about how she felt, about my actions, I am so sorry for that, I really wish I could change that.. 

When we moved to our new place after that things got better for a time. I loved our time there. It felt like home finally, our home. We had planned to marry to give our relationship a chance I had planned a trip to Whistler and Scandinav Spa to getaway and propose to her in a romantic way. It was my responsibility to book it and I left it to the last minute then asked her to do it, I wish I had done it.. It was a shitty thing to do.. 
The first night there was great we had some drinks and food and things were going really well, I should have popped the question there and then, I don't know why I didn't, I guess it just didn't feel like the right time.. Is there such a thing as a right time.. 
During a walk before Scandinav spa I continuously asked her ""would you say yes if I asked you to marry me?"" I way looking for reassurance in some way as nerves got the better of me, not very romantic, again I didn't feel like it was the right time.. 

On the way back I asked her to pull into lighthouse park as I remembered one of our first dates were to the point lookout.. I chose the wrong time to propose after waiting for the right time and the rings were Rose gold which she doesn't like. We argued all the way home and I took the ring back.. It was her ring, she deserved it, it was not my right to hold it from her.. I'm ashamed that I did that, I was hurt that she didn't like that suprise and I wish I could've done it all differently.. 

The day of our marraige was honestly the happiest I ever felt, when I seen her I couldn't stop smiling, my breath caught in my throat. I had seen the most beautiful woman. Her family all pulled together to make it possible, from the arrangements, the schedules, the DJ, the Flowers, everything. Without them it would never have been possible and I'm forever grateful to them.. 
I had married my best friend, my partner, and this was a step into our future together..

When she decided to attend a QA bootcamp we agreed to live with her parents as we couldn't afford to live in our current place, although looking back I wish we stayed and worked on things, I know it would have worked..
In the time with her family, I felt like I had become a part of her family, they were the best people.. Kind like her.. I loved how close they are, many conversations over dinner and tea, exploring histories and cultures, I learned alot from them.
I love them.. 

When she told me that she doesn't want to seperate but thinks we should seperate because theres nothing else to do I was devastated. How could a person who was in love with me think a seperation would help. It felt like she didn't want to try anymore, to give up on us.. 

It was a difficult time with the gym, just life in general had become stagnant and I wasn't doing the papers to stay.. I never wanted to seperate and a seperation means I lose my wife and the person who I felt had my back truly, who I loved so dearly..

On our 1st anniversary I had the Wedding band and Engagement ring remade to gold as it should have been from the start and I rewrote my vows as promises.. I told her that if she accepts the rings and vows then that means we can try again and work through it.. She accepted them and I started to have hope that it would all be ok and work out..
The next couple of weeks were emotional ups and downs. From sleeping in the same bed to sleeping on the floor, barely being able to speak without breaking down.. I felt like I was was losing my wife and best friend again.. She thought that I should move out at the end of that month giving me 2 weeks to find a place.. It was heartbreaking.. I found a place and tried to adjust as best as I could, all while missing her so much.. It was all I could think of.. 
On my birthday a large group of our friends and gym members came to the Blarney Stone.. She showed up dressed in an entirely new outfit, looking really beautiful.. Throughout the night, I was drinking heavily and started to think about her, the situation, what is going to happen and I left the Pub in a haste and proceeded to text her drunkenly obnoxious messages.. I am ashamed of my behaviour and I wish I had bought her a drink, slowed down, and just had a good time with her.. 
I felt like my only option was to leave Canada, the seperation, the place I was living was being vacated and I had closed the gym.. 
To this day I can't feel that if I had stayed and made it work that we could still be together.. Work construction or any job I could find for cash, complete the spousal paperwork, file my taxes, work towards a better future.. 
But I left..

When I got back to home I spent 2 months barely moving, I had no motivation, life had changed to the point it was unrecognizable.. Deep down I vowed to make it back and show her I could be her partner.. But if it was going to end, it would end face to face.. I've held onto hope that we would give it a proper try and see where it goes, weather it be I go back to Canada on the spousal sponsorship, I go back to construction and work my way to a fully qualified tradesman and gym partime with the highest paying clients or choose a different career path all together if possible or she moves here and I continue my job and study in the evening at school.. 

When she came here it was to give me the answer to if we were going to try or not. It was incredible, I felt close again, I felt like we were dating and adventuring, we were intimate, we had a chance, my hopes were at an all time high.. She would say she misses me and she loves me and it ment so much to me.. Then the Pandemic came, and it messed up any plans of being together.. Its been 6 months, and it could be another 6 months before anything is lifted.. I don't want to wait another day being without her but I would wait and do what I can, because I love this girl.. Doesn't matter the time.. 
I've always believed fondness makes the heart grow stronger, and mine has grown stronger, but it seems out of sight out of mind applys.. 

She told me she wants to end things over Skype, that's it's unfair to both of us, and that if she did try it wouldn't really be trying, my hopes completly shattered.. How can a couple of days before, you say you love and miss the person then just end things.. Words are very powerful when used by people you love, they hurt and they mean so much more.. There are things that I don't understand and I probably never will, what can change in the space of a month, a few days, why say things you don't mean or go back on the things you do mean. Am I not worth a it, are we not worth trying for. I don't understand, I felt like we were back together again since February and I never gave up hope.. 
Even if we tried and she didn't try properly I would try harder, for both of us, its a partnership.. I never will give up on her.. I will always have her back when she needs me..

Its always easier to remember the bad times and forget about the good times and I am still in love with her and I don't blame anybody else for this but myself.. I'm sorry that it came to this and I hope one day you can understand.. My biggest regrets were hurting the people I care about, the people I love, and never doing enough.. 

What do I do now?",08May2020,1
402,"I am completely obsessed with my boyfriend's EX and I've no idea what to do about it.

About their previous relationship: they were together 4 years ago and were each others first. I am the first person my bf has dated since. She still lives in France, we live in the UK. 

When I started feeling obsessed: Before we got together he'd casually mention her, but I was never too bothered about his ex up until our relationship got serious and we moved in together. In February I found out that she rejoined social media and I spent a month routinly looking at her Instagram. Eventually I realised that this isn't normal and I tried stopping looking at her account, but I became addicted and ACTUALLY had withdrawal symptoms. I have a daily checklist of not looking her accounts up but I still cave in sometimes. My lowest ebb has been using my bf's laptop for work reasons and during a particularly boring call, I looked at her mother's profile on Facebook and skimmed through pictures of her. (He's still fb friends with her family since their parents are good friends) I would NEVER look through my bfs phone or social media, and I'd completely lose trust if he did that to me, so I feel disgusted in doing that. 

Talking to my bf about it: I've been 100% transparent about it and he knows how I feel. He's very reassuring that he does not care about her, and I believe him. Although nothing is black and white, she hurt him really badly during their breakup, so naturally he doesn't like her. But he's a respectful person and always makes sure to add that he could have acted better when telling me about her cheating on him ect

What really pushed me to write this out (despite feeling incredibly heavy hearted just typing this) is that we started planning moving to France and he said there is an English speaking restaurant I could work in...and then he mentioned it was the place that he frequented with his ex. That broke my heart and completely made me lose interest in moving!

I've tried everything to stop feeling this way, which meant a lot of candid conversations with my bf, deep reflections of whats making me feel so insecure and considering going to therapy. Reading online articles about this have said that perhaps this has to do with possessiveness but I don't think that it's the case either. I'm fine with him playing games and chatting with his female friends and I even be happy to spend a single night in when he's out with some friends. Perhaps this is all just a mental illness of mine and I know deep down that this has nothing to do with her but everything to do with me. 
 
Does anyone have some insight on what I should do? Or has anyone felt this way before? Please let me know, I'm desperate. It scares me that my behavior could potentially be considered that of a stalker and I want to desperately stop, but I need to try new methods because nothing is working so far!


(One little bit of background information: my day job is (basically) an investigator and I create profiles for fraudulent people on a daily basis. This means that I know how to figure things out about someone based on their social media: I knew when she broke up with her bf, I see that she lives in Caen and I saw little background details about her based on the pictures she posted. I hate the fact that I know so much about her because it REALLY isn't healthy) 
(Clarification; I don't think that it's anything that my BF or his EX did to make me feel this way, I'm convinced that it's all in my head)",08May2020,1

405,"Hi, briefly about myself... Im a 17yo girl. Studies in boarding school, my parents are busy with work 24/7, locked at home alone most of the time which is why I begged to go to a residential school so that i wouldn't be lonely.
Long story short... Here i am alone at home because of quarantine with only my Television, smartphone and food to accompany me. I don't receive much parenting because most of the time my parents are too tired to think of home issues.
So now school is about to reopen after the pandemic and i seriously haven't studied anything. My school mates have all studied hard and during a recent online test my friend got higher marks then me. Usually i would score top marks but now i am in the 19th position from being in the top 10 in school. Ive gain weight and got acne. Besides that I feel like my old life before entering boarding school (I mean the life with bullying, loneliness and no one to talk to) is starting to come back.
I want to study and get back on track but when I'm alone i don't even know how fast time flies I mean its been 70 plus days in quarantine and i haven't stepped out of home. Everytime i try to sit and study i get carried away by television shows, social media and biggest weakness YouTube. I have 32 unfinished homework and I am extremely lazy. 
Plus I love my family but the only time we spent time together is at night during a silent movie watch ending with my dad being drunk and using his phone and stressinv over work related issues while my mum is watching her own TV shows in her phone or doing her work online. Moreover i spent my lonely time masturbating and watching porn too. 
Based on this I need some real advice and honestly even if the advice is pretty straight and strict I think I need it. 
1. Should I be spending my time in this non talking family moment or should i be focusing on other things related to education?
2. How on earth am I gonna study I feel so scared that Im left back on studies and that I lack time?
3. Any advice based on my situation...",08May2020,1

408,"Hey random internet strangers, I'm new to this sub. Wondering if I can get some help in any way shape or form... (Sorry, it's a bit of a read)

I'm at a point where the tension between my mum and partner (who we'll call Dylan) is not only severely affecting their mental health, but mine also. There's so much background to this, but I'll try and explain as succinctly as possible. 

Background for 'Dylan': He is 20, has a diagnosed anxiety disorder and at the end of 2018 he was thrown out of his home by his mum. This was a hugely traumatic time for him and has affected him very deeply. I met him around that time, but was unaware of all this until much later. 

Background for my mum: she has had a very tough and traumatic life herself and currently has the stress of being full time carer for my elderly grandparents, one of whom can be extremely verbally abusive towards not only the other, but the whole household at times. Which as you might imagine causes a lot of stress and anxiety for everyone as we never know when the next hammer will drop. Along with that she works from home and has that on her plate, among other things. 

Dylan and I started unofficially dating about this time last year and officially started dating in the August following. Around about August was when he was living almost full time at my family home (we live separately downstairs), and officially moved in in December. My household has my mum and brother living upstairs in the back part of the house (above our downstairs area) and my grandparents living upstairs in the front part of the house. My grandparents own the house and as such I pay 'rent' to them to live there and help out with bills, essentially. When Dylan moved in it was always assumed he would need to do the same: pay the same amount of rent to my grandparents to live there. This is what he was told all along, by the way. He had the understanding that he would move in and pay a set rent to my grandparents. Come December when it was agreed he was going to move in, my grandparents asked that he pay that money to them and welcomed him to the house.  During the time that Dylan was living with us unofficially he was out of work and was struggling to pay his own rent at the place he had at the time and as such I was lending him money to make it through (which he paid in full as soon as he got a job and made the money to).

Now when Dylan first started coming around (about this time last year), my mum was not exactly the most welcoming of people and this put Dylan in an anxious state around mum. He has his own mummy issues, let alone being unwelcomed my mine. Along with this, Dylan is a bit of a 'lazy teenager' and can be very self oriented and makes reward bases decisions. He was of course grateful to have somewhere to live, but didn't really show it to the people that mattered (my family). He would often leave dishes behind in the kitchen, not offer to help out with things etc. Generally not a very giving person when it came to it. This is partially because he's not been raised to ask if he can help, rather wait until someone asks for help; partially because I don't think he really thinks about other people sometimes and partially because of his anxiety. Mum became increasingly hostile towards him, and hence he retracted even further - a vicious cycle.

 It came to a day where he'd been out and wasn't responding to my calls (not uncommon for him to do), and I got so upset and it tipped mum over the edge. The next day, with no discussion whatsoever, she introduced a 'reward system' whereby he had to pay her $10 a day and through a series of listed jobs he could get a 'reward bonus' and get $5 off per day. There was an extravagant list of rules for gaining the discount, along with ways he could gain 'demerit points' which would then null and void the discount he'd gained for a particular day.

From his POV: he was being penalised and extorted for money, and the agreement that he thought was the case to live with me had suddenly changed with no discussion.

From her POV: she was encouraging him to put back into the household. 

At the time I thought, 'yeah maybe it will work and help encourage him to contribute to the family'. However, the system put a great deal of stress on Dylan and he was in a constant state of anxiety for fear of being demerited etc, and his mental health declined a lot. He focused so much on the system and making sure he had done things he wasn't exercising much, wasn't happy in general. Mum thought the system was working because he was finally putting back.

Fast forward a little while, it got to the point Dylan was so stressed with the system, the dynamic and how he was being treated by mum. They had several conversations I was not privy to, and both have different recounts of them so I can't be sure of who's version of things is more accurate. Anyway, we realised it was possible mum had put a couple of demerit points that were unmerited and this made Dylan extremely upset as that, for one, was unfair and abuse of power, and also meant work he'd done was erased. Dylan and I then argued about this and the fact that he'd been seriously thinking about 'being homeless' (see: accruing enough materials to camp permanently essentially, and live somewhere close by as a nomadic homeless man), as he had nowhere else to go. Side note: he had been threatened to be kicked out by mum by this point and that hit a big nerve as you might imagine. I was infuriated by his potential plan as I didn't want him to leave, and I knew it was unrealistic to do what he was thinking. But this goes to show how mentally taxed he was at the time, he literally wasn't thinking clearly he just wanted to get out. The argument blew up, he left to cool off and I was so mad I went upstairs and tore up the 'system' sheet. In my rage I didn't realise I then couldn't prove what I thought to be true, and couldn't prove what I was saying in an ensuing argument with mum. 

Basically this all lead to me 'revising' the system and coming up with something more fair. I drafted a new system, discussed it with both parties, and got both to sign so it wasn't just something that I decided and implemented like mum had before me. The gist of the new system was he paid a certain amount to her per month, and if he did enough jobs he got a 50% discount. There was nothing stating he *had* to do jobs, just that he had the opportunity to gain a discount which worked better with his mindset and also meant there couldn't be unfair demerits given. 

Fast forward a month, we had a kitchen built downstairs and as such can now live completely independently downstairs. Since the new system was implemented, nothing has been addressed. We have actually been living in peace and living downstairs with no hassle for us or mum. He hasn't made any mess upstairs, and instead has improved significantly with his thoughtfullness and does jobs when I need him to. He takes care of the bins every week etc, and cleans the bathroom when needed which I'm super grateful for. All up until a few days ago when mum wanted to discuss things and have her money paid to her. This has dug up a whole lot of shit, and also raises the question - why should he be paying her now  if he lives completely independently downstairs, pays his dues to my grandparents (who I'll remind own the house, my mum does not)? It doesn't seem fair to have a system with the new circumstances. She would disagree, but we are yet to discuss that in the presence of a counselor in a week and a half. 

Now today I had an argument with my brother about everything and he essentially ended up arguing that my mum's trauma far outweighs, and apparently invalidates, Dylan's and therefore her actions are justifiable and she has done nothing all too terrible. Whereas he is the reason we are the in this situation and she has every right to try and protect me from a relationship she deems unhealthy, and his background and own traumas shouldn't be taken into account. He should just 'fix things' and 'rebuild bridges' which have been burnt largely through mums hostility. There are so many more extraneous variables and facts, but this should cover it enough to give context. 

I'm so stressed, I'm constantly in the middle of arguments, I have almost no where to turn and given the current pandemic it's even harder to just find someone to talk to and help me. I'm really not sure what to do. We've thought about moving out together, and even looked into a few possibilities but financially it's pretty tough for us to do so right now so it doesn't leave much option. And what happens if after counselling she turns even more and tries to throws him out? 

Anyhow, thanks for listening. It's actually helped a bit to write things out and get some stuff out",08May2020,1
409,"A few weeks ago I ordered an Xbox One game for my housemate’s birthday. My housemate is German and so I decided to order the game from a German site (I wasn’t aware at the time that most European imports have English language only except on the box, haha). Five days back the package comes but inside it’s a different title than the one I ordered. 

I’d emailed them before to ask a question and they replied within a day, but since I’ve been writing them about this issue they have ignored every single email I’ve sent them. When I looked them up (something I should have done before buying admittedly) I saw LOTS of complaints that their customer service sucks and that they frequently mess things up. So now I’m concerned that I’m basically gonna be out £45 with no recourse.

Is there any government body or consumer’s advice bureau in Germany I can write to in order to pressure this company into arranging a return and refund, or do I just have to eat the loss?",08May2020,1
410,"Recently I've been wondering if it's better to bottle up my feelings instead of being vulnerable with people so as not to lose my relationships with them.

I know bottling things up is unhealthy but isn't it worse to not have close relationships with anyone in your life? I am a very stubborn and difficult person to deal with. I have so much baggage due to my mental illnesses, autism, self hatred, history of body dysmorphia, etc. I have difficulty believing anything positive someone says about me; if someone compliments me I can come up with countless reasons why they're wrong or I'll be like ""what's your reasoning for thinking that about me?"" (and upon them answering me I go back to coming up with reasons why they're wrong). I'm also the type of person who needs constant reassurance about things. Like if I feel like I made someone mad or upset or hate me somehow, I need constant reminders that they don't hate me. I've gotten a little better at providing myself with reassurance, I've tried to see how long I can go without asking for it from others because I know it's annoying as fuck. But I can never really make enough progress or manage to not set myself right back at square 1.

There's been something I've been stressing over for months now, I won't get into it because it's irrelevant but there's one main person who's been my support system through it all and they've told me that I'm not being a burden on them and that they'd tell me if my venting/reaching out for support became too much for them to handle. But I've got it in my head now that they're getting exhausted with me and I'm on my way to ruining my friendship with them. Because, given the behavior I described, I always tend to ruin things with people who I vent to/seek support from. Usually I reach a point where I'm like ""okay this person is clearly and understandably tired of trying to help me out when I'm not responsive/don't make enough progress so I'll just stop talking about my feelings with them altogether"" but in some cases I've just straight up driven people away due to them seeing just how difficult and mentally ill I am. There's another person who I've been growing closer to recently and they've told me that I can talk to them whenever I need to, but I'm scared to do that. I feel like even if I try to do it in as restrained a manner as possible, I'm still gonna end up showing them too much of my bad qualities and drive them away from me.

So like. Should I just stop trying to seek help/support from others so I can have good relationships with them? I know the easy answer is just ""stop being so fucking messed up, just try to be nice to yourself and believe the nice things people tell you and try to not rely on others for reassurance too much, just believe them for once"". And I've tried, I have, but I must not be capable of it or be strong enough because I keep failing. How many times do you have to fail before it's clear that you're not capable of something? 

I know seeking professional help is also an option but I'm not sure I could afford that at the moment, and even if I could, I think I'm too difficult for even a professional to get through to me so it would just be a waste of money.",08May2020,1
412,"My living situation has turned toxic. I can still live here but I am not happy in my household and I need to leave.

413,"I (16F) don't know if I'm overreacting or if it's a serious issue but for a year now I've thought that my brother (10M) could have ADHD. He does really well in school and he seems to have a lot of friends. He's been insensitive a couple times since sometimes he insults other kids' interests and makes fun of them, and he makes racist jokes or comments which he thinks are funny. My parents have already told him that isn't acceptable and I haven't heard anything like that since. He has really obvious mood swings, like one moment he'll be smiley and helpful then something sets him off and he becomes passive aggressive until it wears off the next day. He's usually really sweet and I can ask him to do things no problem (like ""go read your book"", ""can you bring me water?""). Then other times I'll affectionately call him ""dummy"" or ""idiot"" (which is no problem when he's in a good mood) and he's pissed off and bothers everyone on purpose. I sort of feel like this is a normal sibling relationship? On some occasions he gets really angry and violent (hitting, screaming, crying) over insignificant things. For example, I had a pack of cards that he wanted and I told him there were more downstairs and that he can't always have the same things I have. He went bonkers and I locked myself in my room so my parents could calm him down. Maybe I was being too childish by arguing with him? I know there's a lot of over diagnosis so I'm not sure if this is regular kid behavior. Our parents are a little close-minded, like if you aren't ""normal"" then there's something wrong with you. Do you think I should bring this up with my parents or am I just overreacting?",08May2020,1
414,"I am house No. 3 in a joined row of 4 houses. I have lived here for 3 years. I rent, No.1 and no.4 own, no.2 is a government housing. I am friendly with no.1 and no.4. 

Late last year, a new tenant moved into 2, and after a month, he moved someone into his garage. This person has severe violent mental health issues. This person will violently hit and smash things in the garage, then move to screaming and yelling horrible things, for example ""Im gonna kill the fucking slut, I will kill you. You're dead, with a knife in your fucking head"". Combined with growling and screaming nonsensical stuff. 

I approached the person who was actually living there the first time this occured, and he assured  me this was a once off as the other person was off his meds, and he would deal with it. 

So me being somewhat timid, said ok, and left it at that. stupid!!! The behavior escalated to occuring several times a day, then also thru the night. Because of the violence of these outbursts, I get afraid of calling the police (I have a 3yr old daughter to protect and she has also been distressed to the point of tears). Well finally the couple in no.1 hear, call the police, they come, warn them all to stop, blah blah. 

It was fine for a few weeks, until tonight as I am putting my daughter to bed. This man starts up again. My daughter starts crying, and I lose it. I leave the bedroom, open the front door and yell as loud as I can ""shuuuuut uuuup!!!!!"".

415,"I realized I will mostly likely never get a job as a literature professor, and that a PhD in English would be, for me, a waste of time. Not because I discovered I didn’t like research or teaching as much as I thought, or wasn’t as good as I thought, but instead because of the state of higher education and the academic job market, coupled with waning confidence in my ability to succeed. 

I’m pretty heartbroken by this realization. Becoming a professor has been a dream of mine since high school. Like many students I have fallen totally in love with literature and the life of the mind. I’ve become obsessed. 

At times, I feel unsuited to be anything other than a scholar, as though I were built for the academy as opposed to the real world but I understand that you can’t always get everything you want, that bills must be paid, and that there are other things out there.",08May2020,1
416,"So I\[21M\] got out of an unhealthy relationship in mid February and I decided to redownload tinder. I had a few matches over time but I ended up matching with this girl around March 18th. I really enjoyed talking to her. It would take a while for her to respond to my messages on the app, but she would still respond (most of the time). It's been difficult for me to really open up and talk about deeply personal things because of how my last relationship went so we were really making just small talk. I wasn't really annoyed at all by how long it took for her to respond to my messages I was just glad to be talking to someone. 

About a week after we matched I sent her a message and she didn't reply so I sent one or two more and she messaged me on the app and said she doesn't really check Tinder that much so she asked if I wanted to give her my number. I was honestly surprised that she offered and so I gave her my number and we texted back and forth. We had maybe one or two deeper conversations where we got to know eachother a little better so I thought things were going somewhere. 

So fast forward another week it's April 4th and we were texting back and forth and she was talking about how she had an uneventful day because of classes and I asked if she wanted to talk about it. For whatever reason she never responded to the message. I texted her the day after (April 5) and still had no response. I really didn't worry because I was used to her not responding right away to the texts. I texted her one more time on April 5th and still had no response. I was really just confused so I sent her a message a few days later with a quick apology saying I was sorry for not being the best at conversing and still no response. I sent her a message on the 17th saying I hope everything was ok and that was the last time I messaged her. 

Looking back on it, I'm assuming she ghosted me, but it was just so strange for her to do it mid conversation. I know I'm not the best at being interesting through text messages but she would respond and even gave me her number so I thought things were going somewhere. I really enjoyed talking with her and I thought she enjoyed talking to me too. These past few days I've been thinking about sending her a message just apologizing if I made her feel uncomfortable or anything. Part of me wants to and part of me thinks it's excessive if I send her another message. Can anyone please give me some advice on if I should/shouldn't message her? I need someone other than myself to give me advice, if anyone has any questions I can answer them in the comments. I appreciate all of the input (positive or negative!).

418,"Pics: [crossbite pics](https://imgur.com/a/g7H4wen)

I’ve had a pretty noticeable—at least to me—crossbite for pretty much all my life. I wanted to start on getting it fixed when I was much younger, but my family never prioritized it, so I set up my own appointments starting freshman year of college and was then informed of my crossbite and need for surgery (SARPE) on my upper palate. So at 19, I started wearing braces, and then about a year later, underwent SARPE surgery and started using a palate expander. 

It’s now about three years since I started this journey, and the process has so far consisted of spacers, braces, SARPE, expanding, and now elastics. The expanding portion of the process resulted in the right side of my upper palate being overexpanded, while I suppose the left side still needs more expansion. That’s what the elastics are supposed to help with now (as I’ve been told), and I’ve been using them post-expansion for about a year now. I included pictures of where I have been instructed to position them in my mouth, as well as other pics showing my crossbite in the imgur link.

I am now at a stage where I’m not exactly sure what to do while covid-19 is continuing (and therefore all ortho appts have been cancelled for now). I’ve still been using the elastics (3/16” heavy; 4.8mm) as instructed, but as far as seeing any improvement, I’m no longer noticing much—especially since I am now behind on brace tightening. I also think that the continued use of elastics on the right—overexpanded—side of my mouth has brought down my upper teeth a little(?) and left me with a gummy smile on that side.

So one issue is that I’m not sure if I should continue using elastics on both sides at this point. I also am not sure how long covid-19 is going to slow down my journey and cause it to take much longer (possibly several months more now?)—so I just wanted to maybe know anyone’s thoughtful opinion on that. Aside from covid-19, I just don’t know if it’s possible to fix this crossbite at all (starting to lose hope). Also, if anyone has any knowledge on the type of crossbite that I have and what the most effective treatment would be in the future (and if it seems like my ortho is actually doing that), then that would be incredibly helpful as well! I strongly appreciate second opinions, and I’ve been thinking of going to another orthodontist after quarantine ends to maybe get his/her thoughts, too. I’ve ALWAYS been extremely insecure about my teeth, and I’m hoping that one day they’ll finally look good enough for me to be able to smile openly and comfortably. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: Not seeing much improvement from braces and elastics anymore on crossbite (post-SARPE). Not sure if I should keep wearing elastics or not during covid-19, and also wondering if current ortho treatment seems most effective for me—if anything will help (welcoming any opinions on what would be).",08May2020,1

421,"okay so I am a senior in high school (17) and I met this sophomore girl (15) around when she had joined our team as a manager (around november). I was honestly amazed at how beautiful she was when I first saw her. My other friend, who is a senior, was also interested in her and he decided to make a move while knowing she had a boyfriend. turns out she had been going through a lot and my friend was able to help her immensely and get her out of the abusive relationship. Shortly after, they started dating. They dated throughout the entire season and I respected my friend so I did nothing but supported the both of them. now until april, they’ve broken up. I have recently started talking to her and when i say we had a great connection almost immediately, I mean it. I texted her around 3am and that didn’t stop us from having a conversation til we can see the sun rise. we have so much in common, have so much fun talking to each other, crack jokes and tell each other about deep aspects of our life. she’s very mature and quite smart. we’ve also mentioned to each other that we think we’re both attractive and fun to be with. Recently, she’s told me that her relationship with my friend felt more of like a friendship than a relationship and some the problems she’s having. I told her some of the problems I have as well. she’s also told me how she’s always admired me since the sports season began. I feel that whenever I’m around her that I can just be me and I’ve never had something like that before. almost like we can talk about another with each other and be there for one another. I’m very tempted to tell her how I feel maybe in a few weeks or so but I have my doubts on a some stuff. 

* is it wrong that a month after she broke up with my friend, that I will tell her how I feel even though I truly think we bond on a whole other level?
* She’s a sophomore and I’m a senior. I am going to a community college very near but she’ll still be in high school. Is it worth it trying to go for the relationship because from what I’ve heard, high school and college are two different beasts and it may feel like our lives might just be too different to work out.

sometimes to make things easier, I wish that we had met two years later from now so that maybe the odds would be more on the side of us being together but that still won’t stop me from believing that this could work out and be beautiful but I have to be realistic sometimes.

425,"Me and my gf have been dating for 1.5 years and are both 16. We started playing this sexual game we call ""Naked Compliments"" months ago. Basically one of us goes into the closet and the other gives 5 compliments not based on looks. Then the person leaves the closet fully clothed and the other gives compliments based just on how they look there clothed (compliments about the clothes are common here). Then they strip to their undewear and get 5 more compliments based on that, and finally they get naked and get 5 more compliments about their body while nude . Then we switch off. We've had a lot of fun with it and play it every now and then. It almost always leads to sex right after.


Recently my girlfriend injured herself and it left behind a scar on her stomache. She sent me a picture of it and I told her it wasn't bad. We didn't bring it up for a bit after that. We were recently playing Naked Compliments for the first time since she got the scar. 


After it was time in the game for her to strip down to just her bra and underwear she got uncomfortable and told me she didn't feel like playing anymore right now. I said ok but asked why. She started crying saying her stomache is ugly now and that she's worried I won't be attracted to her anymore. I went up to her, hugged her, and told her ""Don't talk like that about my beautiful girlfriend"" but she just replied with ""Its true though"" and was still crying and very upset. I told her that while its totally fine if she doesn't feel comfortable stripping right now the scar isn't that noticable, she's the most beautiful and sexy girl in the world, I'll always be attracted to her, I love her no matter what, and that I love every part of her and her body.


She eventually relaxed more but has been acting more down on herself. She must still feel really insecure about the scar. I really don't think the scar is a big deal at all, it doesn't affect my attraction to her AT ALL.


She doesn't really want to take her shirt off in front of me now. Before the scar, we were totally comfortable being naked in front of each other whether its showering, sex, or whatever. We've had sex once since her crying but she wanted to keep her shirt on. Of course thats her right and I respect that but how can I make her feel better about herself? Maybe she just needs more time? I can tell she's really sad about it :/

426,I'm a 17 year old male teenager from Germany and my Dad is always angry. As soon as I get out of bed i'm feeling the bad vibes he's spreading. He gives me and my mother and sister this look of anger with no reason. As soon as we try to talk about it he is just getting more angry and starts yelling quite often. Before this whole situation with the virus I went out with friends a lot and I never had a problem and never caused problems. But my mom told me that he was pissed back then too but to me it became normal to hang with friends. I was introverted for a long time and never went outside with friends. I'm just trying to enjoy my life. When I was younger he always told me about the crazy and cool things he did with his friends and I just want to experience crazy things too which I can tell my kids when I'm older. When I try to talk to him he won't accept my opinion or shows no understanding of my point of view. His personality changed a lot in the past years as he got more and more toxic. He distanced himself from his friends and has no understanding that my siblings and I have friends who we meet up with. What can I do? How can I have a conversation with him about it without him yelling at me?,08May2020,1
427," I  am a Cognitive Science undergrad who heavily focused the degree on  AI/DS.  I am currently 23 years old and I feel kinda old for my status  in life. I do not have any practical experience.

In theory, I would be ready for my thesis now, but the thing is the following:  
This  semester, I need to write two more exams, attend one seminar and work  as a Machine Learning tutor. I think it is definetely doable doing this  and writing my thesis, if I had more than 3 months. I found a cool  professor I could write my bachelor thesis with (very respected  researcher!).

Here comes the  problem: My plan has been to do the courses , work as a Tutor and write  the thesis now, do a 12 weeks internship then at a very cool research  center and start a Master degree in Machine Learning afterwards. When I  talked to the professor, he told me that this is definetely not possible  all together, because the internship and the thesis should not overlap.  So my options now are:

1. Do  not write the thesis this semester, but rather focus on the rest. Do  the internship in summer, write the thesis afterwards, do a Master  Degree one year later (would start with 24 then). Long-term, if I wanna  do more education like a PhD, might be very old without a job in the  future.
2. Try  to do everything simultaenously, might not work out, would be stressed  all the time, might produce shitty grades and shitty thesis this  semester.
3. Do not do the internship. Have way more time with the thesis. Do not gain practical experience.

434,"I want to patch things up with my ex.....

For context, we've been schoolmates for 11 years. Been friends for 3-4, and have been together for 1 year and 6 days. We're the same age. We broke up around a year ago.

I guess i should preface this by saying that we didn't break up on bad terms. No fights, no massive fallouts, no animosity after the breakup. We were always on good terms, even when we were together. The cause of the breakup is partly stress and pressure from school, and the long distance. Although we agreed to stay friends, we went no-contact for a long time. The no-contact stopped at February of this year. After that first conversation we only had a few short conversations every few weeks. Checking up on each other and stuff.

I guess, ever since the breakup I've had a lot of realizations. And I honestly learned more about relationships from the breakup than the relationship itself. I learned how to live without her and how to be happy on my own. (As for her, I can't say. All her friends say that she won't talk about the breakup at all. I'm close with her friends too, and I trust their word.)

Lately though, due to quarantine I guess we've been having more frequent conversations. And yeah, I want to have a real talk conversation about her regarding ""us"". 

Not sure if I'm fooling myself by saying this, but I do think I have moved on from the breakup. Like I guess I've moved on from the pain, but not the person?",08May2020,1

443,"Hi, I'm a girl, almost 18 y/o. I am very lucky in life. I have a good relationship with my family, I love my school and my friends, I have the time and opportunity to work on my goals (I want to become an actor). Sometimes life is shitty of course, but I'm very lucky to have a good support system. My older brother is my absolute best friend. Although I have had some body image issues in the past and have had ups and downs like everybody else, I don't have any self esteem problems anymore and quite like my little life doing me. However, I'm starting to worry that I might be so far up my own asshole that I can't even tell that I think I'm superior.

Ever since I was a kid I've had people badtalk me behind my back. When I say people I mean girls. They seem to think that I'm a bitch who thinks I'm better than everyone. This has been the primary comment my whole life. Also along with ""Who the fuck does she think she is?"" ""She isn't even that pretty"" and ""She's only pretending to like everyone so that they'll like her"". And of course, I do realize that a lot people get these comments behind their back. People bad mouth you, and you bad mouth them. However, I truly do not have a single problem with any of the girls that have said this - I've never had a bad thing to say about them, and I've often seen them as my friends. But even after going from middle school to high school and getting a whole new set of people, this is still the comment I hear. It breaks my heart. I don't even hear it that often, but when I do, I get upset. Because I don't think I'm better than anyone else- but I know they're not better than me either. People can't be compared, and I'm not a very jealous person. I think I sometimes seem like I think I'm superior because I never lean into a ""prove I'm the best"" contest. But it isn't because I think I'm better than them and have nothing to prove, it's because I deem that sort of competiton to be downgrading to everyone involved. I don't wanna compete with my friends, they are my friends and I love them.

All I want is good vibes, some jazz in the background while I cook with my friends. I don't care to be on the top of the world. But maybe I'm to up my own ass to tell. Maybe I do think I'm better than everyone?  How can I fix it if I do?",08May2020,1

446,"Background: I’m 23. I’ve been thinking a lot about an arts degree with a major in humanities and a minor in philosophy. My issue is how I’ve always concluded that I could learn it myself and save the money, especially when my interest is in philosophy and not the superfluous courses (although they’d be interesting and informative). But it isn’t as if I’m unable to afford a university education; I’m lucky enough to be a beneficiary of a trust, which currently covers my boyfriend and my living expenses. My boyfriend will finish his degree and begin working as a nurse next year, which will take the pressure off me as the sole bill-payer.

I’ve always attempted ‘practical’ courses: diploma of business, accounting, and even hairdressing as a last resort. But it’s as if they all had a ‘no thru road’ sign at the end, and things I thought were practical soon became wastes of money. Ever since, I’ve been frozen in limbo afraid to make another wrong decision. Now I’m at the point where I’m less afraid of making another mistake than I am of inactivity and settling with philosophy as a hobby. But should I really attend university for it? People say it’s good for the social factor, but I have social anxiety and would happily avoid people (not that avoidance is good). Athabasca University (online) would be fine too, but my local university provides better philosophy courses and contacts in case I pursue a master’s. Note: I have no fantasies of an illustrious career—at best I believe it could make a job in editing or publishing possible when it is now an almost-impossibility.

However after the breakup, I don’t feel comfortable talking with them anymore. They are in the same company with my ex and they hang out together 24/7.

453,"I (27M) was brought up in a conservative christian family (the world's 6000 years old, most people are hell-bound, don't even think about turning on the computer on a Sunday). A few years back, after struggling with those beliefs for a long time, I rejected them.

The problem: I can't work out what I do believe now and I feel totally rudderless. I know plenty of people with clear sets of values (right-wing, left-wing, other wings) but the way they seem to reach their conclusions always strikes me as unpleasantly similar to my family's: make sense of a horribly complicated world by reducing it to a simple set of rules, ignoring or explaining away any data that doesn't quite fit the conclusion they're aiming for. Often they even have a book and/or a thinker who serves as their sacred text/God figure. And when a problem arises, their thought process seems to be, ""what position should I, as a liberal/libertarian/communist/nationalist/feminist etc. be taking on this?"" Very often the conclusion is: ""it's simple, \[insert slogan\]"" and I'm left thinking, ""is it simple though?"" I envy their certainty, much as I envy my family's, but I can't really get my mind to that happy place on any controversial issues.

To take an unnecessarily controversial example: ""abortion is murder"" and ""her body, her choice"" both seem like gross over-simplifications of a really tricky moral debate. My approach is to just keep out of it until I've got something more than gut instinct and peer pressure underpinning my view. But fence-sitting is pretty miserable and doesn't give me much reason to get out of bed in the morning. It's also clearly not a morally neutral choice in many cases: like UN officials during the Rwanda genocide saying ""there's fault on both sides"" or Aung San Suu Kyi saying the same re:the Rohingya ""conflict"". 

So, have any of you read/seen/thought something that helped get you off the fence and give you a sense of purpose in life? Are there any books that helped you make sense of the world without it feeling like someone was drawing straight lines between a biased sample of data points to prove a pre-determined conclusion. I've seen/heard enough ministers using that methodology (very persuasively) to attack homosexuality, evolution, etc. so I'm allergic to anything that bears the same hallmarks.

454,"Hi everyone:) I'm using a throw away account because some people I know follow my main and this is kind of personal (apologies in advance for the long read). Any help is really appreciated!!!!

I (16F) started dating this boy (16M)   around two years ago. We broke up after 9 months because we were pretty young and I was still figuring myself out. We were on good terms although unfortunately lost touch for one reason or another, but at the start of this year we started talking again because I moved very close to his place. Before all this pandemic stuff started going on he asked me out and we started dating shortly after.

Everyone in my city is quarantined but romantic partners are allowed to visit each other so we've been hanging out a few times a week and recently our relationship has gotten sexual. Going into the relationship he was a virgin and I wasn't, but he'd messed around with people before and had a bit of experience. He's  quite devoted to me and thinks I'm his dream girl which is really sweet, so the problem isn't in our emotional connection - we both like each other a lot. (about to get into the tmi bit so please read on only if you're genuinely looking to help).

At first everything was fine, he's a great kisser and I'm very attracted to him. We'd had no issues so far and done almost everything excluding sex. I really care about him and wanted his first time to be as enjoyable as possible so opted for us to get comfortable with each other again. I'd assured him that sex is supposed to be fun and easy, that it's about feeling good and that he didn't have to worry about 'impressing' me or anything, just to enjoy himself and I was sure I would too. I know that he's a bit  insecure about size, as although he's tall he's slim and about average in terms of length and width. I love his body and try to make sure he knows that because I don't want him to feel shy around me.

We decided that our relationship had reached the natural progression and he was pretty keen to have sex and again, at first everything was fine. I put on the condom and he started to get a little soft but I knew it wasn't a big deal and soon he was fully hard again. We started having sex and it was fine, pretty good for a first time. I have a feeling he started to overthink it and he began to get soft again and wasn't able to finish. I knew he had no control over it so I cheered him up and we talked about how it was only natural and he'd have plenty of opportunities to try again because I really didn't want him to be embarrassed or think it affected my feeling for him.

On another day we decided to try again, which was even less successful because as soon as I put the condom on he went soft. This happened again today and that's why I've decided to ask for advice. I adore him and want to do whatever I can to make him more comfortable. He assures me that he does want to and has never had this issue before, but I can tell he's got some performance anxiety to do with sex. If any men or others have had a similar experience and would like to offer some tips that would be greatly appreciated, I've tried everything I can think of and I just want to make him happy without making a big deal about it.

Okay, I love my parents and always will. And maybe this isn't the place for this, and if there is a better one, if you tell me I'll delete this.
My whole life I've wanted to be a film director and screenwriter. I remember being around 3 to 5 and having an (awful ) idea for a superhero named ""KNIFER"". Awful name, I know that now, but I was five.
I wanted to tell my parents about him, and when I did, they both laughed and called it dumb right to my face. It is dumb, but I was five... what did you expect?
So I set a mental note.
""What I can tell my parents,"" and ""what I can't tell my parents.""
The stuff on the first including, ""I learned something new in school made a new friend,"" etc. And the second, ""I have new ideas for movies and tv shows,"" and I even thought they wouldn't care/I would be embarrassed, if I told them that I was “having a hard time at school”.
And only today I think I realized that experience of telling them that idea caused me to be so shut off from them. And if I end up being a filmmaker (fingers crossed) I don't want them to see the stuff I, hopefully, make.

It was awful, she would make a new account when I’d block her and started bringing up my dead dad asking if I missed him and laughing and it got so bad for 5 days straight I had to call crisis line because I was in such a dark space from it all and I live far away from family right now. It was awful. I found out she has a repeated pattern of doing this to people. But I keep wondering why it is I seem to attract people like her? 

I have some major trust issues so it’s not like I let just anybody in, but when I do let people get close it seems to often be the wrong people. 

When I ask family I get told it’s because I’m too nice and don’t listen to my gut which I think is true, and I know jealousy plays a role too, I also am extreme with my boundaries, I’ll either be cutthroat and not let anyone close to me or I’ll let someone walk all over me. 

I realize I carry a lot of trauma from being betrayed so many times in my life by so many people, including some of my own family. And I really want to address this now and start to heal so I can go on to develop better friendships and actually feel closer to people. 

I notice too that I do have some friends I do like and trust but I find I don’t get close to them because I’m scared it will get ruined and I’ll get betrayed again. Which is very counterproductive to what I want lol. So that’s something I need to fix too.",08May2020,1

468,"So I'm a big time introvert and allthough I do enjoy the occasional smoke with some buddies(like once a month) I also love being alone and smoking weed alone.

My girlfriend didn't like either to begin with but we talked about it very openly and she is now totally okay with me smoking with buddies.

I once told her that I was in the mood for some weed and I wanted to smoke some but she didn't like that and she said if you start smoking alone it's weird. It's like your addicted, like with drinking alcohol alone. 

I didn't want to argue too much else I would seem like I really wanted it and thus proving her theory correct so I just let it go and saidcokay if you don't want it then I won't. 

But sometimes I just want to smoke alone and I feel like I can't now. I don't want to argue about it with her because that makes me look like an addict. I know that I'm totally not vulnerable for addictions so far in my life never had one and never had problems with alcohol, smoking and stuff. The last time I smoked some weed was probably 2 months ago. Just to give an indication. 

I could use some advice on how to deal with this?

470,"Throwaway bc she knows my reddit account.

My best friend (26F) is pregnant with a dude she was FWB's (FWB is 29M) with. They did use protection but she reckons the condom must have split. Anyways she told him she was pregnant and gave him the option of how involved he wanted to be, but said he definitely has to provide financially. I will add she only told him when she was ~7 months along as she was worried he would pressure her into an abortion.

He's come back saying that he only wants to see the kid a few times a year and has no interest outside of that. She's now wondering whether that is worth it and in the best interests of her child.

So I wanted to ask, morally, is it better for her to allow the dad to only see the kid a few times a year or should she just tell him to not be involved at all? He doesn't seem like he cares either way and I personally think it will be more damaging to the child for him to only pop up here and there, at least if he's completely absent then there's no expectation?

2 days ago i got to actually call his female friend and talk with her and she completely understood why i felt that way. i've been comparing myself to her (she's more deep and philosophical and my boyfriend loves that kind of stuff). it was really getting to me. last night my boyfriend told me he misses the old me. he hates this weird mood i've developed and he said it's going to be a major problem if this doesn't end. my boyfriend even offered to get rid of her if that would fix all of this. i'm not that type of person so i would never insist on him doing that.

i feel a LOT better after having talked to the girl. i know they're not that close and that their relationship isn't that special.. but for 3 months i truly thought they had a super special connection like we do. 

how do i move forward from here? i want to become more confident and secure with myself, and i want to be myself again. i've hated feeling jealous and anxious in the back of my head all these months. it's finally pretty much over with, but i do have some leftover thoughts that annoy me. such as ""she's more interesting than me"", ""he did fun stuff like watch his favorite movie with her and not me"".. just little stuff that made me compare us.

It's for a job that I really want at a decent company.

I was under a lot of time pressure and completed the tasks with about 15 minutes to remain.

There is no way to go back and review and revise my answers now.

It's really winding me up as I know I could have given a more efficient answer now.

Is it worth me contacting the recruiter and outlining what I could have done better?

Should I just hope I get through to the next round and then discuss my improvements with the company?

I strongly believe I've done enough but it's just not optimal. I think I'm judging myself unfairly and it will be enough to know what could have been done better and take that knowledge into three next round.

He asked me to do something else today,  and I just said no. He kept insisting,  and I asked why cant he just take the no after I have said it instead of insisting over and over. This is where he hits me with ""I'm just asking a favour from my brother"" .

He isn't home now bc he moved out but if he moves back in again and and chooses to live with us, it will all start again. The thing is that I can't afford moving out, so I have to live at home and live with it. I just can't handle it and get hurt and angry really fast by his behaviour. I already have mental issues and he only makes it worse. I tried once not talking to him and instead of leaving me alone or asking what is wrong, he just provoced me by throwing annoying statements at me. Which made me even more furious. Last time he came to me and apologized for his behaviour but everything I said he turned around and said stuff like ""oh yea I could say that to you, too"". I know him very well, I accepted his apology but I know that he won't change. He is a bit like a narcissist. I feel like I can only be relieved after I let all of my anger out and tell him everythinf and then ignore him forever. So I wanna know how do I not care anymore about my brothers behaviour and what he does and says? And how do I remove this anger?

479,"*i’m somewhat new to reddit -forgive me if I’m not doing this correctly!*. *also- longish post ahead*

My boyfriend is a carpenter.   My friend and her husband called me and asked if my BF could replace some trim on her house because it has rotted.   It is around a window above a garage on a pitched roof.  He goes and looks at it.   He says he can do it for $500.  We buy all the stuff and paint the cedar boards.  We go the next weekend to put the boards up and the old trim is crumbling underneath and the plywood is soaking.   He stops and tells them If he replaces the trim it will only last maybe 6 months.   The plywood underneath needs to be replaced.   They say they can’t afford it so in order to save cost he says he’ll remove the siding and replace all he damaged plywood, then put the tape (waterproof kind- can’t recall the name) and then the siding, then finish the trim.   He tells them $1200.   He tells me he gave them this price because they are my friends but usually this costs way more.   

They agree.   He goes out the next weekend with another siding/roofing specialist.   They finish the job in about 3 1/2 hours.   There is an extra sheet of plywood that we left along with half a cedar board.  My BF pays the guy more than he made on the job.  

I get a call two days later from my “friend”.  She is cursing me out and insulting me, telling me she was scammed.   I am taken aback. I would never speak to anyone like that but I said to her let us come out and see what the issue is, let’s make it right.   She continues to be angry and then her husband gets involved- he says ALL of the plywood needed to be replaced.    We say that’s not what we agreed on.   But still let us come out and see what the issues are.  They continue the insults.  I tried to talk/text with her but they say they want all of their money back.   

They tell us that they are going to tear it all down and make it look like he never did any work.   Then take us to small claims court.   They won’t let us come look at anything.  

A day later they call my BF and say, we will forget everything if you re-ply the area and put the trim back up.   

At this point I blocked my “friend” on Facebook and her number.   She was berating me and the BF and insulting mine and his kids.    I do not handle this type of behavior very well.  

We didn’t respond to their request to re-sheet the area.   They already tore down all of his hard work!  

Now she has taken to social media to post about how we didn’t do what they wanted.   My BF said it doesn’t matter.  When you’re in the trades people are never happy to spend money to fix things.   

Oh- he finished the job on a Saturday afternoon and they tore everything down the following Wednesday.   

Should I report the posts?   Should I continue to ignore her?  Is there something better I could have done?",08May2020,1
480,"I've felt like this for a really long time. I started to feel suspicious two years ago, during summer vacation. My father let me use his phone to use Spotify and listen to some music, when suddenly he got a Hangouts message of a girl I didn't know that said something along the lines of ""hi my love! Are you there?😘""

I went to him and told him that a stranger had messaged him, and he got super defensive. He snatched his phone out of my hands and shouted at me that it didn't matter, and that I shouldn't be intrusive. It made me feel bad because it wasn't my intention, the notification suddenly popped up and I just happened to read that.

I asked him if he knew who it was, and he just told me to brush it off. I wasn't satisfied with that answer, I just wanted a ""yes"" or a ""no"", not a ""this is none of your business"" kind of response. But he refused to answer properly, so I just assumed that the other person had mistaken my father for someone else.

I wish everything had ended just like that, but that wasn't the case. Everything got super suspicious and kind of obvious when once, my father and I were sitting beside each other in the subway and he was looking at his phone. It was all normal when all of the sudden he slightly turned around in a position where I couldn't see the screen of his mobile. He thought I didn't notice, but I immediately knew he was trying to hide something from me when doing this. I thought to myself ""okay, maybe work stuff he doesn't want me to see"", but then I saw that he had a chat on Skype open, with a woman nicknamed ""Wolfy"". They were talking dirty to each other, and she was sending him provocative pictures. My father responded with flirting. I froze.

I felt super betrayed, because I love my father. We've always, ever since I was little, played together. I've done many fun and cool things with him, and I never thought he could do something like this to my mother and I.

This wasn't a one-time thing, I've seen him talk with that ""Wolfy"" a thousand times over this year, including today. He always tries to hide the phone from me when he opens Skype to talk and flirt with that girl. It makes me want to cry. I don't even know if he still loves my mother or if he's just pretending.
 What if he has another family? What if there's another daughter, or a son, that's spending time with my father the same way as me when he's not at home? For how long has this been going on?

All those nights he said he spent in his job, or those times he had to travel somewhere and stay for a day or two, was he really where he said he was? Was he doing nasty things to the Skype girl when he was supposedly working?

I'm too scared to confront my parents about it, and I don't want them to split. I had several dreams about it and I always wake up crying from them. But I don't want my mother to keep believing that she's the only one in case my father is actually in a relationship with the other woman. My mind is a huge mess, and I can't talk about this to anyone of my friends because their image of my dad will change forever.",08May2020,1
481,"I’m a college student who had to move back to my parents home due to COVID19. The past 2 months have SUCKED. I’m from a South Asian Muslim family. My parents know I’m atheist, but they still treat me like a Muslim and remind me to pray and whatnot. My mom also cares about religion more than my engineering schooling. Even when I have classes and exams going on, she still comes in my room to remind me to pray (even when she knows I have a class meeting going on). She is like this because she thinks that my prayers will last me until my grave, not my grades. I’m an atheist so this doesn’t apply to me. My mom complains about me being on my laptop all the time when I really just have to study(finals are in a few days for me)/go to classes. I’m also being forced to “fast” during Ramadan to keep the peace. I also can’t wear whatever I want around the house. Summer is coming up and I can’t wear comfy shorts and a loose tank top because it shows skin. If I go to the kitchen in a sleeveless top, my parents will force me to go to my room tom change just because my dad and my brother are “men”.

On top of all this, my mom has been really toxic to me and calls me stupid a lot. My dad eats a lot of junk food and isn’t exactly counting how much sugar he consumes (diabetes runs in his family). My mom complains that my dad is getting fat, yet she still buys ice cream when she goes to the grocery store. I’ve told them many times that they should limit their sugar intake and switch to brown rice instead of white basmati rice. We also have a cockroach infection in our condominium which is really disgusting to me, and I’m trying to help out with this. My parents home is unorganized - my dad is a hoarder so we have a lot of stuff lying around home. When I was away for college, they use my room as a “storage room”. We also need to get our home remodeled. My 10+ year old bed has bed bugs, and it’s time for me to get a new mattress and bed because of this. My brother also moved back home, and last month he QUIT his job during the middle of a pandemic/unemployment crisis just because he “HATES working from home”. I told him to keep the job because lots of people lost their jobs and the economy is getting really bad. Now he is struggling financially. And he goes out almost every day, seems like he doesn’t care about the stay-at-home orders. He also stays up playing video games really late, and he talks so loud that it wakes me up from my sleep. Even when I tell him to quiet down because we are all sleeping, he just closes the doors and continues talking and playing his game.

If it wasn’t for my parents, I would just move in with my boyfriend in peace and happiness. But if they found out I had a boyfriend &amp; I moved in with him, they would completely disown me and stop funding for my college education, phone bill, car insurance, etc (I have 2 more years of school left). My summer internship salary will go towards my tuition. My boyfriend said that logically I should suck it up and live with them for now, and after we graduate, me and him can move in together. 

One my final exams are over in a few days, I’m going to help de clutter our entire condominium :/ I’m also very tempted to buy a new bed and mattress and a new study desk. I’m not sure how long i will have to live here for, due to COVID19.

i recently had split up with my first ever boyfriend which was hard but i seemed to move on quickly as he treated me badly and i didn’t want to be in that relationship anymore anyway.

a few weeks went by and i told lachy how i felt. he felt the same way. after a few days of just talking like usual i say that i can’t have a relationship as i had been going through some serious mental health and family issues at the time. he tells me to never speak to him again and to not even go near him. i of course am heartbroken, not only did i lose the guy i liked but i lost my best friend. i thought i was doing what was best for both of us at the time so of course i was surprised by the way he reacted. 

i went a few weeks without seeing him because of all of this covid stuff. but school came back on wednesday for me. i see him in the classes we have together and apologise, i ask him to not be mad at me anymore. he seems like he’s fine with me, i got false hope as i was messing around with him like how we did before (i would take his hat and wear it) before one of my classes where he says, your a creep, stop trying to take my stuff, your only doing this because you like me but you missed your chance.

We have found out that A moved to her father's house with the kid, and here is where it gets strange.

Just today, my granda called us again and said that the whole family is in a cult. Their point is like to make a connection with the angels and talk to them.

The person who sat down will try to communicate with the angels."" Is what he told us. They also have to wear a special ring with wings on it, they made one only for him too.

487,"Throwaway account.

2 years ago I managed to move abroad for university. I did it to move out form my abusive parents. They really know nothing about raising children, they only pay for stuff and threaten us to gain some respect. Fortunately they have money so I decided to study my ass off to move abroad.

My sister however is still stuck with them because she's a teenager. You see, I wanted to escape so I invested in my education but she's completely opposite - she doesn't want to study at all. She loves horses and thinks that she's going to clean stables as a lifetime job.

I have to say it could be partially my fault - because my parents used to compare her to me a lot. I was too young to realize what was happening but now I try to stop them from doing so. It's too late though- she's failing every major subject.

I think she's counting to her 18 birthday and she plans to escape. I'm her sister and she knows she can find support in me. That's tough however - I'm barely managing myself, I don't have my own place and I won't have a graduate job before her birthday. I also don't want to take a big risk of taking care of her if she's planning on living of my parents/my money.

 I know we all need therapy and stuff but with my means I really don't know what to do and how to solve this problem. I'm not in/from US btw. What can I do now when she's still living there and how can I prepare for her escape?",08May2020,1

I want to find hope somewhere,  the light at the end of the tunnel.  I don't want to end up getting depressed with things and realities i could've solved or accepted sooner.  Please...  Help me,  i know this ain't much and my problem doesn't matter like the more important things in society.  I just want to clean my heart and pull this burden off my chest.",08May2020,1
490,"Hello guys, that's probably gonna be a long read, because I need to tell my thoughts about my situation and also a piece of advice required. So after graduating the university I was 22 yo and decided to start my own business with a guy I knew. Nothing big and too prosperous, but it was enough. Long story short, 2 things happen within half a year: 1) My partner tried to get all the profit for himself, which left us in debt and made us to shut our business down; 2) my aunt got sick and my parents got a big loan to help her off. So I had a huge debt and was like oh ok I should try to do something about it. I was making it for almost 3  hard struggling years but right now I'm broke and done.  So I made some ideas about what should I do and I'd like to hear your advice about them, maybe some new ideas, maybe some ""hey you're gonna be OK bro"" - it also would be really cheering. I make enough money just for living, but I still have around 100 000 $ of total debt, around 15 000 of them are a pretty urgent to pay.   


1) Jokes aside, suicide is not an option. Screw that I'm 27  yo yet.  
2) Unfortunately, bankrupcy is not an option as well. It would be, but my parents are stubborn as hell. 3) Finding new job like office job - I live in Russia, medium salary is like 400-500$ per month here.   
So what I need is some creative way to make money and yeah lots of luck .  


What ideas I got here:  
1) Youtube channel. I can edit videos a little and have experience in videomaking. Like horror-channel or comedy channel (in Russian - my English may be not good enough to stream and make live vids), maybe some political channel in Russian or in English about our politics (it could be really funny because you should see how ridiculous they behave when they try to hide their corruption).   
2) Instagram - I'm not what people call handsome, but I got a couple ideas that might be interesting and not unique but pretty original.   
3) Making a movies - I tried to be a movie director and it was a good and interesting experience, actually something I'd like to do for a living if things were OK. So I could raise some money on kickstarter or something and make a youtube channel with short movies (horror mostly)  
4) I have a friend (not a close one) who owns like 5 pubs in my city. They're all with an interesting concept and nice profit and he invited me to start a new pub with him after this pandemic is over, but I'm gonna need like 6000$ for it, so if you know someone who has this money, not gonna need them for a year and can lend them to a total stranger with some interest of course - message me and we'll talk, ofc I'll pay you back in time. I know it's not very possible to meet such a guy, but hey, I'm desperate and grabbing for every straw.   


Soooo any thoughts and opinions about my options are welcome, I guess even sharing this with you guys is a good thing.  Best wishes for every one of you and I hope you'll never be in big debts - that's probably the worst.",08May2020,1
491,"My dad just made me (22f) sign a paper so he has access to my health records. He says it was for ""billing and insurance purposes"" and ""so he knows what the bills are for, and what he's paying for.""

I told him I don't really feel comfortable with him having access to my private health records but he said that if I didn't like it ""I should get my own health insurance.""

Since I am 22, I am still on my parent's insurance. I am currently unemployed so I can't get my own.

I signed the paper because I felt under pressure, but is there any way I can call to say that I didn't want to without getting my dad in trouble?

496,"I was at volleyball tryouts for my high school and it was going great. We were doing serves and I’m good at those but the coach asked me to do a jump serve so I did and I came down hard and my ankle just kinda went _| inward. I elevated it went through the steps but it was definitely the worst I had sprained it ever. The other times were minor. I had bruising on both sides and for the first couple days it was so painful to move it at all that I just didn’t move. 

It seemed to be fine it still bothered me every once in a while but I’m not a patient person anyway so I just let it be. But every once in a while I would move wrong just a little. Just turn too fast and it would hurt. When I press on the inside bone it hurts and when I point and flex my foot I can feel it grinding. I did swim and it felt wrong whenever I pushed off of the wall but I was just careful with it. 

I went on a jog today and when I got home I could tell that something was wrong again. I didn’t twist it or do anything excessive but it just hurts a ton. Especially the inside bone. I’ve always had a strong pain tolerance so I’m worried that I did some real damage and just didn’t hurt enough to get it fixed in time. I know that sprains don’t go away fully but it feels like it never healed right at all. I have a brace on it right now but it’s not doing much. I don’t have an air cast either. 

If you have any ideas of what I actually did to it or anything I could do to fix it that would be great. 

TLDR: badly sprained ankle and it never felt like it healed.",08May2020,1
497," My actual question is a few paragraphs down, but I felt like I had to include the first part because maybe some solutions to this lie in the background.

During this lockdown, I've found myself feeling dissonant with the world around me. My wife, parents, brothers and randoms online all seem depressed to be locked in their homes without social contact. However, I'm feeling joyful that I don't have to leave the house and go to work, and I feel anxious at the thought of the lockdown coming to an end.

This anxiety about a return to normal has been building and it has shown to me how unhappy I am with my life. I love my wife and my pets, and I love staying at home gaming, but I *hate* going outside. I think it's because I don't like my job, or the industry I work in, and except for my wife, I don't like the company of many people I know. This reminds me of the saying that goes something like ""if everyone around you appears to be an arsehole, it is in fact you that is the arsehole"". This feeds in to my anxiety because it feels like all of my dislike for others is simply re-directed hate that I feel towards myself.

I feel like if only I could learn what I truly want to do, then all of this anxiety about the outside-world would go away, and I would feel excited to go to work and interact with others.

\----------------------------------

When I was younger, I always wanted to be in Games Development. I taught myself how to animate on Flash when I was 13 and made animations after school. I remember how it felt to teach myself something and love the process of learning. However, as I've gotten older, it feels like all passion to learn has left me. I don't think the interest for animation, or any other discipline related to the games industry has gone, but an ability to sit with patience and discipline. I set out with the best intentions and willingness to do whatever it takes, but as soon as I start making progress it makes me feel hollow and hopeless. After that, my interest wanes and it becomes near impossible to bring myself back to the learning process. It will be some months/years later that my interest re-emerges and I wish that I had stuck with it.

I suppose my question is if anybody relates to this process of passion - motivation - progress - patience deflates - disinterest - defeat? I have long believed that the problem lies at the point where my patience dwindles. I can still have a deep interest in what I'm learning, but it is never enough to keep me going. It'd be amazing if anybody had any advice about pushing through the parts of the learning process that are hard.",08May2020,1

499,"I made some mistakes a couple of years ago in my life. I'm in college and this began about halfway through high school. This is pretty multi-faceted so bear with me. Myself and everyone mentioned will remain gender neutral and pseudonyms will be used.

I had a partner who was very obsessive, like creepy. They will be called Jamie. I am really scared to mention details just in case they read this. Seems silly but please humor me. Jamie was obsessed with me, my personality, my humor, we shared very obscure interests, etc. We were best friends, we talked all day every day. Jamie wanted to have kids with me and went so far as to say I was genetically perfect for them. This is obviously pretty weird, but I always tried to be nice. I loved them, they were one of my best friends. It was the kind of situation where you didn't want to be mean so you dealt with it.

So obsession turns into physical harassment. They would grope me, and text me pictures of my ass and tell me all the lewd things they wanted to do to me - without prompt or an okay from me. This made me super uncomfortable. This happened for years but it gets more complicated.

I eventually started dating another person. This new partner will be named Reagan. Reagan and I dated for 3 years, passed the end of high school. Our relationship was really good and happy and productive until the last 7 or 8 months. This really angered Jamie, since I was the perfect partner in their eyes, and we were supposed to be together. I dealt with their sexual harassment for a year and a half or so but it becomes assault at this point. Passed groping, Jamie now begins to physically attack me, and my sexual organs 1) to punish me for dating and loving someone else and 2) because it is a fetish that Jamie has (that I never participated in with them when we were dating). Jamie begins to groom me sexually by exploiting mental weaknesses I have and tempting me sexually, despite my relationship with Reagan.

There was one time were I actually cheated and let Jamie do sexual acts to me. This was about a year after Reagan and I started dating. Jamie said that they knew I was always theirs before what happened. It still makes me sick to my stomach. This whole event is really upsetting to me still, I threw up after it happened. I consented, it was not assault, rape, etc. I shouldn't have and that night is my biggest regret of my entire life.

After this point, the regular harassment continued and occasionally flirted around crossing a line with my relationship on my part. There were times we texted sexually. I never reciprocated in person, it felt like I had no power. Jamie would compliment me and make me feel happy about my body, which is a major insecurity so sometimes I would give them what they wanted in order to feel good. I felt so hollow and exploited and gross often, though. Sometimes I would lash out in anger yelling or hitting Jamie, which people who are friends with Jamie would just see my retaliation and make fun of me. It was humiliating, Some of Jamie's friends saw me get assaulted, groped, whatever and said nothing.

Jamie was below me in school so we saw each other less after I graduated. Reagan and I broke up. I'm going to skip over a ton of small details and get to the point. Jamie and I got in a fight and we finally stopped being friends and this opened up pandora's box. Jamie began telling their friends about all the times I was promiscuous in my relationship with Reagan. I really don't know what is being said besides that I cheated. Jamie tells Reagan about this. I don't think Reagan understands that Jamie was the person who I cheated with. Maybe Jamie said I raped them or something. I have no clue.

Ever since this, I have been being harassed by Jamie and Jamie's friends. I have been kicked out of local groups and my hobbies have been ruined by this. I can't participate in things that I love anymore. People will see me in public and yell epithets at me or just go out of their way to be awful to me.

I have no delusions about myself. I know that I made mistakes. I know I really hurt Reagan and I think about it every day. I began therapy, exploring religion, and have worked every day towards improving myself. After a few more short, passionate but ultimately failed relationships, I have stopped dating entirely to be able to help myself before I put my problems on everyone else. I don't think it's important for me to qualify my effort to become a better person anymore. I guess you have to take this as granted.

I have been suicidal off and on for a long time in my life but I have been in the emergency room more than once, hospitalized twice, and have regular anxiety and panic attacks because of this stuff, the harassment, and all my friends who don't talk to me over this stuff. I tried to kill myself between when Reagan and I broke up and Jamie and I not being friends, and that's when I realized I needed to change who I am and be a better person. 

I'm so scared that when I start my career, Jamie will say I assaulted or raped them in order to sabotage my happiness. I can't deal with the harassment anymore. I'm scared to leave my house and go to certain spots in town I love in case it causes an issue. Jamie has turned friends I made after high school against me over this, telling them whatever to make them dislike me. I feel like any progress I have in becoming a better person is continuously being cut down by these people. I often feel suicidal thinking that I deserve to die for what I did to Reagan. I feel choked and smothered and like there is no hope often. I am scared of telling my friends and talking about it because I'm scared of them leaving me.

What can I do to protect myself? How can I fix any of this? I've considered moving but I can't really do that for a couple years.  What is your advice for me? If I didn't explain stuff well, let me know. Thank you.",08May2020,1

502,"Basically what the title says.

I'm currently 14. When class ended in my country (pre-quarantine) I started exercising. There were lots of things that I wasn't able to do because I was too busy with school, and working out is one of them. So I gave it a shot, and I liked it a lot. However, my mother would ask me why was I exercising, when in fact, I was ""too thin"". When I hit 14 I suddenly got thin and I suspect it was stress from school. Another thing would probably be a pattern in my family, because when my older brother hit 14, the same thing happened to him --- he suddenly became thin. He has a big body now by the way. I don't think he's fat, he just became big. At first I was convinced that my weight would be normal when I get older so I didn't think much about it. But my mom would always comment on my body that I felt like I should probably eat more. 
And so I did. From 2 cups of rice (we're Asian and rice is necessary to eat lmao) to 4 cups every meal. At first it was a little challenging but over time I just got used to it. I also ate more frequently and squeezed more snacks like crackers into my diet. My parents we're happy that I was gaining weight. And I was happy too, except that they comment a little too much about my eating habits at dinner. 

Tonight after dinner my mother commented about me again. She said that I was gaining too much belly fat and I shouldn't really eat much. I lost it, I just don't know what to do anymore. At first she wanted me to gain weight and now she complains about me gaining belly fat and tells me to do otherwise. It makes me sad because I also gave up exercising for a while for this. I thought that maybe I should gain weight first before I exercise because if I exercised more I would get more thin --- or at least what my mom thinks.

What should I do now? Should I eat more? Should I eat less? I'm just really confused.",08May2020,1

504,"There's this friend of mine who really confuses me with some of the things he says. Lately he's been insulting me on occasion. To iterate, the insults come out of no where, completely unexpected. One time we were having a normal conversation, he seemed chill, and then all of a sudden he just insults me. I'm not even exaggerating. There was no build up- he just insults me right out of the blue and calls me stupid and arrogant and this and that. Meanwhile I'm just standing there wondering if he's joking or what's happening. I sorta just shrug it off and mind my own business but he persists a little more, and tries to get a rise out of me. The thing about his insults is that, they're usually not direct. He'll make them a little more direct each time but, he tries to hide them which is what confuses me. Couple months ago he did this frequently and eventually I had had enough with his bullshit so I just broke contact with him. It didn't really affect me that much, honestly I'm used to discarding people who I don't really like and didn't think about it at all, I just moved on. Then a month later, he contacts me again. Doesn't apologize- just asks me a simple, non-personal question. This might've been my mistake, but I answer it and boom, we have contact again. I don't really talk with him much but he begins talking with me more and more, and then (like an idiot), I decide ""alright, maybe he's cooled down and was just having a bad month or whatever."" Of course what happened today leads me to think otherwise. I'm not sure what to make of it really. I'm slightly annoyed but, in all honesty, I'm just more perplexed. I can't figure it out- guy insults me repeatedly, I break contact with him, he contacts me again- then insults me again. And legit, over a period of months. I don't get what his game is or what he wants. I'm probably just gonna break contact with him again the next time he does it (which I'm certain there will be one), and at that point its gonna be a final decision.

505,"My name is ""Temp"", and I am 16-years-old. I was seeking advice and also just wanted to vent. My life is going weirdly, sometimes I am happy sometimes I am sad, but I'm never content with it. I'm a very ambitious kid, but I haven't been dreaming as of late. I feel depressed, and sad to be completely honest. Two years ago, I graduated from middle school, I was popular and I was happy. But, that summer, I learned that a lot of people only kept me around as a form of entertainment (allegedly I am a hilarious person.) It was very painful watching my friends pull away from me, but I stayed strong. Freshman year was tough, I went to a magnet school, I was stressed out constantly, depressed, but I made new friends. That summer, I cut ties with everyone, I focused on myself, studied self-help and self-improvement books, and I came back sophomore year strong. I made a bunch of new friends, and I was genuinely happy. Then, my school doubled down on the homework, stress increased, I stopped reading my self-improvement books, and I hit a new low, I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep and was sad all the time. I lost nearly all of my friends, now I am participating in a lot of self-sabotage and I'm not necessarily motivated to change. I am just tired of being sad, being lonely and feeling bad. I never felt so insecure, so lonely and so hopeless. I'm even starting to drift away into listening to music ALL THE TIME and trying to escape from my reality and of course, thought about the big s. I just want to know what can I do to stop the cycle, rise above my sadness and be great or at least content.

512,"drinking and driving, kickstarting my depression,  letting his friends drink and drive with me in the car, it’s not good enough for her. 

spending an entire week drunk and having friends over, he took better care of them and their kids than me and my dog. i had an exam and 12 page essay due that week. but everyday he was drinking. his friends were smoking pot. i had to take complete care of my dog, because i did not/do not trust him giving him his medication. it’s not like he even offered to help anyways. coming home to my dog caked in dry mud and having to clean him. that one truly killed me. how the fuck does that even happen? and the fact that it dried up and he didn’t even do anything? seeing my dog get hit with a golf ball three times by his friends (and that was only in the time i was outside). yelling at me, “i’m going to kill you” in the morning because i was joking about playing the drums when he was hung over. 

my mom knows all of this. and it’s not good enough for her to leave. apparently him screaming in the car every time my sister used to go to soccer (around 5 years old) wasn’t good enough for her either.

and i’ve bit my tongue since i was 14, because i didn’t want him to get in my face (he did that once when i mentioned his drinking on christmas when i was 14, when he was drunk). but i lost it the other day. it probably lasted for about 12 seconds. i was screaming, and i mean screaming. this is what i said, “i have wanted to kill myself since i was 14 because of you. you have no idea what you have done to me, mom, my sister, and the dog, because you were drunk. you have no idea what you’re friends have done to me. get out of the house”. my mom was there in a heartbeat and pulled me back.

eventually it was, “you’re scaring the shit out of us (my name), it’s not helping. you’re scaring the shit out of the dog.” (words of my mother) it was such a nice feeling, being treated like somehow i was the bad guy. really didn’t expect that, but alas.

it’s been a week now. she didn’t even ask what happened with his friends. can you imagine? “you have no idea what your friends have done to me”, and nothing? without context, does that not sound like sexual assault? mind you, all it was was his friend coming to my room 4 times to give me beer. i got drunk, at 18. thankfully my friends picked me up, so nothing happened. but she doesn’t know that. i guess she doesn’t care though because she didn’t even ask.

my dad has not acknowledged the situation. everything went back to normal, from his side. still making me do things for him. acting the same you know. like nothing even happened. in fact, the next day (after this happened) he went to his friends house to a party (overnight). 100% got blasted, i can guarantee it. (also important to note were in quarantine. or at least the whole world is but him). last time he did this he came home (i believe he was drunk) with a scratched car, and parked one inch from the wall. 

my mom made empty promises that night. “we’re not living here anymore. we’re going to move out.” and like the absolute fucking moron i am i believed her, despite her making these empty promises before. she’s all talk, and yet i fall for it every time. and each time i realize that it’s not happening, it’s like, what the fuck is wrong with me? i should know better. you have no idea how high my hopes get. and then nothing.

there’s nothing i can do. i’m 20 years old, i’ve never had a real job, and believe my when i say that it’s impossible to find one. and i’m talking like a job at mcdonald’s. fuck i can’t even get that. even my friends who have had jobs can’t find one. so i have no money. i’m trying to sell posters and portraits online, but we both know that’s gonna go nowhere. i rely on my parents for everything. they are paying my way through university. 

i don’t want to live here anymore. for the love of fucking god. but there’s nothing i can do. if i worked two part time jobs i probably wouldn’t even be able to move out for three years, and even then i’d be living in a shitty place in a shitty area, barely making it. shits expensive as hell where i live. and no, there’s nobody i can go live with. it would break my heart to leave if i could, because my dog has cancer. i’ll let you fill in the blanks. god, i hated even typing that.

i don’t know what to do. there’s nothing i can do. and before you ask, yes, i go to therapy. i take medication. no, i don’t feel suicidal. and no, i don’t self harm anymore. if anyone could offer advice i would greatly appreciate it.

anyways. thank you for listening. i hope that you all have a lovely day, and that you see lots of dogs today.",08May2020,1

515,"I was talking to a friend recently and he was mentioning that how this quarantine period is messing up with his mental health and how he's been feeling a little unwell. So i adviced him just to relax and just not to make a big deal out of it, but he got a little offended and said mental health is not a joke and should be taken seriously.

This reminded me of a few months back when there was a camp at my uni for mental health awareness, it was free of cost and had a licensed psychiatrist present there. It was free and id never been to one before so i thought i should attend it.

She was quite friendly and helpful so we talked a bit, and she gave me few tests regarding depression, social anxiety, self esteem and anxiety. So i gave all the tests, took me about 20 minutes, after that she analysed all the tests and kinda looked at me with a pale face. 
I asked her about the scores she behaved in a weird way and said, that i should immediately see a therapist or it could be fatal for me later in life.

 I was freaked out, not gonna lie but i thought it was a setup for hooking up students for pointless therapies to suck up cash, because i wasn't feeling sad or anything like that.

Now that my friend has mentioned this, I'm kinda getting freaked but at the same time confused because i still don't have sadness or anything else like suicidal thoughts.

As we move forward, it is more and more unlikely that we will play any semblance of a season (despite the fact that league officials are hopeful).

So I am asking this because I am morally conflicted. On one hand, it's $400 and I did not/will not receive the services. On the other hand, I do understand that this is a complicated environment and asking for a refund/disputing the charge will put the league in a bad spot.

520,"Good Morning. Throwaway because my friends use Reddit.

Some backstory: My friend, we will call her C, her sister, and I worked at a local restaurant. The restaurant owner brought a family friend, we will call A, over from Europe to work at the restaurant. A and C started dating after we worked together for a few weeks. He ended up overstaying his Visa but now they are married and have had their immigration interview in order for him to obtain a Tax ID to legally work in the US.

Here is a list of reason why we do not like him:

1. He threw money at me multiple times and asked me to f\*\*\* my t\*ts.
2. He was here illegally for a while (13 months) and was behaving recklessly. Getting pulled over for speeding, having weed, not signaling all in one traffic stop. Doing hard drugs, gambling money he didn't have, starting fights out on public.
3. Before A and C started dating, he said he was going to find some dumb American girl to marry him so he can stay.... another time, e A and C got in an argument and he told her he would find another dumb american to marry him.

It was almost like he was acting out to push her

This is what we knew about prior to their marriage. Our friend told us about their wedding 2 weeks before it was set to take place. We warned our friend to not marry him and we spoke with her parents about this and she uninvited us to their wedding, called us backstabbers, etc. We were re-invited 2 days before, but we barely spoke to her. She asked our very good friend to marry them and that drove a wedge between us and our friend.

After they were married, the restaurant owner opened another restaurant and brought A in to be the head chef and manage the business. About 2 months in, the owner and A got in a fist fight. C told me about this the day after it happened and said that it was because A wanted to be paid more and owner refused.

After A was fired for the fight, he moved to NYC because he could not find work in our city. He was constantly overdrafting their joint account (she told us they needed joint accounts to prove they are a real couple). She was forced to move back home with her parents and sister to save money.

Since COVID, he moved into the family home, caused an argument between C and my friend (sisters) and my friend has been bouncing around to friends homes since. Recently, C and A ""needed"" to drive to NYC to ""pick up clothes"" for A. They drove down and back in 1 day.

Now, we recently found out from the wife of the restaurant owner things we had not know before:

1. A was 10s of thousands of dollars in debt to a bookie locally and restaurant owner paid his debts multiple times
2. A was using crack regularly and allegedly got C to start using (we noticed her skin and hair getting really bad but we chalked it up to stress)
3. C is now paying his debts off as well

Prior to meeting A, C was a very independent, go-getter, feminist type. She drank but never did drugs (only smoked pot 1 time in college) and would leave the bar in tears when her sister would smoke a cigarette. She has always been pretty frugal but likes to travel. She is a completely different person now. A shell of herself. She is co-dependent on him. She has turned most of our mutual friends and her family members against my friend and me because we do not associate with A and do not accept him. She has guilted my friend multiple times and made her feel like a POS for not accepting their marriage, constantly tells her that she is worried their relationship will never be the same. My friends' mom and sister-in-laws never got along, and mom and sister have a strained relationship as well so C throws this in my friend's face saying that they are headed down the same path. I don't know if this type of manipulation is sociopathic or if she is an addict and ""trying to survive"" or hide her addiction at all costs.

**HOW SHOULD WE PROCEED? I was thinking my friend should reach out to C and tell her ""you need to be honest with me now. I'm here to listen."" and hope C is honest with her. If C is not, we were thinking about reporting to immigration but unsure if we can as he is on the path of being here legally. We were also thinking if C is not honest, we would talk to her parents. We just aren't sure what to do.**",08May2020,1

I understand if a person is busy but why not tell me that you are busy?

 I understand if no talk for a whole day. Then i just asumme ok he is busy/doing his stuff.

But if texting some things during the day here and there (whit few hours in the middle) he could at least say things like. ''I'm busy today'' , ''Sorry whit my slow answers i'm busy'' because waiting hours for repply makes me annoyed.

Even if he is speding the day whit someone example friends he could say ''Sorry i'm busy whit friends''

So this is the age old story of needing a place to live, getting a friend as a roommate and things going sour.  


So I moved into a place with my friend. We aren't the best of friends, but I know him pretty well from University and growing up near each other. Our relationship is pretty relaxed, there are not many problems, but the problems that do occur are just conflicting with my lifestyle.  


Without going into too much detail, I make good money with my current job, and am able to pay the rent alone. My roommate does not make good money by himself, and most likely could not meet the rent and utilities by himself.  


All the Bills are in my name currently, and he's paid them all (not on time, but he pays them and thats nice).  


I've done some reading on having a tenant removed from a lease, and that is basically not possible. (I wouldn't want to go this route anyway, its not like we are fighting). However, when our lease is up, I would like to live in this place alone (I am more of a loner anyways).  


**\*So my question I would like advice on\*** : How do I go about telling him that I would like to re-sign the lease without him. and What possible backlash can occur from this?  


At the end of the day, I don't have a problem moving out and finding a new place, but I like my current location, and I care more about it than he does. (Thats not a jab at him, just different outlooks on where we are at in life).

But as it happens feeling got involved again. one day she said that even though she feels so many things for me, she felt that involving feelings was damaging our relationship. i again agreed to be friends, but after a lot of thinking i realised that it would be better to stop talking completely.

552,"I'm a teenager and I'm healthy so, If I get the Corona virus I'll be fine. My step mother, on the other hand has many health problems and if she gets sick with the Corona virus she could die. My Aunt who is quarantined with my dad and step mom also has health problems and has a very weak immune system so, it's a similar situation with her. My parents are divorced and I live at my dad's house half the week and mom the other half. My mom invites my uncle to dinner at our house every other day despite the fact that he isn't quarantined with us. They hang out together frequently and they don't social distance. I have told my mom that It isn't a good idea to be within 6 feet of someone that you aren't quarantined with. She usually says something like ""it's fine, he's family and he doesn't show any symptoms of Corona."" She's right that he doesn't show symptoms but, people can carry the virus with no symptoms and not know it. If my mom gets the Corona virus because she isn't social distancing, she'll end up giving it to me. If I don't have symptoms and I go to my dad's house, I could give it to my stepmom and aunt who could die from it.

553,"So I (22F) have this friend guys(18F), I invited her over since it’s my birthing day tomorrow and she came to run errands with me and smoke and whatever. I live with my boyfriend(20M)and he was there too obviously and she started to touch on him later in the day like laughing and punching his arm and putting her hands on his chest and I told her once “chill with all that touching bro” and she was like okay sorry and then did it again like 5 min later... I feel very strongly about my partner and I see a bright future with him so I’m very protective and I’ve been told I’m too quick to anger but honestly I want to put the gloves on and fight one round (that’s how we handle things where I’m from) I took it as flirting because I myself am a woman. That cutesy play fighting sh*t is for guys you wanna f***. Also she’s married and I wouldn’t touch her husband for any reason and I’ve known him for years so I think it’s weird she just met my partner and is doing all this. She doesn’t do it to her husband or me when we say something funny so reddit am I wrong for wanting to box it out because I’m very angry. What do I do? I’m tired of losing friends over men but I feel like no one has respect anymore.

554,"Hi,

I'm hungry, but there's nothing that my family cooks that I feel like eating much... there's fried patties and sometimes there's beans (I like beans) and tuna and eggs, but I'm tired of eggs and I don't like patties much. There's not much meat, and when we eat we rarely eat a meat I like. There's salmon too and fish at times but I don't know... I don't have much appettite for it.

I know I'm being a really ungrateful whiner, but I don't feel satisfied and nothing calls me. I like pasta and rice and boiled potatoes but they don't work on their own and I'm a picky eater.

Then I eat less at meals and end up snacking but not even the snacks seem like they fulfill my needs because cereal isn't going to compensate for whatever it is that I'm needing nutrition of but I can't figure out what is or how to eat it.

I don't know much recipes, the ones I know I'm tired of them a bit (beans and tuna, pasta and eggs, chickpeas and eggs)... or don't have the ingredients (we order the food so if I'm feeling like cooking the special oven food that I know how to cook with ingredients we don't order usually I'd have to wait one or two months now)

But even if I need to wait for that time, I'd at least like to be prepared if you guys have a recipe to help me. I know this is really dumb and whiney but I really want to know how to cook food that I want to eat. Because I look at the fridge and I don't feel like I want anything that's there. Except turkey meat that's currently being unfreezed. I also like chicken.

I'd really like advice.

556,"I (24F)  bought some appliances from a local store and over the course of a month, I was hooking up with the guy (32M) who delivered it. He would come over a few times per week, we hang out with my friends, eat, drink, socialize, sleep, etc. 

One night we drove in His car to get food, had dinner at my home, and went to sleep. By the morning, my wallet disappeared. It's really odd because I never lose my wallet and always leave it with my glasses and keys. 

I feel bad to accuse people of stealing so I kept seeing &amp; talking to him regularly throughout the ordeal, and continued giving myself time to tear my house apart while looking for it. 
 
I mentioned it a few days later, asking him to check His car. Nothing. 

Close to 1.5 weeks after the wallet missing, I told him I am concerned that He is involved with my wallet disappearing and He said ""I understand."" (without denying it). He still continued to come over and even celebrate His birthday at my place. 

So a few more days later, I joke that when He stops by again, ""don't forget my wallet"" and that He ""never told me He didn't take my wallet."" He then responded with ""I didn't take ur wallet..."" and we continued texting for a few more days, although He hasn't come back again.. and now pushing on 3-4 weeks, He ghosted me. 

Isn't this suspect af? On an intimate level, He also had some other red flags/ inappropriate behavior, but that's a rabbit hole I don't feel like going down. On the surface though, to other customers and even my circle, he presents himself really well and is respected and valued. 
 
I am contemplating if I should tell His boss because we met through His work, and He is in different homes all day, so He has a lot of opportunities to steal. 
 
I acknowledge that we choose to make the relationship unprofessional and not work-related, and that I will never recoup the loss involved. And I know that His boss will most likely take His side. But.. shouldn't theft be noted under someone's profile? He already told me that his coworkers know we're hooking up, so I'm sure they have heard his side of the story and may think I am crazy.. How should I bring up mine? 


TLDR: Starting hooking up with my appliance guy and then he *allegedly* stole my wallet. Should I inform the appliance store that he works for? If so, how?",08May2020,0

I don’t want them in the basement because it’s dusty, dark and generally not nice. 

I want them in my room, cage free. 
The basement is cold, even though the weather as improved, but my mum still says that “they have fur, they won’t get cold” and “they stink so they have to be in the basement” (they don’t stink, I clean their cage out often) so I said I’d keep my window open and she just snaps and says no. 
(At the moment, they only sleep in the cage at night, they go outside during the day and in evenings and mornings they run around the living room) 

I want them to be family pets and live with me, rather than be treated like livestock - outside during the day, in a cold, nasty place during the night. 

My mum already took their cage down to the basement - they are outside currently. I was planning on just bringing them to my room tonight and locking the door. I’ll probably get yelled at for that but I refuse to let them sleep in the basement.

Then just today I texted her for the first time in a few weeks and she told me she just found out that he died two weeks ago and that she didn’t want to talk about it, she seemed pretty reserved. She’s a strong woman and has gone through a lot of shit without harming pretty successful. She’s always 100% honest with me which I love and i remember maybe a month ago she was going though a tough time because she’s anorexic, and lockdown had recently started so me, her only friend had to leave and she was worried about her parants and probably had some other things going on and she started drinking a lot and said that wanted to kill herself, luckily she got thought that and was happy again, and made some friends without harming herself. She seems really upset about her friend, and I’m scared she will harm herself but I don’t know how I can help her.

Now that i think about it, if i had one i wouldn't be able to take her to shit. Like for example to eat out or something.

Id be nervous. Well, generally, fears dont stop me from doing things, but the feeling would be there

I would constantly think that i look stupid or that everybody's watching me, the pressure would even double cause of her.

Another, thing is that most of guys my age want to beat me up. Like, literally they stare me down, eyes full of hate. And im talking bout random guys in the streets.

Well, tbh, im an attractive, tall guy, dress well, id probably have a hot girl besides me, cuz you know, thats the only type i want. And, maybe, that could cause something. Honestly, can anyone really give me advice for that?

Im not scared of literally anyone one on one. I can fight. And it doesnt even happen in that case, they cant even look me in the eye, or they do, but no bad intentions. But thats the point. Everyones literally ganged up. Can you imagine walking in front of them? They would probably get triggered asf. Especially with a girl. Avoiding them would make me look stupid in front of her, and if not, i might get my ass beat. Well, honestly, i wouldnt run away, and also, im not trying to sound tough and shit, but i would probably kill them one by one afterwards. Lowkey, no one can stop my rage. sounds cringey and corny, but its true tho.

Why do they even get triggered tho? I mean, i dont think i look anxious, even considering other things ive mentioned above (feeling watched, etc.) Well at least everyone says so. I really dont know. I do have a ""if youll fuck with me, i ll fuck you up"" type of expression, but tbh when i look unborhered or relaxed they find it more triggering.

569,"Posting for my boyfriend.

So a while ago (roughly 7-8 months) my bf T (30M) had a roommate R (56ishM) move into his home to help do work around the house in exchange for rent. R has helped T out a bit with the house and being a friend to listen, but since then he hasn't  been putting in work so T has him paying for rent instead.

R has been becoming more and more of a nuisance. He doesn't have a job, car, or life. He spends the majority of time in his room all day every day, and only comes down to cook food, if he thinks he hears T in the kitchen, or to linger when we're hanging out with guests over. It's weird because he doesn't engage in conversation with anyone except for T, and it always feels awkward with him around. T will avoid walking around his house freely just so he doesn't have to interact with R or listen to him complain, or ask for rides places.

R is weird. I myself, a few of my friends, and even T's sister caught him staring out the widow at us out in the yard on multiple occasions. Just staring. T thinks he listens to us when we're being intimate or just in regular scenarios too so most of the time we talk quietly. EX: Once we were talking in the kitchen just the two of us about how we just bought milk and it was almost gone and the kids are the only ones who really drink it and they hadn't been home in a few days cause they were at their moms. I knew it was R cause I bought cereal and it was gone in 2 days and I hadn't had any. T doesn't eat cereal and it wasn't kids cereal. Well I went to work and apparently R walked through the door with milk to show T. Like good job you replaced the milk you drank.. and proved you do listen in without being present.

He'll use little things here and there and think we don't notice. Stupid things like the laundry detergent I bought has been watered down instead of replaced. It's gotten to the point where we keep anything we use and don't want to share in our room but I don't think that would even make the difference if R wanted something... He's taken our laundry out of the dryer when it was in for a little while and put it IN OUR ROOM instead of on top of the dryer. 

T has 3 Kids whom he shares with his ex. In the beginning his ex didn't want the kids there because R lives there. R knew she felt this way because T mentioned it to him but he didn't feel the need to move out. Most people would hear they're causing problems and go. I thought that was weird and asked T about it. Apparently R lost his kids and can only see them if it's supervised. T's ex let it slide and the kids come over, T has the kids sleep in our room when they stay over and they all have their own beds and they like it cause it's like a sleepover. But they don't sleep in theirs because T is uncomfortable with R being right down the hall. That reason alone should have been when T told R to go.

I believe R is mentally unstable. I've seen him talk about someone who pissed him off and punch a brick wall with a smile on his face and his knuckles all beat up afterwards. And I've also witnessed him steal before with no remorse. T is ready to ask him to move out but is unsure how to ask because R has been a friend to him, and more so because T is concerned R will do some something if he's offended. That's the advice part.. How doe's he ask this guy to find somewhere else and move out in the smoothest way possible?",08May2020,1
570,"I know it's cliche, and I didn't think it would happen to me, but here I am. I've been in a relationship with my current gf for 9 years this year, we've been long distance for 9 months so far (I moved to the other side of the country for a career defining job) and at first it was ok, but maybe because of the virus and my inability to go visit i've been feeling especially home sick recently. I wasn't really thinking of staying out here for long, 2 years max is what I told her and myself. The job itself is ok, not as great as I originally thought, but I am learning a lot which is good and useful. I just miss her dearly, and recently just been thinking of calling it quits and moving back home, getting a job won't be an issue for me in my field but I'd be taking a pay cut for sure.

Basically I need advice, my parents tell me to stay longer as this job is very good and stable. Although i'm pretty miserable out here, the city i am currently in pales in comparison to the city i grew up in (bias aside). My heart says to go home and be with her, I know she's the one and I don't want to lose her. She is VERY supportive of me and is open to me staying the full 2 years as I said, she's even working on moving out east to be closer to me but her field isn't as flexible as mine, and employers rarely will hire and relocate someone of her position and she's reluctant on moving without a job ready. Although the desire from her is there for sure, I doubt there is an employer out here who is willing to relocate someone (engineer drafter). 

At this rate i'm open to move back after only a year of being here, but i know rationally, staying the 2 years would look better for my resume, and I was also relocated by the company I work for currently and I have to stay at least 2 years so I don't have to pay back the relocation fees.

My dad is very poor and I couldn't go take a 3 hour ride to see her often, I didn't drive and he was in contact with the doctors, telling me how it's better for her not to have visitors (he was probably trying to protect me as he saw how affected I was and still am about it, taking sedatives, antidepressants..). Meanwhile, a very shitty relative who my mom hasn't spoken to most of her life lived close to the hospital, went there to tell her how her daughter sucks, how I'm probably ashamed of her (that made me extremely mad) and was contacting the whole family on my moms side to inform them of all of this.

577,"For context:

I (24M) work as an English teacher in an elementary school. I love teaching. It’s stressful, of course, but love working with kids. I know it’s something that I want to do for the rest of my life, as least as a side gig. 

The school I work at is definitely not bad. The pay could be better but it’s slightly above standard, I usually feel appreciated, and I get along with the other teachers and staff. The administration could improve certain things but nothing that we can’t handle. It’s also 10 minutes away from my house (not that that matters too much atm with the quarantine). Overall, it’s a good job. I was only going to teach in this school for a year, but stayed for another because I really enjoyed it. However, I feel like my time here has come to an end. 

I had planned to quit by the end of the school year in July because I'm applying for a second BA in Game Design in Germany (I have a BA in Language Studies). After languages, videogames are my other passion and I would love to find a way to bring them both together. For the past two years, I've saved almost all of my income for this purpose. I am also super interested in Germany as a country and was excited to have the opportunity to live there for a while. I even planned to go to Germany whether I got accepted or not. If not, I would've just gone to study German for a few months and try to get certified to come back and become a German teacher. Then I could just reapply next year.

Now, the whole situation with COVID-19 has me feeling really unsure if I should be taking that leap now. I'm afraid of this going on for too long and not being able to travel, or going to Germany only to spend my time in quarantine taking online classes.

Even if I can't go to Germany, I had already set my mind on quitting, so now I don't really enjoy the idea of staying for another year teaching at the same school. If not going abroad, I would at least want a change of scenery. I was thinking about finding another teaching job in another state or something. I would also work on learning coding and game development on my own. With two years of savings, I'm covered on the money front for a while.

What I'm asking is: If I can't go to Germany, should I still quit my job? Should I play it safe for now even though it won't make me as happy? Or should I risk it and try to follow this other dream I have any way I can?

tl;dr I have an okay job, but I have other interests that I want to pursue. I'm not sure if quitting right now is the best decision because of the situation with COVID-19. What should I do?",08May2020,1

579,"Hello. I'm at my wit's end about this and I have turned to the internet for help.
I'm on mobile, so apologies for formatting issues. Throwaway account.

My (20F) dad (46) used to be a smoker for at least a decade. About 6-7 years ago, he experienced some pain in his chest and went to the doctor. He was fine but the incident left him shaken and he stopped smoking. 

A year or so after that, he started drinking. I don't know how (I think one of his colleagues persuaded him to). At first it was one beer every once in a while. Then he slowly got addicted. After a while, he would even bring beer cans home to drink after the family would go to sleep. My mother (45) was distraught. She (and I) thought that with him not smoking anymore, he would become healthier. Instead, he took up this disgusting habit and has become addicted to it.

It has been roughly 4 years since he started drinking. We are worried about his health and we have tried to get him to stop many times. We tried the pleading/begging route. We tried the emotional what-will-happen-to-us route to appeal to him. We tried being angry and scolding him, hoping some sense would go through his head. Nope. Nothing.

Two years ago, he said he would stop drinking on my parents' anniversary. He hasn't and keeps saying he will stop on so and so date. These past two months he was sober due to everything happening and non essential shops being shut down. However, our government has allowed for liquor stores to open up this week and today he came home drunk after grocery shopping.

I keep thinking about finding a therapist or something but I am really out of my depth here. I am very scared for him and ourselves. Please please give me advice. I would appreciate any and all help given. Thank you.",08May2020,1

582,"To any alumni or prospective/admitted/current students, I am deciding between UCSB and Cal Poly and need to make a decision asap. Because I can't take a tour during a global pandemic, I thought I'd turn to reddit. I want to be an environmental engineer (specifically a marine or petroleum engineer with a focus on pollution) but I applied in environmental science. A little about me that might influence your opinion - I’m from Tam Valley in Marin (across the gg bridge from SF on hw 1). I used to surf and I want to get back into it. I like to snowboard and play beer die and I smoke a lot of weed. I’m also really into math and science (chem and physics are my fav) and I do not like English. I spend almost all my free time at the beach.

**Cal Poly Pros:**

* Hands on while ucs focus more on theory
* found a really cool roommate
* accepted to quarter plus (need to accept offer in like 30hrs ahh)
* smaller class sizes taught by real profs
* 94% of grads have a job in their major!!!
* slightly less expensive
* closer to home by 2hr drive

**Cons:**

* Hard to change major, but I reached out to 4 different departments that said most people end up changing their major. Engineering will require some extra writing but I should probably get in
* quarter plus will probably be canceled for corona
* if I were at cal poly I feel like I would see Isla Vista on social media like that could’ve been me but if I were at sb I wouldn’t look at poly and say that could’ve been me..
* hard to find housing as an upperclassman
* 10 mins from the beach
* Can't bring a car

**UCSB pros:**

* ISLA VISTA PARTIES
* Never bored
* Literally ON the beach (my happy place)
* UC reputation good when applying for jobs/grad school
* research opportunities
* nobody that goes to sb has anything bad to say about it
* scholarships
* a lot of friends live in appts down there at CC
* Easy change of major

**Cons:**

* Focused on gen ed vs major classes for first two years
* big classes
* a lot of classes taught by TAs
* theory vs hands on
* less labs
* never been to SB
* higher likelihood of social life distracting from academics but I did pretty well balancing that in high school

Kind of a pro and a con for SB.. they only have a chemical engineering program no environmental engineering but that could open up more job opportunities - I want to do petroleum engineering or marine engineering",08May2020,1

I read online that starting birth control can cause spotting for up to three months but im unsure if this counts in my case as i stopped the pills and started again within a 4 month time frame, anyone else experience this?

593," So, im going to try and keep this brief.

My parents are super religious

I am gay.

19 years i've known i was gay or at least that ""i didnt like girls"" since i was a kid even if i didnt know there was a name for it yet. I'd always get in trouble for messing other guys and getting caught/'Repenting for my sins"" and confessing it to her. I never really got in any severe trouble for it past maybe a spanking and not being able to hangout with that person, or being told to ""pray about it"" and, ""it was just a phase"" or ""puberty"" for 10 years.

So you can imagine my surprise and broken heart when the first thing my mom said to me when (She found out) I was gay, was ""where did I fail you as a parent"" before breaking down in tears.

For the first couple years after, she'd randomly send me bible verse texts and call me to let me know ""its never too late to come back to the church"" and that ""god will help me overcome your sexuality"". I'm not even sure why it bothered me so much. Its not like she'd shunned me like ive heard other parents do. She's said she ""wont accept your sexuality but i still love you"" and i guess thats the better than a lot of people get. Its now been about 5 years since and we really dont talk more than two or three times a year, and the conversations are usually awkward and brief.

This morning however i got a text saying that granddad had died, and my numbness to the text and situation is kind of alarming. I called my dad to ask about her but he only told me to call her myself. Im afraid that If I do, im going to come across as super ingenuine or insensitive and i dont want to make her feel her worse than im sure she's already feeling. I also know that if i don't call at all, shes going to be even more hurt that her own son wouldn't even check up on her. I feel like a super peice of shit no matter which choice i take.",08May2020,1

595,"I 23/f had been dating my ex 25/M for 3 years. I found out he had cheated on me with 2 different girls. One was only sexting over tinder and the other one he met in person but apparently they “didn’t have sex”. We broke up in December and I have been trying to move on without him in my life. I blocked him on everything except his phone number. 

So last night I get a text from him because he saw that I was on tinder and now he wants all his money and stuff back. I told him I’d give him the stuff back and be done. Then he said “I’m just mad I don’t want it back”. So I explained that I’m done and I’m moving on and so does he. 

So this morning I wake up to a call from my sister and mom who say my ex has been messaging them on Instagram and Facebook to try to get to me. I then went on my Instagram and saw I had a message request from a random account and it turns out it was him. He sent me long paragraphs about how he’s going to come to my house to collect his things and that I’m a hoe for talking to other guys and he doesn’t want the stuff he bought me to be in a house where other guys will be. I told him that’s fine and he can have it back. 

Then he sent me bills and receipts for all the trips or money he’s ever given me over the course of the relationship and said if he doesn’t get it back he’s going to come over and collect it. I don’t have the money to pay him back. 

I blocked his number and this new Instagram account but I feel like hell keep making new ones. I just don’t know what to do and I’m getting scared.

597,"AITA for cheating on my ex husband even though he cheated first?

Yea this one is messy and the relationship ended up being toxic as fuck. Probably on both sides. I would say him more than me. I will start off by saying that we have kids together and I never ever thought we would separate honestly. But we are both young (21 &amp; 22). I was devastated when I found out because I genuinely thought he would never do that to me. I was finishing up college at the time, doing my externships when I found out. He went as far as to telling these women I had left him when we had been living together for at least a year and a half at this point. I was very depressed for a long time but stayed because we do have kids together and at the time I was scared to be a single mom and I didn’t want to break up our family and have a “broken home”. I have no idea if he actually had sex with any of these women but I still considered what he did do to be cheating. I however did sleep with other people. I know I should not have and it didn’t solve anything, i was in a place of hurt and honestly didn’t really care about how it would hurt him at the time if he did find out and felt like I was sort of taking karma into my own hands. Which I know this could backfire on me as now I could have bad karma. We are both in new relationships and I have learned that he’s already cheated on his new girlfriend. I just feel like overall he’s turned out to be a shitty, toxic, draining person. Was I wrong for giving him a taste of his own medicine?",08May2020,1

608,"I (M17) have an aunt who is showing obvious signs of depression. I suffer from anxiety and OCD, and it’s sometimes hard to keep track of her behavior and what’s going on inside her head. It worries me and it seems like she’s having a crisis in her 40s (desire to start a family, unhappy with work, missing her parents) My aunt told me that she’s seeing a therapist, but things are getting worse.

- When someone dies in my family, she tells me that the dead are better off, because they don’t have to suffer anymore in this cruel world. My aunt even said something about jumping off a building, but I didn’t know how to respond, so I went upstairs.

- She dislikes her house and misses my grandparents, so I told her to frequently stay here.

- She cried to me about feeling lonely and a man who was interested in her 12 years ago; I told her to maybe try out a dating app and meet someone new. As a response I got that her religious organization advises against.

- My aunt wishes that she could do simpler, more creative work, instead of working in an office.

- I don’t know how to word this properly, but she uses some sort of emotional blackmail. It sounds harsh and I don’t mean it that way at all. Every week she pressures us into watching a film at my grandparents’ house and when I don’t give her way, she says that she’ll cry on her bike when she’s going home.

- She has A LOT of trouble with her childhood and always talks about how distant family members would create unrest in the house when they came over. (Our family hasn’t been the nicest and is very dysfunctional, still.)

- My aunt is a firm believer of alternative therapy, so she will refuse antidepressants. She told me to not use pills if a doctor describes them, however, a little Serax helped me a long way when I felt a panic attack coming up. Isn’t there a way for her to use antidepressants in a safe way?

I love my aunt a lot, but she told me that because of homework I don’t notice her when she visits us. These subtle things she tells me about my behavior make me feel like shit for a tiny bit, so I want to help her even if we don’t get along always.

614,"Hi! 

As stated in the title, I want to go back to school and earn a degree in law. I’m having an Elle Woods (minus the ex boyfriend) level quarter life crisis. 

I’ve always been intrigued by law. This quarantine, like everybody else, has given me the gift of time to overthink my life choices. I have been feeling way too directionless and ignorant of the world around me lately and now I feel this calling getting bigger and more demanding inside me. The tipping point was watching this video of cops trying to intimidate this guy into bogus laws and unjustly getting him out of his car until he pulls out his BAR card and the cops immediately backed off. It got me thinking, along with the other new reports of unjust things happening, what if I’m ever in that situation? Or my family? Or friends? I want to protect myself and others. I want to make a difference, even if it’s small. 

But is it too late for me? 

I already graduated with duel degrees in visual arts (I love painting and drawing and I hope to use this skills in some way, some day) and advertising (to appease my business minded parents with something more lucrative—- but they’ve always supported my art endeavors). But it’s been, oh geez, FOUR years....

If it’s not too late, what are the most important things I need to prep for? Books I should read and study? Schools to look at that aren’t Ivy League? Law movies I should watch besides My Cousin Vinny and Legally Blonde???? (Mostly kidding on the last one) Or just any other miscellaneous things that are good to know??

I’ve been doing research on my own, reaching out to friends who took a law path, and my mother is putting me in contact with one of her best friends that is an artist (photography) but is... wait for it... a law professor on the west coast of the USA (where I’m from).

I basically grew up in a car (Germans drive everywhere, lol) but I was always over-aware of the traffic, and scared for an accident to happen. Since I moved, I don't know anybody who owns a car in my city, and the few times my parents visit, and I drive with them, I am even more anxious than I was before. They are both really good drivers, but if freaks me out that there is other people on the road. I have seen people doing some crazy moves, speeding, and of course there is sometimes ''ghost drivers''. All that stuff freaks me out and it got a lot worse over the years.

When I am on the bike, I am pretty confident in traffic most of the time. I am careful, steady and keep my eyes on the road all the time. I don't even listen to music. I had some moments where I had to react quick, like a bus that almost hit me bcs he didn't see me, and I always managed to handle the situation perfectly (sounds arrogant, but true lol). Literally escaping from death or serious injury. Maybe because I am this person who is always waiting for something to go wrong. But it scares me, and there is days where I am so anxious that I avoid busy streets at all costs.

Still, I really want to get over this, because I know I can drive a car. There is so many people doing it, there is no reason why I should not. I even drove a car in a parking lot years ago, I get how these things work. It is really not that complicated and kind of fun to do. But it horrifies me at the same time. I almost pushed myself far enough, plus I would have the money *and* time to do it now, but I could really use some advice to get over this.

I would appreciate any tips, maybe some of you had similar issues and managed to overcome them? Please tell me how!",08May2020,1
619,"Basically, my 24 year old son was going to College but he dropped out. He lives with his Rich GF who pretty much pays for everything. He doesn't have an actual regular job and says he's doing music and something online. 

This is honestly embarrassing as he's a full grown adult and without his GF he could not live his slacking life style. He needs to go out and actually contribute to society. When I was his age, I was already working multiple jobs while going to College. The only reason why I'm not paying for any of his stuff is solely because of his GF and that's his only lifeline. Since his GF is so forgiving of him, he's able to whatever he wants instead of being an Adult.

What should I do? Should I just ignore him and just live out my life? He's not my responsibility but it still pisses me off that my own flesh and blood is acting like this when his mother and I were never lazy. Is there any way or action to take to get him to actually be a responsible **adult**?

As we were making out I held her hips and she picked herself up where I felt her up. Awesome, as it was, I asked her if she was ready for s*x. She said she wasn't sure at the moment, later that day we talked and she said not yet. The way we are we could sleep together, but how do I know the time is right? Is there a sign I should look out for? Does she give off certain body language? Is there something i need to prepare for?

I am stuck in a toxic situation with my parents. My entire life they have been overprotective to the point that I STILL need to ask them to leave the house, I never could really hang out with friends or do activities outside the house (and I can’t stay out longer than they decide (usually just after a couple hours of being gone). I am 22 years old. 

My older brother went through a 4 year long fight with cancer until he died almost a year ago. During this time I had to take care of my little brother alone for a few months at a time, and I even had to skip an entire semester to help out with the family, at my dad’s request. I was happy doing this, this is what families do. I thought that my parents would be proud of me and grateful that I sacrificed a lot to help out. 

They were. For a few months at least, until I started dating a wonderful man they disapproved of immediately for being black. My parents have since started treating me different. My depression has worsened and I have tried to kill myself multiple times. They do not take my depression seriously. I was seeing a therapist and they made me stop because they “couldn’t afford it” (they can, we are well off family). They haven’t batted an eye when I told them I wanted to die or even that I had almost killed my self but my boyfriend helped me through it just a couple months ago. 

Sometimes things are fine but tensions always boil over and end in a huge fight where they say awful things about me and my boyfriend. I used to cry and fight back but I have since steeled myself to the point that I don’t speak and I am stone faced until they finish and I go to my room to cry alone. They only other good person in my life (besides my amazing little brother and the therapist they made me stop seeing), is my boyfriend, who is only allowed to come over once a week if that, and I’m only allowed to go to his once a week as well. The whole time he is in my house, they aren’t hostile but there is a certain tension that makes everyone uncomfortable and I could tell it makes my boyfriend upset and I hate it. I’ve spoken to them at length and they can’t see their ignorance. 

This tension finally reached a tipping point where after a particularly nasty argument that left me feeling drained and suicidal, I decided to pack up and leave to my boyfriends where I stayed for three weeks until this morning (I left because he was lying for everything and i felt like a burden). 

I came back home and my father said that I’m not his daughter anymore and that he wishes my older (dead) brother were here instead of me. They said that they will not help me pay for anything unless I stay at home. (They helped my sisters when they moved out) I can get loans for my tuition and although my job search for people in my major has come up short, and the pandemic isn’t helping, I might just work at a supermarket meanwhile. But I still won’t be able to pay for the expensive rent in my city, nor my car insurance and phone all on that salary. 

Is there anything I can do? Any resources or options I can explore? I’m sorry this is so long, I just feel like I can’t take it any more.",08May2020,1

But Engineering messed up me up really badly . I soon realised that this was not my piece of cake and always had thr thought of quitting.

I like my job and all , but my parents wanted me to complete the last 3 backlogs that I have and officially be an ""Engineer"".

631,"Hello! So I am a lady and I have a girlfriend who I’ve known for 7 years. We’re both 21 now. When I was 14 I moved across the country so we kept in touch over the internet all these years and I came to visit her twice. Once when I was 16 and another time a few months ago while I was back in the state. She had come to my state 3 times in the last 3 or 4 years for things like Disney and she also has a sister living in the same state as me. I was kinda hurt because she never really mentioned to me that she was coming to the state 2 of those times. One of the times she did tell me and then turned around and said her dad was too sick to come because we made plans to meet. She actually did end up coming anyways and completely “forgot” to tell me and we couldn’t meet up I guess. It wasn’t a big deal I just felt like she didn’t even want me knowing but then posted it all over social media. Like she always said she wanted to see me but didn’t really make any effort to make plans. I would have understood if she couldn’t but she kind of just blew me off instead. 


Another issue I had was when my sister needed someone to hold onto some boxes for her because she wasn’t in state and she had an ex friend dropping them off so I asked this friend if she could keep them in her basement for me. She confirmed 3 big boxes when I asked but never sent pictures when I also asked for those. When the time came for my sister to pick them up, this girl ignored my messages about it for days. Like she would not reply. So I gave my sister her address to pick them up and when my sister got there this girl called her mom looking for it. Apparently her mom went through it and gave it all away, and it was a bunch of jewelry, costumes, and Knick knacks my sister had collected over the years. Not junk. Obviously it wasn’t her responsibility to hold onto it but it kind of broke my trust in her because it was almost sneaky in the way she handled it, how could she not know what happened. She’s basically an only child so it’s not like she wasn’t there when her mom must have done it. 


She never really seemed interested in my problems and always wanted to complain about herself and I tried my best to be a good friend and offer advice. I told her I wanted to be a nail tech and a week later she was posting online about looking for nail schools to go to because now she wanted to do it, but she never even mentioned that to me either. So I told her we should go together to encourage her to share with me. I’ve also recently told her about how I pole dance because I don’t tell very many people. The next week she has a pole installed in her room. I told her I wear wigs and she just ordered 3 off of amazon. Catch my drift? I told her I had been practicing tarot and she has a tarot deck and all that jazz now. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not gatekeeping my hobbies, I encourage people to start these kinds of things all the time! But it’s a little off putting because it’s like she copies EVERYTHING I tell her I do. I think she might have a little crush on me tbh, like she almost wants to be like me. Even in middle school she tried to copy my exact style and she doesn’t wear the things I wear anymore but it still stuck out to me. I’m never mean about any of this, I do encourage her to do it all once I realize she’s done it so it’s not like I’m hateful, I keep my thoughts about it to myself as long as she seems happy. 


I would just like some insight on how other people perceive this stuff. Am I being crazy? She’s the only girl I’ve stayed friends with as I am not good at making friends because I am shy. I just feel strange about it because I don’t really know if it’s normal behavior. Opinions would be helpful!

Edit: I’m mostly asking and thinking about these things now because I’m getting married soon and idk how I feel about our friendship, I don’t want people with weird intentions in my life or at my wedding because I’m a very closed off person and it would make me uncomfortable.

635,"Hi. Im 17 (f) and I’ll be turning 18 in approximately 7 months, I’ll be graduating from high school next year. I know that it’s normal for people my age to move out and head to college, start their independent life, ya know? But my parents are a little more traditional, they want me to move out when I get married (lmao). However, my relationship with my parents has never really been stable, or good.

I’ve applied to colleges that are kind of far away, and I really do want to move closer to whatever school I end up going to.

Its scary moving out, especially since most kids my age have their parents support and help- if I move out, I’ll be completely on my own.

The middle child Son2 is on the Autism Spectrum, and also lives at his dads. Their dad is a real piece of work.. he basically told son2 he’d pay him cash for doing all the yard work and taking care of all the farm animals. Son2 has never seen a dime from it. His Dad has taken all his birthday, graduation, and Christmas money and spent it on cocaine. His Dad also convinced him he no longer needs his meds, but still fills the prescription to put up his nose or sell.

Son2 told his Dad he wanted to move in with us next week, and his Dad pitched a fit and threw his brand new iPhone (I bought it for his birthday 2 weeks ago) into the woods and his Dad tried to tell him he bought because it was from child support. I DIDNT PAY FOR SON2’s PHONE WITH THE CHILD SUPPORT HIS MOTHER HAS NOT RECEIVED IN MONTHS. I paid out of my pocket.. 

Sorry that doesn’t matter... his Dad is trying to convince him all we want is money from him ( which is what his Dad wants, obviously)

All We (mom and i) want is Son2 to be able to grow up and eventually be self sufficient. He is her only child who has graduated so far.

641,"I’m kind of at a loss here, and to be honest i’m very upset and trying not to let it get to me. 

I’m half Hispanic (25% Spanish 25% Mexican). I usually just say i’m half Mexican because it’s easier to explain. I’m half German as well. 

I look white for the most part, i just have olive skin. I look just like my dad with some of my mom’s features so it makes sense i look more white. Nobody would guess i’m Mexican unless i tell them, then you see it. 

My boyfriend and his family are very very white. I love them to death and they love me and obviously they don’t give a shit that i’m Mexican because thats not something you should care about, so they don’t. They make lighthearted jokes here and there but i don’t mind because my biggest thing is that you should be able to laugh at yourself, plus they are never malicious jokes or even racist jokes. I laugh at them and i never get upset. 

My boyfriend’s grandfather is 84 and quite senile. He makes very inappropriate, loud comments about everything and everyone and it’s typically funny, until he found out i’m Mexican...

I remember when my boyfriend told him i was Mexican and he goes “OH!” In a very disgusted way. He then proceeds to say “Mexicano and Italiano should not mix.” (My boyfriend’s grandmother is straight from Italy).

He’s said these things in front of me and i just laughed it off, even though i was sort of uncomfortable. 

I must clarify right now that my boyfriend ALWAYS defends me. Always always always. Whether i’m there or not he will defend my honor, even if it’s his family. He knows i don’t mind the jokes but he defends me either way because he loves me. However he gets even more angry with his grandfather because he’s just straight up being racist. 

My boyfriend told me yesterday that his grandfather ended up calling me a “wetback” at dinner. He and his stepdad defended me (as usual) and got very angry, but i can’t help but feel humiliated and upset about this. I kept thinking about it endlessly and i was actually crying all morning about it. I have never experienced this before from anyone. I feel so hated for something i can’t control and that’s what is hurting me the most. 

I expressed this to my boyfriend and he was even more furious with his grandfather because i cried about it. He knows i have thick skin and i can manage my own, but when i start crying he knows it’s serious. 

I’m just unsure how to handle this situation. It’s becoming more and more frequent, whether i’m there or not, that his grandfather is making such derogatory and racist comments that are not lighthearted and fun, they are straight up negative and full of hate. 

I feel like his grandparents (both of them, even though his grandmother hasn’t said anything) hate me because i’m half Hispanic. I feel uncomfortable going over there because they live with him and his parents. I feel like his grandparents would be so upset to have Hispanic children in the family one day. They would never accept them, and that’s what’s upsetting me the most. I don’t care about me, i care about my future children. 

I want to stand up for myself but i feel like it’s pointless. He is 84 and i don’t want to cause drama, but i have no idea what to do. My boyfriend does a good enough job defending me but obviously his grandfather doesn’t give a shit because he continues to make these comments. 

I’m just at a loss here. I love love love my boyfriend to death and i love his mom and stepdad and brothers and step siblings. Even his grandparents i still love. I want to be in their family but i feel so unaccepted by his grandparents. What should i do?",08May2020,1
642,"So I had braces for 3 years and my orthodontist is now my regular dentist. Before starting my orthodontic work she gave me 2 fillings, I had pretty bad teeth before but I take very good care of them now. I got my braces off in September and then she moved me to her new clinic closer to where I lived which was great, but at my post braces checkup she told me I needed 3 fillings. Something about the timing of it seemed off (why was she only mentioning them now?) and I also hate getting fillings so I cancelled it and never rebooked. 

So today I had an emergency appointment because my retainers were destroyed (you’re supposed to get new ones every 6 months and it had been 8) and she asked me about fillings. I claimed I couldn’t remember her telling me anything about fillings. Then she X-rays me and says I need 1 filling. So now I feel like she’s just trying to build up a clientele for her new partner at this location as she did the same thing to my uncle when she moved him to her new clinic. She also seems to be charging me for things now that I was pretty sure came under my orthodontic package (new retainers were 170 and told me if I wanted a permanent bar to keep teeth in place that would be 200).

644,"My boyfriend has gained about 40 pounds in the past 2 months or so, and last time he dropped me off at home my mother remarked about ""how fat he'd gotten"" I love him and I really wouldn't want him any other way, he's 6ft tall and 230 so I think he's fine and healthy. I really like the new weight on him and I know he's very insecure about his body because he has stretch marks. I want him to come over, but I don't want my mother to say something that might hurt him. Should I warn him that if he comes over she might say something? I've spoken to my mother about it and she sorta laughed it off like 'what? He's a big guy!' We come from a culture where if you're fat, people are just gonna say it, she thinks Americans are way too sensitive about it. Whether that's true or not I don't want her words to hurt my boyfriend so help from any chubby insecure guys out there? What would you want me to do?",08May2020,1
645,"Basically, I’m shacking up with my mother right now. Hopefully make my way out of the house within this year. Sucks being 23 and still home but I digress. 

Lately with tax returns and stimulus checks, money has been on my mind. With my mom in particular, I offer her whatever she needs financially to make my staying home not a burden. But she’s been known to be a pathological liar. (Trust me. Not my favorite thing to live with.) 

Lately she’s claiming that something went wrong with her tax return AND Stim check saying she has received neither. 

Part of me wants to be a helpful responsible adult and give her the benefit of the doubt.  But I can’t shake the feeling she’s playing the sympathy card to weasel money out of me. 

Is there any way I can see if these things were received? Hopefully without her knowing? I tried asking to look at her bank statements once and she guilt tripped me about how I don’t trust her.

646,"What is the point? No matter how hard I try, nobody will care. I will never be the very best. It's a competitive mindset, I know but how am I any special or unique if I know I will never be the best in anything.

Its exhausting, more so that few other addictions have crept up on me and I am not sure how to quit. Video-game addiction sucks, usually I would know how to quit them but in this case I am in quarantine and all my friends are playing all the same.

My sleep cycle is messed up, my schedule for studies are messed up. Its all a mess and only solace is that during this period nobody is being productive. But it's probably all ending soon and when the world opens back up, I will have to fight a meaningless battle again.

Seeing all those other people try so hard, so sociallable, living life like a breeze makes me kinda sad. I wish I could be like them. I want to but I just don't feel happy, haven't felt genuine happiness. Only time I felt that was when I am doing those unproductive things. Whenever I thing of those things that I have to do, I just feel exhausted and don't feel like doing any of them.

I really need help. I don't know what to do, I just don't really have that spark anymore. You know that glow in the eyes, that fire, you see that really pushes one to their limits. I wish I could have that again but my past motivations was only for revenge. Now that goal was achieved and I just feel empty. What now? What should I do now.

My friends just seems so passionate about the future, accounting, finance, counting money, doing business. I see those sparks within but whenever I hear about these stuff I just feel bored and uninterested. I know it may sound immature but I don't know what I want, why do they have the spark for things like these. The anticipation for growing up. The adult world just seems boring and grey and I don't really have that motivation to move on to that, yet, at least.",08May2020,0
647,"First of all, sorry if i misspell something or anything like that, i’m brazilian and so english isn’t my main language.

— // —

I don’t even know where to start. I’ve been friends with Person A for about 2 years, and the moment we met we were instant best friends. We get along really well and they’re one of the most important people in my life. 

I’ve met Person B around the same time as A, but our relationship has been quite different. He were really toxic and abusive to me, saying things like “You’re the only person that keeps me alive” or “If it weren’t for you, I would’ve already killed myself”, etc. I felt like it was my duty to help him. One day he even sent me a photo of a freshly cut wrist, saying that he did this to himself because i didn’t respond him in time. I could spend hours saying all the things he did to me, but just trust me when I say it was one of the worst periods of my life, but I simply couldn’t stop talking to him for my own mental health, only because i feared that he would attempt something bad when I wasn’t around him.

Some months pass and Person B simply didn’t talk to me anymore, and I assumed the worst, putting all the blame on myself because now my “best friend” died because of me. 
Well, some time passes and he returns, saying that he changed and wanted a second change at your friendship. Now thinking back, I definitely developed some sort of Stockholm Syndrome, since even if i new he was toxic to me, I believed that he changed for the better and wouldn’t mistreat me like he did in the past. He still *did* mistreat me, but a lot less than before, but i kept on giving him more and more chances to redeem himself.

Around the same time, A started dating Person C (sorry if it gets confusing for now on) which had a bad record of toxic relationships with other of my friends, and A thought that they could change C, and that he wouldn’t be toxic with them or something like that. Well, they were inseparable at first, but some months pass and the relationship got nowhere, and the fights between them got worst. Of course, A told me everything to me, saying that he needed someone to talk about his problems (which i didn’t care, he was my best friend after all). 

So this kept going, and eventually the title of “best friend” was for both A and B. But, B started liking C romantically, even though he was dating A at the time. Person A found out about this and wasn’t happy the tiniest bit, and a HUGE fight broke off and in one night, everything fell apart. 
A was thinking about breaking up with C, and B was just waiting the right moment to ask C out, and I was in the middle of everything. For some stupid reason, the blame fell on me after everything, C says that A is a bad influence on me, and wants me to stop talking to them because they are dramatic and really possessive towards C; and A thinks that C is a bad influence to me, after all, he was super abusive at the begging of our friendship. 

My instinctive reaction was to calm both down, and be friends with everyone, but it’s really not that simple, and I fear that if I don’t chose one of them, i’ll lose them both. 

Of course, I don’t want to choose between two of my best friends. A is really kind and caring for me, and we know basically everything there’s to know about each other. 
Even though B mistreated me, I feel that he changed and is really trying to improve and be a better person, and he was really disappointed on me when he found out i still talked with A. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if i should befriend them in secret and HOPE that they don’t find out about my friendship with the other; or if i should stop talking with A/B, or if I shouldn’t talk to none. 
If the story got confusing, feel free to ask me questions about this, I really need some advice :((",08May2020,1
648,"So for backstory: I was in a rough relationship three years ago, born out of desperation,  and it really taught me the value of maturity. Ever since, I have highly scrutinized any person I had any interest in. I'm not looking for flings or short term relationships, so as soon as I realize that there isn't long term potential, I move on. This has lead to me not having a serious crush for the last three years, and to a loss of interest in males my own age. They all seem to be boys, and not men, to put it succinctly, and that is a real turn off for me.

In January, I met a man who seems to be one of the best men I think I have ever met. He is kind, considerate, consistently hardworking, very intelligent, and downright hilarious. He's honestly raised the bar even higher than I had it, and it already seemed unobtainably high. I could go on, but I don't want to be yucky. Ever since I met him, I have been thinking of him more and more, and I think I've fallen in love with him. 

I am afraid that I am developing some thickly rose tinted glasses, as that was a main problem last time. 
 
So here are the main issues as I see them:

1.  He is about 18 years older than me. Even though I am looking for someone older, that seems societally like too much of a gap. I'd like to get the perspective of someone in a similar relationship.

2. I don't think we share the same religious beliefs. Obviously that is something we could discuss, and I don't feel that we have to agree on every little thing, but it is a potential problem. 

3. Dating or even showing interest in me right now could jeopardize his career. If my personal plans work out, that should be solved at the end of this year. The problem is, I am not sure how to balance showing interest with maintaining appropriate discretion. 

I think that he is interested in me, but I am historically very bad at judging that, and it is extra hard to tell for the reason above. I guess I am partly just looking for support and want to talk it over with someone since I probably won't see him for a while due to quarantine, and can't be open about this with him until the end of the year. Patience doesn't come easily to me. Thanks for your help.",08May2020,1

650,"My father is insane and has always been the biggest villain in my life. Posting this on a throwaway account for my own mental comfort.

He beat my brother and I when we were kids. Always yelled at us over big and little things. Never helped me with school, but beat me in sixth grade in front of my mother and brother when I got my first F. No matter what you said to him, he would get mad (big or little answer, positive or negative answer, it didn't matter). He would always guilt trip me into doing things for him or with him. He constantly manipulates conversations to get what he wants. He'll move the goal posts further and further to milk you for all you're worth. He's always been drinking and he's seriously bipolar. He'll be friendly in public but a complete dick in private.

Worst of all, he raped my mom about a year and a half ago. That event completely broke mom and she's been lost ever since. Soon after it happened, mom called the police on dad because she didn't feel safe near him in their house. He changed all the locks on the house so she and the police couldn't get in. The police started an investigation but of course couldn't find any evidence about her claims. Later on, she wanted to get a divorce and move out into her own place, but she can't really afford to do so. She's stuck with him and she's been trying to get him to see reason, but he simply won't. He apologized once and then took it back the next day. He told her that she could ""keep her kids"".

I blocked his phone number because I was and still am completely disgusted by him, but he just got a new private number that I couldn't block. I finally called him after a year at my mother's request and I told him how I felt about him and everything. It seemed like maybe he was beginning to understand, but then I got a text from him last night where he was back to his old ways. Trying to guilt trip me into talking to him even though we've got a family therapy session set up next week anyway. Somehow he fails to recognize that he has torn our family apart and refuses to take responsibility for his actions.

I don't know what he or my mother want me to do. Their situation comes down to dad owning up, and I can't make him do that. Every time either one of them calls or texts me, my hearts sinks and I'm emotionally/mentally messed up for a week. It seriously prevents me from living my life and finding joy. I have nightmares pretty regularly where my dad is angry at me and I can't reason with him. I often wish that my dad would exit my life and never return. The worst part is I feel guilty for trying to look out for myself and trying to remove pain and sorrow from my life, which I think comes down to how he raised me. What do I do?

Thanks in advance to anyone who took the time to read this, it means a lot. I haven't really reached out for any honest help for the past two years. I'm open to answer any questions anyone might have and provide more information.

651,"I post here because I have nowhere else to put this shit out of my chest and o boi it's a lot of crap  
But I think I should start from the beginning right 
So I'm a 19yo  guy who joined a ""religious group"" with all my family when I was around 13 after the te consecutive deaths of my  grandmother my dad and a pretty close cousin  that  She was killed In a robbery so as you might imagine I was pretty damn Susceptible as my whole family so we started looking  for a group and all and we found a group that was doing the things right they were a little bit strict but nothing to extreme that's what we thought. Fast forward a few years my brother got married with the daughter of the leader  so we got closer to the ""core"" of the group as you might imagine things started to get more strict more cult like (they where from the beginning but as every other cult you don't notice until you're too late ). 

They started to use the bite model more heavily on us  but it was okay no ? They only want the best for us right it's because they love us ? 


Ff corona virus and all of this I'm studying software engineering I'm in so fucking love with it for real I can feel this is what I was born to do with my life so as it's logical I started to pay less attention to the groups teachings but now this corona virus thing started and all this since I live in Mexico where the  whole quarantine thing isn't as strict the services of the group moved to a whole online service and guess what I'm the fucking moron in charge of the broadcasting for the group  but it's okay I can help with that I don't mind and I even like it   but now this is where the whole cult shit starts and I mean full on cult tactics.


 The pastor started the typical preach of the ending it's near and all of that that's fine pretty normal in this world scenario  but he is really like really into the world ending so he started to pressure me by saying  literally ""I'm not telling you that you shouldn't study BUT if it won't be Profitable for the faith you should leave it because the times are getting closer  ""


 but now that's one of those advises that after the right amount of time they become orders. And you know what happens if you disobey the lider of the group now that's my family it's full on into the cult and I have nowhere to go  if I decide to leave the cult  to keep on my studies  nothing seems to be worth I feel like I'm sinking I have nowhere to go 

 I live my family and I feel like a traitor  and a egomaniac to go follow my dreams without   considering the but all they're saying it's that I should obey the fucking leader of the group  i feel like there's no scape I don't what to be  Miserable for the rest of my life. Because a desision that it's not mine I really want to go out of it but im to coward to do something about it

I'm 22 turning 23 in a few months with no job experience or further education. I've got no idea what to do with my life or where I want to be.

Throughout the last few years I've been putting off further education due to my anxiety. The thought of studying makes me scared, the negatives and what ifs stick with me and keep me up at night. I also have a mild skin condition called Psoriasis which definitely doesn't help my self esteem and most days, keeps me confined to my bed/room.
I've also applied to many jobs however my resume is definitely lacking in experience and skills. Of course this whole COVID-19 stuff doesn't help with this either.

I want to better myself and I want to finally start living a life where I can look in the mirror and say that I'm proud of myself.

Sorry if this is a loaded question but, where do I start?

657,"So I just got an amazing email today- I've been accepted into a master's program in Europe (I'm in the US) with a full-tuition scholarship and a stipend that will cover most of my living expenses (and I have more than enough savings to cover the rest comfortably without working)! It's in a field that I am really interested in and would be a great jumping-off point for getting a job in Europe (my dream ever since I did study abroad a couple years ago) if I'm interested in staying after 2 years at my program. Basically I just got a free ticket to my dream life after 4 years of undergrad and a year of soul-sucking office work here at home.

But I'm not sure if I can take it.

My little brother (19) is mildly autistic and suffers from pretty severe anxiety and depression. He's a really awesome guy and you would never even guess he's ASD if you met him on a good day. But bad days are *bad*. He shuts down, can't talk to people, hurts himself, breaks things, and howls like a scared wild animal. He's a big guy so it's scary for everyone in the house when he does this. I'm the only one that can calm him down. He's my best friend and I'm his. He loves and trusts our parents but not when he's having an episode. He trusts me always. He sees a therapist and my parents work so hard to get him the help he needs, but it's really slow going. It seemed like things were looking up and he was about to join a program to help him find a job (which I think would really help with the depression and anxiety) when COVID hit and now things are pretty much back to how they've been. I don't live at home but I live by myself and nearby so I still visit ~3 days a week or so. He's totally fine most days (if still depressed) but his bad days have stepped up in frequency from how they were before COVID. Anyway idk how much detail I actually need to go into here but the point is he struggles a lot and I am his only real friend that's not one of our parents.

My parents really struggle with this, my mom has used the words ""this is no way to live"" and says dealing with him makes them feel like they have PTSD. Of course they love him so much and never treat him badly or neglect him but it's so hard on them. It's hard on me too but I'm not there 24/7. They're retirement age and luckily are pretty secure financially, but they should be buying their dream cottage in Spain right now. They can't because my brother isn't financially independent. They really really encourage me to follow my dreams and insist that my brother isn't my responsibility but I can't help but feel like I'm letting all three of them down if I take this and move across the world for two-plus years. I'm worried my brother might kill himself. I feel really torn here and I don't know what to do. I think the right thing to do is to just take it and follow my dreams (I really fucking hate my life here in the states right now, not in a depressed way but just I don't like any bit of it besides my friends and family) but I don't know how to deal with the guilt if I do.",08May2020,1

We just got married and moved in together around the same time and he said he’s quit cigarettes but moving to a new state has stressed him out so he’s doing that + weed every day. 

Recently he’s been saying he wants to try cocaine just to experiment because his parents have done it and it ruined their lives including his siblings so he wants to know why they did it. His reasoning is also when we have children, he’ll be able to know what to say if they ask about sex, weed, and other drugs/experiences. I don’t want him to do it because my mother was also an addict but he says I have to live my life and he has to live his life too since he’s young.

In my case, my parents and siblings are even pressuring me to pay them a visit over the weekend, as they say ""they are healthy, so there is no reason for concern"". Also, they would be able to drive me there so I would avoid travelling by train/other public transportation. My siblings in our conversations online/over the phone stress the fact that my parents miss me very much. 

My point is: I said that I don't feel comfortable paying visits now since there is an epidemic, regardless if they give me a lift or not. This of course, caused them to say I'm unreasonable, and that ""how long will I be self isolating/what if the epidemic never ends/I hide behind this to conceal my not wanting to visit parents"". I don't have answers to those questions obviously - I think no one really does. The motive part also hurts my feelings and frankly, makes me feel like they see me as an ungrateful, cruel child.

At the end of the FaceTime, Abby did not apologize ONCE (and she sure as hell should've) and both Katie and Abby were pointing out all of my flaws. I agree, they are things that I need to work on and I apologized to them both. HOWEVER, they were being complete hypocrites about it, acting like they don't do the exact same thing.

Now I feel shut out by both of them. Me and Abby have been talking about things like homework, and even though I shouldn't forgive her, I'm going to set my dignity aside. I still feel ignored by Katie, who used to be my rock and my #1 confidant. 

What do I do???? I feel sad every day and I cannot concentrate. I feel like everything is falling apart.",08May2020,1

If it provides any information, she has psoriasis, but not on her face. She also tends to get red cheeks and her chin has gotten very dry and seems to be peeling.

671,"My husband started working for a company that is contracted by Fedex for drivers. He was hired as a driver. They pay all the drivers a flat rate every day - so they are not paid by the hour. He is supposed to work five days a week. He usually gets in around 8 am, but sometimes does not get home until 6 pm, 7, or 8. When he gets in in the morning they assign him more packages to deliver than one person can possibly deliver - though sometimes around 6 pm someone comes and helps him out. He has only worked three days this week so far and has already worked 30 hours and still has two more days to work. They do not pay overtime, but when my husband has made it clear that he does not want to be working this hard or this much they have twice given him a $100 ""bonus"" on his check. My husband does not want to work overtime, and isn't being paid for over time if you don't count these bonuses. We are not that hard up for money and he has said he is not interested in ""selling his soul"" for this company. He thinks it is good honest work but feels they are taking advantage of him, especially when it seems that other people who have been with the company longer aren't getting stuck with these big loads. Is what they are doing illegal? He is certainly working more than 40 hours a week, but since they pay a flat rate every day he doesn't have to clock in. He wants to advocate for himself and is sick of feeling like he is being taken advantage of. TIA!",08May2020,1

674,"I tried to post for help the other day, but I just couldn't manage. I'm feeling a bit better now, so I hope to articulate this as well as I can.

My father passed away on Tuesday and he and my stepmother live in New York City, while I live in Ohio. There are major concerns with just flying into the city at this time and with NY being an epicenter for Covid-19, a traditional service is just not possible.

I am tasked with determining what we can do virtually. My father knew many, many people from years of being an educator and being part of his Grand Lodge, so we'll need to do something that allows anywhere from 500 - 1000 people to ""come together"" virtually to hold a small service for him. 

My first instinct is a Zoom meeting since I use Zoom often for work, but I'm unsure whether it's worthwhile to pay for the Pro or Business service for up to 1000 people for just one time, or if there are other options available, like Facebook or something else.

I'm looking for help from anyone who has gone through this themselves, or even knows someone who knows someone, or even those who might have any suggestions on what we could do. I imagine we'll have a slideshow of pictures as well as allowing joiners to speak and say what they wanted. I'll need to be able to control for things like people not remaining on mute, so I'll need an admin or host level control. We'll also need to take as long as we need so it could be anywhere from an hour to four depending on who wishes to speak.

I'm far from the rest of my family, which is hard enough at a time like this, and while I'm usually willing to carry on alone with my beest understanding, I'm just reaching out for any help at all.

It's the game I wanted to create and got lucky with some investor.

Also they demand mostly casual, idle, hyper casual etc. and are not very interested in well polished quality games. Realistically I am not sure if my game will earn the amount of money that'll let me create another similar title.

Well, it was a surprise to both of us but we started transitioning to parent mode slowly. The second one was actually planned and she had begged for, so we had our second. The third was also unplanned and we had actually considered an abortion because we weren't in a very good financial situation and were struggling with the other two already. Needless to say, we couldn't afford to pay for that so it got scrapped and we became set on being the parents of 3. My 3 year old is not what I'd call a normal child and is overly rambunctious, and makes life very hard on us, whereas the other 2 aren't so bad my themselves.

690,"For context, I'm 19(M) and i suffer from terrible anxiety, i'm trying to start work as an artist doing online commissions but for the time being i'm stuck living at home with my mother and my older brother. We live in a pretty small house so its hard to have any real sense of privacy and my brother frequently comes into my room to chat which is fine, if i really want to be alone i can lock my door and do so but he doesn't respect my possessions at all. in the past he has frequently used my computer whilst i was asleep or otherwise away from my room despite me telling him i'm not comfortable with that.

The problem is that recently I've been coming to terms with some confusing things about how I see myself and without going into too much detail, I want to try on some more feminine clothing to feel more comfortable. I believe what I do in the privacy of my room is none of my family's business and I have the right to have somewhere private to keep these things without feeling like I'm hiding something I shouldn't have, however today I had a conversation with my brother where i mentioned I might purchase a dresser for my room that features locks of some kind he opposed the idea saying that locks are just a glorified keep out sign and that if he was looking for something and he thought I had left it in the locked drawer he would just pick the lock if I wasn't available. (he picks locks as a hobby for the record) 

Needless to say, I can't exactly tell him why I don't want him rummaging through my stuff since he thinks I'm just going to keep legal documents in there and his point of view if if you've got nothing to hide there's nothing to fear, and the thought of him finding out terrifies me, even if the odds are low of him actually doing it, it would just be an unwanted source of anxiety and I'm anxious enough already.

So I guess I'm looking for advice on either a different place to keep the clothes that is private and secure but doesn't feel like I'm smuggling drugs or hiding dirty money, or what i can say or do to get the point across to my brother that he should never invade my privacy like that, without letting him know that I'm keeping something secret.",08May2020,4

People say if you're stuck in life to go out and improve yourself. Well, I did just that. I got two degrees, my own car, savings, a career; I ate healthier, got stronger, came off medication; I learned new skills, met more people. The whole nine yards.

Yet, I'm still in the same place as I was before. I have a handful of friends, most of whom don't truly care for me and our friendships were always one-sided. Not one of them has bothered to reach out to me during quarantine, hence why I've cut them off, and these are people who I have supported at their very worse. I can't seem to meet anyone I click with, despite generally getting along with people when I do go out. I have absolutely no dating prospects; no woman is ever interested, and I can't get matches on dating apps. I'm on the verge of losing my career due to false allegations, and as a result of all of this I'm still very much alone.

I've seen ***fourteen*** therapists in the last five years. Not a joke. I haven't ""jumped ship"" either; most let me go because they felt I was doing the right things. They all said that I come across as a confident, social individual with a lot going for him.

694," 

Ok so this is a very embarrassing post and I am seeking objective views and advice and how bad/serious this problem is and if I am exaggerating or being over dramatic in feeling as awful, freaked out and paranoid as I am.

Am a early 30's gay male....long story short, I have gotten addicted to something called ""faggot exposure"". Two years ago a guy on grindr asked me to send him a full faced nude pic on all fours, tongue out etc....I didnt but over course of couple months he kept asking. One night I eventually did and oh my god it was such a sexual rush. The humiliation of it etc, and he would call me fag etc and anyways, over time I sent more and then he would threaten to blackmail etc and post them online, twitter and such. Which he did, and then he would delete. It was so incredibly intense and horny and terrifying....which became addictive. The head fuck of it all.

Two year later, I have gotten so deep into this, I join kik and there are loads of groups on kik specifically for ""Fag Exposure"" where you send humiliating full faced pics and they are posted to group and some guys threaten to put the online. Which has happened.

I have prob sent hundreds if not thousands of pics and vids of me doing the most humiliating shit, I wont describe but yea, am sure you can imagine. They were posted online, taken down, posted to groups, sent to random guys, I even sent some to guys on grindr in my local area. It spiralled out of control.

I have tried to stop many times, but its genuinely like some sort of an addiction. And recently in my life, something happened that messed me up and have come out of a very toxic relationship....and am looking at my life and going...wtf???

I'm terrified that at some stage in some way, this whole fag exposure thing has ruined my life. And it weighs so heavily on my mind and I think over time has actually affected me in ways I havent even realised. Its been a toxic addiction/comfort.

Two years ago, sending that first pic was something I NEVER EVER EVER imagined I would do....now I have screen shots of my pics and vids guys have sent me on various groups/sites etc. I have asked all to take them down, but there has been 1000's sent to random guys and plenty of time for people to download etc from when they were on various sites.

Is this something that can ruin me? Or in this day and age....is it really that bad? So people really care? Can I just put it down a taboo kink thing and get on with my life?",08May2020,1
695,"I am in Texas, I have been a cosmetologist for about 10 years now. Before the pandemic started I was doing eyelashes for a company that was so-so they were constantly out of supplies (like facemasks) and sometimes even glue, which is literally how I do my job. So my job is reopening next week and they're telling me that there will be all these new precautions. They're giving clients mask, taking everyone's temps, and not letting clients wait in the building unless they are being serviced. 

This should make me feel better about going right? Well no, I feel like if they are having to do all of these precautions maybe it's not a safe job to do since we are literally inches from people's faces. I have **literally** had people cough in my face before. I don't have a lot of faith in my company to look out for MY safety. They laid off the entire staff, which sucked but at least we were able to collect unemployment.  But I told them that I wanted to wait until June to maybe feel safer, they told me if not enough people are coming back then they will just start to hire new people (I have been here 3 years)

Everything in me is telling me not to go back, but I'm afraid that I won't be able to find work in a recession/depression.

I genuinely want to join the Army. I am comfortable economically, even with the pandemic in full swing. I have a Bachelor’s in History and was going to start applying for teaching jobs. I still intend to teach but I’m young and want to serve while I’m able; I’ve had an arm-chair level of interest in the contemporary US military until recently. I can always come back to teach but my body won’t be in its prime forever.

The expectation is that I have is that I can sign up, try to make it through each circle of Hell, attempt to graduate from Officer Candidate School (OCS), and climb my way up to Military Police Officer (MOS: 31A). It is the work I find myself most interested in.

I understand it is challenging, but how *feasible* is it? How long does it take to get there (assuming it’s a perfect world and that I’m performing phenomenally) and how long do people normally take to go from OCS to being a 31A? What’s the most likely way the Army might screw me?

I’m looking to find people that will shatter my expectations and set me straight. Personal experience, outside perspective, and studies are all info I’m eager to listen to. Feel free to ask plenty of questions.

TL;DR - I want to join the Army and my family has some reservations.

But because her opinion is already that space isn't interesting, I can't figure out how to correct her.

709,"Hello all! I'm about to be a high school senior, and I'm in a very bad situation.  I love music, especially the clarinet, and I plan on majoring in music education.  

**The Story:** (Feel free to skip if you want it's just explaining my situation) 

I go to a private school, and most of the time our band program sucked haha.  But, when I was in eighth grade, we got a new, actually qualified (which is a rarity at our school) band director.  He was a fantastic teacher and a great person, he brought our band up from rock bottom and helped me become a pretty good clarinetist.  However, last year, the summer before my junior year, he left.  He wasn't getting payed near enough.  

I stayed at the school I was at, which turned out to be a terrible choice.  I was put in charge of the band program, which was extremely stressful, although enjoyable at times.  Although it was a rough time, it was what made me realize that I really want to do music.  

My school eventually hired someone, but she has no qualifications.  She's an elementary education major, maybe plays piano and trumpet (we aren’t really sure lol), can't keep time or conduct AT ALL, and is generally not a pleasant person.  She's very rude, and likes to pretend she knows what she's talking about, but it's clear she has no idea.  

I have the option to go to another school in the area that has a great music program, and their band director has helped me out in many ways this year.  My parents, however, do not want me to leave.  I've been at the other school since 1st grade.  If I go to this school, I will have no help from the faculty in pursuing a music ed degree.  The ""band director"" knows nothing and cannot help.  She's not even qualified to register students for Allstate.  The good side of this is that I have a lot of outside help.  My old band director now teaches private lessons, and I have an AMAZING clarinet teacher.  I also have a wonderful piano teacher who wants to see me succeed.  I have many great musicians in my life who I am very thankful for.  The issue with is: I'm having to learn everything outside of school hours.  The largest chunk of my day (8:00-3:20) is spent not working towards my career (My school also doesn’t allow students to choose classes so i'm stuck in difficult math classes and the homework takes me at least 3-5 hours where as other can do it in 30 minutes). I have lessons for about two hours after school most days, and then I have to go home and do several hours of homework (my school loves busywork lol).  On top of that, I need to have time to practice clarinet and piano (I'm involved in a church orchestra and a local orchestra so I normally have a lot of music to learn).  This gets me in bed at around 2:30 am every night.  That is, if I actually do my homework.  And then, I get up early in the morning before school to practice for about 30 mins- 1 hour.  This is too stressful for me. I can't keep functioning like this.  My grades are lower than they've ever been, and it bothers me that sometimes I don't have the time to really focus on music for a concert or lesson.

tldr: my band program sucks and i am v stressed

**THE QUESTION:** 

Does anyone know of any good music programs for high school seniors? Let me explain what I mean:

I tried to apply to an arts high school in my state, but you couldn’t be going into your senior year.  You had to be at most an upcoming junior.  Are there any arts schools or music programs that allow for seniors to join? I live in the southern US so preferably something that isn’t too far away (South, Midwest, East Coast), but I will be appreciative of any suggestions at all, regardless of where they're located. 

Please let me know if you can think of anything at all!!!!!!! 

And if you read all of this, thank you so much.",08May2020,1
710,"So I (14 F) baisically got into a fight with my mother (50). She ruined one of my bras so I was kind of angry. After a remark I made (You can't win an argument agains a dumb person, I don't use swear words but she did tell me she's going to kill me/ wishes I was dead) she got physical and I fought back (but not that much because she's my mom). She slapped me, kicked me and punched me. Afterwards I grabbed something so actually defend myself and finally made her go away by going barefoot outside. 

Now when I finally got into my room I started feeling really weak in my legs, I was hyperventilating and crying uncontrolably. She came in about 30 minutes later threatening to call the ambulance on me if I don't calm down in 5 minutes. Now I feel really tired for the whole day and whenever I close my eyes I see her and get scared so I can't sleep. What happened to me? And this is more of a rant.

I’ve came home on multiple days crying due to stress from school, expressing that I struggle with making friends, getting out of bed, keeping happy thoughts, etc. I think she’s keeping the nurse mentality that ‘you’ll be fine.’ and it’s really hurting me. It seems like she doesn’t care or that things magically got better after we talked about what was wrong that day. Some days I feel so alone and I’m finding it hard to come back to her for help because she hasn’t really helped me even after she admitted at the doctor she’s concerned that I have depression. What I really want is to give medication a try, because I’m at the point where I’m desperate to see the light and I’m afraid that therapy wont work because it’s hard for me to access and the way I’m feeling could be purely my brain being crazy.

715,"So I was pretty much best friends with this girl for four years, then I went away travelling for a few years, returning home this year. We've maintained contact while I've been away, I thought to a pretty good degree, more than most other friends I left behind at least. Obviously she's remained in the same place and will have closer friends, but given that we were pretty inseparable before I left I thought she'd be delighted to see me when I returned. And she acted like she was thrilled when I told her. But then she went cold on me, took over a week to reply to my messages, and it was like drawing blood from a stone trying to speak with her to organise meeting up when I got home. Which we did, but it seemed like she could barely fit me in. We had a group of friends, all of which haven't maintained much contact with me and didn't want to meet up when I got back, which I took pretty hard. The last time I spoke to this one friend in particular (who is still friends with the group) I was noticibly upset and confided in her about feeling rejected by the others. She said they'd all just drifted, which I know isn't true from each other, just me and my partner that I went travelling with and was friends with them all too. She didn't want to say anything on behalf of them which is fair enough. She then told me that the two of us weren't close anymore, which I took very much to heart, and told her she was still a close friend of mine, from my perspective. The call ended well despite being a bit emotional, and she still said much love and all that and I mentioned her coming up to see me, which she seemed to be up for. But now it's been three or four months and I've heard nothing from her. Not a peep. Which has really upset me, as I know we can't see each other atm thanks to covid, but she knows I'm back here alone and separated from everyone. Also particulary since many people are struggling with their mental health atm, and since I'd confided in her last time we spoke about feeling abandoned by friends I thought she would have at least chucked me a casual 'how are you' message to check I'm OK. But nothing.

So do I wait or should I say something? And if I do, do I let her know how much she's let me down as a friend, because that is how I feel.

721,"  

I’m a 21F and I have no idea what my sexual orientation is.

Unlike others in high school, I didn’t think about being in a relationship, exploring, trying out sexual stuff.

I had crushes on both genders, but I never wanted more than thinking about spending time with them and how it would be nice to date them.

But I never had a desire to kiss, to be physically touched in any way. I never felt sexually attracted to anyone. It’s like my sexual drive was not existent. Of course, I did masturbate, but more out of habit.  I never had sex or kissed anyone...

Some people say ‘Oh, she/he’s so hot I would sleep with him’… that kind of thing never happened to me.

For me, I have to develop some sort of feelings/attachment. It’s easier to develop it for women, than men. But maybe it’s because I was abused by males in the past.

I used to fall in love, but now I can’t even do that.

It’s been more than 6 years since I fell in love with somebody… or even loved someone. It’s incredibly hard to fall in love... I don’t understand what’s wrong with me. I want to fall in love, but I can’t

Everyone around me is in a relationship…

722,"Currently feeling overwhelming pressure due to covid. Currently working two jobs both remotely. One is 40/week, the other is 32/week. I’m quitting the 40 hour one due to not having enough training from training remotely and not getting help from management on my files when I desperately need it. Consequently I haven’t been able to do shit for my work. Normally I wouldn’t feel pressure from quitting this but I feel like i am going to put stress on my family by quitting this job. I am worried I will upset my partner by my decision and put us both in an unstable position in the future but I cannot stay at this job any longer. Its either quit or get fired down the line anyway.

I have money saved from working both jobs for the last month so we’ll be alright for a couple of months moving forward but with the future being so unpredictable right now with covid I feel like I might be screwing me and my family over by hoping to be completely back on my feet two months from now. I am essentially gambling that every thing will return to relative normalcy soon when all evidence points the opposite direction. But I cant keep up with both and I cant stay at the 40 hour job much longer. I don’t really have much of a choice in the matter anymore.

My current game plan is to sign up for partial eu (i was working 40 hours at the other job until covid), file my taxes for the return, apply for other work, work a gig job like Postmates on the weekends and defer my car payment for a bit but can anybody give me other, better advice or a more solid gameplan moving forward?",08May2020,1
723,"My roommate got laid off his job a few months ago (even before the pandemic) and he stayed home 24/7 (only ever went out for groceries). Now that there's a pandemic, we're both constantly home because of quarantine.

He's a nice guy but socially awkward - never really bothered me because I'm usually in my bubble at home with my earphones on... Recently, he's been popping my bubble though. 

So we have our own rooms but share the bathroom and the kitchen - the kitchen is right in front of my room, so I hear everything from there. He seems to LOVE to cook for 5 hours straight (his record is 8 hours STRAIGHT). I don't mind if he cooks, he's gotta eat, but the smells and the noise goes on for unnecessary long times. When I cook a feast for myself and 5 other people it takes me tops 3h-3h30. When I cook whatever he makes for 5-8 hours, it could take me 30min - seriously, how long does it take to make pasta with a few vegetables??? Ding ding ding 5 HOURS.

On top of that he stays in the kitchen in the morning for 3-5 hours sitting and watching videos on his phone laughing (he has the most irritating laugh too, like a high pitched giggle). He's in the kitchen ALL DAY now. Whenever, I leave my room he's there. He never stays in his room anymore. What's worse is that he randomly talks to himself, hums with his high pitch and sings to himself. I CAN'T I'M GOING FKN CRAZY and I'm just trying to figure out a way to approach him without being the asshole in this, because I'm afraid of what I'm going to say.

725,"My fiancé [F22] and her sister [18] haven’t really ever gotten along very well. They both still live with their parents. My fiancé would come crying or venting to me about how she says the most awful things, like “you’re so fucking selfish,” “everyone in this house hates you,” “you’re such a bitch,” etc. These comments make fiancé upset, as she is very emotional and sensitive. Once fiancé starts getting upset, sister says things like “see, you’re so emotional because you don’t care about anyone other than yourself” and things of the like. Never has sister once apologized to fiancé for these comments, despite (as far as I’ve heard) best efforts from fiancé to talk about their differences and not fight verbally.

Since I’ve never witnessed these events, I give my fiancé the benefit of the doubt. However, given her parents’ diligent neutrality on the subject, I figure that maybe her sister isn’t acting as crazily as it sounds. Although in the past I’ve made excuses for sister, I’ve always given fiancé the advice to try and stay calm and don’t give into her sisters emotional attacks, as that’s when things seem to get ugliest. That is, until about a week ago.

I was on the phone with fiancé at around 1:00 am. Since sister and fiancé room next door to each other, sister texts fiancé and asks her to talk quieter as she’s trying to sleep. Fiancé begins borderline whispering into the phone. Five minutes later another text from sister claiming “I can still hear you, I don’t want to listen to you and Cellowned talk on the phone all night, you’ve kept me up every night talking for over a week.”

The first thing my fiancé does is leave her room and go to the other side of the house so as not to disturb sister any longer. Fiancé then tells me sister’s claims are not true. Not only does fiancé have phone records to prove she’s only been up late four nights out of the past eight, she also tells me that two of those nights, she got up to pee and noticed either sister’s light was on or heard sister talking to *her* boyfriend.

Fiancé texts back saying something like “I didn’t know I was keeping you up, but I’ve noticed you’ve been up as well multiple nights this past week. If you had let me know you were trying to sleep over a week ago I would’ve gladly went somewhere else in the house. I haven’t even been up that late all those nights.”

Sister immediately responds with the typical bout of insults, claiming fiancé is “blaming” sister for not being able to sleep, and also that she was only awake because fiancé was awake. She continues to call fiancé names and completely disregards anything fiancé said.

Fiancé sends one more message saying “how was I supposed to know I’m the reason you were up? It’s not fair of you to blame me for keeping you up for over a week when that’s not even true and you could’ve asked me over a week ago and I would’ve stopped. Do you think I relish in keeping you up for no reason? That doesn’t make any sense”

Sister then runs across the house to the room fiancé was in, calls her a cunt, says she doesn’t want to be her maid of honor, says everyone in the family hates her, and a spew of other awful things. At this point, their mom comes into the room. Fiancé says nothing and tries to leave, but sister blocks the door and begins slapping, scratching, punching and kicking fiancé. Mom does absolutely nothing. Fiancé hysterically runs from the room and slams the door behind her, but not before sister runs after her and gets hit in the wrist and face by the door. Fiancé looks back to see if sister is ok, and sister screams at her to get away from her (ironically). 

Fiancé calls me crying and is scared. I tell her she did the right thing. Mom comes up and tells fiancé she “shouldn’t have provoked your sister.” 

Since all of this, sister has suffered no punishment from parents, has not acknowledged she was in the wrong, and has not apologized. Parents have both acknowledged sister acted out, but haven’t otherwise done anything. They even tried to tell fiancé she should still make sister her maid of honor because “family is family.” 

I believe fiancé has been minimized by her family her entire life, and it’s getting increasingly difficult for me not to say something to parents, although I know I shouldn’t. They are all acting like nothing happened while sister continuously uses her hurt wrist to garner pity. It makes me sick to watch. What can I do, if anything? I come from an abusive household myself and I recognize signs of some underlying issue, but parents seem to think this will all “blow over.” I feel that if sister wants to act like that there should be repercussions. I’ve been encouraging fiancé to sit her parents down and demand something be done, but I’m not sure what. A psyche eval? A punishment of SOME kind?",08May2020,1
726,"One of my good friends of a few years completely stopped talking to me mid conversation. She just never opened the message, but talked to other people. Its quarantine so i cant see her or anyone else, but i could see she was posting with her friends and her friends were posting with her. At first i thought her phone was taken off her or something but i could tell a month later that didn't happen. I guess she just got tired or bored of me.

I have severe anxiety so things like this make me feel horrible and i blame everything on myself. I know for a fact i didn't do anything to make her leave like that but i still feel bad. I haven't been coping with it well. I used to really care about her, she helped me through a lot of different mental issues that I've gone through and I've helped her through hers. This wasn't something she normally did to anyone. Especially me, i thought. But now I'm the only person shes done this to.

I noticed that she was very toxic to me. I couldn't tell at the time, i thought she was just a close friend. But she was manipulating me to feel what she wanted me to feel and i never realised. Ive always hated myself. Ive been through a lot of things, but i started to think a lot more badly about myself then i ever did about 1-2 months of knowing her. She would make me feel embarrassed in front of her friends and herself, and now her friends hate me. So do some of mine now. 

I noticed she was still looking at my social media and it made me really stressed so i blocked her on everything. I don't want her in my life anymore and i guess thats both mine and her choices. I cared about her so much because she really helped me when i was at a really really dark place and i wasn't happy at all. After that, its like i had this ""she saved my life, i owe her a lot"" type of mindset towards her. Even though months after knowing her i went straight back into that dark place. I didn't think she was the reason for it because she was ""so nice to me at first"". 

I still care about her. I mean fuck her, i don't like her in the slightest but a very very big part of me still believes I'm the reason she left. Like i annoyed her, or did something wrong. Or I'm the reason she clearly got so bored of me. I know its clear she just had no use for me anymore. A few of my friends have always told me how much they don't like her and how she treats me. I didn't want to listen. But now i cant stop thinking about what i could've done or said to make her leave. I don't need her. Its just my brain.

I am very hygenic/clean about everything, and used to have a healthy sex life. I've been tested for every STI and STD on multiple occasions, and have the same sexual partner. I've been clean every time. I'm getting to the point where sex is becoming an issue, I'm becoming afraid to have sex. I've been so afraid to admit this, and I can't talk to anyone about it. But I often suffer from micro tears after sex, which causes spotting and discomfort. My mother and aunt also suffer from these issues but I feel mine have been more frequent, and all three of us suffer from ovarian cysts. My aunt suffers from endometriosis. My issue is, I'm becoming afraid to have sex. I've never felt this way before and feel ashamed and depressed. Sex can be a little bit uncomfortable after I don't do it for a while, because I haven't been having it. But then the problem is I'll get an infection and can't have sex until it's cleared. But then once its cleared I'll have sex and will get microtears. So I'm afraid to have sex, this is becoming psychological. I don't know what to do, doctors don't know what's wrong.

I met my best friend in freshman year of high school and in my senior year we fizzled out on purpose. She started dating an ex of mine and every time we had a (occasional, rare) argument it came back to her saying “oh you’re just mad that I’m dating so-and-so now.” So I purposely denied hanging out with her more and more and we gradually lost contact.

730,"This will probably see minuscule to some of the other awful gaslighting cases people experience but I’ve been feeling so anxious lately and this event with my boyfriend has just amplified it. 

Even though our country is in lock down he’s occasionally met up with friends whilst out and I’ve caught him in lies a couple of times. (He’s a horrible liar). I’ve even said that if he’s going to go out and break quarantine rules at least be honest with me about it and he agreed. 


Yesterday he went out on a bike ride. I called him mid way through and as he picked up he was clearly talking to one of his friends. I just ignored it and we spoke normally. Anyway today he said he would be going on a bike ride again and I made a joke like “to meet up with your friends again?” and he replied “What? I didn’t meet up with my friends yesterday. Like you said it’s against quarantine rules”. I said “I don’t care what you do, you’re an adult, you can look after yourself. But I definitely heard you talking to your friends yesterday.” He categorically denied it, even went as far to tell me that I didn’t hear him talking to anyone. 


Idk. It just really disturbed me that he was trying to convince me against something that I was 100% sure about. Even going as far to try to get me to distrust my own hearing. When I told him that was gaslighting he said that I’m irritating him and hung up. A few minutes later he called me, breaking down, saying that he’s sorry and that he just didn’t want to “disappoint me”.  


This event just made me see things about him in a new light. TMI but a few months ago he ejaculated inside of me even though he knows that’s 100% out of bounds. We even had just recovered from a pregnancy scare. He claimed that he heard me tell him do it during sex. I knew that was 100% untrue but he managed to put a bit of doubt in my mind that maybe i did . Then a few nights ago he was really upset about something and he just kept saying “I’m not the man you think I am”. We talked and he was just feeling insecure because of how much I think so highly of him.

But anyway today’s event has made has just made overthink everything. I haven’t spoken to him all day because I just feel so disturbed that he would try to manipulate me in that way. This probably sounds stupid but I’m just feeling so anxious about it all.",08May2020,1

I’m also a very frightful person, and it makes it nearly impossible for me to draw a connection with guys unless they’re extremely patient and very cautious/unthreatening in the beginning. I date women as well, and I find that even though I’m still awkward, it is to a MUCH lesser extent. Why am I so scared of men? How do I change this? I want to be able to trust people, but I don’t want to go too far in the other direction and miss red flags. 

A few examples:

1) A while ago I was at a bar with a female friend and a guy approached us and asked if he could buy me a drink. I said “Why? No. No thank you. I don’t want that. Thank you.”  He asked if I had a boyfriend and I asked him to please not talk to me. My friend got really mad at me and said I embarrassed her. I was just voicing that I did not feel comfortable. I was taught to speak out if I feel uncomfortable, so I did that. 

2) A few months ago I met a guy who I really liked. We talked a lot and I felt we had chemistry. That said, he did not like the way I expressed my needs/limits. I do enjoy dating, but I don’t like being touched randomly or suddenly, even if I know the person. It startles me and makes me uncomfortable. I also feel like I cannot pay attention to what a person is saying if I try too hard to look them in the eyes, so I tend to avert my gaze when talking to people. He understood that as me not being interested in him, and needless to say, he lost interest in me. 

How do I work on this? How do guys like being talked to when they meet new women? I have some pretty specific interests (like Russian Literature, WWI, comic books, drawing, etc). Do guys find that weird? If I’m asked what I’m interested in, should I lie and say general things like “the outdoors” or something like that?

Note: I’m in the autism spectrum. I do not tend to disclose this to people I meet, especially if I’m meeting them with the intention to date them, as I find that people tend to infantilize me when they find out I’m on the spectrum, and guys especially tend to lose interest almost immediately (even though I felt that sometimes women infantilized me more, they usually did not lose interest and still dated me. Guys on the other hand were not as patient/accepting). 

Example: I was talking to a guy for a while and we had chemistry (at least I thought we did). We sexted, exchanged nudes, etc. He said he found me very attractive but that he liked that I was also “quirky”, and that he enjoyed my personality. I disclosed to him that I was on the spectrum and shortly after he said he saw me as a “little sister”, and that me being on the spectrum in addition to our age difference (10 years) made him feel creepy, so he didn’t think he could date me. I’m not mentally disabled! I respond for myself, I live on my own, have a masters degree, a full time job, etc. This really hurt my feelings, so I don’t disclose my autism anymore. 

Anyways, is there anyway I can become better with guys?",08May2020,1
738,"It involves everything - from loud discussion until 1-2 am, VERY loud footstep, dog that yells constantly. I think all of this would be somewhat acceptable for me, if it wasn't for the loudest sex that i've ever heard irl. And it's not sporadic, it's almost everyday. Some days I cannot fall asleep because they're doing it at 11 pm, sometimes I'm woken up by the woman screaming at 2 am, sometimes it's 8 am on the weekend when I want to actually sleep of the nights I lost because of them. 

Don't get me wrong, I understand that it's a very important piece of relationship, and I'm not saying they should stop having sex at all because of the neighbors. 

But I cannot do this anymore... I sleep now maybe 4-5 hours, because once I'm past my bedtime (I like to go to sleep around 22), I can't fall asleep for hours. I want to cry everytime I hear them, I think I start to develop some kind of trauma. Tbh I think I will be moving from this apartment because of this, I still live with my parents and I wanted to save up some more money to buy my own 4 walls, but now I NEED to move, my mental state is ruined because of them.

So the question is - how to let them know without sounding rude and pretentious? Should I just go to them? I'm a very shy person, so I would probably be all red and embarrased and I really want to avoid it. Maybe an anonymous letter? Just a public note on the entry to the building not actually targeting them?",08May2020,1

742,"So when the lockdown started I (M28) started chatting with a girl (21). Our chats were pretty interesting and we both stayed until like 4 in the morning every night just chatting about everything. Many times she said she likes me really much, she finds me very handsome, smart. She also sent me some photos of her in a bikini. That lasted for a month.

 Then we set up a date and we went out for a coffee yesterday. We were both a bit nervous but everything went smooth. She laughed, I laughed. I walked her home and tried to kiss her. She put her cheek and said that you don't kiss a girl on the first date. I say ok and we laugh it off and say goodbye. Then when she gets home she texts me saying that she had great time, that I have really nice arms and hands, that she enjoyed spending time with me.

Day after that I ask her when are we going to go out again. Then she sends me a long message, saying that she was thinking about everything and that she thinks she's not ready for an emotional relationship.

I am just totally confused by her behaviour. If she was giving me all the compliments, spending all the time with me, etc, then where did that come from suddenly? What could be a reason for something like that? 

I am trying to understand her behaviour but I am clueless. i would be very grateful for any opinions on this. 

Short: was texting with a girl, she was saying she's really into me, we went out and she said I was great, then she suddenly texted me saying she's not ready for a relationship",08May2020,1
743,"This is a very long one. Tl;dr at the bottom.


I don't know, I just feel helpless in the situation I'm in right now. 

My boyfriend and I plan on moving in together next month. He works full time while I am currently in the middle of my exams, while staying at his current place (but not living there). I do his household chores because he oftentimes comes home exhausted.

The problem is that I do ALL of it. And I don't mind doing mine and my boyfriend's laundry or cleaning the kitchen after cooking. I also get that he comes home late most of the time, but on the days where he's home early, I expect him to do a little bit in the household as well. Not too much because I know he is exhausted. Just maybe loading the dishwasher and turning it on or something, I don't want him to clean entire rooms or stuff like that. 

It's just that we're in the middle of moving and everything is kind of a mess. He has asked me to start packing HIS stuff (while I also have to pack my own stuff at my parent's place) and I actually have packed about ten boxes of his stuff (including literal trash that he refuses to throw away, but it's not my right to throw away his stuff of course). His appartment has become a huge mess and he refuses to clean anything up. He hasn't packed anything himself.

It has come to the point where I clean the kitchen every day because of the mess he makes and just doesn't clean it up, while simultaneously telling me to clean up my stuff and that it's annoying that I leave everything lying around. He has called me lazy because I happened to sit on the couch when he came home from work, after studying for my exam, cleaneing his living room and picking up his trash for the fourth time of that week (that was like two weeks ago) and it broke me. I cried as I was really hurt, because I try to make his life as easy as possible by doing his household chores for him so he can relax after coming home from work. And he thanks me by insulting me.

I wasn't at his place this week because I had two exams since tuesday and when I left I asked him if he could please do one load of laundry because my favorite pants were in there and I wanted them clean by the weekend. He texted me yesterday (thursday) evening that he hadn't done any laundry and wasn't planning on doing so, and it made me a little sad, because that was literally all I asked for. 

I was at his place earlier than him today and came home to a total mess once again. I started cleaning the (once again) messy kitchen including a dirty pan that had been rotting for probably at least four days. I did my load of laundry. It took me about 20 minutes and I wondered how it was that hard for him to do it. When he came home, he didn't even notice that I cleaned up his mess for probably the hundreth time this month and left to go to a friend's place. I asked him why he didn't do the laundry and he just rolled his eyes and left. When he left I broke down crying (happens a lot since he became so messy) and I literally feel like a fifty year old mother of six. I really do my best to keep his appartment clean and this is what I get for it. I feel useless and that all I do is literal nonsense since it's not being recognized at all and I even get called lazy for sitting on the couch at the moment he comes home. I am only 18 years old and I know I shouldn't feel that way. I cry almost every day when I see the huge mess he leaves for me to clean  and his denial about it. 


Tl;dr: I do household chores for my boyfriend because he works full time and it feels like he uses me because he refuses to clean up after himself and calls me lazy after cleaning up every day. I have mental breakdowns regularly and cry because of it almost every day. I know this is not healthy but I can't just stop cleaning as if I don't do it, nobody will.",08May2020,1
744,"My situation:

I used to live in ""City B"", but back in March I moved to ""City A"" to try out a 2-month job with ""Company A""; there was a vague idea that I could continue working here in June. At the same time, I told ""Company B"" that I might be available to move back in June (Company B wants me for at least a full year, for sure) and we verbally decided on a salary. 

Then the virus hit and started cancelling things. I've been hanging out in accommodation provided by Company A and trying to avoid discussions about the future. My plan is to wait until the last minute and see if Company A would like to take me on for a full year at a higher salary than Company B (with the current travel restrictions, they couldn't even have anyone else come in here until at least late-May, so they're kinda stuck with me unless they deem my position unnecessary). But I think it would be too much to try to renegotiate salary with Company B (City B has way more people around who could replace me). 

So I'm gonna ask Company B for a bunch of non-salary things. I'm thinking: 

1) Salary paid at the beginning of months (ie first month paid as soon as I show up) 

2) 1-month severance

3) Contribution to my health insurance (this is rare in my country, but it's just a few hundred dollars). 

4) Advancing me money for an apartment (common terms here are pre-paying 6-12 months but I want to pay monthly). 

5) Paying for my commute if I can't find an apartment walking-distance. 

6) Specific details about working hours and potential overtime/bonus pay.

748,I’m 18 years old and a senior in high school. During quarantine my brother has moved back home. I had to move into the basement as my old room became the nursery for my younger sister. My older brother also has a bedroom in the basement. When I say bedroom I mean no walls we use bookshelves and blankets and walls. He makes comments about my body a lot. He walks around the basement to my side whenever I’m there. We share a half bathroom down there and he always leaves just his underwear there. Literally while walking down the stairs or in his room he will start moaning to make me uncomfortable. I really don’t like it and told him but he continues to. I’ve tried talking to my parents about it and they aren’t taking it seriously. Whenever I get out of the shower he always says he has to work out at that exact time. (There’s like a rec room in my basement with gym equipment. On my side) I always notice him staring at me and he walks around in a towel a lot. Over the summer when he still lived at home it was worse and I told one of my youth counselors at camp about it. He ended up calling the police so my parents like know somethings going on because there was a whole investigation. I really don’t know what to do at this point.

751,"For some context: I love both members of my family. I’ve struggled with my relationships with them in different ways because recently I’d decided I was done being pushed around by them. I’ve often been guilt tripped by my mother into activities or scenarios I never wanted to be in, and earlier this year I made a post here about my sister blaming me for my entire family’s animosity for her childish behaviors. 

My mother is involved here only because I struggle to maintain a relationship with her over the phone. My mother is a pathological liar, manipulative, and requires at least 2 hours of my time for a single phone call. Needless to say, after being furloughed due to the virus and desperately trying to find a daytime schedule to fill my hours, the last thing I wanted to do was listen to my mother talk for hours on end about absolutely nothing while already under immense stress the last few weeks. I’ve tried to call regularly, but most days it gives me anxiety to even think about arranging these chats with her, knowing I’d be cornered or silenced for most of the conversation. 

This morning, I had a pre-arranged phone call with my sister for Animal Crossing. She had just gotten the game, and I’ve had it for a few months with no friends to play with so to say I was excited to have her visit my island and enjoy the gameplay with me was an understatement. She called me, and I was simply waiting for her to grab her switch on hop on, something she explicitly started the conversation with by letting me know ‘her WiFi had been pretty spotty and she was having a hard time with connection issues.’

Maybe less than 30 minutes into the call, she went quiet and I couldn’t hear much. Suddenly, and apparently by complete accident, my mother had been added into the call. My sister stated that my mother hadn’t even called her, just that somehow magically she’d been added to the conversation. At this point I was fuming, but hesitant to make a big deal out of nothing when in all fairness, it *had* been some time since I’d spoken with my mom. 

When asked about what I’d been up to recently, I attempted to segway the conversation back to its original purpose by stating that I’d been really into this cool game recently! To which my mother responded by accusing me of not answering her phone calls as a result of my video games. She continued on to joke about how on her deathbed I would admit that at least ‘she knew that I loved her.’

The conversation continued with absolute negativity, from my opinions about the current virus and mask wearing to judging my partner and his decision to go on a keto diet recently for his own personal reasons and nothing else. It was a weird humble brag for both of them to tell me about how much they’d been working at their jobs as essential employees, shifting to a competition about who was more tired as a result of hours worked. The fact that I’d gotten an interview for the first time in weeks was glazed over because I hadn’t been busting my ass like they had in the past couple of months. 

I know that personally I’m not the best at keeping contact with people, especially since the social distancing rules had come about and my own personal life had gotten in the way (somewhere in there I had a stomach bug for a couple days, life has just been dreary for me). However, I feel completely betrayed by both of them. My sister always let me know that my mom talked with her about me because I never called, and that I should get back to her soon, but I didn’t think it entailed cornering me into a conversation with them against my will. 

Please help me. I don’t know how to approach them and set a boundary line when their reaction will be to play the victim and pretend as though they’d done nothing wrong. I can see them both taking this personally, and I’ve been trying for years not to cut ties with them because they are, and have been, a big part of my life for a long time and I love them dearly. But morally, the way they treat me wears on me constantly. I don’t know how to set a boundary line without them guilting me into feeling like I’m the bad guy.",08May2020,1

With this being The end of my freshman year at college. I just got back my final grades, in my chemistry class I received an 89, which effectively translates to a solid B. Currently I am receiving a scholarship to completely eliminates my out-of-state tuition. This out-of-state tuition is about $8000 per semester, as long as I maintain a 3.25 or higher. My first semester I really didn’t do too well and failed two classes. This caused my GPA to be quite low and I’ve worked really hard this semester to make up for it.The way things are going right now I’m about just on the edge of securing my 3.25 cumulative GPA. An A in this class would definitely help me reach my goal. Does anybody have any experience or any ideas as of how I should ask this teacher for a grade increase.

754,"Throwaway account. This is a long read so sorry in advance for any typos.

My friend, (let’s call her Irene) and I have been friends for about 15 years. Three years ago she started law school and I was so happy for her! She moved to another state with her boyfriend (now fiancé - let’s call him David) so they could be closer to the school she was attending. 

Over the past three years they have had financial hardships. Irene hasn’t really been working because she is in school so David is the one who works full time and takes care of the bills. On top of that, Irene and David help their family out a lot financially.

Being close with Irene, and now David, I have noticed they have expensive taste (they still have expensive taste till this day).

There have been instances where I, and a couple of our other close friends have helped Irene &amp; David out when they were in a jam. They eventually send the money back, but in the back of my mind I can’t help but think some of these financial jams could have been avoided if they were more responsible with money.

So last year this is when I noticed they were irresponsible and it started to really bother me (because I was the one loaning them money)

In June of last year Irene and David have planned a trip outside of the country - little did Irene know that David was going to propose! David has asked me to loan him $300 (I did not ask him for what) and that he would pay me back in two weeks (still have yet to see the money). A week after that, Irene messaged me asking for an additional amount (300) and that she would pay me back in two weeks (Again, I did not ask for what it was, just sent her the money;  she has not paid me back). Fast forward a couple of weeks they are away on their trip and David proposes - Irene says yes! While they were on the trip, Irene had asked me for another $300 and said they would pay me back in a couple weeks (I have not seen that money either).

A month or two after their trip, Irene calls me distraught. They were once again in a financial jam - they got into a car accident and needed money to get the car fixed ASAP (they are fine Thank God). I sent them over $2,000 and they promised me they will send me the money in installments - Irene had started working again so they had more income. Till this day, they have have only paid me half of the money. 

Ending of last year they decided to get a dog (golden retriever). Only thing is it really upset me that they got a pet and still have not paid me back all of my money. I understand that we are close friends, and they have been there for me, but I just think it is extremely financially irresponsible for them to purchase a big expense without paying me back.

It concerns me because now they are planning for a wedding (wedding got pushed back a year because of COVID-19). I do not want to be in an instance where I have to cough up costs for them when I have yet to see my money back. I am also someone who has a hard time saying no - I don’t like confrontation, neither does Irene. I fee like once I say something or bring this up, all hell is going to break loose. I don’t know what to do. Should I just keep quiet and hope I get my money back? Should I just let it go?

Am I wrong for counting their pockets? Now anytime I see them with a new gadget (whether or a new phone, watch, etc.) I think to myself how that money could have been used to pay me back. I feel horrible but I can’t help it. My family thinks I am an idiot for even lending them money in the first place and that I will probably never see that money again.",08May2020,1

763,"Due coronavirus suddenly I have more contact with both my neighbors, which I really appreciate since I don't have that many friends.

The contract was good, but suddenly she ignores me and things have become a bit weird between us. We've talked about a job interview the another day, she texted me to wish me good luck and I didn't replied immediately, maybe this is the reason? Or maybe she just tired of all the contact or me as person? I've tried to ask if everything was ok and let her know I appreciate the text she send me, but I didn't receive any response.

Things have become a bit worse since my other neighbor invited me and her to come over this weekend (first time ever) for small talk, I know she just isn't interested, although she acts likes she does. This also brings me in a bad mood and makes me a bit frustrated. Like why can't she just say no?

Anyway, I just want to leave her alone, but I think I'm acting a bit childish when I see her in person. What should I do? Normally we (incl. someone else) walk every day in the afternoon (except weekends), should I simple stop doing this and leave her alone? I'm afraid I maybe crossed a line and the contact is over already.

Should I message her next week, just to ask an question like how are your plants doing she bought this week?

1) it said the last backup was done on Wednesday at 22:00 
2) phone completely died forever on Thursday around 19:00

If someone sent me a Whatsapp message during this interval, will it be kept? I don’t know when the last Whatsapp backup was done, but it used to be automatic.

However, I just feel so discouraged because of my own mother. But sadly, I don’t make enough money to provide for myself and so I’m tied to her decisions on meals. My mom doesn’t cook unhealthy food but it’s not super healthy either. I asked her if we could maybe plan the meals ahead of time. She said no. I asked her if we could buy less snacks. She said no. I wanted to try and count calories and she told me I shouldn’t do that because “it won’t work, you won’t keep up.” It’s just getting really frustrating because I feel like I don’t really have her support. And then when she eats snacks in front of me and I try not to eat (which obviously puts me in a bad mood) she gets angry at me and says it’s not her problem that I’m upset.

I said that I'll get more hours, but she insisted that I work somewhere else. I hadn't yet looked into the other job so I told her I'll stick to the one I have for now. I thought I better hang on to this one because the COVID situation isn't great for 16 year old kids who need a job. After she yells at me about it, as she always does when she doesn't get her way, I apply for the job because upon my own thought and reasoning, I think it would, in fact, be better for me. I wish she wouldn't yell, and tell me I'm wrong, or illogical, or say that she knows best because I'm sixteen and she's an adult. I want to make my own decisions at some point. I need to learn to do that without her forcing me in her own direction.

Afterward, we got in a fight about her controlling my life and yelling at me when she feels like it. I'm a pretty good kid, I get great grades, I work, I help around the house and manage my time well without asking for anything. I see no reason for why she's constantly on my ass for every little thing I do.

This problem has been persistent for the last couple years. This is a really bad time to reach a breaking point because it's mothers' day in 2 days and I don't know what to do. I can't reason with her, she'll just yell at me.

All she does is yell. 

I'm going to try to have a decent conversation with her at some time about this, but she will never admit fault for anything, and she says she's always right. 

What do I do? Please help.

777,"Context (copy-paste from a previous post here a month ago):

""6 years ago, High School, there was a guy bullying me. He was white, tall, muscular and hairy. I'm Asian, quite short, skinny and at the time completely smooth. He verbally bullied me about all of these, calling me with female names, no one liked him because, you know, he was a racist and rude guy. I handled this pretty well however.

We were in the same sport team. Once we were alone in the showers and he put a finger inside my ass, just for a moment, saying I looked like a girl. I was shocked and I cried that night, but I was also ashamed and never told about this to anyone. I left the team with an excuse. I found the courage to face him after a month or so, he laughed saying it was only a joke and nothing serious. But at least he never bullied me after it.

Even after so many years, sometimes I still cry thinking about it at night. I often think about what should I've done and how I can go over it.

I told myself it's a small thing and It wasn't my fault, but it doesn't work.""

I decided to confront him and yesterday we met after I've found him on social media. I asked him and he agreed.

I told him everything about how he hurt me. He was genuinely surprised and said he was extremely sorry, he didn't realize how much he had hurt me and how he'd changed since high school, admitting he was a jerk.

He confessed to have acted that way because he was confused about his sexuality and to see how I would have reacted. He suspected I was gay (I told him I'm not) and thought about me in a sexual way more than a time.

He made it clear he regrets how he acted, but he wasn't brave enough to ask for it explicitly. He was also sorry for the verbal abuse, explaining he didn't fully realize how racist his words were.

Maybe I'm naive, but he seemed sincere.

I said I was happy to hear that, but I can't forgive him. You can't change the past.

I was also a bit happy he's now fat and balding, I know it's childish but still. 

He wanted to explain me how I was the only guy he felt attracted to, but I refused. I told him I've issues about my masculinity for years mainly because of him and I don't need to hear what I think he would have said.

It was hard to confront him. I wanted to cry during that, but I didn't show him any feeling. 

In the end, this helped me. Now I'm stronger.

Do you think I should have acted in a different way?",08May2020,1
778,"Or not just thoughts like that but like romantic and/or sexual thoughts in general.

I can’t seem to get rid of this kind of thought pattern.

But something I have been making progress in is losing weight: Started lock down at 91kg and now weigh 86kg. I haven't even made large changes to my diet: it's a combination of eating just under my allowed amount of calories and not being able to go to the shops and buy snacks as often. Plus I'm on my feet anyway: quite the pacer.

Obviously if I don't work on toning, it isn't going to happen. But as I have some fat to trim anyway...should I just focus on losing weight for now? I mean, I'm not gonna see muscle if it's under fat right? 

I don't really have the equipment or motivation to gym right now. So maybe I should just focus on losing weight right now and tone when the gym reopens?

785," Hi, this is my first time on this subreddit and I really do hope that this post is okay. I have nowhere else to turn with this problem. I feel embarrassed for ending up in this situation at all.  
As the title already told you: my boyfriend is doing drugs. He smokes weed multiple times a day and also does coke in the weekends. He occasionally does other drugs like ecstasy and stuff.  
I've always been pretty liberal when it comes to drug use, personally I don't have any interest in them. I've smoked some weed every now and then with him or with friends but that's like once every third month or something and now I'm not doing it at all.  
I hate that my boyfriend is doing drugs, I used to be okay with it but these days I can't stand it. He is 25 and I am 21 but I always have to step up and be the grown-up. I love him and I do want a life with him but I can't live a life where he is addicted to weed and always turns into a different person on the weekends.  
I feel embarrassed and stupid because I've known that he's been doing drugs for a few years still, I've stayed with him. I just never thought it was this bad and I was always clear about the fact that I wanted him to stop eventually. He refuses to talk about it and always turn on me and say the most horrible things if I try to bring it up. We recently bought an apartment together where we took a big loan. He sometimes borrows money for me to pay for some of his monthly expenses even though he makes twice the money I make. I always make it clear that if he borrows money for me it's not okay that he goes and buys drugs (or other useless crap) until he's paid my money back. He still goes and buys stuff that he doesn't need like drugs, alcohol, games, etc. And I just can't say anything because he gets super angry at me. I feel so trapped in this situation where I'm stuck in an unhealthy relationship with an immature guy that I love to bits.

787,"Here is some context.

My friend is a semi-closeted homosexual guy that is on the route to acceptance and is a person who is very passionate about select topics and can talk for literal hours about said topics. Which, is a rather endearing trait, I admit.

But it drains on my patience and my energy.

The topic that he is passionate about is his identity, and more than often not he would gush about representation in comics and media for the lgbtq people, and he loves nothing more than to bring it up in every conversation.

But that is the problem.

He talks about it so often it practically dominates 80% of our conversation topics. On one hand, I get that I am probably one of the few people that he has to express this part of himself to, and I *am* flattered that he trusts me enough for this, and I do want to see him be happy about himself. But on the other hand? Its tiring. It is literally *all* he talks about and it feels as if that is all he cares about.

If we talk about comics? It's going to end up as a three paragraph gushing about lgbt representation. If we talk about music? 'Hey, did you know that the singer is gay?' and goes on and on about how that aspect of the singer influenced his works. If we talk about movies? People? *Academia?*

I want to talk about something *else* other than the lgbt aspect of whatever topic we are talking about. I want to talk about the way dresses are structured and I want to talk about art and comics and discuss the plot and the character development and talk about our shared passions together.

But it all has to go back to 'gay this' 'gay that', 'non-binary this' 'bisexual that'. It all has to go back to *how oppressed gay people are* and monologues about the importance of representation- each and *every single time.*

Is it my problem? Is this some deeply ingrained homophobia or whatever-phobia that is not yet dealt with? Is it even *okay* for me to feel this way in regards to this sort of topic?

How do I even break this to him, if that's the case, without running the risk of this being a permanent stain on our relationship? I worry that he takes things too personally at times, and I would hurt him if I am not very careful with this.

I really need some advice as soon as possible.

789,"Hello redditors. I have been struggling with this and some sort of advice would mean a whole world to me. For the past 3 years I haven't been able to make clear decissions, so often instead of choosing between option  X and option Y, I choose nothing. It started with my family who would say no to things I wanted to do as child, which turned me into really submissive person. They were really conservative and controling. My mom died when I was a teen so after that I was forced to grow up and start making mature decissions in my life. Few years ago I was able to get out of that mindset and just did things I wanted, it was amazing and it felt like I could do anything, and I could. Even traveled a bit. 

Untill I met my ex who was extremely toxic to me. He made me give up on things I loved and people I considered my close friends because he was too jealous. I was really lonely and at the bad mental state I just did everything he asked, thinking it was love. Looking back at it, it left a huge impact on me and my ability to make decissions in life. I am afraid of being judged, called weird, sexualized and overall scared of meeting new people because they might treat me bad like he did.

I work for gamers/streamers/youtubers so I often meet a lot of new people, but they tend to sexualize or generalize me untill they get to know me (being a girl in a gaming world often means guys judging you). I am a very friendly person and part of my job is networking with these people. If they show interest in being friends, I sometimes go for it. But the problem is when people get too attached and invested into my life. Then act all entitled to my time and my attention and get frustrated when Im too busy. Somehow it seems like no matter what I do, people just get mad at me, even over life decissions that have nothing to do with them. 

Now I lost my will to make any decissions, but at the same time it makes me annoyed and I'd like to change that. I don't know what to do since I'm starting to feel like I fail at everything without even trying anymore. I just can't win. Honestly I just wanna be happy doing things I like but sometimes it feels like the only way to do that is being completely isolated from everyone.

I am an also having a lot of doubts on if this would be a well paying job or I’ll lose all of my extra earnings by having to pay for gas. I kind of want to quit but I am too scared now since they have started training me and spent a lot of money buying new tools for me to use. I’m not sure if I will enjoy this as I will be alone all day working out in the sun, and I don’t know if I will lose too much money on gas, but I am scared I’m too far in to quit.

799,"I am not going to make this long. 

When this Covid-19 virus first started I was seeing doctors to get surgery done on my thigh that should have happened a long time ago, since then the virus has supposedly escalated and things are bad right now, my surgery is taking place on Tuesday;  in order for me to even have my surgery done I need to take a Covid test, I am starting to mixed signals, people are saying doctors lie about the test( a tool to control your life) I don’t know what to believe at this moment.  There are so many naive people.  Story short if I test positive for the virus my surgery will not be happening. I was denied in the first place because they wanted me to get surgery done locally, went to my home town hospital and told me it’s a difficult surgery and the other out of town hospital has to do it no matter what.  For people saying doctors are lying about people testing positive. Would this affect me in any way?",08May2020,1
801,"Hello! This is the first time I've ever actually posted on Reddit. So apologies, if I do something wrong.

Background:

So I (20 F) grew up in a strictly Lutheran household, and was very sheltered. Never allowed to watch certain shows and movies, so on so forth. I started to grow up and found my 'true self,' pulled away from the church. I go to college now. 

So my family has a good enough money, so I'm pretty good. My parents pay the half that I can't (because I work during the summer to pay as much as I can) but I'm still expected to pay it back.

My grandfather passed away when I was in elementary school, and left money for each of his grandkids and its grown enough to pay back. I can't get to it yet tho for some reason. (IDK)

Anyway so basically I want to get a tattoo, and have talked about it for a long time. I'd pay for it myself, but my mom is super against it. She said I have to be out of the house and financially stable. Which you know, in this world, is gonna be a while. 

So the advice I need is that if I decided to go get a tattoo on my own, would she really kick me out or take my money or something.

As I said I grew up really sheltered and don't know a lot about it. I didn't even realize I had the savings until I was 17. My mom has flipped out about a lot of things. Like when my doctor said that she was going to put me on zoloft and adderall, my mom threw a fit. I broke down in the car because of that. I was so terrified to go home that weekend and see her. 

So if you have questions I'll do my best to answer. Sorry if this is childish or confusing, I'm just sick of my parents micro managing my life. Any type of advice would be extremely welcomed. 

Thank you,

:)",08May2020,1

803,"I’m a 33 year old female for reference. I was dating a woman for several months and we had a good relationship. We had issues here and there like any other couple. But we kind of settled in really quick and became like an old married couple. I felt there was no fire. She didn’t express her feelings a lot. But she was an amazing girlfriend overall and cared for me a lot and there was definitely love there on both our parts. I had a lot of doubts and ended things with her which broke her heart. But I felt I had to be honest with with her. 

Now I’m seeing someone new and she’s amazing. We had an instant connection. We are talking seriously about marriage and I love her a lot. But, I still find myself thinking about my ex a lot. She even called me crying recently and told me how much she misses me and wishes things were different. I have to admit I miss her a lot too. I have realized I still have very strong feelings for her. I think maybe it’s because I never realized how much she loved me and I didn’t give her a fair chance. So it’s almost like we have unfinished business. 

I have tried to put this out of my mind. But I literally wake up every morning with this ache in my heart for her. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should ignore these feelings and continue on with my current relationship, get married etc. or if I’ll spend the rest of my life wondering what if and living with regret. I also know if I tell my current girlfriend how I feel that there’s no coming back from that and it will ruin what we have. Even if we stay together things may never be the same. I’m so conflicted and this is on my mind constantly. It’s like torture.

I’m an hourly employee who received a promotion in February. I got a new title, and a $3/hr raise. My paystubs came back showing hourly rate (checked the first couple), with overtime paid at time and a half for extra time I was spending at the facility. I was told many times that all overtime due to a certain project was approved. I do not work from home. I never even filled out our “take home a laptop” form because I can’t do my main job duties remotely.

Today our payroll worker came to me to tell me that I don’t need to clock in and out like I have been because I’m salaried. She said that SHE didn’t even realize I was salary until she got a message from someone else regarding me punching in and out.

I looked on our HR software— my feb raise is recorded as expected. But on April 1 I have a “general increase” and a pay change to salaried exempt. I was never informed of this, I certainly didn’t sign anything about it. My direct deposit matched what I was expecting in overtime so I didn’t look at my stubs. I just looked and indeed my april paystubs have a salary listed. Should’ve been looking every time but didn’t. 

I guess the things I want advice on are:

-Right now things are going ok but I am not really interested in being exempt when it comes to this place and don’t want remote duties. Should I ask to get changed back?

-I don’t think I can trust these people at all. They have been dishonest about other things in the past and are huge fans of backdating things. Is this worth leaving over?

810,"Hey everyone,

the title is missing quite abit but i didn't want it to be too long.
Some background before i start:

Me and A, the person i lent money to, started an apprenticeship at the same company in 2017 with a monthly salary of 850-900€.
Mine finished last summer, his was supposed to finish this year.

His apprenticeship was for a sales job, mine was more like consulting.

We didn't know each other prior to the apprenticeship but got pretty good buddies pretty fast.

We also live in a european country with universal health care and only co-payments up to 10€.


So as the Title says, i lent A 600€ in September 2018 because he told me something with his car broke and he did not have enough money to repair it, he needs his car in sales because he drives to the clients.

He did not want to ask his family because in his (south-eastern european) culture that would apperently mean his family would lose respect for him.

Since 600€ back then was 2/3rds of my/our monthly salary, we agreed that he's going to start to pay it back pretty quickly, atleast in little bits.

Months passed and i never recieved any money. At first i didnt really press it, but went to ask whats up more often.

He always said he's going to start next month, money is tight right now or had issues within his family, at one point said his mother had health issues that his family needs all money for.

Late 2019 he said there was a tumor in this stomach and he can't work right now and it's not sure if he can finish his apprenticeship.

Since i was pretty pissed and suspicious about whatever he said at this point already, i decided to just go and ask every few months and not bother to much for the moment.

Now, 2 days ago i asked again if he is able to give me my money back. He then asked ""if i didn't know what happend"" and that it wasn't a tumor but he actually had cancer and already got chemo treatments.

He then showed me a picture of his head and said his hair already starting to grow back. 

His hair/head looked very much normal to me in that picture though.


Now i don't really know what to do, i don't know if i should believe him, it's cancer after all and lying about that would be a super asshole move at the same time i feel like asking for proof on that i a super asshole move too.

Still, 600€ is alot of money to me and he never even payed back like 50€ in atleast 1 1/2 years of him getting 850-900€ per month from his apprenticeship and living at home.

I need advice/opinions on how to proceed, am i an asshole questioning him here?",08May2020,1

States are beginning to reopen. I was denied unemployment because the dates they are checking against I was hospitalized/recovering from sepsis. I applied for PUA and it says ""active"" but it still isn't actually approved and that doesn't mean it will be. I'm deeply concerned about what is going to happen as things progress further. I don't have anything stating right now that I am immunocompromised, however, before this all took place my doctors expressed concern that I show signs of an autoimmune disease. That aside, it is apparent that ever since I was hospitalized, my immune system is not the same. I get sick very often, very easily.

He had me get off the pill so we could try for a baby, I have health issues that deemed it damn near impossible for me to have a baby, So in the chances that it could happen. He wanted that chance and fantasized about us having kids and a whole happy family together. He flip flopped on the idea and had me get on and off it twice, But we found out I was pregnant and I was 5 months along. Which is past the point of abortion for my state. At the point we found out he back peddled and decided he didnt want it. But he was so back and forth about what he wanted, It always hurt. Our families were excited and so was I despite his negativity. I always wanted to be a mom. We had all the support we needed to make it work. I told him he can do whatever he wants, Be a dad, Dont be a dad, Its fine with me. Ill do whatever it takes to make him happy but Im not giving up pur daughter. And I mean it, I wouldnt go after child support, I wouldnt talk shit about him. If he wants to go explore the world and act like she doesnt exist I wont stop him. I wont force him to be a dad. But he feels that he has to cause if she exists around me hes obligated to parent. That he'll be shuned by his family for turning a blind eye on his woman and his child. He loves her, He loves me. And Ive seen him glow with her, But to his core he says he doesnt want her in the picture but still wants a life with me.

I feel like Im chosing between my daughter and my best friend. I dont know what to do. Ive given him every option, But he doesnt want them.

I hear her sleeping and I see her smile and I feel complete. I dont think I could function the same again, I couldnt be the same me. But I dont want to lose him either. Im stuck in this limbo and I cant get out. I dont want him to feel obligated and misreble, I want him by my side. He says how much he loves me and how we'd both be happier without a child, How we could do so many amazing things. But at that point i dont even think id have the desire to.

815," Hey, Hopefully this wouldn't be too long but I'll add a tl;dr for my lazy readers out there.

So basically my mom (60F), and my dad(65M) have always been having their ups and downs, the way it used to go is that my dad would scream at my mom would usually take it and move on, my dad never apologizes to my mom, for sakes of ego i guess, and thats how it's been my whole life.

My dad is not a bad person, he tries to take of the family the way he believes however he's really old fashioned which involves him screaming at the rest of the family members as a form of outlet instead of communicating with us, and everytime someone disagrees with him on stuff he does or gives him a remark he goes to this form of outlet which makes the rest of the family afraid to even talk about stuff with him and personally, I (22M) get regular panic attacks because of that (which i told him at some point).

Lately, it's been getting worse.It all started when he started renovating our big house and dividing it to 3 units so we could rent the other 2 and have more money cuz he doesn't have a pension or an actual source of income and my mom does.However, he did not consult my mom regarding this, he made them a small room to move into and didn't even ask her what she thought of that and she was upset but couldn't tell him because she was afraid he would yell.He's been renovating the house at night even when it disturbs my mom's sleep, or whenever she's resting between giving private tutoring to students for extra income (she's a teacher).

My mom is working 18 hours a day, she's the type of person that needs peace at the house so she would rather take the yelling and let him go with his day than confront him.I however, can't stand when my dad screams at my mom so i usually back her up and stands up for her when things go too bad, and that annoys my dad even more and he blames my mom because she and I are disrespecting him which results to my mom getting more backlash afterwards.

About 2 months ago she texted him saying if he can keep it down because she's trying to rest, he came up and started yelling at her so I stood up for her yelling at him back, I said some pretty bad stuff like i wish he was dead which I do regret and he said some shit about me (not like that though), this made my mom upset and she started yelling at me to stop, he yelled at her and she started yelling too, All this concluded to him not speaking to me or to my mom and instead he speaks to my other brother who's also still in the house.It's been 2 months and he has yet to speak to any of us, my mom made me send him an apologetic text because of what i said and I sent him something along the lines of ""sorry for the bad words."" not too apologetic and basically just to get me off the hook which i know is not right and as a respond he said ""i dont care, i want you to not come in between me and your mom.""

Ever since then my mom has been using my brother to text him inviting him to weekly family dinners which he responds as ""no thank you"" and my mom does not know what to do.

Me and my brother do not think they should be together as we believe this is abusive behavior and we want the best for our mom however she is just trying to bring it back to the way it used to be to make peace around the house - which peace being him yelling at her and her taking it and not telling him what bothers her out of fear.

What should we do to convince her she can have a better life? should i be even convincing her on breaking up with my dad if she just wants to have peace around the house?

I know this is kind long and messy and i probably left some stuff out but if there's questions i'll be happy to try and make the story more clear.

tl;drMy dad is borderline abusive (yelling and screaming, never laid a hand on my mom) instead of communicating with her and me and my brother wants advice on what should we do to convince my mom she can have a better life.",08May2020,1

819,"Years in the future, my son comes to me and asks me a question.

Why did you have me? I am so depressed by the world we live in. It’s a mess, it’s full of hate and greed and stupidity and I have no hope or faith in the world leaders. The economy is a disaster. The planet is dying and the environment is getting worse and worse. I try my best to be a good person, like you taught me, to be honest and considerate of others and show empathy in every situation. I use the logic and common sense that you taught me but I am tired and depressed and stressed. It doesn’t make a difference. Can I ask, why did you decide to bring me into this world? At times like this, I wish I had a choice.

I reply, I chose to have you because I was ready. I felt the time was right to embrace something new in my life. I wanted a child I could love and teach and raise to be an amazing human being. And I am proud of you for the amazing human being you have become. I am so sorry you are feeling this way. Please tell me what I can do to help. 

My son responds, I understand that you brought a child into this world because it’s what you wanted, but it sounds like it was all for reasons for you. And if I’m being honest, it seems quite selfish. I know you have raised me in the best way you could but I am suffering in this environment. This is not the world I would have wanted to be brought into. Why would you bring me into the world when it is such a mess?

I think on this and say, I thought I could bring you up to make a difference. To become one of those who can change it. I hoped I could help make it better for you along the way. 

My son frowns. He asks, if you wanted to get a puppy, but you lived in a tiny, dirty house full of dangerous and hazardous things, would you still get one and clean up the house while the puppy was living in it? Or would you try to train the puppy to clean up the house itself? No, you would make sure the environment was right first, before you got the puppy. You would make sure the puppy had a clean, safe home to ensure you could give it the best quality of life. But importantly, if it was not possible to do this, I know you wouldn’t get a puppy.
I had no choice but to come into this world, but you chose that for me. I want to make it a better place, I really do, but at the same time it is a lot of responsibility and hard work and I’ve learned that I can’t do it on my own. I’ve come to the conclusion that unless everybody feels the same way, nothing is going to change. I don’t understand why you would put the pressure on me to change things for the better. The mess is too big and it isn’t my mess, yet I have to live in it.

Don’t give up hope, I tell him, even though I understand what he is saying. I feel awful. I know that he is right. 

I am at a loss. I love my son with all my heart and it pains me to know he feels like this. But I brought him into this world for me. Because I was selfish. I didn’t consider what his life might be like due to external circumstances over which I had no control. I did everything I could to raise him to be everything a good human being should be, but he is right. He didn’t choose his environment. I did. The world is a shitty place. 

Right now, I don’t have a child. I am choosing not to have a child. 

I could try right now to do what I can to fix the world, but how far would I get? How could I realistically make a difference? On my own? What could I do that would be enough to make me decide, yes, this is the world I want to bring a child into. To me, I would judge myself for being selfish if I were to choose to have a child right now. As far as I can see into the future, things are only going to get worse. And I will continue to believe this until I can see worldwide positive change. 

PLEASE don’t read this and think I am shaming those who have children. I am not. I’m not calling anyone selfish who chooses to have children. The reason I am writing this is to share my own thoughts on why I personally don’t want to bring a child into this world. I don’t judge others for their choices in having children. I would only judge myself in making a decision that would affect a life, and after having thought it through, I feel that if I were to choose to have a child, based on the above, I would be being selfish.",08May2020,1
820,"From Summer 2015 to Feburary 2020, I (M 24) was on an SSRI antidepressive and a mood stabilizer for anxiety and suicidal ideation. It helped, but gave me nasty side effects such as...

* Weight gain
* Loss of libido and anorgasmia
* Feeling emotionally blunted in the head. Cannot describe it better than that. For example, something that would excite, upset, or sadden me would make me feel indifferent, all the time.
* Bags under my eyes, even though it may be due to something else like genetics or sleep irregularity in the past.

Ultimately, I got my PA to taper me off those meds. Finally got that done in February 2020, but many of those matters were persistent even in late April. So around the end of April, I called my PA, and she gave me referrals to a urologist, and neurologist.

She also told me that my PCP can give me a referral to a dermatologist, however she warned me that my insurance company may deny derm treatments if they deem it ""medically unnecessary"". However, I want to give it a shot.

Ultimately, I realized last year that as an adult, nobody should be more concerned about my personal matters than myself, since I should have a vested interest in myself. Then I realized that it is up to me to get my life back to track. Now, I have been off the medications for a few months and scheduled appointments with a neurologist specializing with tremors, a urologist, and once I see my PCP in July, I will talk to him if I should pursue a dematologist to deal with the bags/wrinkles.

* My mom and GF thinks that the wrinkles/bags are no big deal, but ultimately said its between you and your doctor/PA.
* My psychiatric PA never mentioned a urologist nor neurologist, but I thought that it would behoove me to ask her for referrals. It seems that there is generally nothing wrong in pursuing your self-interest, even if nobody ""told you to do X"".
* I am worried that having kids, or enjoying sex is out of the question for me due to being on these psych meds for so long. If I have these concerns, there is nothing wrong with seeking other specialists?
* Despite the uncertainty with my health in regards to lingering or residual effects of the medications, is there still hope I can get my body back to a baseline state like where it was before and enjoy life without feeling blunted?",08May2020,1

2. doesn't show clear support to the support and safety of my loved ones (feel in some unclear subtle way)-----------------\[my dad always say to me that i don't care about him or the family, that he doesn't want me to take care of him in the long run.whenever i try to talk things like this, he always say ""it's all in my head""
3. i don't really feel passionate about anything anymore---------my peers see me as someone who is quite queer. i love cars along with computer (both of course the faster type). i'm pursuing a degree in computer science, but i have been intending to plan for making my own custom road legal sports car for myself or may be the public. there have been instances when i start questioning about the purpose of life. when i wrote this line, i heard myself saying, ""life is f\*\*king or to be get f\*\*ked up.
4. wasted interest towards BDSM and games------the same questionable passion as for ""lamborghini"" and hi tech gaming computers is also prevalent towards the mentioned.i have never been in a relationship. all i do is watch porn when i am not feeling like myself. or instead game. i am an 

Introvert

5.  i try to win my peer's or others around me, but i don't feel a compulsion to be friendly   
somewhat.

6.  i don't seem to care about things i should do. i also feel out of skin, confused and thoughtless(the kind in which a person can stare into emptiness)

anything beyond that i cannot tell exactly, as i recall it vaguely. but feel free to ask me in the comments.

827,"Hi all,

I'm 20 years old and come from the UK. Most people my age would either have a job or be at university - but I'm not either one of those. I have got a job in the pipeline, it's not happening until the coronavirus is over with. Also, most people my age would have A-levels or equivalents. 

I'm really into art and cartoons. I love designing my own cartoon characters and giving them stories. I do post my art on Tumblr and Deviantart. But my art isn't good enough. I barely have any followers and I suck at colouring. I know colour theory - but I don't know how to shade things. I honestly feel like giving up on this whole art thing because my art is rubbish compared to other peoples. I wanted to make my own comic one day or become a concept artist in character design. But I honestly just can't see it happening. I'm not trying to be negative or anything, but there's so many better artists out there than me.

So, I was thinking, maybe I should become a psychologist (within a mental health setting) because those sorts of psychology jobs are always out there. Maybe becoming a psychologist that specialises in art? I don't know.

Then that means I'll have to sit A-levels. I know which ones I'd do, but I'd be in a class with 16 year olds. I don't mind being the oldest one there, but to me, it's kind of embarrassing? (In my opinion).

Really don't know what I should do.",08May2020,1

Hey I got 99 problems and a girl is one. Were in the same college class. Im, male, 25 yo, shes 22 yo.

So we've been hanging out a lot lately at her place and we've been getting in more real fights. i do like her, but i have hard times with expressing emotions and i feel like im being emotionally used.

today i told her that i might have caught feelings. and that i prioritize our friendship and that we should not hang out alone. which  
her reply was. we shouldnt hangout alone.

i might feel this was a mistake.

ill make a list of things

* bi - she cant have a boyfriend that is bisexual, which i am, she doesnt want an extra challenge (some insecurity she said)
* fighting - we fight all the time, like a married old couple according to friends.
* she talks about her casual sex partners all the time, i am being supportive, but last week it was the only thing she talked about for 6 hours and i asked to talk about something else. That led to a fight where i should not raise my voice and her asking me several times if I had a problem with her guys
* Whenever we fight she calls alot and expect everything to be alright, ive had to tell her several times that i need to calm down myself.
* she says a lot of mean shit such as im a grinch of joy and im annoying piece of shit. We went for a brunch and she started verbally abusing me and i left, she screamed in the apartment block that i should come back and talk about our problems.
* she used to touch me alot which i told her i didnt like, and she stopped.
* in february she insinuated that we were a couple and shit all the time
* everyday is eyecontacts and smile.
* she asks me weird questions about my body, i woke up to text from her, ""have you ever measured your penis?"", ""how long is it?""  
i answered ""no i have never, but you can measure for me"".  
Her reply was ""lol no"" and then she was mad the whole day for me asking that.
* we had a fight yesterday where she started acting like a child when i was studying and i ignored her. and when she started touching me, i told her firmly i needed to study. And guess what, she told me i ruin all the moments with my attitude.
* every movie night ends up with us snuggling.
* she says that she wishes her booty calls were like me, kind and caring.
* she wants to set me up with her friends, but she knows im not attracted to the friends she proposes.

Sometimes i feel friendzoned, sometimes not, thats is why i feel im being emotionally used by her.

Did i make the right thing to try and preserve the friendship? Ive dated people before and been friends afterwards. but i havent liked a girl like this before either.

What is your take on this reddit? should i try and fix it or should let this one go? ask questions if youd like since im prolly one sided, a little sad and mad.",08May2020,1

Sorry this is very long, but it’s been bothering me a lot so I’d appreciate anyone who can read it and give me some advice. 

First a little backstory. The first semester of my freshman year at college, I had a casual relationship with a girl I’ll call E. E initiated the relationship, and we always had sex at her apartment on campus a few times a week. We had been hooking up for a few weeks, and then one night I was planning on coming over, but she told me that she had invited a few girls over for wine so I should come another night, which I said sounded good. Later that night, she texted me saying she wanted me to come over and that she was “in the mood”. I asked how much she drank, I didn’t want to come over if she was plastered, and she said she was fine, hadn’t had that much. I said okay and came over; she seemed totally fine when I got there, maybe a little tipsy but definitely totally aware of her surroundings. We had sex, I spent the night, and left for class in the morning. 
Later that day, she texted me asking me if she needed to get a pregnancy test, which freaked me out, especially since she knew that I was very careful about protection. I asked what she meant and she told me she didn’t remember anything for last night, which I thought was super weird. I didn’t really know what to say, so I just said I used protection. 

We kept hooking up for a few weeks after that, and actually started to get a little close. I even thought she might be catching feelings for me, but she had been very clear at the beginning that it would be very strictly casual so I thought better of it. We then left for thanksgiving break, during which I met someone I wanted to try dating with. We hadn’t talked all break, so after break I texted her that I had met someone so we couldn’t hook up anymore, and she told me she was actually also wanting to break things off. We ended things very amicably, or so I thought. 

Months later, it was January by this point, I noticed she was acting strange toward me, and I wasn’t really sure what happened. I just assumed she had developed feelings and was upset I didn’t reciprocate them, or perhaps she felt used, I wasn’t really sure. Eventually she texted me, saying she needed to talk. We met in a public place, and sat down across from one another.

She then told me she felt violated that night we had sex after she had drank, and that it had been causing her panic attacks for some time. This caught me very off-guard, as things seemed fine after that night and we kept having sex for almost a month after it, but I wanted to be sensitive to her emotions as this had clearly been causing her some anguish. I listened and was accepting of her, I told her I would be respectful of her and wouldn’t go out of my way to make things uncomfortable for her, and I also told her that she was the one to ask me to come over, and that I asked her if she was sober enough to consent, to which she’d said yes. I also told her that she seemed totally cognizant of everything, maybe just a little tipsy, so it seemed weird to me that she didn’t remember anything. She said she knew none of that, and that she thought blacked out because she has smoked pot for the first time that night, and that she still felt like I preyed upon her. 

The whole situation described above is very confusing to me. I’ve tried to be respectful of her and her feelings without admitting to something I don’t feel I’m guilty of. It doesn’t sit well with me that I’ve caused someone so much anguish, despite it being unintentional. 

I also don’t want to be the guy who questions the victims motives, but she has not always acted particularly rational in the after math. She has gone out of her way to be at places and events that she knows I will be at, only to start crying once she sees me.

I would like to hear some outside opinions about this, I know it’s long so if you read it all, thank you. I guess I am just wondering how at fault I am here. She has essentially me a sexual predator, and she has told me that she thinks I “clearly don’t know what consent is” and that I’m “clearly a bad guy”, none of which I think are fair things to say about me given the situation. I just want to hear some opinions. Thank you.",08May2020,1
837,"Hi reddit, 

I'll keep it short or try to. Lately since this pandemic started Ive been realizing lately idk if I wanna stay in my band that I've been with for 10+ years. Reasons are lately I realize driving 45+ minutes to practice just to have my band mates always talking over each other including me (and I have the quietest voice of them) I don't look forward to it anymore, I feel like the lowest of the totem pole with them lately. 

I love the music we play but not to the extent lately I feel that they do. They've been wanting to get together for a practice even though my gf and I aren't comfortable (because of the whole virus thing) and personally I'm lacking any excitement at the thought of playing again. They also keep texting me trying to make it happen no matter how many times I say I'm not comfortable and I'm almost certain they're talking behind my back for it. And the thing is I've never always felt like my opinion mattered when it came to things I'm knowledgeable on. Like marketing, music vids, etc. I've gone to school for it and I basically get shot down. Plus I realize I never contribute to getting merch because, well, I never feel I have a say. They've been wanting to tour and all that as well and I'm not feeling that either lately.


Plus I found out I'm going to be laid off soon and IDT they care.

841,"So, Coronavirus means that I can't live on my college campus anymore. I used to be able to manage well living in my dorm most of the year and only coming home to my mom's house for winter and summer break. It was also easier when I was allowed to leave to go to friends' houses and work and just generally not be around the house as much. But now, as I'm sure we are all dealing with, I literally don't leave the house. I can only leave if I'm going grocery shopping and even then I can't usually leave because sometimes he (her boyfriend) goes with her.

I don't want to get into the past because it bring up a lot of horrible memories. But basically, my mom knows her boyfriend assaulted me when I was 17 but she excused his behavior and now is only mad at me because she thinks I'm holding a grudge. So the current situation is that I'm not ever allowed to say anything she can perceive as negative about him, he basically starves me (whenever he cooks dinner he refuses to make any for me and to avoid panic attacks I don't leave my room to make my own food for fear of seeing him), and he controls everything around the house to the point that I'm afraid to use the bathroom in case I forget one of his many stupid house rules about putting the toilet seat down. Basically, I sit in my bedroom all day either waiting for when he goes to work at night (he works night shift) or for everyone to be asleep so that I can see my dogs, eat, or use the bathroom.

So here's the advice portion: I'm going to be living in an apartment starting in June. I'm really excited and can't wait to get out of this house. But with each passing day, my relationship with my mom gets worse and worse (basically because she keeps defending him and choosing him over me). I used to love my mom, she was my best friend, but ever since that incident my resentment towards her has grown and grown. I want to try to repair my relationship with her, because I know she will never be out of my life even when I move out and that I'll sometimes have to come back home for random things. How do I approach this topic with her? How do I go about repairing our relationship? Because like I mentioned before, it is so hard to bring up anything having to do with her boyfriend or the incident a few years ago because she gets mad at me for ""holding a grudge"" and shuts down. She's not amenable to any kind of open discussion at all.

842,"I love my dad and he's always been there for me. He is usually a stoic and level headed person. He sometimes loses his cool but only when it's warranted. I believe he is an intelligent and logical person but he also has a sort of conspiracy theorist side to him. He loves the show ancient aliens and is way into lizards controlling the government and all that jazz along with my stepmom. 

In wake of the COVID - 19 things have really hit him hard. Right now is his busy season for work and he will often pull back to back 3am days! This has never been good to him as he always seems drained by the time summer rolls around. But in this case, he seems to have almost shut down, now my father is definitely a person who would look at you and seem like he's listening but not retain a word you said. But its since gotten worse. I went down to the kitchen to grab a drink of water late at night and caught him very drunk and listening to music with headphones in. I said hi to him and at almost screaming volume said "" SUP OP"" and startled me. I told him to be quiet as it was 2'o clock and he just whispered to himself about headphones. I though this was odd because he is normally not a drinker, I mean a lot before I was born, but now he seemed to pick the habit up all of a sudden. The next day he seemed out of it, I assumed from a hangover at the time but it wasn't like he looked bad. It was just is unawareness but times 10. His answers to everything were ""oh yeah,"" and ""aa alright okay.""

This has only gotten worse, he's now been walking around the house laughing and talking about how Trump is our savior, note never been a real Trump fan before. And I think I found out what his headphones was about because today he had a weird comment. My stepmom and I were cooking lunch just a few minutes ago and he said ""Y know I'm gonna be honest with you, the world might be better with all the stuff going on,"" and my stepmom said something about a conspiracy about the Queen of England and her secret cult and he says ""no no, I have an idea so groundbreaking it will change the world!"" he is really giddy and almost looks high right now. My stepmom and I look at each other and are just confused. ""I have a plan to utilize hip hop and rap music for good,"" i shit you not full seriousness behind his eyes. Now my stepmom and I know he's really lost his mind. and are trying to get him to eat and he just sits down and sort of half eats half sits there with a blank stare. I'm adding this up and I'm starting to connect the times he would come into my room, not uncommon, and say nothing at all and stand there puzzled. I would ask him how he's doing and he'd say he's fine and leave, almost like he walked into a room and forgot what he was doing. He also called my grandma the other day and I could tell she was uneasy, he kept asking her if she had neighbors that were checking on her, which I'm sure she does, even though she is often the lady care taking other people in her community. Overall he just seems out of it and not present, I did some research and I found that he might be acting very manic depressant. I'm really just scared for him my stepmom and my half sister as they don't have their Mom's house to escape to if things get worse. I'm of course happy to sort of get away from him but at the say time I don't want to leave my stepmom and my half sister with him alone. I hope he gets better and I'm just asking for advice on how to act here, should I be more confrontational and try to find him help, or should I stay passive and hope he fixes himself as the medical system is sort of in shambles right now.

847,"Let me explain, it’s a bit long so I’ll leave a TL;DR at the bottom. 
  My mom lives in a really small village community ( less than 150 people live up there) in the mountains that I’ll call Little Streams (Not the actual name). And every year, the community gathers money from charities that include animal funds, community projects, financial aid, and other smaller things. One of the charities is a grant to financially troubled college students to ease the money-burden of college.
  Which I think is really cool. But I’m not in need of a grant for tuition and book cost. You see, I don’t live with my mom. I live with my dad and he had been saving for my siblings and my college funds before we were born. We aren’t insanely rich but I will say that we are more stable than others. Because of our financial stability, I’m not in need of a grant from a small community like my mom’s. The community is as poor as it is already and I wouldn’t feel right taking money when I’m already blessed with everything I need to be reasonably comfortable in a college setting. 
  That’s the backstory, here’s what happened today and where I need advice. 
  My mother called me earlier today saying that nobody is taking the Little Streams College Grant their year and she really *wanted* me to apply for it. As I’ve explained before, I’m not in need of financial aid from this grant. So I respectfully declined and explained my reasoning. Mom continues to press the subject, saying that anything would help you and you can do whatever you want with the money. To which I responded,” I don’t need the grant. If I did win the grant and I could use it however I wanted, I would have given it back to the Little Streams community charity to help others. My mother then said these exact words. “Don’t give it to charity! Give it to me! I need it more than the charity!” 
  Which boggled my mind. It’s true that my mom is in need of some money, but most of her income comes from my father’s support. From which she spent most of it on cigarettes, the necessities like groceries and rent then whatever she has let she saves to gamble later. (She told me so). Otherwise, she doesn’t work. She’s a very manipulative person as is known the guilt trip people into her desires. Especially to make people feel like major crap if she feels wronged in any way. 
  Back to the conservation between my mother and me. I didn’t say anything about her greed but I told her on my reluctance to take money that I don’t need. She then said that she would get the applications for my brother and I so we could win the grants. 

Should I apply for the grant and keep the money for my next semester? I really don’t need the money and there are other students who need it more than I do. 
  Or should I give in to my mother and give her the $1000 of my grant?
Another option is to not apply for the grant and take the few weeks or more of mental and emotional stress from my mother will she finds out that I didn’t apply. 

TL;DR: Mom wants me to apply for a college grant that I don’t need. She said that if I don’t need it, to give the $1000 to her.",08May2020,1

So the current situation is that I'm not ever allowed to say anything she can perceive as negative about him, he basically starves me (whenever he cooks dinner he refuses to make any for me and to avoid panic attacks I don't leave my room to make my own food for fear of seeing him), and he controls everything around the house to the point that I'm afraid to use the bathroom in case I forget one of his many stupid house rules about putting the toilet seat down. Basically, I sit in my bedroom all day either waiting for when he goes to work at night or for everyone to be asleep so that I can see my dogs, eat, or use the bathroom.

So here's the advice portion: I'm going to be living in an apartment in the next month. I'm really excited and can't wait to get out of this house. But with each passing day, my relationship with my mom gets worse and worse (basically because she keeps defending him and choosing him over me). I used to love my mom, she was my best friend, but ever since that incident my resentment towards her has grown and grown. I want to try to repair my relationship with her, because I know she will never be out of my life even when I move out and that I'll sometimes have to come back home for random things. How do I approach this topic with her? How do I go about repairing our relationship? Because like I mentioned before, it is so hard to bring up anything having to do with her boyfriend or the incident a few years ago because she gets mad at me for ""holding a grudge"" and shuts down. She's not amenable to any kind of open discussion at all. So yeah, TL;DR how do I ask my mom to start working on our relationship that has only suffered after she made excuses for the man who assaulted me?",08May2020,1
851,"So I your basic guy [22m] and I had two serious relationships before one lasted 14 months and other ended in 4 months so I'm not really very experienced on that field and I'm not really attractive I'll say that I'm a solid 3.7/10 
So the deal is when I started college I wasted one year and changed schools and in the first year of second one I met a girl [21] I always prefer to stay alone in my school since elementary but she asked for a lighter I gave it and turned away she caught my hand and shook it told her name and we slowly became friends. After a semester we were like best buddies and always hanging out together and over the course of 3 years I started to like her. From time to time we watch movies at her place and talk until morning (I live in a dorm) and last year I started to play with her hair and sometimes massage her shoulders,face and neck and it accelerated the process of me falling for her. Anyway I confessed to a friend before and we never talked again and I don't want to ruin this one as well and this is the last yeat of school so if I don't shoot my shot now I'll probably regret it forever.",08May2020,1

853,"Okay, so, I work in a restaurant and with the whole covid thing it’s been stressful, of course. But, there’s this one coworker that just came back after being furloughed last week who every time she works has just been complains nonstop about every little thing. I get it, the customers can be a bit difficult at times but if she’s even inconvenience in the slightest she gets all huffy and acts like they’re abusing her. I honestly can’t deal with the negativity all day and I will probably lose my mind. 

Yesterday, I ended up snapping at her because of it. Then she yelled at me asking me what my problem was so I told her “you’ve just been complaining all day and it’s really annoying.” And her response was “what have I been complaining about?” And I said “everything.” And then she accused me of being nasty to her all day when we had barely interacted but I think she was just picking up on my annoyance with her because I was just trying to tune her out and ignore it. So I apologized for it. And she said “no, you’re not sorry. I’ve had enough of your stuff.”

I’m scheduled with her again on Tuesday and I really don’t think I can handle it. If she’s oozing with negativity it’s obviously going to bother me. Also, I’m afraid she’s going to accuse me of being ‘nasty’ to her again when all I’m trying to is my job and get through the day.

854,"I'm a sophomore in high school who always wanted to attend a top college. For reference, here are some acronyms explained so to make this post make sense: EC-- extracurricular activity, HYPSM-- Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT.

Not to brag, but I have very, very good ECs, to the point that everybody I know expects me to get into HYPSM. Unfortunately, my grades don't match. I have no legitimate reason for it, just a lack of study skills. At the end of the last semester, I did some calculations, and figured that if I got a 4.0 every semester until senior year, I'd have a 3.6, enough to give me at least some chance at good schools, if not a big one. But due to corona, my plans were screwed up, and now, even if I get a 4.0 both semesters next year, I'll only have a 3.3 or 3.4 at most.

This means I have basically zero chances at a top school. The only thing I can do to really improve my chances is improve on my ECs further. But no matter what I do, my GPA will still make it really hard to get into a good school. And the fact is, the more I improve my ECs, the higher I'll raise people's expectations.

That's exactly what I'm afraid of-- people expect so much of me, and I'm afraid of letting them down and ruining their impression of me. And it doesn't help that I also really, really want to go to a good school.

And so I have absolutely no idea as to what to do. If I don't get into a top school, I'll be screwed. Everyone will be disappointed in me. But with my GPA, there's almost no chance I'll get in. What to do?",08May2020,1
855,"My(26) whole life my mother(43) has been a user of various substances, and at various intensities. I've seen her in all sorts of situations that you should never see your mother in. I watched one of her ex boyfriends overdose on heroine, while she was crawling around on the floor and falling asleep midsentence. But I don't know of any time where she's taken it too far for herself where her life was in danger. I don't know how she's gotten so lucky.


I've not lived with her in years, so it's hard for me to know what she's currently getting herself into. My younger sister(16) spends 50% of her time with our mother and the other half with her father. Luckily, she hasn't had to see our mother's worst drug episodes, just maybe drunk or high on pot. 


A few a days ago my sister drove over to our mother's house on a day she normally would be at her dad's. Mom was already at work but was of course totally fine with her coming over. My sister found what we're guessing is cocaine, a small straw and an old gift card for cutting it up in our mom's bathroom. She called me right away and sent pictures.


Now I'm not sure how to handle this. I told her not to say anything to mom about finding it. I said this because I'd rather know what my mother is up to versus her hiding her substances better. Now thinking on it I'm not sure thats the right move. Do I say something to my mother? I mean the woman is God damn 43, I doubt she'd change now. We've been at way lower points in her addiction and nothing stopped her then. I just don't want something drastic to happen again in front of my sister. Her Dad's house is barely better than her mom's. I just don't know the right move here.

856,"Let’s call this friend Bob.

All throughout elementary school starting in kindergarten Bob and I were extremely close friends. Spending every group activity time together, lunch break together, and playing at eachothers houses on weekends. Being both pretty strange and out casted from our classmates we really depended on each other and kept each other happy.

At the end of seventh grade, before we all we’re supposed to start high school he moved away. It was a really tough time for both of us and another friend in our small group. For the first year or two we stayed in contact every day through Facebook and it seem to be going well. And then schoolwork took over and we drifted apart.

Fast forward to the last year of high school, I’m walking through the hallways focussed on getting my crap and finding my next class when I nearly ran into the lockers. I could’ve sworn I briefly saw Bob from the corner of my eyes. I continued to go talk to a friend of mine without really much thought because he was in another province right? Well… When lunchtime rolled around I was shocked to see Bob waiting for me. Apparently he had been back for a couple weeks and was waiting to see if anyone noticed him. He had managed to make a few new friends but was extremely happy to finally see me again in person. We tried to talk as much as we could throughout the week to catch up on everything. Unfortunately after a little over a month his mother had them move away once again.

Fast forward again to around 2018. A couple years after the last time we saw each other. He had popped up again on social media and we tried to talk a little but it didn’t seem the same. He was still using texting lingo and posting nice guy/I am so depressed pictures on Facebook. I had grown so much in those couple years because of a lot of medical issues and the only other friends in my circle we’re getting ready for college so it was weird to see someone acting the same as they were when they were 13.

At the end of the summer we have a small  festival with rides and games. I guess Bob wanted to visit family down here so he found a ride. He asked around and found out where my family had moved to and surprised us with a visit. My mom was really happy. At this point we were both around 18, but I felt like there was such a giant gap that came between us.

Now, just a couple days ago guess what? Yep Bob popped up again after a couple years... I should mention that Bob has a bad habit of forgetting his accounts and making new ones, so at this point from what I can tell this is his fifth account. I’ve tried looking at the things he is interested in hand it’s all very Edgy/emo/I’m so sad/love me so really nothing has changed, almost nothing in common anymore and I’ve only recently started feeling better and getting over a depressing time in my life.

I’ve never left a friend behind before, I’m someone who never wants to give up on someone but at this point I’m not sure if I can handle him anymore. I hate myself for saying it but I’m not ready to take on someone else’s problems all over again like every single time he pops up. I really miss how we used to be, I just want to go back to how it was when we were little but if you can’t change and grow as a person I feel like I just can’t. I don’t want to leave him behind because I know he’s struggling really badly…

he is five years older than me, and when I was younger I had no reason to be untrusting or afraid of him, and when he first started abusing me, I trusted him and didn't say a word bc he told me this was a way to show love. I don't remember much, but this happened dozens of times during the years, and only stopped after I got fed up with him one time and when he tried to touch me inappropriately once again, I begun running after him with a knife I had put under my pillow. of course, he'd do these things when both of out parents weren't home so no one intervened. 
after that, we didn't really speak to each other for years, unless it was absolutely necessary or to criticize the other. lately however, I have begun seriously working on my mental health (since I now have ended up with bpd and psychosis bc of my trauma) and have started talking to my brother again. he seems decent enough, even tho we've just been talking about games and stuff like that since we're both fans of the elder scrolls series, so I don't know anything about his feelings, or if he may have trauma himself, he's almost like a stranger I'm meeting for the first time.

865,"Hi all,

Been with my boyfriend for a couple of months now; recently he moved in with one of his friends into a new apartment (we both are long distance ourselves). 

Prior to moving into the apartment, he had quite a demanding job &amp; therefore didn't hang out with friends as often as usual, however now that he's living with his close friend I found out he smokes weed with him a few times a week - so afaik it's more of a recreational/social habit, rather than a solo one.

For whatever reason, I've felt weird since finding out. For myself personally, I've never taken drugs (that aren't prescribed ones from the doctor.) and I'm generally just a reserved, nerd in general who's never I guess, dealt with that world of things. I've never been clubbing or been to parties to experience that kind of thing, I don't understand much drug terminology, I don't know what it's like to get high, all I know is what's been depicted in movies and stuff. 

Whenever he tells me he's going for a bit (if we're on call), to go smoke, I get this weird, anxious, fear in the pit of my stomach. I don't know why. If i'm okay with people having a drink with friends, or having a smoke with friends, then why am I not okay with this - or feel weird when he says that. I feel l'm upsetting myself, by not knowing why I'm reacting this way. It's not like I dislike the idea of smoking weed - I just, have no idea why I feel this way. Is this weird/strange? Should I just accept that this is his hobby, despite the weird fear I have?",08May2020,1

Since then we have texted each other pretty regularly and video chatted a few times. I am unsure where I stand with him though as I seem to get mixed signals. At times, he and I will have an easy-flowing text conversation back and forth. He compliments me a lot, uses a lot of emojis, and sometimes says cheeky remarks. I am unsure if he is flirting with me or if I am reading too far into our interactions? Can anyone explain how they know for sure that someone is flirting with them through text? But then there are also times where he does not respond to my text message for a few days and just seems distant. He did confess to me that he is going through a hard time right now, so that could be a part of the reasoning behind his actions. I am a bit concerned for him, but since we recently became friends I don’t wish to overstep my boundaries or come off as a hindrance.

Due to his mixed signals, I just don’t know how to act towards him. How do I know if he thinks of me as a friend or more? Is there a sure fire way to know either way (without asking him because I do not feel comfortable doing that right now).

870,"Hi!

I need advice because I think I am losing my life because of money.

I am 22 male. Since 19 I was working in 6 companies. Mostly doing customer service. Two years ago I took a debt to run my own wedding video production company. After that I took few more debts for stupid things like car, life etc. Now everything what I am earning means nothing because I have to pay debt, so I don't have any savings.

After one year of filming weddings I earned about 1/5 of my debt, but now I don't know if I want to do it more. 

Apart from that I am learning programming. Why?

**I do not know what to do in my life!**

Because of debt and no savings I dream about safe work with nice payment. 

Also I dream about running my own company and be independent. Something like digital nomad. 

Since I am 13 my biggest dream was to make youtube videos. But I think I am not good for that. I am not confident. I always wanted to be like Marques Brownlee or Mckinnon - my own producing warehouse and creating something with somebody else.

Because I have few targets in my life I am changing my hobby and target every day. One day I can learn programming and create something nice, other day I think I am losing my life and I change my hobby to filming or dreaming about something else.

I can't do just one thing in my life, I can't set just one goal in my life.

I think everything is because of money. I am doing everything what will give me most money as fast as it is possible.

Everyone laughed at it for a week before forgetting about it. I was embarrassed by it, before laughing it off and then forgetting about it.

873,"I (m) ended the friendship with my best friend (f) after the things got too toxic for us both. We were the best of friends because neither of us were attracted to each other which made it easier for us to open up to each other as there was no need to impress. We didn’t flirt or anything but we did have a good banter and rapport with each other. And we were always there for each other in time of need.

Things started to change a bit last year after she dumped her bf. She was still casually dating guys after that and I have been her wingman a few times when she needed one. I didn’t have any romantic inclination towards her. Our friendship was very good but the thing was she found every girl I found attractive to be ugly and then she’ll try to help me out with girls I had zero interest in. She also started to ask me to sit closer to her on sofa when we were at her place. It made me uncomfortable as I needed some space. One time she was drunk and she told me with a smile that she would fk me if I didn’t get a girlfriend soon. I showed disgust on my face and she quickly changed the topic and next day she told me she was too drunk to remember anything. 

I started to develop some feelings for her and I told her as we were always honest with each other and she was already in a LDR with a guy at the time. We were always honest with each other and told each other everything. She didn’t make a big deal out of it and we moved on. I felt relief and my feelings for her disappeared. She would send me pic of her and her new bf whenever she was back home and they were cute together. After the holiday we were back in Uni and she had broken up with her LDR and was talking to someone new. But she started to get jealous again. And one night her mood suddenly changed when I was talking to one of the girls I had befriended in Rowing club. I had huge my bestie and tell her that the other girl was just a friend from a club to make her cheer up again. And later that night she got me drunk and took advantage of me. She told me I started kissing her first but when I came to my senses I told her no and to stop 3 times and I also tried to put her down gently by making things awkward by telling her I don’t do ONS, how she was doing with the new guy and that I didn’t have condom on me so we should stop and just sleep. She had answers for these all and she showed me that that she was pill. She also hit me with “I love you. Be with me. Don’t worry about anything.” I didn’t know what to do. I wanted her to be happy so I slept with her. But it just felt so wrong. The next day I slept in because I didn’t know what to do as I felt like shit. She seemed to be okay and was smiling. Before I left to go back to mine I was stupid enough to ask her “Do you also regret last night”. She just hid her face under the duvet. 

And I leave for my home, felt sick, cried my eyes out. I felt like I had taken advantage of her.  Later on she messaged me saying she can’t think she can be friends with me anymore and I ask her out of desperation as I still wanted her in my life (and I thought that she liked me more than a friend because of what she did and told me the night before). She rejected me and said we should just be friends. She does this 2 more times before wishing me well and saying we can’t be friends anymore. She then blocked me. I understood why she blocked me but I was very depressed and lost appetite for a few days. I lost around 9lbs in a single week. Her friend messaged me and called me saying that she wants to talk with me. I didn’t do anything as I was just starting to feel a bit better. But then she called me herself and we met up. She was drunk and she kept checking me out and flirting while saying she wants to see my room and bed. I took her back home and the next day I asked her out as I realised I still had some feelings for her. She said no as she doesn’t do well in relationship and she doesn’t want to hurt me. She also told me that I should go and see other girls. She also asked me to never talk about what happened between us. I was happy as I really liked more like a friend. I asked her to give me some space for a few days as I still had some feelings for her and I didn’t want to be around her when I had those feelings as that would just mess up our friendship and she deserved a friend not some dude waiting for his chance with her. She agreed but 2 days later she blocked me again after she told me I was being weird for not being to get over her. She messaged a few days later and we made up as I was over her. I really wanted to apologise to her about my behaviour that night as I felt guilty every time I was with her. But then she tells me that she doesn’t regret what happened between us that night. I didn’t reply. I tried to set healthy boundaries but she won’t have any of it. She also started to get jealous and started playing love songs when it was just us. She tried to get me jealous a few times and it worked. Even though she was dancing with this guy she would just make an intense eye contact with me every 4-5 mins and followed me everywhere with this guy. I basically ruined the night and I shouldn’t have done what I’ve done. I told her that I liked her and I wanted to be with but she just said that she doesn’t think of me in that way and I should move on. I tried to apologise to her about my behaviour because just because I was drunk and jealous doesn’t mean I should have acted that way. 

When we met again I tried to apologise to her but she blamed everything on me, saying I was jealous and ruined everything. And she also told me that I took advantage of her that night and have been taking advantage of her friendship. And told me that she didn’t want to reconnect after what happened between us but her friends told her give me another chance. I could not take it anymore because when she told me that I took advantage of her the guilt I was carrying got firmly established. The next day, I apologised to her about my behaviour and taking advantage of her trust. I ended the friendship because I was hurting her too much. She then blocked me, even my phone as I texted her to say I had left her notepad at the reception. Around 2 week or so, I see her in house party. I avoid her at all cost. Later on I get told by her friends that she got thrown out by host after punching host’s friend. I was drunk and stupid so I txted her. It went through and she was basically accusing me not giving shit about her as I had not reached out to her for almost a fortnight and I can’t talk to her whenever I wanted. She also told me that I had a lovely week and I was having a blast as I was talking and dancing with some girls. And she also told me she was self-harming. I tried to stop her but it was no use. Went to her place but she won’t let me in. I kept in touch with her for a few more days to make sure she was doing okay but all I got was stop talking to me and I completely stopped talking to her after I found out from a mutual friend that she was doing okay. I also stopped because it was just cruel to keep talking to her after ending the friendship with her. I know I shouldn’t have txted her.

That was almost 2 months ago. I have since changed my phone no and she has too much of pride to unblock someone and talk to them  eg. Her friends and exes(or so I thought but she always unblocked and contacted me). I was very anxious as I thought that she might contact me but after a month I moved on and was feeling better as she didn’t contact me and I was still blocked. I lost my phone so I had to get a new one and I also got the opportunity to get a new phone number. She dmed me on 1 May the Friday night asking how I was doing and that she had sent me messages and she was waiting for my reply. I didn’t reply to her message took me by complete surprise. She has also friended me on FB and added me on Snap. I was thinking of what to do but one of our mutual friend messaged me asking how I was the very next day. So I blocked them both. But I have no idea what to do as I really want to message her and ask how she is. I also seem to really care about her and want to give her another chance but I feel like we’ll end up like this again. And I’ll see her again because we are both go to same uni and study same course. I have no idea what to do as I’m really really want to reply to her as I want to know why she is reaching out after so long. But I know that if I reply to her we’ll just go back to being friends again or something. And I’m like 60% sure the history will repeat again. I don’t want to hurt her and I don’t want to hurt me. 

I’m curious about why she messaged me after blocking me for 7weeks and if should give our friendship another go? After we slept together it only took 1 month for things to turn this ugly. I stuck with her for that 1 month because we were both confused and I thought some time and honest talk would heal us as we had been good, supportive friends for 2 years. We could talk to each other about everything and be honest and express ourselves as we never judged each other and had accepted each other’s strength and flaws. We always listened to understand the other person and we have never had any argument before as we both respected each other’s point of view. We were supportive of each other and always motivated the other one do well.  I didn’t want to end it just because we were having a shit week which turned into a month. Thought we could go back to being friends like before again but it got messed up even more so I ended the friendship after enduring it for a month. I really miss our times before things went and I guess I’m hoping we could go back to it again. I know it’s a wishful thinking.   

Damn, wish I could write this many words in my assignment without any problem. Sorry for any grammatical and spelling error.

TLDR; Had to end friendship with a good friend after catching feelings and playing games ruined our friendship and made it toxic in a month. She has unblocked me and reached out to me so I don’t know what to do? Have questions like why did she unblock and message me after almost blocking me for 2 months and if should respond back to her even at the risk of being friends again (and going through with this again)

875,"I have a friend who is a misanthrope(possibly he kinda admits it but he says he likes some people so idk) , talking to him was weird at first because he didn't trust me at all. The fact that he was Suicidal and depressed made me want to come closer and to try to help him to get out of that "" I want to die"" mentality
***
I've been dealing with depression for years, with three suicidal attempts. Now I'm better and I came to this state all by myself.
***
I saw him as the earlier me, an insecure person scared of this world , depressed and Suicidal. 
***
To prove that I am 'me' I took a verification picture of myself and I proved him that I'm real. Plus I also did some other stuff like writing handwritten notes with his name and then signing it by my name. He trusted me eventually and we got real close( I don't think he had ever been that close to someone nor have I) it's not just by the things we shared also by the *bond* that was felt. The bond was stronger than what we shared , if it makes sense.
***
He left from all his social media platforms two months ago, came after a month and told me that he didn't think that I truly cared about him. I was heartbroken cauz I thought it was very unnatural of him not to come online at all. After about 28 days I lost all the hopes and thought that something might have happened to him because of Corona, but yeah I was so.much happy that he's okay and safe. He is gone again ( 22 days passed)

876,"A lot to unpack here.

First off, I'm trans. My mother does NOT know this, but everyone else in my twitter-circle and life in general does and is completely supportive and accepting. But because my mother follows me, I can't post openly about my experiences or reference it or anything, which I have found myself wanting to do but holding back purely because of my mother.

Logical solution? Come out to my mother. Great! I wrote a letter and had planned to give it to her next week. But today as we were talking, our conversation turned political (which **rarely** comes up in our family but has a lot more with the whole virus thing) and I learned officially that my mom voted for and *still supports* Trump. Kind of a lot to process here, but now I really don't feel comfortable exposing myself to her knowing that she supports someone who is openly sexist, racist, and transphobic. 

One possible solution would be to get a private twitter under an alias, but that really ruins the point of twitter for me, as I use it to connect with other composers and people at school and I follow a lot of people/have a decent number of followers already, plus I'm rather attached to my username as I use it for everything (except this so don't bother).

I saw an article talking about the ""soft block"" where you block them and then immediately unblock them which forces them to unfollow you. Which might work for a little while, but my mom only follows 16 people so she's likely to notice and re-follow - it may bring up questions down the road.

I could *fully* block her but again, possible issues down the road, she's bound to notice. 

What should I do? Please note that coming out to her is **not** an option right now.",08May2020,1

878,"Hows it going, I am currently in a dilemma with my father and neighbors. 

My father feeds the neighborhood cats in front of our coop complex at night time every night. Yesterday a neighbor that lives in the area came and knocked on our door around 12am and asked if I was the one that was leaving the cat food outside. I said it was my father and he said that he put food by his window and that he is really upset because the cats all go there. I apologized and told him I would talk to my father. As he was leaving the building he walked over to the cat food and put some kind of white powder all over the food. I couldn't really tell what it was but my guess is either some kind of kitchen cleaner or flour. After that he sort of just stood across the street staring and waiting for my father to return walking the dog. So I went outside this time because he was just standing right in front and I asked him to show me where the cat food was placed. We walked a few hundred feet behind the building to where he lived and I noticed my fathers trays with cat food and powder all over it. It does look like my father went out of his way to place them by where the kittens were staying and it just so happened to be right by his window. The guy said he doesn't like cats and that they pee and poop in that area and it smells bad. I apologized to him and cleaned up the trays. 

The next day my father said he called the police to make a report and he was trying to poison the cats. Is he wrong here? I told him that he was wrong for putting the food by his window but then he told me that its a public area. 

Can i just hear some of your thoughts on the situation?

882," 

The universe throws distractions at us to keep us from our goals. It is our purpose to filter out these distractions so they do not slow us down or keep us from realizing our potential. Netflix is a distraction. Video games are a distraction. Women are a distraction. Mindlessly scrolling Facebook is a distraction. All of these distractions combined rob us blind of time. Precious time. Time is the most precious finite thing for humans on Earth. How we spend our time is everything. 

So what do we spend our time on? Growth. Little comfort. Growth and comfort are inversely proportional. They are opposites. Spend too much time in the comfort zone there is little to no growth. Spend too much time growing, there will be very little comfort. Neither of these cases are sustainable, although they are possible. 

What is growth? Every person has their own measures of growth. We all-if we’re honest with ourselves-know where we want to grow. We can grow mentally, emotionally, spiritually, physically, and artistically. Growth is progress. Growth is improvement. Growth is the action and process of self-actualization. To become the archetype of ourselves--the ultimate version of ourselves. What is the ultimate version of yourself? What is the ultimate version of myself? What would that person look like, dress like, talk like, and work like? What is this persons hobbies? We have the answers. We already know. But the distractions rob us of becoming our archetype. 

How do I grow? You grow by making changes and taking actions one small change and one small action at a time everyday. And to be consistent and unwavering in those changes. Once made, make every effort to not relapse. It’s okay if one is struggling to permanently end or break bad habits. Best way to do this is cease the one bad habit and begin a new healthier productive habit of growth. Enough of the small doable and manageable changes eventually lead to a massive change. Enough small actions taken towards growth eventually lead to some massive growth. 

The unknown is scary, what if I don’t succeed?

GOOD. DON’T SUCCEED. YOU LIKELY WILL NOT SUCCEED FOR MANY ATTEMPTS. ACCEPT THIS. EMBRACE THIS. UNDERSTAND THIS. THERE IS ONLY SUCCESS THROUGH FAILURE. This is true in the universe. This is true of Michael Jordan. Of Dwayne Johnson. Failure is something to accept and embrace and not to be feared. The fear comes from the scrutiny of our peers and our peers will be sure to let us live up to our failures.",08May2020,1

One of my best friends this year, we will call her K, we haven’t talked in a while during quarantine, and it kind of sounds to me like she doesn’t want to be my friend anymore.


I’m a big over thinker, so stop me if I am. 
I texted K yesterday and was like, “Omg this girl is annoying me sm.” And it took her a really long time to text me back, like a good three hours. And the other day I noticed that she was commenting on this girl’s Instagram post talking about “squad” I really don’t care that she’s made friends, I’m happy for her, because we both left a friend group and it was hard for both of us. 

Everyone in this friend group is kind of so called “popular” I am acquaintances with most of the girls but I’ve developed being kind of shy this year, which I guess is kind of because of how insecure I’ve become.

Yesterday I texted her and said, “Hey, do you wanna call tomorrow?” No response, that was 6:45 ish yesterday. So I decided that I would call her today, she didn’t answer, and then texted me, 
K:”hey I can’t talk I’m in the car going to red rocks” 
Me:Its ok I just wanted to say hi, you don’t have to call back.
K:Ok thank uuu sorry.

• I used to think watching marvel movies is a personality.
• Whenever a celebrity likes or replies to my tweet, I used to boast about it on my Facebook and Instagram.
• I used to tag people like, more than 50 people for likes on facebook who are not even in the picture.
• I used to gatekeep.
• I used to post nothing but stuff about marvel movies and celebrities I like thinking that would make me more likeable. 
• Since I rarely post about myself on my instagram or facebook, my friends started unfollowing me and I used to wine about it like a bitch.

So, when I was 19 years old, I thought every one of my followers hates me and I decided to delete it.

Today I was at the shop, we had to queue outside because of lockdown. I cycled there. My dad walked, so when my dad arrived at the shop, I was around half way down the queue. Because I had my bike, I decided to stay outside and let my dad go in the shop instead. Because of this, a guy at the back of the queue started mouthing off because my dad jumped the queue (in his eyes). He was drunk and being aggressive. The town we live in is very quaint, wealthy and highly regarded, he clearly wasn’t from here. Because he started mouthing off at my dad, I quickly came off my bike and started approaching him. He put his hands in his pockets and stood facing me in a sort of power stance. I wanted to smash his face. Before I could approach him, my dad and another man in the queue stopped me going any further and told me that he is a known drunk and has caused problems before and that if I attack him it will be me that gets arrested. 

After, when my dad and I were walking home (I walked with the bike), the man in question was walking behind us. There was no one around us at the point, I suggested that we let him walk by us, so he did, he didn’t say a word, had his head down and walked right by us. He walked alone in to the woods with beers and wine in his shopping bag. I still wanted to smash his face. 

That’s the whole situation. Looking back, I wish I had found humour in the situation and hadn’t reacted like I did, I usually don’t get wound up like that when I’m on my own but it was different because it was my dad that was getting it. 

I felt completely weak when I walked away from him, although I knew it was probably the right thing to do. I feel like all the people in the queue deep down know that he got the upper hand. He got away with hurling abuse at my dad and I didn’t do anything about it.

I’ve been looking for a decent job to replace it since about the first week I worked there but haven’t found anything equal or better in terms of salary. 

That brings us to earlier this week. On Sunday night I couldnt get to sleep (insomnia and tinnitus are not a fun combo) and called off from work. The manager in charge really didnt like that but I was looking for coverage and felt like I really couldn’t contribute if I came in. after sleeping for an hour or two Monday morning, I still couldn’t sleep Monday night and didnt get any sleep at all. I let work know that again I won’t make it in and they really dont like that, obviously, and they ended up suspended me for the rest of the week. I can understand why they did that and wasn’t mad at them, per se, but I was certainly fed up and just wanted to quit and never look back. I signed up for door dash and became way less picky looking for jobs. I set up interviews for next week when I should be back to work because in my head I was never coming back so it doesn’t matter. 

Then later today a phone call comes from work and the manager in charge is very apologetic and says she acted hastily in suspending me. I got nervous and I really wanted to tell her I quit and that I’m putting in my two weeks but I just listened to her and said it was ok and that it was my mistake for not finding coverage ahead of time. They expect me to come to work Monday morning, but I have multiple interviews during that time. Now I am thinking about emailing them that I put in my two weeks and to just thank them for having me but I feel bad now if I disappoint them. Maybe I should put in my two weeks then skip Monday morning. Or maybe I should just not show up at all and just go to my interview and never look back. I only worked here for a few months and have the same experience at the other branch that I feel secure about putting on my resume.

Hello everyone,

So this is a bit of a long story so I'm sorry in advance and it's taken some time for me to write this so its coherent.

I'll start from the beginning, so, about 4 years ago I was two months from finishing my degree with honours and I had been with my girlfriend for 7 years. I'd been saving up and my plan was to move to her and propose once it was all over. So, I booked to go look at some rings as a little private viewing. The day comes and I get a call from her while I'm at the station waiting for the train to go to the city to look at the rings, long story short, she left me and gave me a multitude of reasons why. I asked if we could talk about things and she said no she just wanted it to end. I was distraught for obvious reasons and the reasons why didn't make any sense to me, things like she was hurt that I never visited her at Uni even though she knew I was doing my degree I worked everyday with two jobs. So, I had to cancel the viewing and she blocked me on everything. A few days later I'd found out that she had been texting someone else. At the time my family was really supportive but I was struggling to write my dissertation, sleep and keep up with my full time job. Another week passed and I got a message from her say that she regretted what she did and that It was a mistake, I now see that it was a mistake to have taken her back but I was miserable, especially as by this point work had called me up on my lack of concentration and I was moments away from not being able to finish my dissertation. We talked for a couple of days and she said she just needed some time alone, I said ok, but this lasted about 4 months of us maybe talking once a week for 10 minutes. One day I just couldn't take it and I told her that it wasn't fair and frankly it was killing me, an hour later she'd blocked me again and I've not heard from her or about her. 

Anyway, enough of the back story, since then I've gone on to saving for a home by myself, I have my Masters Degree and a job I love and I've made some friends that I wouldn't trade for the world. Despite all the things I've managed to do, life just isn't satiating. For about 3 years now I've been having regular nightmares about my ex, this has caused me to have strong bouts of anxiety and depression. Recently I've been trying to get back on the horse to find someone again as I feel that finding a connection again might help me feel whole again. I've been on a couple of dates, one with a girl I visit on my rounds at work and another through a friend, they were both really lovely but I left feeling miserable and what I could only describe as guilty, the whole date I felt like I needed to escape and I felt bad for leading them like that.

I've steadily been feeling worse and I know the current climate of not being able to leave the house is making it worse but I've always been in the mind set that things will get better, but that changed about a week ago. I was finishing my remote work for the day and all of a sudden I started getting heart palpitations, at the time I just assumed it was because I was a heavy coffee drinker due to my poor sleep. But after about 3-4 seconds it wasn't going away and I began to feel a tingling feeling down my body, I stood up and went to get my phone and I couldn't talk or breath, I went across my hall way as fast as a could to try get someone, by this point it's still happening and I'm feeling dizzy, but all of a sudden it went away. Once I'd relaxed and calmed down I called the doctors and they said It was probably due to my caffeine intake and that I was to stop immediately. Moving closer to the present now, yesterday It happened again, this time for about 5 seconds, I called the doctors and they had someone come out and visit me. My blood pressure was very high and they asked me about my diet, exercise, wellbeing and sleep, told them and they said it was most likely due to anxiety and lack of sleep.

Right now I'm really getting to stage where I don't know what to do, I can't and don't want to sleep at night, when I do I'm being haunted, when I'm awake I feel sad and guilty and it's now literally killing me... I know that time heals all wounds but it's been years now and I'm suffering everyday. The doctors didn't want to prescribe me anything because I'm young (26) and due to demand and the pandemic I can't see anyone about it but they'd try get someone to contact me. I just don't know what to do, I just want to feel happy again.",08May2020,1

906,"So, I have never really liked my face a body. But I've come to terms with the fact I can't change it and just started ingnoring it. But recently my new friends of only a few months (cause I moved across the country) don't seem to object when I say I'm fugly, stupid, inscure, etc. All my old friends would always say 'That's not true' or 'You're beautiful!' and stuff. But my new friends just kinda look at me and keep going with the conversation. It's been making me feel bad about myself because I always compliment them, but they never seem to say anything nice about my looks back.

I always get told ‘looking young is great’ and ‘you’ll miss it when you’re older’ but now is now and it’s killing me socially. I haven’t had a girlfriend in forever as what adult wants to go out with “a kid”, going drinking (pre-COVID obviously) is awkward as I’m always ID’d, never really taking seriously in the workplace etc etc. I feel like my body just stopped developing after turning 16 and I’ve just been stuck in that body ever since.

Today is me and my boyfriend's second anniversary and he had the idea to set up a projector outside on the side of his house and have us sit over 6 feet apart to watch a movie (with masks on). We haven't seen each other since the stay-at-home order in our state started in March, because we're trying to be super cautious about COVID-19. I am just wondering if this seems like a horrible idea or not. I am very torn about it because it seems like it would be safe, but then again you just never know.

912,"So, I will be turning 18 this july and it just suddenly it hit me. With the pandemic going on and schools being closed, I somehow forget that this is actually my last year of highschool and then I'll be experiencing a completely different world but I did absolutely nothing in highschool that ill look back at when I grow up  

my highschool life went by a blur and I didnt even realise. Growing up I've always read those typical y/a books and I went into hs expecting that kind of life yk? the amazing close friend groups, roadtrips, night talks etc etc but none of that happened? I do understand that most of the books were set is american highschools and there'll obviously be a huge cultural difference but it's just almost 18, never had a kiss, rarely get crushes on boys irl. it kind of makes me feel really sad. I always wanted to live in the moment, but am I really doing that? I dont think after graduating I'll have any extraordinary fun memories to look back at. I feel like your teenage years are a stage when you can actually be free without a lot of responsibilities but I just really wasted it. 

I just need a basic life advice, is it okay that I am feeling it way? is it okay that I wasted all of these years?

913,"My apartment is directly above the workshop for my apartment complex’s repairmen. Because of COVID-19, I’m working from home. Unfortunately I hear all the sounds coming from the shop with crystal clarity. I don’t mind the sounds of the occasional saw or conversation from the repairmen, but frequently throughout the day they have quite graphic, vulgar conversations. This, I do mind. Both because I’m worried about coworkers hearing these conversations when I’m on a call, and because it just makes me incredibly uncomfortable to hear about how, for example one of them “got this chick drunk and fucked the shit out of her” or using gay slurs and talking about sucking dick. I don’t feel like it’s unreasonable to expect to not be exposed to this kind of conversation all day every day, and it frankly makes me a bit anxious given I’m a young, single woman who lives alone and has a history with sexual assault. 

I’m not comfortable confronting a group of men alone about a subject like this (especially given what I’ve learned about their personalities), and I don’t want to get them in trouble for joking (I hope) around with each other (though I personally think it’s inappropriate workplace conversation regardless). I’ve considered sending an email to the property manager saying something like “It might be good to let the repairmen know that the details of all their conversations can be heard in the apartments above the workshop,” but that feels passive aggressive and would just lead to more questions which would likely eventually get them in trouble. While I know this is my anxiety talking and isn’t a reasonable fear, I’m also nervous about the potential personal repercussions from these workers if they were to get in trouble or find out how much their conversations carry. 

What do I do? Am I being unreasonable?",08May2020,1

So, I’m kinda in a tough spot and need advice or some reassurance. My cat has a growth in her ear. We do not know if it is cancerous. Tests and surgery are incredibly expensive- thousands. She is 11 years old. 

A little info on her condition:
She still has somewhat of an appetite, 
Sleeps all day and night, except when she’s hungry or has to use the bathroom
Goes pee on the floor rather than her litter box
Her pee is a dark brown color
Despite her eating, she is losing weight 

With everything going on with covid, I have lost my job and have very little savings. Stuck between surgery or putting her down. As much as I love her, I think it’s best we put her down- partner thinks otherwise. It’ll hurt for a little while, but at least she isn’t living in pain anymore. 
This is a tough position to be in, especially in a time when everyone is afraid to come in contact with one another- the animal hospitals are being huge assholes  right now and don’t seem to give a shit

Tinder/hinge are warping what little concepts I had of healthy dating to begin with. I’m hesitant to delete them because I will miss the (Maybe pretend) social connection, especially during isolation. I know I’m a tiny bit addicted, and I would be lying if “likes” don’t come with a little gratification. I think that goes for everyone. I have few IN PERSON friends, and it’s hard to meet people to date organically. I’m a little lonely, tbh. But, there are also some really cool history pages I follow.

918,"Before I took this class, she already had a reputation for being a hard marker and for failing a lot of people.

Every week, there are at least 4 hours worth of zoom meetings, 6 hours of textbook homework, and 2 types of assignments that could take up to 7-8 hours each, depending on how good you are at math.

More than half of the class has either given up or dropped out, before the pandemic started. 33 people originally signed up for this class, then it dropped to 17 and now after 2 months of corona, it seems like only 7 people are remaining. 

It’s too overwhelming and I’ve already submitted my last 2 assignments late or not completely done and my other classmates feel the same. I don’t want to drop this class as I have a 71 and am not failing.

920,"I live above a couple where the female has a daughter from a previous relationship, and is currently pregnant with the child of her current fiancé. I hate to be the nosy neighbour, but it's impossible when the vents carry voices, and I'm sure they've been witness to arguments between me and my boyfriend over the years.

I heard them argue a while ago after he got mad and shook her violently. I have a recording of some of their conversation, just in case. During their conversation, I found out that when he was 19 (10 years ago), he was charged with domestic violence. I heard they were making up, as these situations usually lead to. He said he'd never touch her daughter and will always be super nice to her, etc. I thought it might turn out okay.

Since then, the only bad thing I heard was that he raged at her daughter for crying hysterically in the middle of the night a while ago, I felt bad, since I had horrible nightmares as a kid and would be traumatised if my parents had ever gotten mad at me for it.

Finally, today, I heard a lot of crying and yelling and it turns out there had been a situation where he had her hands around her neck and she left. They were talking on the phone and I hoped she wouldn't come back, but she did. The shit he says is horrible and when you're not in the middle of it, it's so easy to see through his bullshit. But I understand why she wants to make it work so badly, especially being pregnant.

I feel like I have to say something to someone, but I also feel like I need to stay out of it. I have her first child's dad's girlfriend on Facebook somehow (I know basically no one in this town, so its a shock) and I don't know if I could hint to them to keep the daughter safe? After the first incident, I told my mum (a victim of D.V.) and she said to message the landlord. I know the police is an option, but I don't want to scare the girl into thinking she has to lie and stay. But I also have a feeling that none of this is my business. I understand how mortifying it would be, and how that could push them into a corner of staying. Also, I really don't want his rage to turn towards me. There's a door which I can't really be sure is ever locked between us and them, and god knows where he'd turn his anger if this got out (a big trigger for him is embarrassment or shame), as he could blame me for ruining his life.

My dad was saying because he saw I didnt do my work to do the simple stuff then projects and I agreed (2 days ago) but I was and still am stressed and I was ready to do it today but the last 2 days I didnt do anything and each time my dad walked in and asked hows it going I said fine. Now my mother looked at my progress for math like 30 minutes ago and saw nothing so my dad called his friend head of the board of ed I think and was complaining about how my teachers are stupid and other stuff like how the school system sucks. He does make some good points on actually problems and my sister started saying the problems her and her friends were experiencing. She done all her work.

Obvs I had bad self esteem and/or confidence issues that put me in this spot. I only have a few people I would consider ""friends,"" but even they haven't wished me a happy bday so that should tell you how close I am with them. I'm just extremely disappointed in myself to allow myself to hit rock bottom when I had so many years to change things up. I just feel completely hopeless and even if I thought change was possible, I keep telling myself its too late. WHo the hell would date me knowing I barely have any social life, no career atm etc. Part of me wants to close the chapter on my non-existent twenties and start fresh now, but the other part of me thinks in order to have a good 30s you first needed a good 20s.

923,"So my older Brother died a while ago. We weren’t the closest because he wasn’t very nice but his GF was really nice and I got along with her really well. She was in a car accident a while ago and Uses a wheelchair. And since my brother died she has been super depressed. She’s on a lot of medication and right now is in a lot of pain emotionally and usually physically. 

I visit her a lot because we get along well and he says I make her really happy whenever I come over. 

So I look a lot like my brother like almost a spitting image just younger. My brothers gf I’ll just call her Shannon from now on. Proposed something too me. 

She said that she loved going on dates with my Brother and he used to carry her sometimes o there dates so she didn’t have to use the wheelchair, she loved being carried and not using a wheelchair. 

So she asked me if I would go out with her a couple time’s. Sort of like dates but she didn’t want it to be like a relationship she just wanted me to fill in for my brother for a couple days to make her feel better since I looked like him. She said a week would do but if I couldn’t do it just a couple days. She begged. 

I agreed but the problem is that she would also want me to carry her. I understood her situation and felt really sorry for her so I do want to do it. The problem is she gained a bit of weight since she’s been stress eating. She was already a bit chubby because she couldn’t really exercise but now she was even heavier. Plus I’m 17 and she’s 22.

In response to this, she told me she has liked me for about 10 months (I dated my ex for 7 months). I really do like her and we’ve flirted a bit and i’m super confused about what I should do.

925,"Hello,

I'm a 22 M who recently moved to the US from Germany. 
As someone who lived in a country with above average public transportation, I never learned how to drive, and never saw the need to (I realize now how wrong I was)

I recently saved up enough money and I'm finally planning to buy my first car, I've had some practice and can drive myself around fairly easily without hurting anyone. I have a permit that allows me to drive as long as I'm in the car with someone who has a license.

But here is my problem, I have very few friends here, and none close enough to help me with this ordeal. I'd like to go buy a car but aside from not being able to drive alone, and having little experience to begin with. I have no experience whatsoever in buying a car. 

I did my own research on the proper steps for my state, but having no ride, and no one to depend on who can just sit in the car while I drive has made this whole process much harder. I'm not sure what I should try to do or how I could go about this. Any help would be great.. 

For what it's worth, I'm looking at used cars off Craigslist. 

TL;DR I want a car but have no friends or family to help me with my permit training or the process of buying one",08May2020,1

927,"Hello,

Firstly I'm french so sorry if there are some grammar errors or english errors in general.

So I'm \[20F\] a student and I live alone in my appartment. I'm on an exam periode so I wake up to study and I do this until like 6pm or 8pm. (I'm telling this because I don't really know if it's affecting my problem).

I notice that I'm feeling bad from time to time, I cry and have no clue why, I feel sad or not motivated at all. This happens a lot when I have to study for exams or do some school work. So when I go under thoses phases, or even just feeling bad in general (it happens for no reason in my everyday life too), I think a lot about death or suicide.

I know that I will never do the thing, but I just think about it a lot in a way of ""It could be so much easier if I would just be gone"", things like that. Sometimes I look at a building and I ask myself if I would die if I jumped from the top of it. I already thought of what would happen if I would jump on the road while cars are passing by for exemple.

But I know very well that I could never do something like that (thinking about my family, or things I actually want to do/achieve in my life, and quite simply for the happyness of living ).

So I think about thoses a lot, and I'm wondering if I need to go talk to a psychologist or if I can just continue to live my life like that. I have these thoughts for a while now, maybe since I'm 14 or near that age.

I was in a band for 4 years with friends I met at the end of highschool and I became very close to these guys over the years, I’ve been there for them through tough times and they’ve been there for me too, recently the band broke up and a couple of us started a side project. I was kicked out of the project because I was the singer and they wanted to sing instead. I’m now doing my own thing and the only thing left between the others and I is friendship.

They’ve always slightly disrespected me, one more than the other steals from me often in really sneaky ways, mostly weed booze and nicotine but I’ve had clothes stolen too among various other things ranging in value. I have never done anything to stop this because they manipulate me into a box, constantly trying to assert dominance over me and make sure they get the better end of every deal. There was a time when we parted ways for awhile and I started to flourish, but they pulled me back in. I’m a very peaceful and giving person by nature and usually it doesn’t bother me to share what I have with people close to me. But because of my nature I’m constantly taken advantage of. The worst part is that they’re envious of me and that’s why they feel entitled to my items and my personal power. I now have plans to move across the country with them and move into a house together. What kicked this all off was last night we drank, I got a little too shwasty and passed out in a bathtub for about an hour. When I awoke, my pack of cigarettes were gone, the alcohol I had brought over was hidden from me (not because they were worried I’d drink myself to death but because they wanted to drink it all themselves later, trust me, this happens every time) and the weed I had brought over (I only brought a pinch because I’m pretty sure they steal a few buds from me every time I leave it out) was gone from the bottom of my pocket. I value the friendship, which is why I tend to keep quiet and haven’t ever stopped this from happening. Please give me honest advice, god knows I need it.",08May2020,1

After that, I just can't work anymore. Even if i can't do my job this period, i still have a lot of projects on my own. And I just don't have the motivation to do anything.

Unless it involved other people, for the past 3 weeks i didn't work at all. I tried: using a to do list; dressing as i would go to my job; working with other people, so i would get my motivation back; working in an other room than my bedroom, and nothing works.

933,"Ok so basically, like 3 weeks ago, one of my closest friends met someone over Instagram through another friend I think. I say that because I’m not too sure how they met but that’s just my guess. My close friend (V) made a gc with me, her, her really close friend (I) and the new friend (S). He seemed alright at first, I didn’t really have a problem with him. Found him a little bit unfunny but humour is subjective so I can’t come at him for that. But my problem is, as a group, we’ve started using that Netflix party thing to watch movies together, and V will wait literal hours for S to come on.

Like, she posted on her story, “anyone wanna watch a movie” and I said, “yeah sure”. Then she said something like “ah ok cool what do you wanna watch?”. This happened at like, 2:00pm I think. We decided what we were gonna watch and then just before we were gonna set the room up, she said “ah ok, lemme just ask someone real quick”. I’m like, “Ite bet” and then like 10 minutes later she comes back with ah ok he won’t be long he’s just doing something”. I was already pretty certain it was gonna be S she was asking but I asked anyway, and she replied “my friend”. 

Then, after like 2 hours of talking, she comes back with, “ah S is on a bike ride and he found some shit” I’m like bitch what we’ve been talking for like 2 hours and S has gone on a fuckin bike ride?? But I didn’t say that because they’re obviously friends and he’s not really done anything against me so I just went along with it and we talked about that.

 So like 30 minutes of talking later, she says “ah he’s back now, we can watch in like 10 minutes”. I’m like “Ite bet” a full fuckin hour later, I say, “ah shit, I gotta do my workout now” and then she comes back with “oh (my name), why now”. Like tf you mean now I’ve been doing it around this time for like 2 fuckin weeks and I’ve told you about it multiple times before. But again, I didn’t say that because I couldn’t be asked tbh. So after the workout, I finish having my shower, text V like “ah I’m done, you ready to watch the movie?” She says “ah yeah I am, S is just having a a shower”. It takes him like 5-10 minutes to have a shower so it’s not too bad. Another 30 minutes later she’s liek “ah lets watch the movie now”

And through that entire 10 hours or however the fuck long it was, not once did she say or even hint at the fact that S is being even a lil bit annoying. It’s like, it just bugs me. But I’m thinking it might be a jealousy thing cause lately, I’ve been ‘worried’ that our relationship isn’t as strong as it used to be mainly cause we don’t talk as often as we used to. We still talk a lot but I look into things and overthink them a lot so fuck you. And then this guy comes along and V’s essentially female simping over him. Like, she gets connected to people quite easily so i accused it the first couple times, but it’s happened over and over again to the point where it’s taking the piss and idk what to do about it. Idk what to do about it cause both V and I really like him. While I can understand it a little bit, he just, idk maybe our personalities don’t mix and there’s something I don’t get about him but it’s just annoying. I can’t talk openly about it cause of the fear of losing friends and people close to me because I don’t like someone they do. 

Any help on what to do is appreciated, thanks

We’re all 15 btw, me, V and I used to meet with someone else who is irrelevant to this whole thing, and S has never met up with us because V met him during quarantine and since that isn’t over yet, we haven’t met. Although V and I (the person not me) have said that S is invited to go round I’s house with all of us once this is over so there’s that.

Thanks again",08May2020,1

Sex gave me control in an environment where I had none.
I let them touch me... I didn’t feel anything, I was numb and feeling pain was better than nothing... having sex gave that to me. I’d never cum, I’d never enjoy it and I’d always feel worse after... but at the time it helped.

936," TW for abuse, alcoholism, suicide and untreated mental illnesses.

Strap yourselves in, because this is a long one.

My dad (63) has had depression and anxiety for most of his adult life. He goes off and on medication seemingly at a whim. He was viciously abused physically and mentally by both of his parents during his childhood, and does not have a good relationship with any of his family members, including my half sister J and her children. He met my mom (67) while she as going through a divorce in the 70's. They fell madly in love, and my dad basically assumed the father figure role of her son from the first marriage, my half-brother R. My mom said he was charming, handsome, caring, etc. All you could hope for from a potential partner. There were just a few snafus: my dad's parents hated her and he had a bit of a drinking problem.

My dad grew up in a very fundamentalist Christian household (Church of Christ) and his parents hated my mom because she was in the ""wrong"" religion and previously married with a child. It didn't matter how polite my mom was to them, they hated her. They always liked J's mom more than my mom and they tried to force my dad to choose her instead. He didn't and ended up marrying my mom, raising R as his own and having two more children with my mom, my sister K and me. For whatever reason, he never had a relationship with J or her kids, and neither have my sister K and I.

By this point, my dad is a full alcoholic. He never sought treatment for the abuse he went through as a kid, and turned to the bottle instead. He would scream at people, make them feel like utter failures. He even physically abused my brother R and drove drunk with my sister K. Luckily, I don't remember anything from this period because I was so young and K protected me from his abuse as much as she could.

He stopped drinking when I was 7, so he was sober for almost 20 years before this recent incident. Even after that, he continued to verbally abuse us. I grew up terrified of him. By the time I got to high school, he barely spoke to me unless it was about how bad I was doing in school and how much of a failure I was. K and I both inherited his depression and anxiety, so it made focusing in school really hard for me. I went from being an honor student in elementary and middle school to barely passing classes in high school. My depression during this time was bad, like really bad. I was self-harming and contemplating suicide. I felt like I had no one to talk to. My mom didn't think anything was wrong with me and K said I had nothing to be depressed about. They have both apologized since then and have been very supportive in my mental health journey.

The most memorable incident of verbal abuse from my teen years is from when I was a senior in high school, having just turned 18. My grades were up and I had just been accepted into a state college known for education (what I eventually got my bachelor's degree in). My dad called my on the phone to scream at me for having a D in English, even though I already handed in some late work and my teacher was working on grading it. He told me I didn't deserve any of the scholarships I received, that I was going to be a horrible teacher, that he would chain me to a toilet and not let me go to college an hour away, and that he would sell my car that I purchased with my own money. I spent the entire day having panic attacks and praying that my dad wouldn't hurt me when he came home. He never hit me before, but he threatened to once.

I went to college an hour away because I knew that if I stayed in my parent's home and went to college in my home town, I would be in danger. I was already contemplating suicide, and I didn't think I would make it through college if I stayed there. College was hard for my mental health, but I took steps to become a healthy person through medication and opening up to friends and family. Everyone has been super supportive, especially K and my mom.

Fast forward to summer of 2019. I am 23, about to graduate from college. I'm student teaching in my home town, so I'm back to living at home. Seemingly out of nowhere, my dad tells me that he and my mom are buying a set of 4 townhouses and renting them out. My mom is super against the idea, but he basically told her that if she refused to sign the sale papers he would divorce her. My mom has been with him for over 30 years and he is the one who makes the money, so she felt trapped and signed the papers. Congrats! They now own property they can only afford if people are paying rent (which is great right now when many are not able to). This is the first time I know of that my dad threatened my mom with divorce to get her to do something, and it's not the last.

Over the next year, my dad's mental heath takes a dive into the toilet. He is teaching at a school where administration treats him like crap, so he takes his issues out on my mom and us. He continues to threaten my mom with divorce, and even keeps a large suitcase in their room as a constant reminder. We don't know when, but sometime around November/December he starts drinking again. He doesn't do it at our house, but at the townhouses we own (one is vacant because he is ""renovating"" it). He's becomes more abusive, recluse, and depressed. If he's not at work, he's most likely drinking at the townhouse. He's drinking and driving. My mom says that his moods swing violently from angry to crying.

Then the most recent even happens. We're in quarantine, and my sister, mom and I all stay inside as much as possible. Mom and dad are both high risk, so K and I do whatever we can to limit our exposure. Dad, on the other hand, continues to go outside to work, the grocery store multiple times a week, the townhouses, hardware stores, etc. At the beginning of April, mom, K and I are sitting in the living room doing various things. Dad finally comes home and this happens. This is an almost verbatim exchange

Dad: I was thinking about grilling some salmon tonight?  
Mom: I don't think we have any.  
Dad: We don't. I was gonna go to Costco and get some  
(Note: This is a good 25 minute drive away. We think he wanted to go so far away so he could stop at the townhouse and drink)  
Mom: Oh, you don't need to do that. I'm fine.  
Dad: Do you want salmon?  
Mom: No, it's fine. That's a long drive.  
Dad: Do you want salmon?  
Mom: No, it's fine.  
Dad: Do you want salmon? (Asking my sister)  
K: You don't have to go all the way to Costco. Why not go to the Walmart down the street?  
Dad: Do you want salmon?  
Mom: It's really fine.  
Dad: Well, fuck all of you too. I was just trying to do something nice!  
Mom: Fuck you too! (I have never heard my mom say ""fuck"" before)  
Dad: Fuck all you bitches. Why don't I move out!  
Mom: Okay, do it.

So he did. He moved out. That night, I went on a drive to calm down a little. Obviously, it was very upsetting to witness that. When I got back home, mom tells me that my dad is threatening to kill himself, saying things like ""I promise not to make a mess"" and ""I'm in pain all the time"". He never directly threatened to kill himself, but how could you not read that is suicide threats? I call the police to do a wellness check on him. Second panic attack of the day. My sister and I both have to take a Xanax. I'm calling the police back every ten minutes trying to get updates. Finally, the police show up after 30 minutes and we can hear some of what's going on from the Ring doorbell. He's acting like nothing is wrong, just chatting to the officers like nothing is wrong. The police leave after 15 minutes and tell us they don't have enough evidence that he is a danger to himself or other to involuntarily commit him to a hospital. By this point, we all think this was just a ploy to get us to come over and see him. He starts texting my mom awful things, saying this like ""I hope you're pleased with yourself"" and ""don't worry, I'll file for divorce tomorrow so you don't have to do it a second time"". He's texting my sister that she doesn't care about him. All of this manipulative shit to make us say ""no, we love you?""

It's been a month since then, and he's come over a couple of times to get stuff. I have nothing to say to him, so I just stay in my room or go on drives. He keeps texting my mom awful shit. He blames her for his failed relationships with my half sister J and his parents. He called K and I mistakes.

K says I should be more sympathetic towards him, because he's sick and needs help (which he refuses to get). I want to be compassionate towards him. He's obviously dealing with some deep and powerful mental instability, but I just can't feel sympathetic for someone who is so cruel to the people he claims to love. He hasn't tried to reach out to me at all, but he's talked to everyone else, including my half brother R. He has never acknowledged the fact that he abused us or how much he has hurt me, so why should I forgive him for something he never asked forgiveness for?

Finally, we come to the advice segment. Should I be empathetic for my dad and try to support him? I just feel so angry with him. This has been years of abuse that has never been answered for, and not just with me but against my entire immediate family. He refused to get help (take medication, go to therapy, join AA. etc.) I want to cut him out of my life, but would that make me the bad guy for cutting out someone who is in desperate need of help and support?",08May2020,1

She’s on a lot of medication and right now is in a lot of pain emotionally and usually physically. 

I visit her a lot because we get along well and he says I make her really happy whenever I come over.

So she asked me if I would go out with her a couple time’s. Sort of like dates but she didn’t want it to be like a relationship she just wanted me to fill in for my brother for a couple days to make her feel better since I looked like him.

I agreed but the problem is that she would also want me to carry her. I understood her situation and felt really sorry for her so I do want to do it.

I just turned 30 almost 2 weeks ago and to say the least it was quite uneventful mainly in part to the pandemic so i can understand. This time spent at home has given myself plenty of time to really try and understand who i am and why i am the way i am. I realize that my life was impacted about 2 years ago.

I’ve never been one to be emotional but i feel my heart in my chest but at the same time i don’t feel any connection to it. I moved out and tried to live a life that i could. I was dumb and moved into a nice place that was way over priced but i didn’t care. I only stayed there for a year and thought it was gonna be my bachelor pad.

I have been battling depression already, then corona happened, then my girlfriend broke up with me, and probably cheated on me, either way she's with my friend now. Anywhoo I am failing about 3 classes, and I don't think I can make up the work. If I fail, I have to pay back the scholarship program im enrolled in, I wanted to withdrawal knowing I'd fail, but I couldn't because of the program. My mom and dad are telling me ""You have to pass!"" and I fucking hate school. I have always hated school, so so much. And this is like the icing on the shit cake. I don't want to go to school anymore, as in ever, but both my parents are demanding I stay in school, and I will owe the scholarship money if I fuck up, and the scholarship has me trapped for another whole year. I have never, ever had any motivation to do anything school related, I think it comes too easy to me, and I just can't bring myself to do anymore pointless bullshit. The only times I ever have motivation is not to impress my parents, because they know damn well im capable, as do I, but just to keep them not disappointed, and to not disappoint myself. It goes through a constant cycle of motivation, accomplishment, I feel like I accomplished nothing substantial in anyway, then I don't give a shit for a long time, then I have to fix it, rinse and repeat. I'm not saying I don't learn, or that it's not beneficial for my future, just that I have been, and continue to be, constantly miserable due to my education, and I feel like I would be better mentally and physically if I wasn't in school anymore. The quote from rick and morty comes to mind ""School is not for smart people"" I think school can be for smart people, if they enjoy going to school, and if it's the right school for the right type of smart. However whatever type of person I am academically, does not mesh well with any school i've been in. It's always too easy, or it's just not interesting enough for me to remember. I want to be a biologist. I like biology classes, however I feel like I cannot take another fucking math. Fuck math, why would I learn a language, if I am never going to speak it? I can do arithmetic already, I will never use calculus, or logarithmic functions outside of math class. Or another weird class that they make you take for some dumb reason. Public speaking, I don't want to be on Ted Talk. First Year Experience, we looked at the prof's cats the whole time, and I took it my second semester, while the class covers the transition from High school to college. I'm sick of the shit show that is our education system. I wan't to learn through life, which teaches actually useful things, not crammed in a class room with those fluorescent bulbs that always make my eyes water. I want to learn things no one has ever learned before. Not things that are already known, and is restated, then vomited on to a piece of paper, then forgotten.

TL:DR So I guess my question is, where do I go with my life? I hate school and I want it to be done, but I also want a career in science, and have no plan B. Has anyone been in this position?",08May2020,1
957,"So, my friend, who I only know the general location of is very suicidal and they just told me their plan to commit suicide within the next couple of hours. I don’t know exactly where they live and I have no idea of what to do, I’d just call 999 since I’m in the uk but they’d ask for the location of them which I don’t have, I just know the county they’re in.

958,"A few weeks ago I was on a conference call and for some reason I turned on my video. I was the only one out of 6 people with video on. The call was boring and I was not planning to say anything. So I decided to get one thing that I had in mind all day out of my system and started masturbating. I even stood up in front of my laptop and realized only after I finished off that my video was on all the time. I immediately hung up and left the call. 

After the first shock passed, I went back and checked the angle of the camera and I think that you could only see bellybutton upwards. Even when I was standing. But if one looked closely I am sure that you could notice my hand moving in a jerk off kind of way. 

It did bother me all day obviously, so that I reached out to 2 different individuals that were on the call asking if they noticed / saw anything. But they both denied. 

But now I was “invited” next Tuesday to a hearing with the HR director to explain myself. The invite did not include a lot of context. 

I don’t know who or what was communicated to HR, but want to seek advice what I should do? How should I prepare? What kind of story should
I tell? 

Thank you for your support!!",08May2020,1

I'm 25 and my mom and dad are in their early sixties... my mom has a lot of health conditions (alzheimers, COPD, diabetic, obese), my dad also has some heart problems and a similar weight issue. my boyfriend is in his 40s. my boyfriend has parents in our state as well and his parents are about the same age as well with some health problems, but he's much older so he's had a lot more time with his parents than i've had with mine. what do I do? this is an amazing relationship, but on the same note I don't want to be living permanently across the country to get a call a few years later that one of my parents has died. he's not going to change his mind about this promotion.",08May2020,1

Boys are 13 and 6. Two days ago my brother opened up to me about the relationship and they fight pretty much every other day and it turns into a day of no talking between them. She constantly says she’s done then say they’re going to do therapy together. It’s a back and forth thing with them.

What would be my best option now?

I know it sounds silly and I don’t like it one bit but that’s how it is in my family. I was hoping to assert myself more in my decision and tell them I’m going instead of asking for permission, but with the coronavirus going around I understand  why they wouldn’t want me to go.  I’m pretty sure they’re going to be more aggressive and shut down any more talk about going to California because of this.

965,"Hi guys, right now I feel like a man child. I still live with my parents have have little to no experience in anything. Worked in Delivery once for a while then left is legitimately my only work experience. Right now I’m studying as an intern in something I have no real passion for. I have no relationships outside of my family. 0 friends.  I don’t have a high self esteem and I think I’m unapproachable, I feel like people give me a “weird look” because I’m often silent and barely talk to anyone. I can go through a whole day saying nothing. I feel like an outcast.

I struggle with a porn and gaming addiction, gaming not so much anymore, I can go days without gaming nowadays because I feel empty when playing, but porn is the harder one to break. 

I read and buy a lot of self help books but they never really get me to action. Just yesterday I literally went downstairs with the intention to drink coffee and add MCT oil to my coffee to start a keto diet, when I got to the kitchen I started eating foods with high carbs...

I guess the my main issue is I’m deeply disappointed in myself. Deep down I feel like I could be successful but I’m just so disappointed in my life, the person I’ve become. I often think my child self would be so shocked to how I turned out. 


I lack in every asset of life and have no skills to be proud of or share. I’m deeply sad I didn’t go to university, it’s my biggest insecurity. I strongly envy people that are my age in university and have relationships. I often have phases where I’m enthusiastic to try and do things but they dim very fast and I then resort to thinking about dying.

The biggest issue I face is I’m not passionate about anything. The closest thing to a “dream” is run a successful business and have passive income.

967,"I already talked about this on r/TIFU but I realized I wanted some advice on how to deal with the situation as well.

So today I was at a park playing basketball with some of my friends, another older kid, a basketball coach who had coached me a couple of times and his two sons. When my friends left, I also decided to go as well so I hopped on my moped. I wheeled it out of my parking spot and was gonna drive out the lot when I noticed my left mirror was a little off so I decided to angle it while I was driving (I know I'm stupid right) anyways I accelerated a little and wanted to break but the rear break on my moped has always been a little finicky and you need to press it really hard for it to stop. However, I was already moving the mirror and I couldn't press the break hard enough in time and I ended up crashing straight into sidewalk.

The older kid, the coach and his sons all saw it happen too and they came over to help, but the bike and I were fine, my pride and dignity weren't. I drove away and feel so embarrassed because I respect the coach a lot and his son is the best player in our high school. Hopefully they dont go tell this story to other people otherwise I would never be able to live it down. I can tell that the coach does not like me a lot and neither does his son because I'm not that good at basketball based on various interactions with both. I try to at least act respectfull, mature, and competent so they respect me in that way, but now I'm pretty sure they think that I'm so absolute fucking dumbass who can't even ride a goddamn moped. 

Is there a way for me to win back the trust of my coach? Also, if they tell other people how should I get over the humiliation of such an incident?",08May2020,1

969,"So, I'm quarantined with my parents and two brothers. I'm 23F, brother 1 is 21M, and brother 2 is 17M. All of our bedrooms are upstairs. Our upstairs A/C is strange and does not evenly distribute the cold. My room tends to be cold and the boys rooms tend to be warm. 2's room is worse with this.  Brother 2 recently got out of juvenile hall, and had been gone for 9 months before that.  When it's just Brother 1 and I home for break from college, we keep the upstairs thermostat keeping the upstairs between a range of 70 and 72. He's most comfortable at 70, I'm most comfortable at 72, but 70 is still comfortable enough. Then Brother 2 came home and he won't stop changing the thermostat down to 68. When it's that low, the cold makes it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. Things like showering and such are more difficult as well because who wants to get naked when it feels like Antarctica. So I keep changing it back to 70. I figure that since my ideal is the highest, at 72, and B2's is the lowest, at 68, 70 is a reasonable compromise. But Brother 2 won't stop turning it down. It's causing troubles falling asleep at night and getting up in the morning, and I am sick of it. I tried talking to him about it but he says 72 is too hot. Which sure, it may be to him, but I am turning it to 70, which is a compromise. He still refuses to stop changing it. Any other ways to make him stop?

We laughed so much, we cried so much, we showed the rawest versions of ourselves to eachother. But when you are that vastly open with someone, at least for me, trouble rises. We fought a lot, about stupid shit, the annoyances and irritation were also parts that were unfiltered. Weve had a few falling outs so far, but i knew that we would reconcile soon after.. this time its different. We can only come back together so many times.  I can tell this friendship is over and honestly, I know its for the best but i'm so numb. I feel like I'm losing the other half of me. I feel half empty.

My partner has some pretty irrational thoughts about COVID-19 and our risks, and has started to devote large amounts of time to cleaning and sanitizing things. While obviously a good cleaning regimen is important, including extra vigilance these days, I'm talking about taking two hours to clean and store 25 grocery items we bought on home delivery. I'm talking about him self-isolating on the couch and refusing to ride in a car with me because ""it's too much close contact"", when neither of us have seen any other human beings besides each other, and the termite inspection guy, in well over a month. I'm talking about him coming out of whatever room he is in to grill me about why I sneezed or coughed and failing to understand that people just sneeze and cough occasionally. You get the picture.

He talks a lot about ""this is just how I am these days"" and ""I hate it, but it it what it is"" and absolutely refuses to seek any kind of help (he has a therapist he occasionally sees, but not for a while) because he's already decided there nothing that can be done to help him.

When no one has been remotely close to us in 5, getting on for 6 weeks!)

I have pretty much lost all patience with this, to be honest. I feel it's unreasonable for him to get angry with me for not kowtowing to his obsessive irrationality while simultaneously refusing to seek any form of help. I lowkey want to find a way to force him to get help, but obviously I know that's not reasonable or practical, and comes from a place of frustration.

My boyfriend, Jack, was taken advantage of by a girl a few months before we got together, this girl got pregnant but had a boyfriend, Dave. So there was a possibility of either being the father. Now what makes everything so much worse is that Jack and Dave were really good friends at the time.  Jack has only been with one other girl besides me, he's only had sex with one other girl besides me and we took things really slow. Jack is not the type of guy to sleep with Dave's girlfriend. Jack is shy, and emotional and sweet. So Dave finds out this happened, forgive the girl and decides he's going to raise the baby even if it is Jack. Now I got with Jack while this girl was pregnant, we thought they only had sex once what are the chances? I remember even teasing him ""that babies gonna come out so cute with curly red hair and blue eyes!!"" 
Now my problem is, the baby is about 4-5 months old now...starting to see features and I'm almost positive this baby is Jacks. Jack doesn't want to think about it. When I bring it up he just wants to forget about it which I understand, if I was in his situation I'd be traumatized.

982,"So I introduced a couple of my guy friends to my best friend, and I mean my BEST FRIEND. When I introduced them I told her about one of them, let’s call him David, and how I had a crush on him and wanted to possibly try and see if he was interested. One day I caught her at his house and I confronted her. She denied and went CRAZY on me to the point that I felt wrong for even thinking that she was doing something like that to me. I caught her again and she convinced me it wasn’t true...I even asked David and he also said it was no true. So then here comes the big day. I physically caught her at his place and that’s then the truth all came spilling out...she admitted to manipulating and lying to me the entire time and said they had been hanging out ever since she met him (aka when I introduced her to him as the guy I had a crush on) 

So I freaked out and told her to basically fuck off... she decided (after much convincing that what she did was wrong) that she was going to break it off to save the friendship we had and not break girl code.

So from that point David and I were never gonna be a thing becasue my best friend ruined that. So obviously my crush faded away. 


TELL ME WHY.....she waited two weeks and then went to hanging out with him again and said “well you don’t have a crush on him anymore so I didn’t think it would matter” 
The thing is it wasn’t about him it was more about how she was treating me as her BEST FRIEND! 

So I told her that I didn’t want her hanging out with him period and she responded by saying that basically I either need to be okay with it or I can cut her off as a friend (but that she loves and cares about me and wish I could just look past it and be okay with it) 


So here’s my question.....am I wrong for giving her an “ultimatum” of me or David!? And should I just cut her off and never speak to her again since she obviously doesn’t care about my feelings? Am I crazy for feeling some type of way about them hanging out?",08May2020,1

I’m 17M. Been working in this shop for 9 months. It’s decent to good pay, £8 an hour. I’ve managed to save up a couple grand in my bank and I’m off to Uni next year. 
 
Although it’s been a good experience and was my first job, the work is really draining and I feel under constant pressure from my peers who don’t really do much work themselves but use me as a scapegoat because I’m pretty much too nice to complain or push back. Makes me feel like a real pushover.

It’s a pretty toxic environment and I dread going every morning and can hardly sleep well the night before. I have one good friend who works with me but he’s considering leaving. The majority of people who work there are nice but some people who I work with are just black holes of joy who create problems for everyone lol.

Basically, what should I do? I’m confident I could find another job when this whole corona lockdown is over as I’m determined enough but I’m at a constant tug of war in my head about what I should do. Part of me feels that because I’m simply thinking about it means I should.

986,"So around the end of February I had my Xbox taken away for getting an F in AP Spanish. I was fine with it as I well deserved that punishment and thought well since I'm still in school and playing a sport I shouldn't be too bothered about it or bored anyway. Then, on March 13, school was off for everyone for the rest of the year because of the virus. I was really excited that day because nobody really thought we would actually get school off. Anyway, when break started and all that good stuff, I quickly realized ah shit, I'm grounded so I still can't play Xbox. 

And now I realized I really got myself into quite the predicament. I can't raise my F because it's 17% and online school could only raise it so much so I did the math and found out it won't go up to even a D. It's fine though graduation wise as I'm 17 and a junior in high school who has already met the language requirements. 

But basically I'm asking you guys **if you have any advice to help get my console back** because I'm really bored during quarantine and am tired of being on my school laptop with nothing to do as they also took away my other electronics such as phone and laptop. **I COULD take my Xbox from their room to play it in my room late at night but need a way to distract them from their own room so they don't see me taking it and I would take it around 10 pm so they won't expect it so advice on a distraction would be nice too. ALSO it's important to know I payed for Xbox live and the console and the games so I own it all.** They're really strict parents so reasoning never works because they are arrogant and even know I'm stuck in this situation but have no sympathy and believe they always know better than me even when they are clearly wrong at times.

990,"Hello all, I know this probably isn’t the best place to ask this but I didn’t know where else to go. r/TechSupport doesn’t allow recommendations so I can’t go there. Anyways, 

I’ve been having issues with my WiFi for some time now. My Ethernet is perfectly fine. Always stable, always high uploads and download speeds it’s just WiFi that is often times pretty slow and spotty even when we are closer to the router. It’s really bad far away from the router to the point where I can’t do online school work and work work from my laptop in certain places of my house. I know because of covid-19 there is a lot more people on the internet and such. I’m really just looking to upgrade my router or get a mesh network because even if I fix my WiFi issues on this current router I’ll still have the range issues. I live in a two story about 3,000 sqft home. I’ve done a lot of research myself but just can’t figure out what is a good purchase. I’d prefer not to spend more than $400-$500. 

Anyone have any advice on what router or what mesh network I should invest in? Obviously a mesh network would cover my whole house and fix my range issues but maybe I don’t need a mesh network and I could just do a really good router with more range. Any advice would be greatly appreciate! Thank you.",08May2020,1

993,"My boyfriend (M21) and I (F24) rent a spacious two bedroom apartment. We use the spare bedroom for storage since our apartment albeit spacious, lacks in the closet department. My best friend (F23) lives with her grandparents. She suffers from anxiety, depression, ptsd and Im not sure what else. Her therapists agree that the source of her problems is her family. I agree as well. Her family is very toxic. She’s stuck being unable to move out because she only has a parttime job and it doesn’t pay enough for her to live on her own.

Cue her calling me one afternoon to vent her frustrations at yet another episode between her and her grandmother. She’s crying over the phone, telling me she can’t handle it anymore. And I’m listening trying not to say anything stupid because I am honestly at a loss of words. I don’t know what to advise her but she is my best friend and I want her to feel better. She needs to leave her family and in a moment of a lapse of judgment, I tell her to move in with me and my boyfriend. I didn’t even consult my boyfriend.

She accepted the offer and now she is very excited about it and my boyfriend is okay with it because he knows how bad her family is but I’m not sure I want her to live with us.

I want her to get out of her family’s grasp but I don’t want to sacrifice my privacy over it. But I made the offer and I’m afraid to take it back. She’s already said her family makes her feel like a burden. If I rescinded my offer, I worry out friendship will be tarnished irreparably.

My boyfriend is cool with it, which makes me think that maybe Im just being paranoid, that I should just suck it up but I think about how much that will change our home routine and I just....

1002,"hi, I’m an international student planning to study CS and my list came down to these two colleges. pls help me choose.

Nyu sh:

pros:
-Institution name is much more recognized

-near city, packed and busy (which I like!), and nightlife in Shanghai is amazing and super fun

-can study abroad to nyc/ abu dhabi / paris/tel aviv, basically any other nyu global academic center, bcs they require a minimum of one semester abroad in order for u to graduate

cons:
-expensive as hell. (38k usd per year), i’ll be such a burden to my parentsss 😩

-I know zero mandarin, not rly into chinese culture :(

-I heard dorms there sucks 


Jacobs University:

pros: 
-only 3 years of study to get a bachelor’s degree

-I’ve been obsessed w the german language for years now and I just love german culture

-more affordable (€9000 per year)

-can get a job bcs they give u work permit

-I heard dorms there are super great bcs theyre spacious and everyone gets their own room.

cons:
-not a really reputable school, not a lot of ppl know it

-its quite rural (far from city), and I dont like being isolated I am used to living in a busy city! and based on my research it kinda has this lonely vibe.. it even has a graveyard beside one of the residential buildings.

-yes the tuition is cheaper, thats bcs i’ll be paying student debt for like 10 yrs with a 11% income share agreement (thats how the tuition I need to pay became way cheaper, bcs they move the rest of tuition with their tuition deferral program that u have to pay after u get a job that meets the minimum wage)

Both nyu shanghai and jacobs contains quite an international population (nyu sh consists of 50% chinese students and 50% internationals from all over the world, while jacobs has about 80% of internationals and 20% germans)


p.s: currently I am committed to nyu sh, paid the enrollment deposit BUT jacobs’s deposit deadline is on June 1st. which means I could still switch if I want to.

also, during my research I read a lot of negative comments about jacobs regarding that it is a subpar school for ‘ignorant foreigners’ bcs theyre stupid enough to go to a school that charge large sums of money while in germany there are lots of free public universities with better reputation/recognition.
however, let me remind you that most (or I think all) of those free public unis require German Language abilities of minimum B1/C1 and not a lot of ppl have that. (including me). thats why I applied to jacobs in the first place, bcs they teach in english.

1004,"So around the end of February I had my Xbox taken away for getting an F in AP Spanish. I was fine with it as I well deserved that punishment and thought well since I'm still in school and playing a sport I shouldn't be too bothered about it or bored anyway. Then, on March 13, school was off for everyone for the rest of the year because of the virus. I was really excited that day because nobody really thought we would actually get school off. Anyway, when break started and all that good stuff, I quickly realized ah shit, I'm grounded so I still can't play Xbox.

And now I realized I really got myself into quite the predicament. I can't raise my F because it's 17% and online school could only raise it so much so I did the math and found out it won't go up to even a D. It's fine though graduation wise as I'm 17 and a junior in high school who has already met the language requirements.

But basically I'm asking you guys **if you have any advice to help get my console back** because I'm really bored during quarantine and am tired of being on my school laptop with nothing to do as they also took away my other electronics such as phone and laptop. **I COULD take my Xbox from their room to play it in my room late at night but need a way to distract them from their own room so they don't see me taking it and I would take it around 10 pm so they won't expect it so advice on a distraction would be nice too. ALSO it's important to know I payed for Xbox live and the console and the games so I own it all.** They're really strict parents so reasoning never works because they are arrogant and even know I'm stuck in this situation but have no sympathy and believe they always know better than me even when they are clearly wrong at times.

1005,"Hi, this is my first time posting here.
I’m 19f and currently living at home with my parents thanks to this bastard disease. I used to live on college campus and I was doing alright until I came back home.
My main motivation for living on college campus was to get away from my parents. I don’t like living with them. I always feel alone, unloved, and anxious living with them and I have since I was 12. It’s been adding to my depression and almost removing the motivation. I’m only doing classes now out of fear of how they would react if they found out I failed a class, rather than passion for learning.
I have been recommended many times to see a therapist, but my parents are super strict and say that I need to tell them where I go and they can track everything through my phone. I can’t even call a therapist the school provides because I need privacy and this house may as well be made out of paper. Everyone can hear everyone talking as if they’re next to you. I was doing alright in College because I was able to be myself, but moving back home was a struggle. 
It’s the last week of classes before summer vacation and I still have a Final essay and an exam that could benefit me in that class. But I’m sitting at a failing grade right now and I want to know what happens if you fail a class in college.
This is my second semester in college. My first semesters I had all B’s except for one mid-C, and this semster is about the same except for an F instead of a C. (I took 5 classes both semesters).
Will I flunk out of college if I fail this class? 
If I am able to go back to college next semester, I will be talking to a therapist. I tried to last semester, but they close their offices too early for me go. I specifically made my schedule for next semester around therapy times. 

tl;dr: I might flunk a class in College. Its my second semester and I’ve done...okay... in my previous semester with mostly B’s except for one C. What happens if I flunk a class?",08May2020,1

1007,"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 3 years now, and in that time, I’ve noticed something. 

Every time I try to be assertive and tell her I didn’t like something she did or said, it somehow gets turned on me. Each time I end up feeling shitty like I did something wrong. 

She usually makes an argument out of it and cries and I don’t rush to comfort her so she uses that as fuel to make me out to be the bad guy because “I don’t care about her when she’s suffering”. 

I’ve told her multiple times that she can’t expect me to just put all of my emotions aside as well as my hurt that she made me feel (which started the whole thing) and come to her aide. 

I found out recently that her therapist agreed with me and told her that she can’t expect anything that she doesn’t ask for (she never asks for me to comfort her she just expects it). My girlfriend kept this from me for months and still, even after her therapists professional opinion does the same thing. 

Anyway, it’s really starting to boil over during this quarantine as anytime I point something out like hey, please don’t talk to me that way, you can ask politely, it turns into a melt down with me being that bad guy somehow when she could simply apologize or just say okay, I understand. 

When I talk to her about something I didn’t like she often brings up things I’ve done in the past and tries to point out every wrong I’ve ever done. It will suddenly turn into, “oh and you’re so perfect?” 

She’s very sensitive and her mother was very mean. She got scolded over the simplest things and was the “whipping boy” of her family essentially. 

My theory is that she doesn’t respond well to criticism because of that but who knows. No matter what her reasoning is it’s borderline abusive. I should be able to voice my issues without getting attacked. 

I will say that in the beginning I wasn’t the greatest communicator either, but for the last year I’ve been exemplary. I use all the buzzwords for assertive communication, I let her know I’m coming from a place of love... it just does not matter. 

She can’t handle criticism and I’m getting tired of not being able to voice myself whenever I feel she’s done something wrong or something I didn’t appreciate.

He was doing most of the talking, he didn't really know much about me, he could tell that I was uncomfortsble. But still, he wanted to get to know me so I guess thats why he met me for the 3rd time.

I have a friend who likes to spend a lot of time with me, which is great! The issue is that it ends up being, in my opinion, a *lot* of time. Think along the lines of conversations/binge TV sessions/etc.  that can last up to a couple of hours a day, a couple of days a week. I have been cutting this off a bit lately due to final exams.
When I told them about a project I wanted to apply for (not work or school related, to be fair), they told me “I think you’re busy enough” (paraphrasing). When I finished my exams for the semester, their main reaction was “Now you have more time to spend with me!”, and so on.
This feels a bit clingy to me, and it can get bothersome over time.

They don’t seem to have many other regular social contacts besides me and their family, and with the quarantine in our country it’s not exactly easy to go out and socialize. This friend has struggled with mental health before, so I’m worried about exacerbating issues if I tell them to cool it. I’m prone to overthinking, though, so for all I know they would be fine. 

Maybe I am just overthinking things. By nature I am not very social, so maybe this is completely normal and I’m being unempathetic (quarantine, for sure, is not easy for anyone). Am I being ungrateful? I don’t want to be a bad friend. I would appreciate any advice.",08May2020,1
1021,"hi, I'm a sophomore. Next year, and probably the year after, I'll be moving from a small private school to an academy, and I'm scared. 

Today I talked about it with my friend ( who goes there already ) and the way he described it made it sound like an ordinary public school, but full of ( for lack of a better word ) delinquents. He said there are three cliques: the ""hicks, sluts, and LGBT+.""

I know a girl that goes there. We used to be friends in sixth grade. My friend told me she cut a flower into her arm, showed it to her girlfriend, who thought it was 'cool.' There's someone who identifies as non-binary and genderfluid(?). Homophobes. Textbook lesbians. Narcissists. All around, from what I've heard, fake people who want -and will probably do anything for- a little extra attention, good or bad.

Before i went to a private school, i was at my local high school. That in itself was absolute hell. Toxic people would get in my head to the point where i was too scared to talk most of the time, out of fear of judgement.

I have a big heart. A really big heart. It has been stepped on and taken advantage of. I dont want to hurt like that again. I dont want to be scared of going to school again. 

As much as I kind of want to, I cant go back now. I feel like going to this school, that's so packed full of outcasts, will be good for me. On the other hand, the people suck. At least that's what I heard.

I have a gut feeling that these next threeish years will be the time when I truly find myself. But, I'm scared. What do I do?

I don’t know, I just never feel comfortable with fully opening up with people. This back up of emotions is going to blow up in my face sooner or later because I can feel it and I’m worried. I’ve also become super detached and I was glad at first because I thought it was good thing to not be bothered and not care but now I think I’m detaching for the wrong reasons. 

I’ve dealt with depression before so I think that’s what this is but it just feels so different than before. The minute I get worked up and want to cry or even work through how I’m feeling to just let it out, my body literally stops me and I just don’t! This usually never happens but since I’m becoming more numb by the day and doing all of this pretending, it’s making it hard for me to open up. A part of me is scared that being completely vulnerable will scare people of or make them worried about me and I hate that feeling. I want to express my emotions without being scared I’ll be looked at differently. Another part of me worried that being this detached will also make people leave too. Maybe I’m just projecting how I think people will react. I really don’t know anymore. What should I do?",08May2020,1

\*This has been a 10-week problem and the business is in a different city (3 Hour drive) but we're in the same state so here goes.

I wanted to get a computer part from my computer (CPU) to be serviced so that it can be faster. So I looked into a business that will delid/relid and overclock my CPU. I bought their tool which does this, but I had no idea how to use it &amp; I'm new to computers (it's the 1st computer I've built). So I email them and they reply saying they'll service it (delid/relid etc) in exchange that I provide them their tool back as compensation. I agree. At week 4 I email them for an update. They say they haven't serviced it due to COVID and that they'll get someone on it right away so they can ship it out to me. Awesome. At week 6 I email them for an update. No response. At week 7 I email them for an update. No response. I log into one of my other email accounts and email them under a new name inquiring about a product they have. I promptly receive a response the next day. So I email them through my main email the same day. No response. I believe they knew it was me since there's a ""Visitor's Location"" followed my IP address section at the bottom of the email. It's now week 10 and I don't know what to do. What can I do?

1028," Background: My mother, early 50s, has always been very mentally ill and in and out of treatment centers and rehabs her whole life. They’ve done nothing to help long term (not because of the treatment, because of her). Her elderly retired parents (my grandparents), who have spent thousands in their lives helping her get treatment, have taken her in the past 2 years in an effort to keep her sober. This hasn’t been without a struggle though—with her car she would still go out and buy alcohol, and sometimes would drive drunk, so her parents saw no other option other than to take away the keys for everyone’s safety. She can only go out for appointments. I know this sounds like an awful quality of life, but she has no where else to live, and doesn’t want to live anywhere else anyway, she accepts the rules. She lives in a guest suite/add-on to the house that we rarely used before, which is just a bedroom, bathroom, and laundry room connected that we all use, but she just spends all the time in there doing nothing, coming out maybe once a day. 

I moved out a few months ago for a job and couldn’t take the stress of being at home anymore. I’ve been worried, we all have, since this has been the living situation, about how this is not a permanent solution. All my grandparents are doing is giving her a place to live, and preventing her from drinking for the time being. Because she will do that if this weren’t the situation. I understand my grandparents feelings, they want to take care of their child, but they aren’t blind to her actions by any means— they are stressed a lot about her living here and the principle of it, and that it’s only putting a wall between her and addiction. They also feel for me and my brother though, and want to protect us, by not letting her go out and destroy her life. We’ve learned to understand that some people can’t be helped, you have you want to get better, and our mother stopped showing signs of that. 

I came here to ask what options there are for someone like this. I’d like to help my grandparents relieve their stress of her living here, wasting away. My brother and I don’t have the resources to help her when they die, they know that, and know that her burden should not have to fall on us. I feel like psychiatric facilities are focused on rehabilitation, so they aren’t long term/permanent residences for addicts/mental health issues. Are there any such places that do exist though?

1032," (I also posted this on a different subreddit, but I'm trying to get different opinions and such)

Fist of all - technically he isn't my boyfriend. We went on few dates, hooked up twice and in general are showing strong romantic interest in each other (we used to send each other ""cute"" texts through out the day, would talk about missing each other etc.). Calling him my boyfriend in the title was easier than ""maybe soon to be boyfriend""

But let's get into the actual issue:

We've been talking/seeing each other for about 4 months now, and everything seemed to be going well. However he's been acting very distant lately - taking everything from 6h to 24h to respond to my texts and usually he only responds with one, very short sentence that ""kills"" the conversation before it even starts. Or he ignores what I said and says something unrelated. I decided to point it out to him at some point and he did admit that it's because the anniversary of the death of his close family member is nearing. I apologized and told him that if he needs anything I'm here for him, whatever it is. For the next few days I kept on asking if he's okay and if he wants to talk about it etc. He always replayed saying that he's fine, that's he's just chilling, but he continued on being super distant. I tried giving him space without asking how his doing, not double texting or anything like that, just waiting for him to respond and then taking a moment before responding back (that's something I appreciate when I'm not feeling mentally well) but he still does not hold conversation in any way. I tried ""flirting"" a few times (just stuff that we did before he got distant, like using pet names, saying that i miss him etc.) but he always pretty much ignores those attempts.

Maybe if we were in an actual relationship I would feel confident to talk to him about it, but because we're \*not\* I feel like I'm not allowed to ""demand"" anything of him. Basically I care about this guy and but I feel like I can't really do much in this situation relationship-wise without looking clingy. There is also this additional layer of the fact that we're both guys and even though I know it's stupid, I feel a bit emasculated by this whole situation (constantly trying to get him to talk to me about feelings, seeking affection with the flirting, getting attached to the point where it seems like I might care about this ""relationship"" more than him etc.)

TLDR; Guy I like is distant (probably) due to the anniversary of the death of his close family member, and I tried different methods of helping, but it's been now weeks and he continues on instating that he's fine, while also still being distant. I care about him but as we're not actually dating I feel like there is not much I can do.",08May2020,1

My bf decided to call cps a year ago to try to have our son taken away and now that cps is involved my life is a living hell. I struggle with coping with everything so I smoked marijuana and now I cant because of my open case with cps. I currently live with my parents while I pay for an apartment for my bf to live in that im too scared to move into because of his violent nature. This is causing him to become even more violent as my parents have made it a living hell for him to see his son. They want to take my son away from me and are always threatening to call the police when I try to take my son to go see his father, he's never been violent towards my son but he's starting to grow bitter and losing the fatherly love a father has for his son as he feels that my son is more of a son to my parents than him since he's living with me and them. I feel like killing myself and am struggling with deep depression as I cant seem to find a way out of this household and repair the relationship with my bf. He only turned abusive once he felt like I betrayed him by not letting him see his son, even though I am not the one who doesn't allow it, its my parents. My parents made sure cps put through a court order with the judge so my sons father cant be allowed with his son unless it is with a social worker In sight. I am really struggling financially as I have lost jobs due to cps intrusiveness and the drama between my family and my bf.

They always yell at him and treat him with hate just like they have treated me my whole life.

I am also an illegal immigrant and don't have the necessary paperwork to get help from the government and I feel like I have nowhere to turn to. My parents have tried anything and everything to get my bf in jail for the abuse I endured by his hands and everyone keeps pressuring me to encarcerate him, but I cant live with the thought of ruining someones life and putting him in jail when I know the reason he acts this way is because he's not allowed to see his son.",08May2020,1

1040,"I'll try to keep this short and concise.

My parents divorced when I was young, my biological mom was abusive (verbally, violently and mentally). When I moved in with my biological father (who cares about me), I was bullied in middle school because my parents were law enforcement officers and arrested parents of other kids. I was behind academically and had to catch up. I hated it. In high school, I was a pound from being obese and was bullied for that and more. I had clear signs of burn out despite doing incredibly well in my certificate program (equivalent to college credit). I only did well in the classes I liked which were often medical oriented classes.  I fought from time to time and eventually lost weight. During my first years of college, being in a STEM major brought out the worst in me and I gained back the weight in addition to conditions like shitty teachers (I still thought some college was a place of learning where teachers cared and wanted to teach. In my experience that's maybe 1 in every 5 or more). I withdrew, tried to enlist and was rejected due to obligatory counselling when I was 8 (It's a law in my state that counseling for children must accompany divorce), more recent counselling (my counselor never diagnosed me with anything. She said I was just going through a hard time and I was mentally healthy) and a rivalry between my recruiter and an officer at M.E.P.S.

 I found that legally they can't disqualify a person for medical events occurring before the age of 13 but they did anyways and even though I passed all the other exams and scored well on my A.S.V.A.B. (88 out of 99), I had no one to go above her. This killed my dreams of being a soldier like my father and I had one of the worst waves of panic in my life. A friend helped me calm down and I enrolled in a smaller school. In this school, I still couldn't shake this feeling of ""It's all pointless"". I did ok. I've retaken a class and have A's and B's again but it won't likely be enough to get me into the program. I live in an area with only two schools close enough to travel to. I've fought that same ""It's pointless"" feeling constantly along with home issues like family dying and a girlfriend serious leaving. Relatives beyond my immediate family couldn't give less of a shit if I died today. But they'd do me lip-service. (lol/s) The only thing that helps is hard work, academic progress, improving my fitness and weed (which I've stopped because I'll have to drug test soon). 

My current options are:

A. be selected (unlikely).

B. Put on wait-list (again).

If I don't get into the program for which I plan to retake the exam for a higher grade over the summer (I made an 800/1000 overall and 800/1000 being the lowest grade in 10 categories) are:

B. Become an E.M.T. (certificate earned in 6 months) and/or a Paramedic (diploma earned in a year or less after achieving the tech certificate). Then moving on because it's a dead-end job and I don't want to be poor and I think I'd like to go into psychiatry to help others who were in similar situations,

B-1. Re-applying for my program where the tech/P credits won't help. Salary is 35k to 42k and caps at 90k with a masters. 

B-2. Re-taking classes to increase my GPA to go into a Pre-Med. program where I might find a school to apply my tech/P credits to a degree then Med. school. 

 I'm leaning more towards B-2 but I'm already 24. I'm tired of feeling nervous in front of strangers, tired of dealing with pedantic teachers and tired of this ""Ugh, I have to do this shit again"" the moment I enter the classroom. I can't afford therapy, don't want to be screwed again if I go and I want to be successful in life. I have big dreams and I feel I can do more academically (the material is't hard) but it all feels so tedious.

Generally my parents have always been caring, they always try their best and it isn't easy with two ASD diagnostics in the family. (Me included.)

Since this month my oldest brother NoIdeaOfAge[M] (also with ASD, depression and a massive game addiction.) hasn't been showing up for dinner (i'm guessing since they are low-key encouraging it by leaving leftovers for him) this is most likely also causing them to stress.
Leaving the toxicity in the household to come to an all-time high.

My middle brother 19[M] is normal... not much to say about him other then that he somewhat raped me in the near past.

Then you have me... 16[M] Theres alot going on with me, most of which i won't mention. I didn't mention the diagnostics of my oldest brother but here's mine. I have PDD-NOS and ADD.

My issue is that i couldn't get out of bed because of everything going on. My parents yelling at me, my mom has almost no patience. Which caused my dad to be interrupted from his work and started yelling at me. When my dad started yelling my mom left. After a while my dad left too but the sadness in his voice caused me to cry, alot. They took away all my electronics, except for my phone which i was able to hide, but they booted me out of the router so 4G it is.

I've never heard my dad be more dissapointed/sad in my life.

I was hired primarily for manufacturing for a very small business, but they also wanted me to do social media work on the side because I have a lot of experience with it with my own small art business. I started off working on social media for an hour a day, then slowly ended up with more responsibility on it up to getting to create marketing campaigns and started spending about 3 hours a day working on it. I also ended up making graphics for them, and became the sole runner of their social media. That ended up being half my day spent on all this stuff.
So, with the pandemic, my boss started having me work from home. My home PC is far more powerful and I have the entire Adobe suite, so what I could do greatly expanded. I have, again, expanded what I do because of the extra power. I redesigned one of their logos, was able to make much nicer graphics, and then the kicker; I made a sale campaign that drew in somewhere around $7k in profit. My abilities and my productivity have raised greatly over the past 2 months.
My question here is this; I really want to stay primarily working from home. I think I can bring more value to my company doing that because of the tools I have available to me and because I just focus better alone in my room, but I really don't know how to ask since.....this wasn't what I was even hired for, it just kind of happened.

Last month a friend of my bf and I passed away unexpectedly. He was hit by a car. I have a huge fear of death so this has made me even more anxious than I usually am. I work at a hospital. I am not a nurse, but I am in close proximity with patients especially Covid patients lately. 
I am a transporter, so we help move them and settle them in bed and so on. I got a job at another hospital but they furloughed me due to the virus since I am only per diem there. I was in the midst of looking for a non healthcare job as a “main job” to replace my current hospital one that I’m still working.... but when the virus hit, it took those opportunities away from me. 


Now that my job depends on transporting coronavirus patients throughout the hospital, and their dead bodies and having my own COVID scare myself, it’s been really hard on me mentally. I haven’t been able to see my family either, I am scared of hurting them by maybe giving it to them. I haven’t seen them in about 2 months. And living with my bf during this time I’ve noticed I’ve been kinda mean to him, I apologize but I keep doing it so i feel terrible.


And now I’ve noticed something. I have been getting the worst headaches of my life within the past 2 weeks, and nausea and throwing up and other stomach issues, and I’ve lost over 10 pounds and I thought maybe something was wrong with me. But I am beginning to think this is anxiety from going to work (I work only 3 days a week) and possibly getting sick or the ones I love sick. I think I need to quit or at least ask to be furloughed til this shit is over with, but I don’t know how to go about it. 

I call out a lot. 

But I think I need help on how to let my boss know that it’s affecting me mentally and it’s taking a toll on my overall health too. How should I tell them this? I am going to work today, but I feel incredibly ill. I call out every week and I am worried they think I’m just being lazy. I feel bad because I’m not full time so it’s not like I’m getting that one on one COVID encounter 5 days a week. I feel like such a burden. 

I am also NOT a medical student like most of my coworkers, this isn’t the profession I am going into. This is JUST a job for me. A lot of my coworkers use this job as a stepping stool to get into the medical/hospital world.

For the past several years, I've tried to position myself and make myself the type of person who would try to help anyone I could, however I could. I wanted to be someone people could trust to help them, someone they could trust to be nice or talk to when they needed.

But lately, that's become so much harder.

Once I graduated from college and struggled to get a job, it left me basically home bound. For a while, it was okay. I had things I could do and help out with while I was searching. There was also a period where I had to put that on hold due to personal issues.

All of my commitments that I'd kept to before it have come to a dead standstill. So I decided to take the opportunity to be more active on Twitter.

And boy, did it hurt me.

I discovered the issues of three of my followers, each of whom have problems of their own. One with image issues became irate after people called her ugly, but she's otherwise pretty stable. Another I found out entertains suicidal thoughts, especially after a major incident in his life recently. Another guy can't leave his house and can't get anyone to help him, online or off.

I was advised that trying to help someone instead of getting them professional help is like trying to put a house fire out with a garden hose. I want to be able to do that - get them help instead of trying to be the help - but I don't know what I can do at this point short of just giving up.

I only fret about this because as I see it these people's lives at stake, and as soon as they die, that's it. It's over.

I just want to be able to help people in some small but meaningful way, especially the latter two, but their problems are beyond me. I wish someone could help me so that I could either not care so much or find something to do like put them in touch with a person or group who could do more for them.",08May2020,1
1049,"I already have other mental illnesses but stress is really getting to me. I'm so paranoid about everything, I'm hearing people yell around my house even if I'm the only one in. My brain will tell me someone is following me and it will keep saying that until I turn around and check. Even if I'm mountain biking which has landed me on my face. I'm terrifed and I don't know what to do",08May2020,1
1050,"Ever since quarantine happened I have been going crazy. I have been yelling at my boyfriend, I have been angry with my family, I’m lonely, I’m sad, and I don’t know what to do. I’m already on depression and anxiety medicine. I am on birth control. I don’t know what to do. I’m honestly scared that I might harm myself at this point. I feel like I’m pushing people away. What is wrong with me? I am so scared. I think I’m going crazy. I don’t want to be with myself. I want to be away. I can’t even sleep because my brain is too much. Please let me be okay. I just need help. I’m so messed up right now.",08May2020,1
1051,"Last night I was in my room sleeping when I heard my mom and dad fighting. My dad was pissed about the tv volume, which he claimed was too high (it really wasn’t all that high but he’s a sensitive sleeper). My mom refused to turn it down because she couldn’t turn it down without being able to hear the TV. He then started a pissing contest where he turned on his phone and blasted music, which was by far louder than the tv. I got pretty pissed off and went in to try to diffuse the situation. At this point my mom turned off the tv but my dad refused to turn off his blasting phone, hence the pissing contest. I got fed up and tried to grab the phone out of his hand but I couldn’t get it so I wrongly pushed him (not that hard, he only took one step backwards as he is much bigger than I). He then threw his water all over me and got pissed. Now he is stonewalling my mom and I and I don’t know what to do",08May2020,1
1052,"I am a recent biomedical engineering college grad. I had an internship with a medical device company, but I hated the job and struggled to keep up due to my worsening depression. I am trying to find a new job and I'm not sure where to look. I would prefer a non engineering job, but all I have is very specific biomedical experience. I have applied for positions at public libraries, but that's on hold because of COVID. I have applied to post office positions and a couple technician positions at a hospital, but nothing has come of that yet. 

What other places should I be looking for jobs? I have strong technical skills and I am not opposed to labor intensive jobs. I would prefer not a purely customer service job, but I am open to any other ideas.",08May2020,1
1053,"I have no idea where to post this so please let me know if there’s a better sub for it.

Basically, I’ve had ants in my room for a few weeks now. Not a ton, but enough to bother me. They are especially near my desk in the corner of the room, but can be anywhere. First, I got rid of any possible food in my room. Then I put out an ant bait. And then another ant bait. Then I noticed I was getting flying ants as well (but I’ve never seen any of them flying). Then i tried making a mixture of sugar and baking soda to kill them. They just won’t die. Nothing has worked. Often I find them dead or almost dead, but usually alive. My roommate thinks it is because my window is next to a tree. I just need to get rid of these ants.",08May2020,1

1055,"My gf and I has been very serious about the virus but we still see each other because we both know how much we're taking care of ourselves. My family is gathering for Mother's day and I would be the only one not going out of my siblings. My gf is amazing, she supports my decision if I go 100%, but if I go, I won't be able to see her for at least 3 weeks to a month. I want to keep bonding with her and building what we have. It seems like it wouldn't be fair to my family if I don't go because I'd be exposing myself or them but then I'm still seeing my gf. She lives with her parents so I see them too. They're both retired and they stay home all day in quarantine. I've heard my mom tell me that my dad isn't taking it as seriously because he still see friends and friends come over to his house. If I don't go, I'm afraid they will see it as me forgetting about my family because I'm in love or maybe they will see her as controlling me or whatever they might think. They don't know her yet, haven't had a chance to get them to meet due to this lovely virus. I don't know what to do, I'm between a rock and a hard place with this one. My gf is okay with me going or not going, but I really wanna keep seeing her and I also don't want to worry her about me. I feel like I'm butchering the situation since English is not my first language so please feel free to ask me questions to clear anything up.",08May2020,1
