1,"This is weird to explain and I am aware how narcissistic I sound, but I wish I had a friend who would treat me the same way I treat others. There is a proverb in my language ""don't do to others what you wouldn't like to be done to you"" and I basically do the positive equivalent ""do to others what you would like to be done to you.""

I try to pay attention to people when they say something and reply the best I can, wether in real life or on the internet so they won't feel like they're ignored. In conversations, I like to briefly explain to people who aren't aware of some references or haven't been there since the beginning of the conversation so they don't feel excluded and out of touch with the subject.

In group projects, I tend to try and make eye contact with everyone so it doesn't seem as I'm talking just to a person and excluding the others, giving the impression that I don't value their input.

I also enjoy to give reasonable advice like I would like someone to give to me.
I know it sounds selfish, but this is how I've been acting for a while.

I am proud to say that I am loyal and would always reply back to a person I like. 

However, I haven't met any person who would do the same for me. 
I cannot find to be able to connect with people who are overly positive or enjoy small talk, as it seems forced and fake to me, but this is how normal friendships form, form what I'm aware.

What am I doing wrong? This sounds lame, but I'm kind of lonely..",27Mar2020,1
2,"Hii!  
I have a crush on a girl in my uni and never got a chance to talk to her. Unfortunately when I got the gut to talk to her, COVID happened. Initially, I used to kind of check her out (because seeing her made me happy lol), but since she started noticing and we made eye contacts I kind of avoided that, just so that she doesnt thinks me as a creep. (I never saw her feeling uncomfortable)

However, I noticed lately that she has been kind of checking me out.  
Is this because I was doing the same initially and it just creeped her out or is it something else?  
Also, if we manage to talk how embarassing/awkward would this memory be?

P.S She's quite beautiful and has a number of guys trying to talk to her and never been in a relationship",27Mar2020,1
3,"So my problem is, I know a shitton of extremely cool girls who always try to reach out and befriend me, and old friends who try to reach out and befriend me again, and I just can't be bothered putting any energy in the convo's etc. But I do wanna have friends and be with friends every week and do fun things like everyone else but something always blocks me. It's as if people annoy me or I don't like them idk what it is, and I feel so ashamed and pathetic because I know people see me as a girl who doesn't have friends and completely changed and became introverted, but it's not even like that, idk what it is, do I just not like people?

4,"Hi all, I'm in desperate need of help. I'm a senior in high school, and I won't be graduating on time. I have no idea what to do. 

To clarify, I'm short on credits because I failed 4 classes last semester. I do 4 online classes, which happen to be the ones I failed. The only reason I do online is that my mental health just doesn't allow me to stay at school for 7 hours every single day, even with a quiet place offered in the counselor's office. I knew from the start online classes were not for me because it's just not how I learn and I am by no means a self-motivated person as I barely ever did my homework even when I didn't do online. But, I was pressured into taking them by my counselor, therapist, and mom and now I'm stuck and it's ruined my senior year. 

I should also note that I have ADHD, I'm autistic, I have extremely bad depression, anxiety, and stress. I literally want to kill myself because of how stressed I am, how far behind I am, and the fact that I'm not graduating on time and my counselor, therapist, mom, and psychiatrist are all aware of how I feel. I have a 504 and IEP but those mean nothing because the school does nothing to help me as me and my mom constantly have to fight with the school to actually do something. I've done none of my work during our quarantine because I keep thinking.. what's the point? I'm so far behind I won't finish my assignments by the time seniors get to leave, and I know I'll fail my exams again. I'm not going another year because my mental health won't allow it.

 The question is- what do I do from here? I don't want to go to college and I want to be a tattoo artist which doesn't require a diploma but it's preferred and if I don't have my diploma, I'm basically useless and I'll barely be able to get by. I'm thinking about a GED but my mom is extremely upset about the fact that I'm even considering it and keeps telling me I NEED to graduate, no matter how many times I've explained this situation to her. But, I just don't know if I'd even be able to get a GED with hearing just how difficult it is and how much studying goes into it, and I'm intimidated by it. I don't know about any other alternatives out there to a diploma, but I really need the advice. Thanks in advance.   


TL;DR Short on credits and online classes have ruined my senior year, stressed out and suicidal because of it, what alternatives do I have?",27Mar2020,1
6,"Please help!

I got a new rug and have had it for about two weeks. It reeked of fumes when I unrolled it. A few days later, my dog got a sever allergic reaction of his eyes d needed steroids. My vet thought that it was the VOC fumes from the rug as well

I’m running my Air Purifier and the app is telling me there are raised levels of VOC. 

I have vacuumed it almost daily, I have left baking soda overnight, and it still smells! 

I’m about ready to just get rid of this rug but it was expensive and I’d like to try anything else. I plan on getting plants, as I have heard that can also help get rid of the fumes, but with the current situation I’d like to avoid going into Lowe’s

16,"I (32F) am a receptionist at a doctor’s office. My office is one of many in this area, we all fall under one particular health system. My coworker “Sarah” (29F) is the floater receptionist; she fills in whenever someone calls out sick or if will come as backup when a clinic is particularly busy. Sarah and I are friendly and will sometimes take a parking lot walk during lunch or after work to get our steps in but we don’t talk to hang out outside of work. 

So...Sarah can be very negative. She is more often than not complaining about something, sometimes she complains about how much someone else complains. I’ve pointed this out to her before in a joking manner such as “girl you’re always complaining about something haha” and she acknowledges it but does nothing to change her habit. It think it’s worth mentioning that she doesn’t seem to have any friends. She recently had a birthday and she told me she spent the day shopping by herself and having dinner with her parents (she lives with them). If she goes on vacation it’s always with immediate family members or fellow churchgoers that are her parent’s age. From what I understand her former best friend suddenly stopped talking to her one day. No contact, blocked number and on all social media. She has no idea why. 


In the past few weeks with COVID-19, everyone is high strung and issues that normally are written off are met with explosive reactions. Long story short; there was a misunderstanding when Sarah messaged me (we have instant messaging to be able to communicate between clinics) stating that she was given the new task of pre-screening patients coming into her office. She’d mentioned taking temperatures. Instead of carefully reading, I saw the word temperature and assumed she was taking patient temps when in fact she was just asking questions like “have you come in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19” etc. I nonchalantly said out loud, wow they have Sarah taking patients’ temps outside her office. As you can imagine that statement spread and the bosses got wind of it. Officially our hospital system has not yet started taking people’s temps - that is actually starting this coming Monday. So when the bosses heard this they were alarmed because protocol wasn’t being followed. As you can imagine the entire situation turned into a he-said-she-said and I am to blame (100% not denying this, it was my fault for assuming and not carefully reading). 

But here’s my problem. This is not the first time something like this has happened, and it always involves Sarah. Sarah will tell me something, I thoughtlessly say it to someone else and it bites me in the ass. I realize this makes ME the toxic person. I don’t want to be toxic. I don’t want to be the gossip. But I’ve become that, and I hate it. So how do I stop this behavior?

In regards to Sarah, I understand the obvious solutions like ‘stay away from her’ ‘stop interacting with her’ but in reality this is not a feasible option. So how do I proceed? 

TL;DR My friendly relationship with a coworker often gets me mixed up into office drama. I fear I am quickly becoming (if not already am) a toxic coworker.",27Mar2020,1

20,"About a year ago, I had a sudden change in my mental health and life that completely changed everything that was going on in my life. I realized most of my ""friends"" were not the people I should be around, and that they were constantly disrespectful and looked down on me. I'm still in group chats and other areas of contact with many of them and keep getting into a cycle of reading/commenting on things, getting mad, and then not being in contact for a few weeks before I get curious about what they're up to. This isn't a healthy pattern for me, and most of my friends I still have a healthy relationship with are closely connected with the ones I no longer want contact with, so it's hard not to hear news or gossip about those people and take interest in them. Deep down, I still love most these people and really don't want to give them up, but I know they will never respect me like I respect them and I doubt I will be able to have a healthy relationship with them at any time. How can I stop focusing on these people? I have no outlets to make new friends in real life and so I just feel lonely when I don't talk to these people, even though I know I will just feel worse once I talk to them.

Hello, everyone.

I am an older gentleman who lives alone in the Pacific Northwest. I am retired and as such, I have a lot of time on my hands. Ordinarily, I used my time to volunteer at the Boys and Girls Club and partake in some hobbies outside the home.

With Coronavirus causing my state to go into quarantine, I am forced to spend quite a few hours alone at home.

I am a widower of 9 years and my children and grandchildren live across state lines and are unable to visit.

To stave off the loneliness, I thought I may pick up a new hobby. I’ve been told by Caden, my grandson, that video games are an immersive experience these days (a far cry from when they started as “Pong” ha!)

I’d like to give it a whirl. I am looking for recommendations for video games that can be picked up by a novice easily. 

As I understand it, I can play these games on a personal computer or I can purchase a video game console. Is there any benefit to purchasing the console?

Thank you in advance,

28,"About 2 weeks ago, my boyfriends tenant had not been feeling well. They never had much contact (he only exchanged money to him for a period of maybe 10 seconds) but he was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of pneumonia. My boyfriend had been vomiting a little and a slight cough but I didn’t worry to much because he is one of those people who get sick for really no reason many times. His family had more exposure to the tenant than him. Once the guy feel sick he isolated himself in his room. 

I havent been out in about a month but on Sunday my bf came over. (Call me a fucking idiot, I know.) but he said he felt much better and that he is fine and the guy didn’t have corona. His whole household was fine too. We even fought because I was concerned about getting my household sick and I was hesitant but we spent the night together. (Very close contact.) 

2 days ago, his tenant died. The doctor called and said it was due to kidney failure. (He was 60s, poor health, diabetic and just suffered a stroke a few months ago.) The doctor mentioned he had tested positive for COVID19 as well. I wanted to throw up. My BFs family isn’t too worried at all and my bf wants to get tested but says he is fine. He called the hotline to set up an appt for the drive though testing but they never called him back. I haven’t seen him since Sunday and I’m worried. I don’t feel fine. (Not jinxing myself) I’m taking my temperature every few hours, staying hydrated, resting, etc. 

I can’t get tested because I can’t drive (just a permit) and my bf is the one who can and he is just taking it slow not worrying. What do I do? I’m exhibiting symptoms. (Jinx) and now it’s just a waiting game on his results which even if he goes tomorrow can take several days. 

What do I do? I keep asking him to call again but there’s only so much control I have. His family said they are not gonna get tested because they ALL barely had contact. Once the guy started to feel sick he isolated himself, but doorknobs were still touched.",27Mar2020,1

31,"I started seeing this guy last year, we were together for about 5-6 months up until January. We stopped seeing each other because he wanted space due to personal issues, at least that was the ""official"" reason, because of his anxiety/depression i find it difficult to tell how he's really feeling sometimes. I really liked him (still do) so i can't say i wasn't upset, but i completely understood and there was no drama or anything. For context our last convo went like this.

**Him:** ""Hi I have this phone back I hope your well and the new job is ok .   I hope your not offended but I can’t see any one at the moment because of what happend I’m so parinoid""

**Me:** ""Yeah i know it's ok xx""

""Sorry i tried to call you the other night i was a bit drunk""

""Did it get sorted out or are you still waiting?""

**Him:** ""It’s still a bit up in the air.""

**Me:** ""it'll work out don't worry. I hope you find someone you can put your trust in, you deserve better than what you've gone through xx""

I also made it clear to him that i still cared about him, and i could be there just as a friend to hang out or chat whenever he needed, but after that i backed off because i didn't want to be pushy with him. I figured if he wanted to continue being friends he could always contact me, and i had things to focus on in my own life.

However now with COVID, I'm kinda worried. To be blunt he suffered from substance abuse, had pretty severe anxiety and depression, and from my perspective didn't really have much support in his life. He also lived for his son who he doesn't live with. With everyone being under quarantine I'm worried about how he's doing and have been thinking about messaging him to make sure he's doing okay, but i dont know if i should?

I know i still care for him, i just wanna be there as a friend at least, but am i just imposing? Should i stay backed off and forget about him? Are my feelings giving me stupid ideas? I don't want him to struggle to reach out because of his mental health issues, but i dont wanna assume that's the case and try to force myself back into his life.",27Mar2020,1

So I'm 28/m and 2 months ago I met a 26/f, we met at a friend's wedding and hit it off straight away.
We've been on a few dates and are in contact regularly but I've a small bit of an issue that I'm afraid to say to her.

2 and half years ago I asked a girl to marry me, I thought she was the one and well to put It lightly she didn't think the same about me.
I flew to her country, asked her parents( they were a little pissed she didn't find someone from her country) and popped the question. I flew home to finish up a few bits in my country and told her I'd be back in 3 months and we could look for a place and plan the wedding ect. She was so happy and we set out our plans. I flew home and after about a month she stopped texting me back, stopped answering my calls and eventually sent me a text with just ""it's over goodbye"" no explanation, no closure, nothing. I was devastated. 2 years of depression followed and I finally started to feel great again. Got into shape, focused on myself, hobbies ect. Everything is great.

Then 2 months ago I met this girl, I haven't felt anything at all for over two years but when I met her instantly I felt connected to her, it came as a shock because I thought I'd have given up all of that nonsense but now I'm back in it again.

But yeah, my problem is well, 2 parts to this problem actually, the first part is I'm absolutely TERRIFIED of being hurt, I'm paranoid and scared. I know it's a different person but how can I ever trust someone like that again? What if she's just in it for fun, I guess I could ask but if I do I'm afraid she will think it's getting serious and become uninterested. Yeah I guess it's a pretty common problem but I'm still a little shook even though im completely over the last relationship.

My second problem is I might be moving to the country that the ex is from. I wanted to live there for about 6 years and it just so happened I met my ex in uni and she was from there. I had my interview before I met this girl and it went well I'm just waiting for results. I'm not saying I should stay for a girl that I met two months ago but this feeling I have about her is really great and I don't want to lose it.  But... I'm scared of getting hurt.

37,"Yep. I know with everything going on right now this isn't exactly the most important matter but I just wanted to discuss this and see if anyone could offer advice.

Me and my university friends were, as far as I'm concerned, very close throughout our first three years of University. We spent most of our time together on various nights out, holidays etc. Due to personal reasons, I decided to defer university by a year so stayed on whilst they all graduated and moved away from the city. 

Over the years and as we have changed, I have found that my interests and beliefs have become alarmingly different to my former friends. In addition, I've found the actions they've taken to be immature and toxic for the people I had been close with for so long. For example:

&amp;#x200B;

* One of them started having sex with his current girlfriend while she was still with her fiance. This is of course considered by the group to be ""banter"".  

* Another always calls to catch up but proceeds to spend the duration of the call talking about themselves and not really taking any interest when I talk about what's going on with them. E.g. In our recent catch up, after talking their points, they proceeded to make a meal on FaceTime whilst I was chatting away.  

* Another has become extremely right wing since the Trump/Brexit era in 2016. I am honestly happy to discuss politics with anyone but he considers it to be almost like a Football match. During our last reunion as we walked from one bar to the other, he went up to a homeless person and said ""Where's your house gone, mate?"" before walking away.  

* Another who is a former flatmate of mine becomes extremely verbally and physically abusive when he is drunk. At one point, he would usually get punched by one of my other friends for winding him up too much. As you can imagine as someone approaching 30, I found this to be very fucking draining.   


The main catalyst for us having become distant was that I was unable to attend two of the group's stag do's a few years ago. One of them I could not attend because I was the best man at another stag do on that same weekend and the other was because my Grandfather's funeral was on the same weekend. For some reason, they had taken this as me not wanting to hang out with them which one of the group admitted.

  
Currently we've remained on good terms and met up at a reunion at Christmas. However, during this COVID-19 bollocks, I haven't heard from them. Today I discovered most of them in one of those Zoom meetings catching up. Even after everything that I've listed that would make them look like the biggest bunch of arseholes on the planet, I still naively miss the good old days when we were close.  


Am I right from now on to maintain a distance from them and to make an attempt to cut them out of my life?",27Mar2020,1
38,"i recently adopted a dog whom i love very very much. i do my very best to give her the best care i can offer, and i did months of research before i even adopted her in the first place. she's a chihuahua with a distaste for cats, she will launch herself at cats and try to attack them with a ferocity that i dont see in any other dog breed its kinda scary. of course i always always always keep a very close eye on her when she's around other animals. my problem is that this is the first time ive ever owned a dog, my family home always only had cats and maybe fish, but dogs weren't allowed. my patience is very very low, i get impatient and very upset very fast, especially since i had no prior exposure to dogs. thats not to say that i get angry at my dog, but it makes me feel terrible inside knowing that im getting upset over an issue that can be fixed with training and time and.. patience. does anybody have any tips on how to increase your patience level? i dont want to get mad so quickly but i cant help it and i dont know how to solve this by myself.",27Mar2020,1
39,"I'm a college student, and thanks to the corona virus classes are online, we are under quarantine, and everything is nuts.  I am living in another state for school, and so my parents want me to fly back since all classes are online. My friends however have offered me a place to stay with them, since we get along well and hung out so much. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I prefer to stay with  my friends here for a few reasons: I don't have to go through two airports (risking bringing the virus back home) , I will still be able to hang out with friends face to face and  I can study class material with them. My parents want me home because I have full health insurance in my home state so they can take care of me whether I am healthy or sick, and because they miss me. I really miss them too, but I am worried I won't study as well with my parents there, and it'll be more like high school. Additionally, my sister is already living at home and complaining of a slow internet connection and boredom. For me, I would also have some classes at 6:30 am due to timezone differences.

&amp;#x200B;

In a call, my dad essentially said I'll have to decide between my family and friends (not in a manipulative way, just more a blunt tone). I am torn on what to do. I love my family and miss them and over summer I will definitely visit when I don't have classes.

40,"I have some pretty bad self esteem issues and can honestly say I don’t like anything physical or personalitywise about myself. When people talk about things that hit any of my insecurities, usually they’re not even talking about me, I can immediately feel intense anger building inside. I used to just feel more self conscious and self loathing when a situation like this would arise but lately I start to feel irrationally angry. What’s worse is, because they’re comments weren’t directed towards me, they sense my anger and don’t know what’s wrong. I’ve never wanted to be that person who feels like every comment is an attack on them or that they’re overly defensive, but I’ve come to realize that I’ve always been this way because my self esteem has always been shitty. The only difference is it’s manifested in the form of anger rather than depression recently. I hate feeling like I can’t control my anger. How can I be less defensive and not perceive any comment that loosely pertains to my insecurities as an attack on me? Should I consider antidepressants?",27Mar2020,1

42,"Hi,

I've been working in a lab for 4 years, and just graduated with a BS in Biology. I did not think this through. I chose Bio because I thought ""well, there's probably money in this field"", and I had encouragement from others to continue with science. If money and employment weren't a factor, I would have chosen to be a music major in a heartbeat. I live and breathe music and art, I've always wanted to do that since I was little. And my lab job feels kind of soul-sucking to be honest.

It also feels like a waste quit my lab job (or science in general) and let this Bio degree amount to nothing, and possibly miss out on a better opportunity for savings and/or health insurance in the future.

I just feel stuck. I want to be able to have time for what I love doing, and have at least enough money to pay for modest living expenses. I should have thought my degree choice through better, but I can't go back and change that. Any advice for what career paths I could look into?

I have a younger brother who always has trouble of understanding french texts. He can read the lines easily but comprehension has always been an issue. 
 
We've tried to get him in after-school aide and also at home we make him some mock-up comprehension tests just to make him practice. Still, he finds it difficult to get even simple words. What I noticed is when he reads, he doesn't seem to process the meaning of the lines and just move on to the next. when i ask him if he read and understood everything he would say yes and when it comes to answering questions, he would blank out and say he doesnt understood the text he just read. 

I'm really trying to help him on his studies but even my methods of teaching him doesnt seem to work. 

So what could I do?

Due to COVID outbreak I started living with my boyfriend, he is 30 and I am 23. I was forced to move out of the previous place where I had lived and couldn't find a better solution in a few days. My family lives in a different city and he lives by himself, recently moved here too. It's been challenging but we are managing, especially with our working schedules being completely different. But the moment I run into a problem and we have talked about this many times, it is about his friends especially one friend. They have the same creative background and seem to get along perfectly. But on top of that they had a friends with benefits thing going on but were pretty clear about it not becoming anything especially because she is my age. Now, she and I talk from time to time, she was the first one to find out about our relationship and is really supportive if it. Me on the other hand... I am jealous and I don't like it. I don't think I will ever be as good as she is or be enough for him... And note this he has never made me doubt his love or anything, he is nothing but loving and supportive of me.

So by Tuesday the next day people were really talking crap and so I confronted them in a normal manner with how come you are talking shit I don’t have corona. It excluded quite quickly and I went to the owner of the shop to tell him what was happening. To me it seems like no one cared and nothing was really done about this stigma. The next day Wednesday I called the people out again and I proceeded to mock them about how much of a coward they are about this virus. If they were so scared about me having it why did they come to work. Well the owner came out because he heard me yelling then by mid day our shop decided to close down starting Thursday.

I've tried explain this to him, but he says I should be happy to hear criticism, the only reason I would upset is that I'm prideful enough to think I can't make mistakes at all.

I am blessed, and have worked my way and got a scholarship to college, and I came from a really poor household. Fast forward a few years, and here I am at my job. This would be my third year. This is a public sector job, not a private company

My big boss (third in chain of command) has been assigning me a heck of a lot of work, at odd hours (like for example, it is now nearly 3AM where I live), during the weekends, during the holidays with minimal disregard to my personal life. He is EXTREMELY workaholic, like to the point of this being a pathological problem. The man rarely sleeps.

He keeps asking me to do these reports, which he doesn't know literally take 8 hours of work (yes, continuous damn work). I tried telling him in a nice manner that these take a long time, but still zero disregard.

On days on which we have no tasks or anything really asked of us, he literally comes up with shit for us to do that no one asked for, no one wants to read, and no one gave,gives, or will give a shit about ever. I told him this is bad practice, but still he is persisting. Few minutes ago, I texted him telling him the report he wants me to send by 8AM is worthless and doesn't need to be done, but he insisted I do it. Did I mention that this is my weekend? where I live our weeknes are friday and saturday.

I have literally reached a boiling point that I wanna call him and just shout at him, and quit on the spot, but that would mean I have no income, an insanely disappointed parents, and being looked down upon in my community.

I (23) met my bf (24) on tinder nine months ago. He asked me to be exclusive right from the start. On the third month of our relationship I noticed on his phone (while he was showing me something,  I did not snoop around) that he still got the app. I tried to explain to him that it makes me have doubts and feel insecure. He claimed that he doesn't use it but he is not going to delete it because he doesn't like to be told what to do. I decided to believe him and respect his point of view. 

Fast forward today that I found out through instagram about an event back in October that he had claimed it was cancelled but it turns out it wasn't. It was a concert of his band in which he had invited me at first. Also, there have been some other incidents that made  me doubt his loyalty. 

So I decided to create a fake account and catfish him on tinder. I know it's not right for many reasons and I'm actually really embarrassed. But it worked. First of all he has uploaded new photos of him. Photos that I took. From our christmas dinner and out summer vacation. So, I superliked him and a few minutes later we matched and he sent me a message. While talking he lied about his job, his interests and he claimed he was single. He was eager to exchange phone numbers and was interested in meeting with me in person because he really liked me. After some messages I said goodnight and I deleted the account. 

The reason I am writing here is because I don't know if I should be honest about catfishing him or not. I took screenshots of the new photos he uploaded. I know I was not right to catfish him but I wanted to know the truth.",27Mar2020,1
65,"A little context here: my ex-boyfriend broke up with me four years ago for another girl, and started dating her two weeks later. I guess you could say it ended badly. As any sad girl would do I started finding out what I could about her, found out from her blog that she wanted to pursue a creative path, but couldn’t because of her parents. 

In the months after the breakup, I noticed she was visiting my tumblr page and design portfolio frequently. I put in an analytics tracker because I wanted to know who was visiting my page (It’s especially helpful during the job hunt since I like seeing what companies actually made their way to my portfolio). I knew it was her because she lived in a certain college town. 

Not gonna lie, I got a kick out of her visiting so frequently. This went on for months. She eventually stopped when I took down the design portfolio after landing a job. Radio silence for four years, fast forward to now.

My design portfolio is back up since I just lost my job a month ago. And what do you know, she’s back. She visits every week. One visit was from a random office in her state. I looked her up on LinkedIn, and it turns out she works there. She also started going back to my tumblr page. 

At this point, I don’t get a kick out of it anymore. I feel watched. Why is she visiting my pages so frequently? I didn’t even tell anyone my portfolio was back up. It’s VERY disconcerting to me that she knew that. I’m getting really paranoid. My theory is that she goes on my LinkedIn page more frequently than I thought? I stopped talking to my ex-boyfriend a long, long time ago. What should I do?

I haven’t bought any furniture yet, and this will be my first time living alone and doing a lot of the adult things alone like grocery shopping, budgeting, and the like. It’ll just be me and my dog, and for a better idea of my finances, I have a steady job and I’ll have about $500 extra per month after living expenses are taken out. It’s also worth mentioning that I’m still in the process of learning how to drive and I don’t know anyone else in the area aside from my ex (we moved up here for his job), but he’s being super helpful and is willing to drive me for essentials until I get my license!

John did not seem like the type to ever do this shit to me. He was so loving and caring and constantly expressing his love for me and doing SO much for me. It really just caught everyone off guard. 

Jason was always an ass lol but he built a trauma bond with me that I haven’t been able to shake still to this day. John knew the situation with my ex, I was always very honest with him and he accepted it as long as I would try to break the bond. 

Now I’ve cut John out obviously. My trauma bond with Jason just got worst after my breaking up with John cuz now we speak here and there again lol.

I noticed that for one option the recommended adapter was 12 voltages and 4 amps and for the other option the recommended adapter was a 12v and 10a.
I have a few questions. First, are all led adapter plugs the same? (I mean to connect to the LEDs, not to an electricity source, just to clarify.) And, second, how does the amount of amps affect how bright the led lights are, if they have the same voltage requirements. If there are less amps, does that mean the light is less bright, and if there are more, is it brighter?

83,"tl;dr - i was sexually assaulted from kindergarten to second grade, and from that point on, i pushed it all away, up until recently. i’ve been getting flashbacks and it induces anxiety. 


so, lets clear up some basics. im a 16 year old girl , i have diagnosed major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. i’ve been struggling with self harm since i was 12. i live comfortably, im not in a bad or abusive family situation. my main struggles come from my head and a few past experiences. 


when i was in kindergarten, i met this girl. she became my friend. she’s only a year older than me, which is why this situation is kind of weird. but anyways, we became friends. 

she eventually became my best friend in school. i was always hanging out with her, both during and after school. her mom became best friends with my step mom. they are still close to this day. 

i don’t remember all the details, but one day she came over to hang out after school. we had done this before and it seemed normal until she shut my door and told me that she wanted to introduce me to a “game.” now, im not going to go into harsh details, but this “game” involved her forcing herself onto me, kissing me, and touching me in places where no kindergartener should be touched. it was never directly in the “no no” spots, which is why i’ve always downplayed what i went through. but nonetheless, it was bad. and it always made me feel fucking disgusting. i always told her i didnt want to. but she would always tell me that if i refused to play it with her, she would go and tell everyone that it was /me/ who was doing it to her. 

yeah. that scarred me. 

this continued throughout kindergarten. she always came over to hang out at my house - there were no breaks. none. i remember at one point she made us lock my door and go into my closet. it was shit i dealt with on the daily. 

in first grade, shit started to get bad. she bullied me. she would tell me things like “you’re never going to be loved”, “you’re disgusting,” “you’re ugly,” etc. but when i would cry to her and tell her that i was going to tell my parents about what she was saying to me, she would threaten me. she would tell me that if i ever told ANYONE, she would tell everyone about what was going on - and again, that it was my doing. 

so i kept quiet. if i did not comply, i would be manipulated. i was bullied for so fucking long. i went my entire elementary school career with absolutely no self esteem. no one to go to. so i took it upon myself to solve my own issues. 

i got the chance to switch schools before third grade, and you can bet that i took that opportunity. i wouldnt see her as much, unless she came over. but then she would act like nothing ever happened. like it was all fake. 

from then on, i would lay in my bed at night and let it haunt me. it was a process, but by sixth grade, i completely dissociated from the trauma. it just didnt exist anymore. i didnt have to cry and night and i didnt have to feel so repulsed. 

i started feeling my symptoms of depression in sixth grade as well, and eventually i resorted to self mutilation. this went on for years, and by march of 8th grade, i was admitted to a psych ward for about a month due to a suicide attempt. this helped keep me safe, but i kept cutting, all from 6th grade to last night. i went about 8 months before i relapsed again - and that was about 3 weeks ago. it’s just been downhill from here. 

im coming here because i truly want to be able to get away from this. in the past 2 months, this trauma has tried to wiggle its way back into my thoughts. i see this girl every day at school, because summer before my freshman year of high school, we moved back to where i was originally and now we go to the same school. i dont really feel anything when i see her. sometimes when she gets friendly, i get anxious, but i just pretend like she isnt really real and that she cant do anything. my therapist doesnt know. my parents are clueless. the only people who know now are my boyfriend (we’re on a break with right now), some close friends, and the entirety of this subreddit. i’ve just been getting flashbacks that induce full fledged mental breakdowns - i am still incredibly self conscious to this day. 

im at a loss. im fucking horrified of telling any adult. i dont know if my therapist would have to tell my parents. they would NOT handle this well.  but i cant just hold it to myself any longer. it is destroying me. 

anything helps.",27Mar2020,1
84,"So, I am extremely close with my parents (I am 23). I live away, with my husband, pay my own bills and stuff. 

I am a practicing witch, and I recently started a blog that had been a goal of mine for a while about witchcraft and my journey as a witch. I posted about it a lot on Facebook. 

I was scrolling on Facebook and noticed that my dad had unfriended me. We had been friends on Facebook for 10+ years, so tons of memories and shit.

I called him and said ""why did you delete me off facebook?"" wholeheartedly expecting it to be a mistake and he says, ""because of the witch shit""

He says people at work asked about it, but he wouldn't tell me what they said. He works at a factory so I can't imagine it would be so detrimental. Plus, that means his coworkers were looking me up, because the witch shit wasn't on his page.

Anyway, do I have a right to be hurt? I am honestly heartbroken that he would do that , but I know I might be overreacting.",27Mar2020,1

Ok so first of all I really don't want this to turn into a debate on gun control, your personal opinion on guns aside, he goes to school in a fully red (republican) state so its not like people are against guns there. What options does he have?  (also sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but i tried r/legaladvice and it got removed for not being a specific legal question) 

I'll give as much info as I can while maintaining privacy, but basically my brother (I'll call him Sam, no not his real name) is a senior (4th year) college/university student in the US. He was set to graduate May 2020 before all of this happened. Before the incident Sam was in really good standing with the university (honor roll, dean's list, volunteer, campus research job, ROTC) and was working/living as a Resident Advisor (RA) in one of the on campus dorms since his 2nd year. He is in ROTC and as far as I can tell (from reading the student code of conduct), he is allowed to have a gun on campus because of this.

What happened was that as he was cleaning his gun, didn't check to properly ensure it wasn't loaded, and the gun went off. It shot through his dorm room door, but there were no injuries, just damage to the door and a small hole in the wall. The police came out to the scene, but he wasn't given any citations or any legal action as it was on campus, so all disciplinary actions would be taken through the university. And since the incident, he has been suspend and barred from coming on campus, including his student housing. 

The official policy from the university is that there is first a decision made about whether or not the individual is at fault (after both sides have time to bring forward evidence), then a hearing to decide the punishment. But Sam didn't try and deny fault, he admitted what he did and was up front and honest from the beginning by self reporting to both local police and the university. The thing is this all happened right before COVID-19 sent the whole country into lock down, so it's kind of muddying the waters for the disciplinary procedures. This past Tuesday (3/24/20) he had an online meeting with some of the people responsible for deciding his hearing (I'm not sure their specific job titles) and they basically told him that if they do let him Graduate (keep in mind he was just 2 months shy of graduating when this happened with a spotless record) that it would basically be like nothing happened because the entire university is shut down due to COVID so denying him university access/privileges is moot because nobody has them right now anyway.

As of right now his hearing is scheduled for mid April (more than a month since the incident, but I within the university's 4-6 weeks scheduling window for these hearings) But since the incident he's been suspended and hasn't been able to participate in any of his classes and at this point even if they do decide on April 13th to let him back he is worried that he won't pass his classes and will not graduate anyway. It seems to me that the University is being purposefully obtuse and bureaucratic in letting this draw out as long as possible so that he fails out or has to repeat a semester even if they can't outright expel him. And it seems unfair to change his punishment just because of COVID-19. for example, if the punishment for a crime is house arrest it's not fair to change that punishment just because everyone else is also staying inside right now, right? Is the university changing his punishment because of the COVID situation legal or constitutional? Is there anything he can do to speed up the process so he doesn't miss any more of his course work?

What can he or I do in this situation to help him? Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I just want to do whatever I can to help him. I'll answer any questions I can. Thanks so much in advance.",27Mar2020,1

I work for a car dealership (service department) in a county with a few confirmed cases, under an extremely lenient “shelter in place” order. I’m also in a huge metroplex. So many businesses are “essential.” 

I’m currently on furlough, as is 90% of the service department. I volunteered. I pulled my 1 year old son from daycare. I would rather take a financial risk than risk my life for a company that doesn’t give a fuck about me. The managers don’t give a fuck about employee safety, only the bottom line. They’ve made that incredibly clear. We have an employee who has COPD and has been there for years. He made a really emotional decision to stay home without pay because he’s afraid for his life. Our managers response? “Ok. How many cars have we written up for service today? Make sure everyone stays focused.”

The Fire Marshall has been coming by to check compliance, so any “measures” they’ve put in place is just to prevent them from getting shut down. Rumor has it they shut down a dealership across the street for not practicing social distancing. 

I have loved ones who are still there. Namely, my boyfriend and my sister in law. Actually, my sister in law who just found out she’s pregnant was just told she needs to work 6 days a week because her entire department is on furlough. I gave her my home stash of sanitizer for her desk before I was put on furlough. My boyfriend is terrified and has had the stress shits for almost two weeks. The service department has no hand sanitizer, and I just got word that our GM denied an order of 4 gallons because it was too expensive. We are running out of Lysol. There are no steering wheel covers, no seat covers, and they’re running the skeleton crew to death. I am terrified for my boyfriend and my sister in law. 

Part of me wants to call the fire Marshall or OSHA. Or the health department. I think a lot of people would be relieved to shut down. But, part of me feels like I don’t get to make that call for everyone still working there, earning a check. I’m having such a hard time with this.",27Mar2020,1

For mental health it is essential, but I don't think its essential for all of our staff to be there daily since we can't do full group activities. We have been told by management that we are essential, and now we are helping in other departments. They are now having us help with other tasks and training us to do some of the work of nursing assistants. All things I am not comfortable doing.

When I hired in for my job 5 years ago, there was no way I would have predicted that this is what I would be doing. I do not have a degree, nor an interest in being a medical professional. I have a degree in the arts and that is what I typically do with the elders. I can't do that now, because of how things have been shut down, but my employer is still deeming me essential even though I am not doing my regular job.

Prior to the outbreak, I was considering leaving this job anyway, but now it feels like I would be jumping ship at a critical time and I don't want to abandon the people I care for or my coworkers at a time of crisis.  But I also DO NOT want to do nursing work. It is not my training, nor something I have the stomach for. They have told us its not a matter of if our staff will get it, but when. I will be exposed.

My other concern is that I have multiple family members (not at my house) who are high risk because of pre-existing health conditions. I do not want to spend months apart from them if needed to keep them from getting exposed because of where I work. I am also afraid I wouldn't be able to find another job right now in my field.

A close family friend tested positive for covid19 has been on a ventilator for two weeks after their symptoms were dismissed because they didn't meet the travel requirement to be tested at the time. They have began showing some signs of improvement though. 

On top of that I was laid off from my part time serving job immediately. My sibling and I live with our parents, and my sibling has been quite sick for the past week. Again, can't get tested because it's not severe enough but a doctor we saw told us it could be covid19. I told my other full time job about it and they told me to stay home in case it was covid19.

I’m having a problem with one of my “friends”. When I was 14 she tried to befriend me but she was so clingy and always wanted my attention so I just stopped responding as much and she kinda got the message and we became friendly acquaintances. I had different friends for a long while and this girl would still say hi to me on the halls, but then last summer I made a grave mistake. I suppose I had forgotten what it was like to be her actually friend and during the summer I started to response to her messages and we would actually hang out like friends. It was fun for the summer but when school started and things got busy she got clingier and clingier. I am a very independent person and having this person who constantly asked my whereabouts and would ask me to walk home everyday was not my style. I got kinda distant and she would tell everyone that I was acting strange even though I just didn’t want to talk to her. What I found out during that time is that she was an obsessive gossiper and would constantly talk about me to my other friends (one of them being my best friend who would tell me about every time she would talk about me). It really bothered me when she did this and  the worst part was that she would flirt with my crush/ex-hookup. He would never be attracted to her but it just sucked because she would lie about it too. These days I started to talk to her but you know the saying: “give an inch and they talk a mile”. She has gotten even more creepier and stalkerish like towards me and texts me daily even when I don’t respond. My best friend sees this too and says it’s like obsessed with me. It’s really tough because she’s a nice girl but I just can’t handle how she acts towards me but I don’t want to be mean I just to be friends with someone who isn’t crazy.

I'm a 19 (f) who’s currently feeling lost about how to find a side hustle in order to be able to support myself financially while I pursue a career in music. I live in Los Angeles and currently live with my grandma. I recently got my real estate license and had this idea of selling rentals until I had enough to move out by this summer but now I'm rethinking this whole real estate idea altogether. It’s got me thinking that maybe real estate just isn’t something I’m truly passionate for. I think about how I have to be consistent in order to grow my business and be on the phone calling people all day because ideally every agent wants to sell houses. I currently have a mentor who’s pushing me to do more than just doing leases and while I appreciate what he’s doing for me I honestly feel a lot better doing rentals. What i'm really asking is if anyone can give some advice about how I could financially support myself in LA with some side hustle, job, internship or something I’d truly enjoy. It occured to me that I don't want to be on the phone all day calling people and building one business while building a music career on the other side as well. I don't see it as I’m making excuses as I really want to put all of my focus into my music while being able to make a stable income on the side just to move me out. My other interests are in film, photography, fashion, video editing, and creating content. I figured I could create a YouTube channel by the time it’ll take to make enough in order to move out is going to take awhile.

130,"I'll just get straight to the point. I live with my step-grandad with my grandma and little sister.

My little sister and I have never had a close relationship with neither of our grandparents. This changed recently when I started to notice that my grandad was becoming close with my little sister. She's 13 just for a reference. At first it was a gradual change. My grandad would be more inclined to talk to my little sister than me. I've been made aware that my little sister and him have private conversations together when no one is around- appropriate conversations. 

Just recently my little sister has told me a few scenarios where she's felt incredibly uncomfortable. She told me that my grandad would kiss her shoulder from behind a few times. This was a surprise since we've never been affectionate towards him growing up- we've never even hugged before! I was none the less weirded out but tried to console her by saying, ""You're his favourite. It's probably just a father-daughter love thing."" She later added that he would randomly come up from behind her and run his finger down her spine just above her butt. I once again brushed it off and told her it's because he's affectionate towards her. 

 She continued to tell me another scenario. I was present. We were looking for keys in my little sisters room and for some reason, my grandfather went searching for them inside her dirty laundry. After witnessing this, my little sister quickly stated it is definitely not in there as she too felt very uncomfortable. He didn't stop and continued to thoroughly look through the full hamper. I found it nasty and unnerving and I couldn't find a plausible reason behind it. 

Just yesterday after returning from a walk, my grandad was outside with this weird metal pole extending on the table (It looked like he was trying to connect to the radio). I glanced at it without a second thought and headed straight inside. My little sister stayed behind. That night she told me she had witnessed the most uncomfortable conversation. She was playfully asking what the crazy contraption was and at some point he said ""bend over and I'll show you."" My stomach dropped. 

He's only made me uncomfortable once. That was when we were in the car and I accidentally blew pass a male pedestrian who had appeared very quickly. I mouthed a sorry to him and my grandad who was beside me said, ""he won't get angry with a hot girl in the car."" I was weirded out but brushed it off as a compliment.

I feel conflicted. He's such a nice dude and I don't want to think that he is a pedophile. What's worrying is that I leave for college next year and my grandma is always working long hours. This means she'll be alone with him for long periods of time. I'm probably just overreacting but my gut feeling is telling me otherwise. 

I don't know if this is an important note to add, but he is very protective over her. If we're joking around with mild insults like ""you're clumsy"" or ""dumdum"" he'll swing into full protective mode and assure her that she is not all that. He'll also get angry at the person who called her that.",27Mar2020,1

I submitted a request through my boss to HR, but my boss said it does not look like they are going to approve it. The company's solution is it has staggered the office hours from either 9-1 or 1-5, but I feel like that is not enough. There are several hundred people in the building and my desk is less than 6 feet away from the next person. I told my boss I am opting to use pto until further notice instead of coming in, but I really feel like this is majorly fucked up. I have been working from home with no issues for 2 weeks now and even when I am on pto I am still going to be expected to finish my work on time. So that means I will be working while still eating up all of my pto hours I had planned on using to visit family later in the year. The area I live and work in has issues a “Stay Home, Stay Safe” EMERGENCY ORDER that goes into effect this weekend, but I doubt that will have any effect on my company's decision for me to still so into the office as we are an essential business.

134,"So my ex and I broke up about 6 months ago. We had been together for 4 years, got together in highschool, and had been friends for two years before that so I had met her family and been friendly with them before we even started dating. The break up was kind of messy, but I don't think she ever really told them how messy it was (she cheated), but despite that we are still on decent terms. I did see her dad and step mom after the break up, and actually played some videogames with him online as recently as December. I shot her mom a text about a month after the break up just to thank her for how well she treated me, and she sent me a text on my birthday a month ago. They have both made it clear that I am welcome any time and everything and said sweet stuff about me still being a part of the family. Is it weird that I haven't talked to them more?

I especially thought about shooting a text just to check in and see how they were doing with all of the Corona stuff, but I don't know if that is appropriate or necessary? Thoughts?

me and my best friend went from being best friends to fwb. a few months later and he admitted he has feelings for me (and i’ve been having them for him). he and i aren’t dating yet, but we’re not just friends w benefits anymore. however, we both agreed we don’t want to text 24/7 as we both feel well run out of things to say, and it’s just better to talk when we want to/or have something to share.

however, sometimes i text him and he doesn’t bother responding. he either leaves me on read or gives a bare minimum response. this could be me sending a snapchat, or a meme, or an actual text, he’s been very low energy response lately and it kind of sucks because it doesn’t really seem like he wants to talk to me. he does have a lot going on academically and sport wise, but i am also extremely busy training by myself for sports (since practices are cancelled due to covid 19), academically, and i work at a grocery store and my hours have sky rocketed. yet whenever he texts me i always take time to respond and rarely leave him on read. 

i know we agreed not to text 24/7 and i’m fine with that.... but i feel like in the time we do text it should be more sacred/special since we don’t communicate 24/7. idk... how do i get over not getting a response all the time? or getting a response w the energy i want period?",27Mar2020,1

137,"Hello all! I hope you're all safe and healthy. I'm gonna give a little background first.

I live with my grandfather and my mom and dad, in North Carolina. I work at a Starbucks kiosk in a Harris Teeter, my mom works in a nursing home, we take all the precautions we can while at work. Our county is on lockdown right now and both of us have been deemed as essential staff (I serve coffee, I DON'T SEE HOW I'M ESSENTIAL). My mother has to work because she pays for the bills, my dad is starting a home business and is the one going out for groceries. 

My main issue is my work... I need advice on whether I should stop working and stay home! 

I know we are going to get the virus! It might be a little while, but we will definitely get it either from my mom or from me or even both of us! I am extremely stressed out trying to decide whether to stop working for a while or to keep raising some emergency money in case my mom gets REALLY sick. The odds of her getting REALLY sick are really low though (she's 52). 

I am extremely worried about my grandfather. He is 80 years old, has asthma and several other underlying conditions. I have asked my mom what we would do when we get sick, and she just says we'll deal with what we need to deal with. She's just as worried as I am. But when I ask about my grandfather getting really sick, she says we will prop him up in a chair and do the best we can. When my mom told my grandfather that she was worried about him, he said he has to die sometime. It was kinda funny at the time because we're the type of family that enjoys a little bit of dark humor. Now, I don't find it as funny.

I came to this impasse because I feel like this virus is going to kill my grandfather, and I can't do anything about it. I see online that if you can stay home then you should stay home, that makes me even more confused on what I should do. I also see online that even if he was admitted to a hospital there is very little that they can do to help him. 

PLEASE I need advice on whether I should stay home from work or keep working. At the very least some reassurance would be lovely.

P.S. My grandfather is technically living on borrowed time, he was told that he would never even make it to 70 years old.",27Mar2020,1

They would never accept money and I know my mom liles to do things for me like my laundry for example (she doesnt like it when anyone but her does laundry and I cant even do it in secret because the laundry room is only accessible by going through her room).

151,"Hey, this is going to get kind of long. 

My friend is also my ex. We remained as best friends until around two months ago, where we downgraded to being friends. For simplicity's sake, I will call him Bob.

I went to Bob for a lot of my problems with mental health and parents, and he's given me a lot of advice on it. I feel like I haven't really taken steps to actually take that advice and as a result, ended up mentally burdening on top of what he has to deal with in university.

Near the end of February, I was about to submit my additional information form for university (I will refer to it as ADF). My English tutor and I had spent a lot of time working on it and it was more or less ready to submit. Bob asked if he could take a look and I thought 'sure, why not' and sent it to him. He made some suggestions that I kind of disagreed with. 

We got in a discussion about the ADF and it spiraled down from there. I told him that I didn't want to continue on this topic because I was already stressed from schoolwork. It spiraled from the ADF to things like ""sticking to my traditional tutors and traditional parents until they have full control over my life"", calling me a coward because I continuously told him to stop talking about this topic, and saying how it's pathetic that ""I can't handle the truth"".

My parents are relatively traditional but I can tell that they're (trying) making an effort to not repeat past mistakes. My English tutor isn't really 'traditional' - I would say she's relatively 'modern' but more practical when it comes to writing.

The conversation continued to spiral down from there, comments about 'true love' and such. The thing that really drove me to block him was when he said that I couldn't look him in the eye 'because he was ugly'.

A friend of mine passed a message from him. tldr, it was about how he was done with the friendship and how I've only given him 'bad impressions of other people'. I admit that I have given him bad impressions of others and need to keep that in check. My friend thinks that it isn't right for me to blame him being blunt towards me otherwise I'd be running in circles again and again. She also mentions that I only care about talking to my friends about how blunt Bob is.

After that message, I said 'thanks.' and thought everything was done. I could go and improve on my personality and just move on in general. 

A couple of weeks ago, I went to chat in a discord server and I found that he's made a post about me, saying similar things like how I need to stand up to my parents but in a more 'nicer-ish' way. At the beginning, he mentions about how I've blocked him and that he won't apologize for the things he said. He made no mention about the comments he made about 'true love'/looks and hopes that I have a good future and take the advice to heart. 

Timeskip to last week, I got into some trouble with the server (not going to dive into it, my actions aren't excusable and were wrong). I went on an alt on Instagram to go and apologize to him about it. We talked for a bit and he mentions that he doesn't like how I was kind of treating him as a stranger at this point (I was acting distant). I told him that if acting distant is considered treating him as a stranger, then that's that. He went on about how he was confused on what to do and that it felt awful that I was treating him distantly, which was understandable. He mentions that he was confused about how my actions (ie. blocks) are saying 'don't talk to me' yet I was talking to him right now.

I don't think I should have said the following so bluntly, but I told him that I only talked to him today was for the discord server situation and that if 'he didnt know what to do, then go and improve himself. He doesn't need to be on talking terms with me to do that, does he?'

After I said that, he said that I was being a 'dick about it' and that he was done talking. He mentions how he doesn't like me treating others and expecting them to be exactly how I want them to be, how he's tired of trying to live up to expectations of being my friend, find someone else to be toxic with, and that he 'couldn't care less about being anyone other than himself'.

I was kind of surprised by this 180 angle and told him that I never said he had to be a perfect friend. Improving himself is not equivalent to being perfect. He goes on to say about how people snap when they're stressed (referring to the ADF), says how he went to his friends to ask 'how can I help her?', and says that he dislikes me for not letting him talk about his point. I quickly end the conversation at that point because I knew it would both of us nowhere. He essentially re-summarizes what he said before, saying that he's improved a lot for me, over these years, and that I never stopped asking for more.

For context, this isn't the first time he's 'snapped' at me. I don't recall as clearly as to what he's said and I don't want to comb through our DMs, but they were pretty hurtful. We resolved those pretty soon after they happened.",27Mar2020,1

153,"My brother is 21 years old and is still in community college. He is tested when he was younger for autism and he is on the spectrum but my parents have always said he seems like he doesn’t have it but I think he definitely does. 

Part One:
Anyways, my brother doesn’t know how to do anything good for himself and for school. I love him to death and we are like best friends but he doesn’t even listen to me when I try to talk to him. Its been so stressful my whole life seeing my parents try so much with him to get him to do school. They have been on his ass, backed off, tried to get help for him in school. Nothing that we have tried has worked. It seems like there no hope for anyone in my house. If school wasnt for him, we would support him but he doesnt have a job and we have road his ass in the past to get himself one. He lies to my parents, me, his girlfriend about school and everything. He has failed most of his classes and if he fails anymore, he is at the level of almost being kicked out for his gpa. 

If theres anyone that has someone they know in their life with autism, could you give any advice on how we can help him or work with him or anything to get him to just do something good for himself?

Part Two:
After saying that about him with school, just this week my brother and I’s college “came back” from spring break for school. Since the coronavirus has prevented live in person classes, we are now doing things online. My mom has been very adamant reminding us of our work we have to do. 

My brother has had a girlfriend for long time now (idk how she sticks with him through everything. god bless her) and she is very close with my family. She knew that he had an assignment due at 8 for one class and another at 12. She told us this and my brother lied saying it was due tomorrow, eventually saying I’ll do it later. He was being a total dick. He ended up completing the assignment for 8 around 5 mins before it was due and didn’t understand why we were complaining to him all day and upset why he waited until the last minute. 

Then comes the one due at 12. He doesn’t start working on it until 10 at night. His girlfriend and I were minding our own business playing minecraft and he starts yelling because he accidentally deleted all the work he did for the assignment. We just sit there not saying anything. She then looks up giving a weird face and my brother THROWS HIS LAPTOP ACROSS THE ROOM AND BREAKS IT ON THE FLOOR. He threw it bECAUSE SHE GAVE HIM A WEIRD FACE. 

He then blames HIS GIRLFRIEND AND I FOR THROWING HIS OWN COMPUTER and breaking it. What. The. Hell. I don’t know what to do here. After that went down, we go to bed to sleep on it and then wake up the next day. He is all upset and in a bad mood and is continually blaming us for him throwing the computer. This went all day long and he doesn’t understand why or how he could possibly even be at fault for this and truly believes that us telling him to do his assignment and for giving a weird looked forced him to throw his computer. Just in the past hour, my brother’s girlfriend and I were done with his bs so we went upstairs to bed and then she shoots me a texts. Its a screenshot of my brother requesting HER TO PAY THE EXACT AMOUNT OF MONEY OF THE COMPUTER HE BROKE BY THROWING HIMSELF AND BREAKING IT. 

Please help. How do I get him to change his mind or how do I even work with this? This thing has gotten to the point of craziness I dont even know how to deal with.",27Mar2020,1

Anyway, before study hall I went to the bathroom and when I came back he was sitting across from my seat. I thought he was cute. When he saw what I was reading, ( To Kill a Mockingbird) he started a conversation about Dauntes Inferno. I thought he was smart and east to talk to. At the end of class he asked if i had snapchat and I gave it to him. We FaceTimed later that night. We talked about everything and anything. I was surprised to discover felt really comfortable talking to him because I’m a bit shy. We made plans to hang out over the weekend. He talked about cuddling. 

The next day we hung out in the morning before school. I brought him his favorite candy. My friend maddie was there with her boyfriend and she said that he’d looked at me in a way she’s never seen anyone look at me before. We’ve been friends for a long time. 

The rest of the week, he ignored me. I didn’t see him in the halls and he skipped study hall.
On Monday he called me immature for being upset but apologized. He said he was just feeling off. My teacher asked why we weren’t talking. She told me i get all smiley when I talk about him.

164,"Personal Conflict

So lately I've been feeling this way, and I feel like I need to get it off my chest and hopefully get some advice for this. 

Lately I've been feeling that I'm not good enough for my girlfriend, now let me explain. The reason I've been feeling this way is because there's been so many people saying how I look ugly and that I'm a failure and other things. Someone in her family said that ""opposites attract"" and that my girlfriend is much better looking than me and that she doesn't even know why she chose me. I've had people in my family tell me that they don't know why she chose me and that I'll grow up to be nothing and that my sister will be the successful person and I'd just be the person working for her. This is just putting it bluntly. I personally think I don't look bad, but I guess that's just my own opinion. I've been told that my nose is too big, my ears are too big, I just look bad in general. My friends have even said my nose looks bad. Now let me just say that my girlfriend is indeed great looking, and personally I don't know if what they're saying is right about me. I mean, my nose certainly doesn't look good, but other than that I don't see why so many people are saying that my general looks are bad. And this isn't the last reason. 

Now this may help you understand me better, or I may just be rambling on and giving info that you never needed to know. But I grew up with comprehension skill troubles, and I went to therapy for it and had school therapy for my problems, and I do think it didn't entirely help me, but it did make it a lot better, but anyways. My next reason is I feel like I'm also nothing. I'm not a talented person, and I don't know what I'll end up doing in my life in the future. I want to hopefully do something in the music industry, like music marketing, distribution, maybe even a label. But these dreams and hopes seem like such a stretch, and something that a person like me couldn't achieve. Now my girlfriend is a more talented person. She can do art like I've never seen, she's smart, everything that I'm not, I mean I can draw I guess. But my drawing ""talent"" couldn't ever pay bills. And sure I can do business and market things, but what if that fails if I make it a career? I have basically no back up plan, business is the only thing I'm decent at.

I just needed to get this off my chest and hopefully get some help with this. Thank you if you read through it all. Please give me advice if you can. Thank you

I slept close to 10-12hrs a day
Routine was wake up work, microwave something, sleep and repeat. 

I got help with my depression, or so I thought, mid February when I began the SSRI lexapro. After consistently taking it for a month my boss stopped me in the hall before my shift this morning and asked if everything is okay. 

I didn’t realize I was extremely unfocused and making far more (inconsequential) mistakes. Thankfully I’ve been there awhile and it was just more out of concern for my well being. 

I’m just really trying to figure out where I’m at here.. do I tell my doctor so she can wein me off when I can’t see a specialist for ADHD as she recommended. Going with zero treatment and watching myself fall back into depression?

She made a great dinner and everyone was happy and we ate. Afterwards was when it got bad. It’s always been a rule in the house “whoever cooks doesn’t clean” I agree with that rule and follow it. Although, everyone- no matter who cooks is responsible for their own plate. My sister decided to “order” me to clean her plate since she cooked dinner. It wasn’t in a nice tone, it was demeaning and honestly just rude. So I told her no. I told her I was doing the family dishes (serving plates, cooking plates, putting the left overs away) but she could do hers. You could tell she got pissed off that  I told her no and her boyfriend said verbatim “if you can’t even do the dishes, you are going to be a bad mom” I took it really offensively but I didn’t say anything and I finished up the dishes I had to do and left.

I moved into my apartment on Sunday before my city went on lockdown. I was really excited about living on my own but I’m kinda upset it happened this way. I was looking forward to decorating my apartment and having friends come over to celebrate this moment in my life but now I’m feeling really lonely and finding it difficult to be on my own. I’ve unpacked my clothes and I’ve been staying busy with online classes and working from home but I’m also finding myself contemplating lots of things. It doesn’t help that I just got out of a bad relationship and I was thinking this big move would distract me and help me move on quickly. I’m just sad and being alone in isolation is making it even more difficult. I’ve been going on walks around my neighborhood to get some fresh air and get away from being locked up all day. I just wish I had someone to spend time with rather than staying up crying or doubting my ability to be independent. It doesn’t make it any better that my hobbies only include reading and journaling. There’s only so much I can read or write before I get exhausted of doing the same thing over and over again for hours.

Does anyone have any tips or recommendations on how I keep myself distracted or start a new hobby? I can’t really drive to any places to buy stuff but there has to be something I can do from home that doesn’t require much. I just don’t want to feed into my sadness anymore.

168,"Hey guys- I don’t know where else to seek advice but here goes. This seems rather silly and unimportant but you don’t understand how trapped I feel because of it. And it has been going on since way before COVID-19 so I know it’s not just be going crazy due to isolation.

I’m going crazy due to my situation at home. My sister and mom are against me, while my dad ignores the situation entirely. You can read some of my past posts about what has been happening. This is the ninth time I’ve talked about it this week don’t feel like explaining again. It seems silly as I am in no way in physical danger, but being told to argue about all of this for hours each day is making me extremely depressed. I don’t want to fall back into suicidal behavior or self harm. And I don’t ever want to turn to drugs.

I need to escape this situation at home. Due to what my mom has told other family members and shown my sister, my relationships with them are ruined as well. I don’t want to be a user and stay at other family members homes. This past few months I have been going through prescription Klonopin withdrawals due to my suicide attempt, and I honestly have been extremely short temper, hence why I try to not interact with people to avoid me being snappy.

This has gone on for years. In many forms. I know I’m not perfect but for my mental health I need to escape.

My mom and I just had a huge argument and it is clear she sees no wrong in her behaviors and even if she does she does not plan on changing or remedying anything. I need to leave. Both isolating in the bedroom and interacting with my mom won’t do me any good.

I’m at my grandparents house in SoCal. I plan on leaving soon, and will leave them some money and also a note and some texts explaining where I am, updating them, and also apologizing for the noise of the argument. **Also pls don’t offer me to stay at your place, there are some strange people on reddit and I don’t trust internet offers.** 

I just need to get away from my mom, dad, and sister. I just don’t know where to stay, how to get money, etc. I’ve been financially dependent on my parents for most of my life.

169,"A little background information before I get any judgement - I am a 23 year old successful, attractive female who lives in a very cold environment and is moving away to grad school where it is warm. I applied to undergrad there as well and always vacate there. I am NOT moving away for a man. The idea of “chasing” a man is foreign to me. Usually I am the one being chased.  

Now, let’s get started...

Flashback to the summer of 2018 - my friends and I met a charming, handsome man named “Mike” [26 now] who was in my town for the summer for work. His hometown is right near where I’m going to grad school, so I was immediately intrigued (but didn’t show it). I was in the process of ending a horrible relationship, so he wasn’t an option at that point because I don’t believe in jumping around like that. Anyway, Mike and I became very close over the summer. We would hangout during the day and into the night doing fun outdoorsy things. He ended up meeting all of my friends and even went to my cousin’s bonfire with me. We remained monogamous and, although he’s VERY flirty, he never hit on me because he knew I just got out of a relationship and respected my boundaries. 

After the summer ended, he had to leave. A week before he left, we ending up having sex a few times. Absolute fireworks. He got another job offer VERY far away in an expensive place to travel to. We texted and Snapchatted a lot, but eventually I got the feeling that Mike wasn’t interested because it was so unrealistic because of distance. We ended up falling off, but it didn’t stop me from thinking about Mike daily. I was really hurt. Throughout the next year, he would randomly call me out of NOWHERE and we would talk for hours to catch up. But in my head, I’m still thinking he’s a fuckboy because he doesn’t ACTUALLY want me. If he did, then he would talk to me more, right?

Flashback to summer of 2019 - I got into a relationship with someone named “Rob” [30]. This relationship was a mess. I’m not going into details - but Rob was a possessive jerk with some mental illnesses. I posted a photo of Rob &amp; I on my Instagram story. Mike randomly reacted to it and said that I “still look as beautiful as ever”. Rob saw this message, got infuriated, messaged Mike saying to “stay away”, and made me block Mike on everything. I complied out of respect &amp; I felt as though it was inappropriate of Mike to message that. 

Flashback to December of 2019, Rob and I broke up so I added Mike back on everything recently. Turns out, Mike left his job is back in his hometown, where I am moving to in the fall for school. He continuously tells me to go visit him but he is living with his parents and has never offered to pay for anything or come and see me (I have my own house to myself). He has said he would “love to have the chance to date” me. I’m not sure if I believe him due to the lack of communication and effort. 

I’m wondering if Mike just wants to have sex with me as payback to my ex and is he going to become uninterested in me again.",27Mar2020,1

171,"Backstory: me and my gf knew eachother for 3 years before dating and we were kinda FWB when we weren’t dating other people and when we started dating (half a year ago)she used that against me as “using her” and would think I was cheating on her at times when I have never, and we’ve argued a few times over this topic

Sometimes she seems uninterested in our texts and I ask her if she is but I can kinda by the way she texts (if that makes sense) so today I got fed up and thought about the pros and cons of the relationship and the cons outweighed the pros and I finally got the courage to break up with her but I couldn’t, she told me how much she loves me and trusts me and how I’m the best and longest she’s ever had and I just couldn’t do it, I almost broke into tears reading it but I don’t know what to do

Long story short, I [21F] met him [21M] my freshman year college and it was obvious that he wanted to get to know me from the very beginning. He eventually became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he showed up with hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what he wanted and he said he didn't want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year, nothing really happened. He made the effort to hang out with me here and there, but we never actually hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to talk a lot through Snap and he tagged me on stuff on Facebook. When classes began, he immediately asked me to chill the very first week. This became a consistent thing throughout the school year. Every time we hung out, he tried to hold my hand. Some things he did that made me think he wanted a relationship was: he would always pay for my coffee, bought wine a couple of times so we could drink it together in our dorms, bought and cooked me food (dude specifically bought me steak too cause i asked for it), bought me a bottle for my birthday after I jokingly asked for one, asked to chill in the city and Facetime over winter break, he invited me to pregame with his friends (which has never happened during our 2 years of being friends). First semester, we were both at two parties together and usually he hooks up with other girls but both times he just stayed with me throughout the party. One party, I was dancing with another guy and it was obvious that he was mad but didn't say anything. Not only that, second semester, I had a birthday party and he bought me a bottle. I got drunk and was apparently touchy with his friends. The next day, his friend told me that I was touchy with them and that he looked mad stressed when I did that.

Anyways, last week was basically our last week of college because of everything being moved online do to the coronavirus. On our last day of college, he asked to hangout because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, once again he pays and tries to hold my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. He then asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no and he asks why. I know I should've asked what his intentions were then but I just couldn't so I said that I wasn't good at this physical stuff and he kept saying that it was fine and he didn't care. I said I'm only comfortable with being kissed on the cheek so he kisses me on the cheek and neck for a little bit and then we cuddle for 2 hours (this is the most physical we got all year). Later that night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he'll be coming too. He comes, we're both on the dancefloor, I dance with my guy friends, and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

So did he want to just hook up with me or did he want an actual relationship? I'm confused because he spent so much time and effort throughout the year to hangout with me -- but just for a hookup? Anyways, I feel like if he really wanted a relationship with me he would make the effort to make his intentions more clear and would reach out first. What do you think?",27Mar2020,1
175,"I have worked in the prison industry at the corporate office for a few years now. Over the last 2 weeks I have been using my company laptop to work from home. Today I received a call from my boss telling me that I need to start physically coming in to the office as we are classified as an essential business and his boss has not approved anyone to work from home. The problem is I have 2 young children at home with no family to help me watch them. I am not in the risk group, but I am still concerned about getting sick. I submitted an exception to work from home request through my boss to HR, but my boss said it does not look like they are going to approve it. The company's solution is it has staggered the office hours from either 9-1 or 1-5, but I feel like that is not enough. There are several hundred people in the building and my desk is less than 6 feet away from the next person. I told my boss I am opting to use pto until further notice instead of coming in, but I really feel like this is majorly fucked up. I have been working from home with no issues for 2 weeks now and even when I am on pto I am still going to be expected to finish my work on time. So that means I will be working while still eating up all of my pto hours I had planned on using to visit family later in the year. The city I live and work in (South Florida) has issued a “Stay Home, Stay Safe” EMERGENCY ORDER that goes into effect this weekend, but I doubt that will have any effect on my company's decision for me to still go into the office as we are an essential business. I'm going to continue to take pto for now, but does anyone have any other advice? I'm concerned about other people in my office as well, not just me.",27Mar2020,1
176,"Long story short my upstairs neighbors are incredibly noisy. It legitimately sounds like they’re dropping heavy weights on the ground sometimes. This sound often exceeds past 10pm, which my leasing office told me is when there is not allowed to be no excess noise. I have knocked on their and door and asked politely to be more conscious of the noise twice and I’ve also complained a handful of times to the office to which they just reply “we’ll call them and tell them to be quiet - sorry about that!” (Spoiler alert: it doesn’t work)

I understand a normal amount noise is to be expected in apartment living, but I guarantee this is far beyond “normal.” I have even had company over who have clutched their heart in fear because of noises that have come from upstairs. 

I have tried everything I can think of except calling the police (which I find a bit extreme and would like to avoid). 

Has anyone dealt with this and have advice I want my options might be? I have considered asking to move to a new apartment when my lease is up, or just moving entirely. 

I don’t want to move because I just moved in 8 months ago, but I really can’t live like this.

181,"English is not my mother language, so I'm sorry if something doesn't make sense.

For reference, I'm (F15) and he's a (M17/18).

So, recently I moved to a different school and there's this guy who I'm really attracted to. I first noticed him on my first day, he was staring at me and he just had this cute half smile on his face. I didn't really pay much attention to it on the first day, but as the week progressed, he continued. He would stare at me everyday during lunch break, and his friends started telling him when I arrived where they were at or when I passed by their classroom (the whole school has wooden doors, but we have glass doors in my building, it was built recently and is the most modern part).
Second week went by like the first one and it was Friday, I was walking with my male cousin and one of his friends when I heard one of the guy's friend saying he should try approaching me soon. Later that day, I was texting my cousin and brought this up. Cousin is friends with his ex girlfriend and says dude was really abusive to her, really possessive. So, of course, I'm keeping my distance.
But his demeanor changed the last few weeks. He still stares at me, yes, but it's different. In the beginning, he looked really cute and innocent when he did that. But it's starting to get a bit scary. He rarely smiles when he stares at me, he's just serious most of the times, and he doesn't look away when we make eye contact, like he doesn't care that I noticed him looking. I know people space out sometimes, but he does not look the smallest bit distracted. You can see he's focused, paying close attention, and it's scaring me quite a bit.
He also started paying a lot more attention to me, even more so when I'm with any male friends, specially his classmates. Two or three weeks ago I was joking with a male friend (from his class) and I noticed him looking from across the yard, he was really serious and even looked a bit angry.
And a few days before that, I noticed him watching me get in the car to go home. I still had to wait for my little cousin, so I stayed there a few minutes, but he didn't look away until the car was moving.
There was also that time when he was watching me laughing with a couple of friends and he was kind of hidden, I can't really explain.
I am recovering from depression and it's actually the first time I'm feeling well with myself and getting attention from boys and shit, so I'm not sure if this is normal or not. Also, my cousin described him as possessive, so I think it may be some obsessive behaviour or some shit.

Basically, guy is paying too much attention to me and I don't know if this is normal or he's being obsessive.

Is this guy obsessed or I'm just overanalyzing? What do you think I should do about it?",27Mar2020,1

183,"My Mum generally gives me money for lunch. I usually wake up have a coffee and a piece of fruit go to school then at recess I buy my lunch and at lunch I'm not hungry. I then get home a bit after 4 and have a snack (a bit of fruit, veggies, cereal) depending on what we have. Then at dinner time I have a slightly smaller portion so I can have a salad after (it's annoying that mum doesn't put a salad with dinner). When I'm at home (weekends etc.) My mum gets annoyed when I don't have lunch (even though I generally have it earlier) and I explained that i'd rather have 5 smaller meals than 3 large ones. This isn't because of my weight or anything like that jazz but I generally don't like walking around with a really full stomach and then slowly wearing it off and becoming starving before the next meal. It also works with my schedule. Well ... mum said it was very unhealthy to do this but in doing so I'm getting enough fruit and veg, protein etc. And I'm  definitely eating enough. Is this unhealthy?

184,"A bit of backstory. I have always had a weird relationship with my father. I was awful to him growing up, and he was awful to me in return. We had a lot of ups and a lot of downs. I grew up a lot (I am a 21yo female, with a 2 year old son and a 22 yo fiancé.) Both my father and I have matured a lot, and figured out a lot about ourselves, and now we get along great. 

When I was 17 I got an apartment and by 19 I had a fiancé and a child. We did fine and at 20 I decided to go to college, and my fiancé was supporting us. My father has always been someone who will give his last dollar to help someone and he paid for our utilities and even the down payment on our apartment. A year went by and we moved to a really tiny apartment to save money. My fiancé got a really good job, until Covid-19 hit. He lost his job and no one is hiring. We’ve been living off of our savings, but while this happened my father had a big life change. My step-demon decided to move out and took her sons kid( she has full custody) with her. My dad has raised that kid since he was born(4 years ago) and is devastated by this loss.  He is trying to play it off, but he is a 61yo man who works full time. He can barely take care of himself after this, and cannot take care of his house. In the 14 years he was with my step mother she did nothing. Would not work, clean, or cook. She racked up 60k of debt which my father paid off and she hated him. I don’t know all about their relationship, but it’s easy enough to say they shouldn’t have ever been together. So my fathers house is a mess. Between gentle hoarding and probably 14 years of neglect, it’s in bad shape. 

We came to an agreement that we would move in without paying rent and we would help clean, cook, and fix up the place. I also think it would be really beneficial for my dad to have his grandson around after losing his “son”. I know it won’t be a replacement, but may ease the pain if he isn’t alone all the time. It seems beneficial, but my big concern is that my father will turn back to how he was. He used to hit me, and I would destroy everything I could. It was really unhealthy, but that was when I was 12-16. I have matured a lot, and gotten rid of my bad habits, and he has mellowed out having a child around. He has quit drinking and without my step mother there, he is much less likely to be stressed and angry. I guess I’m worried moving back in will hurt my relationship with my fiancé along with my father. My fiancé is 110% for moving in, as he likes my dad, it’s a free, large house, and it’s not in a city anymore.  

Sorry that was so long. I could use any advice you fee like giving.

I wish I didn’t unfollow him, I also wish he would text me back lol..I double texted him twice! I’m not going to beg.. I’ve always really liked him the most though, thought he’d be the one..it’s the only reason it’s hard to get over.",27Mar2020,1

196,"An oddly fun and interesting thing to do is trace your ancestry. Ancestry.com and pretty great. I’m not sure if you have to pay, but I’d think renting movies and buying games is also going to cost money. It’s really interesting. You have people who have already done research and you just type in grandparents names and you get loads of notifications/hints on their history. As soon as their birth certificate pops up, you immediately add a generation with their parents’ names. You can find so much that you never knew. I retraced my heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and some royalty. I also found multiple members who came through Ellis Island, which I wish I had known when I visited when I was younger. Unfortunately, I also found some Jewish relatives that didn’t make it out of Poland before the Holocaust. I found things that I never knew about my missing great-grandmother. It’s really cool and gives you an enriched knowledge of your own family history. I even found some families that have written books and they actually have a family reunion every year that I could go to so that I could actually meet these people. Basically it’s just cool and intriguing. It’s something that makes you lose track of time. 

If you’re a sports fan and having trouble coping with the loss, NFL and NBA are providing free viewing of nearly every game this season... for free. I was wary at first, and while I did have to make an account, they didn’t ask for ANY credit card information. They will simply cut it off when quarantine is over and hopefully sports resume. ESPN app also has a lot of extra content, replaying historic games, including some McDonald’s high school All-American games/contests of your favorite pro players already showing their supreme prowess before college/NBA. 

Do you have unfinished projects that you just haven’t completed? Since you already have the materials, hopefully, that’d be something easy to do and maybe help with procrastination. It’d definitely be satisfying. 

Many people want to learn something new. There are so many free apps right now that do just that. Not only are you learning vocabulary, but they speak and you have to repeat it with the correct accent. 

If your vision and hands are steady enough, a new craft to pick up is cross-stitching. Don’t have the materials or the knowledge? Amazon or Walmart or many places that deliver have things with the exact lines already on the material so you kinda just fill in the lines. They also come with pamphlets that explain how to do it and supply the string needed and a needle. It’s pretty easy and old-timey. It’ll get you away from screens and focused. 

These are just a few suggestions that I haven’t seen brought up. I hope you find that one of these fits you.

According to her it's humanoid shaped, about 6 feet tall, it's lanky and extremely slender. It only moves when she's not looking at it. She describes the way it moves as kinda teleporting. It moves around her room but it's always stock still. She's heard voices from it and even has had things knocked off of her make-up desk or thrown across the room. Everytime she's seen it has been staring at her. Tonight it's displaying new behavior, it was looking into the mirror she has in her room before it vanished. She can't currently see it but she thinks its still there. Also to note she's on multiple occasions felt a burning on her body and woke up in the morning with scratches on her body where the burning was, sometimes in spots she couldn't reach if she tried. Neither of us know what to do and she doesn't feel safe in her room anymore. She doesn't want to talk to her mom about it because her mom is really superstitious and wouldn't allow her any freedom what so ever if she found out about it.

The first one to display aggressive behavior I guess. How do we go about getting rid of it?

I'm 29m and ill be 30 in a couple of months. I have a career that isn't the best, but I enjoy it and most of the people I work with. I also have a girlfriend 28f and we have been together for almost three years and I plan to propose sometime soon. I've had the ring for a couple of months now and I got her parents permission a month ago.

You'd think that I'd be doing pretty good right now, but I've been plagued with some thoughts. I feel like I've wasted my 20s. My 20s started with me going to community college, but not finishing and getting a degree. Though I've have 5 jobs in the career I went to school for. The fact that I've changed jobs so much has bothered me, though I'm glad I did in the end. After school was over I got out of a six year relationship where she was married 8 months later. Then just a few years of me being single, hating myself, and playing video games. I dated around and had one long term relationship between then and my current relationship.

I've moved 4 times around the state I live in. Due to this I don't really have a very good group of close friends and tend to let relationships die when I move. Its not like I don't like them though, I just feel most of my friendships are due to proximity. I've also never really been able to get close to people, but that's an issue outside of my 20s and I've been trying to work on. I'm trying to make friends in the town I live in now, but this virus has put a damper on everything.

She was so cool and we totally clicked but a few months went by and it just faded. We did hang out, we texted but it got boring. It’s hard to keep any type of friendship. I keep telling myself that it’s okay but I do miss talking to different people and having different conversations. I wish I didn’t care about this. How do I change this? What do I do? Why am I like this?!?!",27Mar2020,1
205,"Ok so Im a 20 year old woman and the guy im referring to is 32. We are friends that hang out and sometimes smash. But often he will ask me questions like “Do you want to have my kids”, “what do you want in a husband?” Things like that. Is that normal? Or should be worried. He’s known me for like 2 years off and on. Any advice is welcomed :)",27Mar2020,1
206,"I (22F) have just started hooking up with a new guy (note: I know, not smart bc social distancing, but both of us are alone at our respective homes, except when we hang out). I previously have never been close to orgasming from penetration, and only have ever orgasmed both with a partner and alone via clitoral stimulation. However, every time I’ve had sex with this new guy something feels different and I have been extremely close to orgasming from penetration, but I end up feeling like I need to poop as well (???) so I get scared and ask him to stop because I don’t want to do that.

I have no clue why this is a thing, have never felt this before (with clitoral orgasms), and none of my friends were able to relate or help me out, so that’s why I turned to reddit. I almost positive I’d be able to orgasm if I just relaxed my body (?) but for some reason my body feels that if I relax, I’m going to poop. Literally any advice would be great right now because I want to give in so badly but I do NOT want to shit the bed. This has happened more than once.

tldr: I’ve never orgasmed from penetration before, but with a new sex partner I’m almost there, however I’m afraid I’m going to poop. What do I do?",27Mar2020,1

Now my interview was today and they gave me the job offer, I was weary to accept and now have 24 hours to call them back and let them know if I accept. I feel like I shouldn't take it based on how covid has been.",27Mar2020,1
209,"So, I'm 22 (a girl) and my sister's 31. She's a full-blown (covert) narcissist and has always been extremely jealous of me and it's clear she has a lot of hatred for me and she tried to push me to suicide before, so I've been in no contact with her for two years now. I'm happy with that decision, but my sister is still in touch with my parents and calls my mom every few weeks. Despite me asking my mom not to talk about me to my sister, my mom still does it on accident sometimes especially if something good happened. It makes me uncomfortable because I know for a fact that my sister's very nosy and stalks people online a LOT. I have public social media (I'm an artist), and I try not to get personal on there because I know she most likely looks but yeah. I'm being careful basically.

Right before I cut my sister out of my life for good, I was kind of at my worst. Depressed, suicidal,  dropped out of university, broke up with my best friend, well, my life was a huge mess (and my sister genuinely loved it, which still creeps me out when I think about it). I've been healing a lot and working on myself, especially these past few months where I'm really getting my life back together. It's been really great and I'm super motivated and excited to continue getting better! Only thing is... and I don't know if it sounds dramatic but I'm kind of scared of what my sister will do or say when she learns about my progress.

To add a bit more context, my sister never had a job and is currently leeching off her current boyfriend and making excuses after excuses to not go and get her driving license. She's jealous of my looks (she's actually very pretty herself, but yeah, even as a teen she used to act sad and tell me I have the ""perfect face""). And she hates that I'm very close to our parents because she's not (she was really awful to my parents for many years which is why they keep a certain distance).

So you can only imagine if she learns that I'm doing good now, it's going to make her mad. I'm scared she'll try to reach out to me or something. I currently still live with my parents, and she sometimes visit. I always stay locked up in my room with my music in my headphones so I don't have to see/hear her at all. But I can't help but wonder, what if she comes knocking on my door or something? My dad would probably stop her but who knows. It makes me anxious to think about it.

I want to reach my goals and go for my dreams and am working on it but there is this tiny part of me that's worried she'll want to contact me again. I don't want her to ruin this for me. How do I not let it affect me?",27Mar2020,1
210,"Hey there, this is my first post and english isn't my first language, so please be kind.

I (21 F) worked fulltime in a food store for half a year as a student job. It was a pleasant job, the team was super nice and we got along really well. I had to quit because i began an one year art course in a different city. I moved out from my parents home and into my first apartment. My parents are really supporting of my choices and pay my rent. I was a fulltime student all my life so I feel bad for being such leech to them. I want to work as much as I can in my free time so I don't have to use their money as much. My parents also expect from me to work when I'm not studying and tend to guilt trip me a lot when I don't work during my freetime.
 
Now the course is almost over and I'm looking for work again. My old boss wrote me and told me how they were lacking some staff because of the virus (there were old people in the team and for obvious reasons they wanted to take a break from working during this outbreak). I was looking for a job in retail again anyway so I thought I take the chance and move back to my parents home temporarily and start to work in the small supermarket near our village. 

I'm well aware of the dangers of COVID19 and my parents are both 55 and 58. They are totally unhappy with my choice to work in the small supermarket. They think I'm a death threat as soon as I step into work and come home. My brother also thinks I'm totally irresponsible. They are almost acting like I'm out to kill them. But they still expect me to work during the crisis. I feel like the biggest asshole for wanting to work in retail again but I liked the team and the atmosphere the job was providing. It is also nice to see my parents everyday instead of only once a month. 

I'm a pretty anxious person so I would be extremely glad to work in a familiar environment again. The supermarket is not big and in a small village where everyone knows everyone. I still know the names of some people and remember the kind of cigarettes they bought. There are never a lot of people in the store and most of the time I was filling the shelves. 

My parents are very disappointed in me and want me to work online jobs. But to be honest I can't really see myself doing online work. Staying inside all day isn't good for my mental health at all even though I'm taking antidepressants. 

What should I do?",27Mar2020,1
212,Is it cheap?,27Mar2020,1
213,"So, basically the story goes as is in the question. I'm a personal trainer, and my gym was shut down for Coronavirus related reasons, you know the deal. 

Unlike most gyms, my gym is still charging peiple their membership fees, and refusing to cancel or freeze memberships during this time. Even better -- they won't pay us with that money theyre still bringing in.

On top of that, they've come out with a ""Quarantine Special"" where all of our clients are encouraged to buy more training packages from us because the commission from it is the only way the company WILL pay us. So like, ""Hey, help your trainer out, if you buy something we'll still honor their 20% commission"" (no they havent even raised our commission, despite us now having to work off the clock to contact our clients about said special, and not being paid for the hours). In return for supporting their trainer, they can get like, 2 free sessions out of it. 

But here's the thing. I'm moving cross the country in a month. Yeah, times are shitty, but the wheels are already in motion and cant be stopped now. For starters I'm homeless right now (thanks dad) and the only way I'll EVER be afford to live off my own income and quit couch surfing and taking advantage of the kindness of others is if I move out of this expensive hellhole of a state, so.

I'm supposed to leave on or before April 26th.

My gym won't reopen until April 30th.

Not only did I not get to say goodbye to any of my clients -- they told me the gym was closing an hour before I went home that day, so any clients before then didn't know since I didn't know, but any clients scheduled for later in the week all just got cancelled instead. So I'm kind of emotionally reeling from that, because I love &amp; adore my clients. 

But now I'm supposed to reach out to them and ask them for more money knowing full well I won't be there when they get back. My boss has even offered to reach out _on my behalf_ and still give me the commission.

That feels super dishonest to me, and it feels like I'd just be contributing to the company's greed and letting them off the hook for not paying us. And I got another temp job stocking groceries anyways so its not like the 20% commission off a package or two would make a huge financial difference to me.

Am I way overthinking this, and I should just tell her to go ahead and start contacting these people so I can get the commission? Or am I right in thinking this feels dirty &amp; underhanded?

I'm so torn up over this. I've never been someone to tell my boss ""no"" before. And when I move I'm transferring to the same company, so I don't want to mess up my transfer at all....",27Mar2020,1
214,"I’ve definitely think about her a lot more than other people, but I also spend a great amount of time with her so most of my memories are related to her, and I enjoy thinking about them very much. I also like being around her, more one on one, but I probably got used to being with her a lot. I’ve always known if I like or have feelings for someone, but it’s not quite clear with her. I’m not sure if I’d date her? Because I think that would complicate things. But I don’t like it when her boyfriend gets brought up, like I just can’t help it. I want to know if I like her or not so I can move on.",27Mar2020,1
215,"
Am I in the wrong in this situation?

I’m going to keep this a little brief since I don’t want to keep going into detail.

My girlfriend keeps randomly asking me stuff like “Who do you love more, your mom or me” and stuff like “Do you care about (best friends name) as much as you care about me?”.

For a long time I’ve been going with this as she’s been really insecure this whole relationship. But I finally snapped today and told her the truth that I care about everyone the same, which I actually do. She explodes on me and she says I’m wrong and how I’m an asshole. 

Another thing she would do is show me pictures of models randomly and ask if they’re hot and pressure me into saying yes just to argue. 

So with all that being said, what should I do?",27Mar2020,1
216,"Hey guys, I am on mobile so excuse any formatting errors! TLDR at the bottom. 

So, a little bit of background - I live in California where we under a statewide stay at home order from the governor. This means, more or less, that all non-essential businesses must close. Essential businesses that remain open include grocery stores, gas station, pharmacies, etc. 

I work full-time at a co-working/ready rent office space as a receptionist. I would consider this a non-essential business, but to each their own. One of my responsibilities at work is collecting, sorting, and distributing mail for all clients. Right now, my employer is having me come in from 2p-5p to complete this task, which I understand because, if this was not completed, mail would pile up. Now, where I am running into an issue is with one of my other duties. This duty is to give prospective clients tours of our space. 

My original thought going into quarantine was that we would not be accepting tours until operations returned to normal or the stay-at-home order was lifted, however, my boss texted me today saying I had a tour tomorrow at noon. I was a little taken aback and wondered why we would be accepting tours under the current circumstances, but my boss ultimately told me I had to come in to do the tour because I was scheduled. 

So, I guess what I am looking for advice on is - is this okay? Should I do anything about this? Or should I just suck it up and give a person I have no information about this tour? 

TLDR: My employer is still making me go to the office and give tours while we are under a stay-at-home order, what do I do?

Thanks in advance, guys!",27Mar2020,1

IS THE SKY REALLY FALLING?


As I write this, the world -- or a very large part of it -- is effectively under martial law. To protect against a proposed enemy named coronavirus (COVID-19), schools have been closed, airline flights scrapped, theaters and restaurants shut down, churches shuttered, curfews put in place, public gatherings prohibited, national borders closed, people told not to touch or go near each other, every surface, door knob and human hand smothered with toxic disinfectant, and the population ordered to “shelter in place” in their homes.

And the people, from the USA to Norway to Bolivia to Australia to Egypt to Indonesia, have obeyed, not only without much protest, but with enthusiasm.

My inbox and voicemail are flooded with contradictory “information,” little of which is verifiable, less of which makes any sense, that is tailored to favorite points of scientific and political view. No one is looking at the big picture. No one is noticing that the mortality rates from all causes are going down, not up in most countries.
 

WHAT CAUSED THE 1918 ""SPANISH INFLUENZA""?


This is not the first time a scare about a viral pandemic has swept the world. We have previously heard predictions -- none of which came true -- that swine flu, bird flu, SARS, MERS, West Nile virus, Zika virus and Ebola were going to kill millions of people. Notably, all of these scares have occurred after the Internet replaced human contact as the predominant means of communica-tion, and words and pictures on a screen replaced reality. Today, this has gone so far that people are finally willing to shut down the world rather than notice what is going on around them.

I do not pretend that there is no basis at all for these predictions. Behind all the hysteria is a fear that the catastrophe that was the “Spanish Influenza” of 1918-1921 will repeat itself. The 1918 flu, after all, sickened one-third of the world’s population and killed an estimated fifty million people. 

 

But there are a number of important facts about the 1918 flu that are not widely known:

 

The 1918 flu was not caused by a virus.

The 1918 flu was not contagious and did not spread by direct human-to-human contact.

The 1918 flu began on U.S. military bases where soldiers were being trained in wireless telegraphy. It spread throughout the world on ten thousand U.S. Navy ships equipped with state-of-the-art wireless stations. It became much more deadly in September 1918 when the first round-the-clock voice radio station powerful enough to be received in most parts of the world went on the air in New Brunswick, New Jersey in service of the U.S. war effort, thereby launching the modern era of radio communication.


Efforts by doctors working for the U.S. Public Health Service to prove the contagious nature of the 1918 flu were heroic and resulted in resounding and repeated failure. In November and December 1918 and in February and March 1919, they attempted to infect one hundred healthy volunteers with influenza in the following ways:

 

They put secretions from the mouth, nose, throat and bronchi from hospitalized influenza patients into the nose, throat and eyes of volunteers;

They injected blood from sick patients into volunteers; 

They filtered mucous material from sick ptients and injected it under the skin of volunteers;

They had volunteers shake hands with sick patients, talk to them, faces close together, for five minutes, then had the patient breathe out as hard as he could while the volunteer, two inches away, was breathing in, then had the patient cough directly into the face of the volunteer, five times.


None of the volunteers in any of these experiments got sick in any way.

Similar attempts to infect healthy horses with secretions from horses sick with influenza resulted in the same resounding failure.

These experiments, and other facts about the 1918 flu, as well as about influenza in general, are thoroughly discussed and documented in chapters 7, 8 and 9 of my book, The Invisible Rainbow: A History of Electricity and Life (AGB Press 2017, Chelsea Green 2020).

Historically, influenza was an unpredictable disease that struck without warning and without a schedule and disappeared as suddenly and mysteriously as it had arrived, not to be seen again for years or decades. It did not exist on this earth as an annual disease prior to the worldwide deployment of AC electricity for lights and power that occurred in 1889. Many of the doctors who were flooded with influenza in 1889 had never seen a case before. But influenza has not been absent anywhere on earth since.

What is most difficult for people to let go of is the notion, so deeply engrained in our society, that a disease is the same as a bacteria or a virus. This way of looking at the world, as a battlefied instead of a community, is wrong. Yes, there is a respiratory virus associated with influenza. No, the virus does not cause the disease. Influenza is a neurological disease that can affect almost every organ, with or without respiratory symptoms. It is caused by electricity.

Especially now, the world needs to know these things. Once it is understood that the 1918 flu was not caused by a virus and was not spread by contagion, but was instead caused by the sudden spread of radio communication throughout the world, the hysteria should die down and the world can get back to normal, and go about the necessary business of getting rid of wireless technology. Radio waves have sickened and killed more of humanity in the past century than all of the bacteria and viruses combined. Also heart disease, diabetes and cancer (chapters 11, 12 and 13 of The Invisible Rainbow) are caused primarily by the sea of radiation with which our cell phones, cell towers, radio towers, radar stations, security systems, baby monitors, wireless computers, and other wireless devices and infrastructure have flooded our precious and fragile world.

 

The Coronavirus and 5G


I have been asked if I think the coronavirus disease is caused by 5G, and my answer is: not directly. But the parallels to 1918 are striking. Remember, the 1918 flu was not caused by a virus but by the proliferation of radio technology, to such an extent as to modify the electromagnetic environment of the Earth itself. The first, mild wave of the flu in the winter, spring and summer of 1918 was caused by the proliferation of thousands of wireless telegraphy stations, each having a limited geographic range and operating for a limited number of hours per day. The second wave, which lasted three full years, sickening one-third of humanity and killing ten percent of those it sickened, was caused by an escalation of radio from telegraphy to voice, part time to full time, and short-range to planet-wide.

That is parallel to what is happening today. 5G is escalating the radio assault on our planet to a new level, using much higher frequencies, much greater bandwidth, and much greater power levels. The first wave of the coronavirus has accompanied an enormous proliferation of 5G stations on the ground, each having a limited geographic range. This is shortly to be escalated from short-range to planet-wide, and from an indirect to a direct assault on the ionosphere, when thousands of 5G satellites go into operation this year and next.

A clue to the electromagnetic nature of the present pandemic comes from an interesting observation: as many as two-thirds of the people who test positive for the coronavirus have lost their sense of smell, and often that is their only symptom and they are otherwide not sick. (“Loss of sense of smell as marker of COVID-19 infection,” ENT UK). Loss of sense of smell is a classic sign of the disease that was called radio wave sickness in the former Soviet Union, and that is called electrical sensitivity today; often it is the only symptom of exposure to radio waves in otherwise healthy individuals. (“Investigation of the Olfactory Sensitivity in Persons Subjected to the Influence of UHF,” Ye. A. Lobanova and Z. V. Gordon, in The Biological Action of Ultrahigh Frequencies, A. A. Letavet and Z. V. Gordon, eds., Moscow 1960, JPRS 12471, pp. 50-56).

Another clue is the frequently reported effects of the coronavirus disease on the cardiovascular system, including “arrhythmias, hypotension, tachycardia, and a high proportion of concomitant cardiovascular disease in infected individuals.” This was reported on March 6, 2020 in Cardiology Magazine. These are also classic effects of exposure to radio waves.

A third clue is the astonishing variation in the severity of the current pandemic, regardless of the measures taken by governments to prevent person-to-person contact. Why, for exmaple, does Italy have 74,000 cases of coronavirus disease, and Japan only 1200? Eighty percent of the cases identified in Japan have not passed on the infection to anyone else. Tokyo, among the world’s most densely packed metropolitan areas with a population of 38 million, has almost no disease. This despite a nationwide quarantine and a shutdown of society in Italy, and few measures taken against the disease in Japan. There is no quarantine in Japan and bars, restaurants and clubs are busy and bustling. Temples are packed, and parks are filled with people viewing cherry blossoms. The subways are packed, and people are going to work, yet the disease does not spread. Japan has close contact with China, and did not even stop incoming flights from Hubei until February 1. Japan has an older population than Italy, and a higher rate of tobacco smoking.

The electrical nature of the disease would explain this too. Almost all of Japan is volcanic, and the electrical conductivity of the earth underneath Japan is higher than underneath most of Italy. Residents of Japan are therefore better grounded than residents of most of Italy, and are less affected by the radio waves around them. The volcanic regions of Italy -- Sicily and Campania -- have much lower rates of coronavirus than the rest of Italy. Patricia Ormsby, who lives in Japan, told me years ago that when she is in the United States she can feel a cell phone from a distance of 6 meters, but when she is in Japan she does not feel a cell phone until it comes within 3 meters of her. I live in Santa Fe for the same reason: I do not feel all the cell towers here because the conductivity of the earth underneath Santa Fe is so high.

Regardless of the origin or severity of the respiratory virus that is called COVID-19, the rollout of 5G is playing a large role in the current pandemic. Fear, social isolation and the shutdown of society are doing far more damage to the fabric of life than the virus ever could. It is time for society to get over its obsession with this microorganism and to turn to the emergency posed by wireless technology, on Earth and in space.

MORE REPORTS OF DYING AND DISAPPEARING
INSECTS AND WILDLIFE


Here are some of the reports that I received in response to my last newsletter, “The Flames of Progress”, in which I documented the worldwide starvation of insects caused by microwave radiation, and the consequent starvation of birds, bats and frogs for lack of insects to eat:

Allan Hardman writes from Mexico:

“I am, like you, astounded by the silence. I also remember driving down the Central Valley of California from college to my parents’ house in the ‘60’s and stopping often to scrape and clean my windshield. That problem has now been solved -- kill the bugs! And the birds who ate them.”

Andrea Mercer writes from Colorado:

“I moved to Minnesota in 2006 in the summer. I would see bats flying through the streets and swarms of insects of many species in densities I had never experienced living in Oregon. Year after year they would disappear. Minnesota was saying it was white nose syndrome blaming that on the disappearance of bats. But it was more to me. The bats didn't have food... I found deformed dragonflies that couldn't fly in Minnesota.”

Rangaswami Ramakrishnan writes from India:

“In India we had sparrows which we used to call Indian Sparrows, with brown wings, and we used to see lots of them making nice noises and the whole variety is now missing in cities. There are still a few left in the villages... All due to 4G.”

Eva Goedhart writes from Los Angeles:

“It kills me watching the bees die everywhere I go. There are so many of them on tennis courts and in one spot in our backyard. I can’t figure out why I always see dead bees in the same spot. It makes total sense that they’re starving! We pick the bees up, bring them inside, put few drops of water and honey next to them and they eat! Sometimes they’re able to fly away!

“I’m 50 years old and I grew up in Poland and remember a totally different world. Frogs, toads, hedgehogs, tons of insects. Now I live in Los Angeles and it’s a true horror watching the towers popping up everywhere. Everything is slowly dying.”

Karen Eichstadt writes from South Africa:

“I remember those days where the wind screens would be smeared with insects. That almost never happens anymore. We are like the frogs in the pot of water and don’t even notice the temperature rising.”

Sam Samson writes from Scotland:

“I’m 71 and remember the myriad of insect and bird life. Yesterday I found a bat unable to get to roost, I tried to place it in a dry safe place, very unusual in winter.”

Warren Friedman writes from South Africa:

“I’ve been blaming EMF’s for the decline in insects for over twenty years. I miss the birds and bats.”

Jeanne Aymé-Martin writes from France:

“I do understand why you are so bewildered because I am too. We are very much concerned about the survival of a so low number of bees, insects, and bats in our garden and in nature in general.”

Francisco Gabiola Guerra writes from Belgium:

“When I go on holidays to the town in Spain where I was born, in the past in summer you heard all the time crickets in the fields, there were butterflies in the fields, you heard birds all the time, when you went to the fields there were honey bees everywhere. Today none of that is present.”

Antonia Holthuizen writes from the Netherlands:

“I live next to the woods. In May 2016, when I came to live here, there were always so many frogs on my driveway. I could hardly avoid them with my bike, there were that many. But in the last two years, I may be glad to see one, maybe two. One dragged itself to my doorstep. I talked to him, but didn't know how to help him. Next time I will pick him up and bring him to the woods where I, myself, can't feel the radiation anymore, and see if this might help him.

“Last year I also saw bumblebees stumbling across my lawn. I let one crawl over my hand, what a beautiful creature, wonderful. But I couldn't help them. They died. It became a bumblebee cemetery. Later I realised that they would die exactly there where I myself also suffered from the two masts, hidden in the church tower in the village.”

Connie Drummond writes from the UK:

“Insects have gone, small birds are not in the trees and we are left with a few kestrels and kites who, too, are starving and just circling the skies desperate for grub like vultures.”

Patricia Ormsby writes from Japan:

“5G got switched on in late February. Five days ago I noticed that the black kites (Milvus migrans) that used to roost around our vegetable field, that left our field when smart meters were installed but moved on to fields further away with no smart meters, have now fled those fields entirely. Totally empty sky, but lots and lots of ground birds in those fields. What kites still remain have moved to the forests. Each time I have gone out I have seen one or two kites attempt to fly out over the fields and then give up.”

Angela Foulds writes from Australia:

“In Melbourne millimetre wave trials across 25% of the city just began. This morning, on my walk with a neighbour we were mortified to see dead bees and insects on the ground throughout our hour long walk, all the way to a nature park and all along the streets back home.”

 

MORE SATELLITES LAUNCHED


On Wednesday, March 18, SpaceX launched 60 more satellites into space from Cape Canaveral, Florida, bringing the total of SpaceX’s Starlink satellites orbiting the earth to 350.

Also on March 18, OneWeb launched 34 more satellites into space from the Baikonur Cosmo-drome in Kazakhstan, bringing the total of OneWeb’s satellites orbiting the earth to 74.

None of these satellites have yet gone into operation, but on March 13, 2020, the Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX permission to sell one million user devices to American customers. This has turned a long-standing concern into an emergency. For last fall, SpaceX announced its intention to begin providing 5G service to the northern United States and southern Canada after it had at least 400 satellites orbiting the earth. The threat to terrestrial life -- at least in portions of North America -- may now be only weeks away.

I have summarized the threat to life posed by SpaceX in previous newsletters but it bears repeating. The energy for life is provided not only by the food we eat and the air we breathe, but by the electricity that we imbibe from earth and sky, which circulates through our acupuncture meridians, feeding our organs from the day we are born until the day we die.

The source of the electricity that sustains us and circulates through our bodies is the earth’s own source of high voltage: the ionosphere. If we pollute that source with millions of pulsed, modulated frequencies, we will destroy all life on the surface of the Earth, including the birds in the sky and the fish in the oceans. And since they will all be orbiting in the ionosphere, that is exactly what all these satellites will do.

Astronomers study the circulation of energy between the sun and the ionosphere. Atmospheric physicists study the global electrical circuit between the ionosphere and the earth. Doctors of Oriental Medicine study the circulation of energy within our bodies. Geophysicists are studying the effects of power line radiation on the ionosphere. But nobody is looking at the whole picture. Nobody is asking what the massive pollution of this source of energy will do to the community of life that it nourishes. Experience with Iridium (now operating 66 satellites) and Globalstar (now operating 48 satellites) tells us that the extinction of life will not be gradual. If thousands of satellites are turned on at once, it will be sudden and devastating. If service begins with only hundreds of satellites to a limited part of the world, and increases to global coverage from thousands of satellites next year, it may be a little less sudden but the end result -- the extinction of most life -- will be the same.


NEW ORGANIZATION BEING CREATED
Donations Needed
 

In my last newsletter, I asked for help in taking the fight to save the Earth to the next level: I proposed to create a new organization whose members do not own cell phones and whose mission is to end the use of cell phones on Earth. People from 24 countries have contacted me wanting to create this organization, and I am hiring an assistant to help me with the work.


Among the other projects that need funding are: outreach to the world’s major environmental organizations; a media campaign; outreach to Elon Musk and the board of directors and funders of SpaceX; and the ongoing litigation against 5G in federal court in New Mexico. Donations in any amount are appreciated.

218,"So I've recently been hanging out with this girl I met where I work (We've only kicked it twice now). Everything is wonderful, going great, then she informs me that she isnt looking to date seriously and is moving to L.A in 2 months ( We live in Illinois.)  I find myself thinking of this girl more times than not. I live alone and don't have any ""close friends"" who would take much interest in this situation. If anyone has any advice on what I need to do to try and get over this girl, I wpuld appreciate your input.",27Mar2020,1
219,"So throughout the years of going to school I would get awards. The awards would be contributed to my attitude and willingly to help others. The same time people took advantage of my kindness that I got to my adulthood I stop helping people. Now when we are in a pandemic and people need help with toilet paper and money... etc. I am hesitant to help because I know when I need help my parents was there to help! (No one else). I can admit I don’t really ask for from people because I don’t want it to be reminded of it!

Anyway, I remember helping people when I was a kid and the joy I felt when I did it! My reputation over the years of lending a hand is remarkable. A lot of my high school peers would remember me because of my kindness but still angry of the people taken advantage of me!

The angry turned to a grudge that I am hesitant to help..,

Anyway, I need advice on what I can do to help people BUT not be taken advantage. I know the minute I found out I am taken advantage of . I know I will be plotting for revenge. I hate that about myself because all those years of plotting and find ways to get revenge is a waste of energy ..

New to reddit but like listening to it on YouTube. Hi rslash 

Every Thursday my boyfriend (bf), a girl friend (H) and my cousin (R)(17) and I (we are all in our 20’s) play DND online and I really enjoy it and so dose my boyfriend.

Also note (H) is a-sexual, 
me and my boyfriend have been cheated by our ex.

So story time, we have been playing for about 2-3 months and I’ve been having so much fun. But 3 games again (bf) added a new side character and (H) desisted that her character would have a crush on this new character. 
At first I thought on he was going to be here for a game or two but since he has joined (h) character been getting more and more flirt with this new character (that bf plays) 
they asked me if I was ok with it and I was but she is getting more forward and I’m starting to get more and more upset. 

Should I say something or just relax? Am I overthinking it? 
I don’t want to wrong the game and I know they are just playing a character but he was the first guy I ever slept with and truly love. I’m scared i might mess up the game and make things awkward. 

Reddit readers what should I do?",27Mar2020,1

228,"Just looking for some second opinions. 
Tl; dr : should we live at our new house immediately within 2 days in case of lock down next week? 

Australia currently isn't on a strict lock down just yet we're still free to go out and about but schools and pubs and cinemas etc are closed. There is a very high chance that we will go into proper lock down next week. 
My partner and I have just recently been approved for a house and we're going to sign the lease this afternoon. We were going to move in slowly (we live with parents at the moment, so there's no time limit/eviction) and just gradually bring our stuff to the new house, we weren't expecting to be living there until at least next weekend or the weekend after and my partner wasn't quite ready to just up and leave in 2 days. However if we go into lock down, we won't be allowed to move at all. Who knows how long the lock down will be for, it could be months, and we'll be paying rent for a house we won't be in. 

So should we be swift and move in completely this weekend and start living at our house immediately just in case we're locked down in 2 days?",27Mar2020,1
229,"Throwaway bc he knows my main.
My friend(M19) joined the military over a year ago. It was a last ditch effort on his part to get his shit together. He went through basic, then got busted for lying about drug use before joining- we both casually smoked weed. It delayed his schooling for a bit, but he then started popping pills, excessive drinking, rehab. It was a cycle that kept occurring. He came home over Christmas and got drunk/high, I only saw him twice the week he was home. He recently visited and told me he had gotten better, then when we hung out he took me with him to pick up LSD. After a recent failed suicide attempt they are honorably discharging him with no benefits. He brushes off my concerns for him, usually getting angry. I've tried being gentle/supportive, I've tried not bs ing him and telling him like it is, he doesn't care and he won't stop. I've known him my whole life, and I'm worried he's gonna attempt suicide again. Advice?",27Mar2020,1
230,"Hi. I have a super overactive imagination. Especially with horror or scary things...anytime I watch a horror movie I’m absolutely stuck on the thought and it replays in my mind over and over again to the point where I stay up at night (like now) and find a way to distract myself. Nightmares can cause it too, 

I guess I’m trying to ask how I can quit being so scared of stuff I know isn’t real",27Mar2020,1
232,"It became obvious my sister has an issue several months ago. She makes these absolutely massive plates of food, snacks all day long, and then goes to the bathroom within an hour after eating and purposely makes herself throw it up. She runs water, or flushes the toilet so we won't hear, but the walls are thing and it's obvious what she's doing.

My mom and I have both heard her throwing up yet my mother refuses to confront her about it, and argues when I say I want to bring it up. We've mentioned it in passing to her (You okay? Heard you throwing up.) And she either pretends like we were hearing things, or says she took some allergy medicines that made her feel sick. 

On the most obvious level, I'm worried about her. If she's doing this because she thinks she'll lose weight, she's not only wrong but is doing far more damage than good to herself. I have no idea how to tell her this, as she's always had anger issues and lashes out when people say things she doesn't want to hear.

On a different level, she throws up in the bathroom sink/bathtub, and clogs them. She sometimes doesn't wash it thoroughly enough, and there'll be bits of vomit still there, which means we have to clean it much more frequently then we otherwise wood. 

On what feels like a selfish level, she uses up all of the food. She'll cut up tons of vegetables, use up meat, rice, noodles, make these massive meals, just to throw it all up 30 minutes later.  It's just so frustrating.

How do I/my mother even begin to go about addressing this with someone who lashes out and has rage issues without starting a problem? It's concerning for a bunch of different reasons for us, but mostly I just want her to stop because of the damage she's doing to herself.",27Mar2020,1

234,"So like schools across the world my classes are online bc of this whole virus thing, and I just haven’t done anything school related this whole time and pretty much checked out. It’s like day 13 of quarantine, not leaving the house, not working out, and my anxiety level are just through the roof. 

I’ve done some assignments that were due but this test I have coming up is 20 percent of my grade, but the key point here is that it’s online. Unfortunately I’m thinking of just cheating my way through this one, and even though we have to have webcams on us, I can control the angle of the video and am thinking of just using this website that has a database for answers. It worked for the quiz that we took and the professor said it’s going to be similar so I’m just praying to god that they’re the same. 

I’m just having crazy anxiety about this and like what if I get caught, what if the answers aren’t online, what if I fail the exam and the class, and like fuck. It’s just so chaotic and it seems like the world is ending, and the economy is tanking, people are dying and it’s crazy the time period we’re living in right now.",27Mar2020,1
235,"I am 20F. Parents are 50s, conservative Christian boomers, and I live with them. I am a 3rd year college student. I have both depression and anxiety. And I'm close to ending it.

I want to be clear that I am on medication for my depression and anxiety. It makes them less potent, but they still happen, especially with added stress. This is my cry for help. It will be long, so stay and read or leave, your choice. 

I have changed my major around 4 times since I started college. From vet studies, to psychology, to nursing, and finally to the one I truly want, clinical lab science. Ever since junior high, I have had problems with advanced math. Any math that's more than simple things, or without a formula.. my brain just refuses to understand it. I've tried so many methods to try and learn what I need to learn, but my brain absolutely refuses math. I'm fine in everything else, except math. 

During my first year of college I decided to take some online classes for the first time, to test them out. I failed one and discovered that online doesn't work for me. My parents still haven't let me live that down. I keep mostly As and Bs, but anything lower and I instantly get attacked and called lazy, not trying, or that I ""don't want it bad enough"". My parents constantly talk about how they'd sit down and figure it out, like they did in school, even though I have to take things they NEVER even thought about back in their college days. I just silently take it. 

This brings us to the issue that is pushing me towards the cliff. I have finally found a class that I CANNOT get past. Chemistry. I took it in my second year and failed it, much to my dismay. I took it again this year and I'm failing it again. I spend my free time reading the online textbook trying to make sense of it, or using Khan Academy online to try and help. Others have tried to explain it to me. Nothing is working. 

My parents have told me that if I fail Chemistry again, they're going to stop paying my tuition. (Rewind: the first class I failed that I mentioned earlier was math, and even though I had all As and Bs otherwise, it cost me my scholarship). I'm well on my way to failing chemistry. All class is online now due to COVID. Failing this class will do two major things. My college funding will be cut off, either forcing me to drop out or take out huge loans. And it will set me a year behind schedule for the program that starts only in the fall. I do have a job at a hospital, but it's not near enough to pay tuition without loans. 

I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, with my parents pushing and prodding and attacking me at every turn with their threats and insults, the impending shitstorm that's going to happen as this semester comes to a close and my chemistry grade stays below passing. The threat of COVID being everywhere in my workplace. It's all caused my depression to flare up tenfold normal. I was actually crying at work yesterday because I don't know what to do. I'm out of desirable options. 

I am a failure in the eyes of parents, and I am terrified of what's happening. As much as I've tried to overcome this chemistry stuff, the advanced math involved repels me, and I can't retain it. I can barely read it on a page. I've tried telling my parents this, but due to me having a very high reading level at a very young age (which they constantly bring up), they seem to be convinced that I am some kid genius about to go cure cancer and end world hunger, and keep saying that anything I ""can't"" do is because I don't want to. 

I am anxious about my future, and their wrath. I am ashamed to have let down them and myself. I am angry that they can't and REFUSE to understand what I'm going through. I am tired, of doing my best to just be shit on and knocked down and compared to other students (since I'm a 3rd year and don't have a degree, they constant jab at me about how others my age already have degrees). I'm just.. tired. Of everything. Fuck, I just want peace. And the longer this goes on, the more peace seems to be lingering at the bottom of an overpass. 

I don't know what to do. Thank you for sticking with me this long.",27Mar2020,1
236,"So just now, I tried turning on my nightlight but it didn’t turn on. I thought it was the bulb and so I turned the nightlight off and tightened the bulb. I turned it on again and I hear a pop followed with a spark of light. I instantly turned it off and ubpluged it. I was sure that i’m not using that again. So i looked around and found my desk lamp, I fit a nightlight bulb into it and turned it on. It was just the same, but now I’m anxious of it’ll heat up a lot and break.

238,"This Spring Break has been pretty bummy because of the Quarantine. This entire spring break I haven't hung out with anyone and I've just been inside the whole time. I feel like this gives me more time to do things I wanted to do when I got more time, but I just feel so unmotivated. I have anime I wanna watch, manga I wanna read, games I wanna play, and things I wanna do in Minecraft, but I just find it so hard to start on any of it because of how much time everything takes. I've been staying up until like 3 am (and later) every night because I always feel like I have stuff I need to finish (finally catching up on an anime for example) and then I wake up at like 12-1 the next day and I don't get anything done during the day.

239,"I don't know how to talk about sexuality or masturbation, or topics like that in public without getting unconfortable, and people tend to censure themselves when they're near me... 

When I was younger I was far more innocent that I'm now, and that became a defense mechanism for me, as teachers would protect me from bullies... Yet I carried it to adulthood...

People think I'm a pure and innocent person, and they treat me like a child or in a more child like way instead of being treated normally, and it's driving me nuts. 

For God's sake, I'm 23. yet I have the mental age and maturity of someone who's between 19-20, maybe even younger, because of the trauma I endured for years... I'm the prime example that having good grades in high school won't guarantee someone a good life.

The results of it? I'm like 90% alone, in self isolation, I don't know how to make friendships or interact with people, or even how to reconnect with them, I'm afraid that people might see me as a special needs person or worse because of an Asperger's misdiagnosis, and I don't want to burden my family and friends more... They've done a lot to help me, but it hasn't been enough, and I feel like shit for still feeling bad despite everything... 

I know that if I keep going on like this, I'll probably end up losing my mind... I know there's a lot of people I need to talk to and maybe apologize somewhere in the future, yet I'm a coward who can't even do that... 

I never thought my adult life would be something like this... I didn't expect to become someone so empty, broken and regretful at all.

Five years took almost everything I have ever cared about... People I met in high school, some in college and others in the internet... I ended up drifting away from most of them, and now, I only have the memories from my past, and the crushing emptiness I feel from my reality is very high...

I'm tired of always losing, of always making mistakes, of not being able to talk about sexuality and being ridiculed because of it, of being spoken when they need my help but seldom for everything else, for knowing I'm fucked up and I'll probably die alone, and nothing I'll ever do will fix the cluster of mistakes I've ever done...

I was wondering if anyone could help me help myself sort this mess out so I can articulate the problems I want to discuss with him and cut to the chase tomorrow. Thanks!:

&amp;#x200B;

 Just want to open off with I've never addressed these issues as a whole or even sought help for them, but today I sat down and wrote everything I could think of down as to how to help pinpoint this issue and get rid of it. I believe I am an incredibly insecure self-conscious perfectionist. I freaking the word perfectionist but that's what I probably am. Let me explain why, and after reading this hopefully someone can point me in the right direction of how to approach getting rid of these negative qualities as they are crippling my life. Let me give some examples in case my self-diagnosis is wrong (whcih it most likely is). First off, school. In my math class, I would say I'm probably in the top three kids in the class in terms of understanding the material, highest grades, etc. However, I'm ALWAYS the last person to turn the quiz, test, whatever in as I check my work repeatedly and make sure everything is perfect and correct. Next, when I'm gaming (which I do quite frequently) I have to have my headest maxed and set to a certain EQ (surround sound) in order for me to feel fully immersed, and I must always make sure I am fully immersed when I'm playing a game or else I tell myself I can't enjoy it because I'm not getting the full imapct of the game, and thus missing out on certain details. Next, because I have my headset maxed I can't hear anything outside the headset unless the person is super close to me or loud. That being said, when someone in my family wants to get my attention or something they'll open the door and walk into the room and take me completely by surprise. Because of this, I'm constantly looking behind me toward the door to make sure noone is coming inside as I'm pretty insecure about the video games I play. The games aren't weird or anything, but if a non-gamer saw me playing it they'd probably think wow look how gay this kid playing this or whatever (my family obviously wouldn't say that but I'd feel judged if they saw me playing nonetheless). To give you some examples of games I've played Skyrim, Ori and the Blind Forest, Nier Automata, etc. Another example of me being a perfectionist or insecure or whatever is that whenever I leave a class in school or a room in school I ALWAYS look behind me to make sure I didn't leave anything behind. I also always fold my pockets inside out before I take off pants/shorts, double-check I didn't levae anything in my wrestling lcoker, etc. (this may be OCD I have no clue). Continuing, I'm on Android and one time I accidentally ahd my alarm volume set to 0 or something like that and I missed my alarm, so now I check every single time I set my alarm that it didn't randomly reset, which it never has. This probably all screams self-doubt and OCD, but I don't think I have OCD because I'm incredibly disorganized and pretty messy in general, while also having atrocious hand writing. For some reason I alos have to read out loud when I'm reading something (as in mutter in audibly under my breath; I have tried stopping this habit but I still move my tongue). I do this for a multitude of reasons, one being I feel for some reason I'll understnad it better and soak it in if I read it out loud, and another reason being that I subconsciously put myself as the narrator in a movie when I'm reading a book and treat it like that (hard to explain). As you can probably tell, I'm indecisive AF and this carries over to video games whcih sucks as well, esp. RPGs. When I make decisions in RPGs I always have to make the best one, and my character needs to be able to do everything when the situation calls for it; I cannot help creating a Mary Sue character in RPGs, table top or video games, no matter how badly I jsut want to be able to actually roleplay a believable character. Skilltrees are a nightmare to me in games as I'm constantly weighing them against each other and trying to pick the best one, and then beating myself up for making a bad choice. I have to check, check, check all the time as I've said before (I'm going down the list on the paper I wrote so if I repeat myself I'm sorry). I'm definitely insecure, self-conscious, and have self-trust issues (like the math example). Even making this post was stressful for me as I was and am afraid that I'm going to forget to say something importnat that could help diagnose whatever I have. I feel like an idiot for taking so long to address these issues that have been plaguing my life but here we are. I constantly, cosnciously and subconscioucly, feel that someone is judging me somewhere or im imaginign what im doing in a video game I'm putting on YT and it has to please people or whatnot (this might have came out wrong but hopefulyl you get what Im trying to say). This self-consciousness and fear of waht others think has evolved so much that when someone says to me, ""Imagine you're doing this..."" or if I picture myself doing anything, it's in the third person; I dream in third person as well. The whole reading example iI gave above also applies to books I read for fun, as I feel I have to read it in a certain way and take it in a certain way or else I'm not getting the full imapct of the book and thus missing out on the heart of it; I need to read it exactly the way the author intended for the words to be interpreted. For example, when a chapter is comign to a close in a book (you can tell because that page is much shorter than the others), I feel I have to read slower and take thngs in mroe in order to get the full value; I have to play it in my head like a movie. Also in school, when I take tests or quizzes or whatever I have to reread questions and answers mutliple times and I have to make sure that what I circled on the test is exactly the letter I bubled in on the scantron; I have to literally mutter under my breath ""Number 44 A"" because I don't trust myself to put the right letter on the scantron when I fill it in. Back to the whole reading thing, I ahve to make sure I completely comprehend everything that happened, ESPECIALLY for when I read for fun because for some reason I picture myself narrating hte book later in life, wanting to talk about it and how much of a masterpiece it was, etc.; wanting to share my thoughts with other people and providing something interesting. Because of all this, it's ahrd for me to TRULY relax ever, and I have a fear of failing and beign wrong. As with the RPG example above, I have an extreme fear of missing out on things. There were two more things I wrote down on the paper but I abbreviated them so I forget waht they are; this beyond irritates me but I feel like I have said more than enough. If you read this, for real thank you. I have no idea where to turn, who to talk to, or what I need to do to get this all sorted out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I just need some help articulating myself here. It may seem like a silly issue and that I should just deal with it on my own, but when I walk in tomorrow I just want to say to him, ""OK, here are my problems: A, B and C and how do I fix them"" or something to that effect, and I want to make sure I'm using the right descriptive words beforehand and explain everything clearly so I can defeat these issues expeditiously.",27Mar2020,1
242,"Hello! Basically, I just need some advice. So I met my best friend in junior year of high school. We are both in our second year of college now, and over the past three years we have become EXTREMELY close. We see each other literally every day, and about a year ago I began to fall in love with him. We never fight, never get bored of each other, and he is the only person I've ever felt truly knows and accepts me. I can tell him anything without fear of judgement and he is honestly the best person I know. I was (and am still slightly) convinced he is my soulmate.  The problem is, when I confessed my feelings for him about a month ago, he told me he was sexually confused and thinks he is gay. I'm the only person he's ever told and I can't tell anyone else. This is eating me up inside for several reasons. I've been struggling with depression for about 6 months now, and the addition of this heartbreak is almost enough to kill me. Literally. I don't know what to do, I love him more than life and don't want to lose him, but I don't know how to just shake my romantic feelings for him. I want to be there to support him through his journey !! 

I guess what I am asking is: how can I continue to be best friends with him even though I love him and know that those romantic feelings will never be returned?",27Mar2020,1

I can’t pinpoint what the real problem is, it could be any of the above and so much more 

I can’t even monitor my symptoms properly to tell my therapist. The only thing I know is that I seem to be unable to express myself at all around ANYONE (except my parents and brother and sister) but even around them I can’t fully. 

I have so many different problems on top of this also; I suspect schizophrenic like delusions and possibly OCD.",27Mar2020,1
244,"Due to everything going on with the coronavirus, my university decided to give us the option to use a pass/fail for certain classes. I’m not sure if I should use this because I plan on going to medical school in the future.

I’m currently trying to get my academic scholarship back and I need to get my gpa up as much as possible. I will end up with a C in the course if I don’t take the pass/fail route. In my other classes, I have high A’s and if I made this one class a pass/fail I’d have a 4.0. I also had to withdraw from organic chemistry since I also had a lot going on in my personal life.

246,"Due to the pandemic I don’t have regular school which has left me staying up all night unable to sleep. I already have trouble sleeping even when I’m exhausted simply because I like to keep my brain moving. The only way I sleep is usually just watching shows until I pass out. I know blue light can keep me awake but I’m unable to sleep without a show on due to my anxiety and fear of being in the pitch black. I’ve tried everything but nothing makes me tired. I hate staying up late because it gets lonely and negative thoughts come eventually from sitting in the dark all night. I’ve tried exercising to waste energy during the day, reading to help me get sleepy, waking up earlier. Nothing works. I stay up until approximately 4am every day and I would like to be in bed by midnight. My body just doesn’t like to sleep and I’m not sure why. Any advice? (F 16)",27Mar2020,1
247,"hi. I'm 17f and this is mostly a vent but advice is needed.


one year ago I had friends and everything was pretty cool.

due to some mental health concerns I dropped out.

after that I was blocked and ignored by ALL of my friends.

I went an entire year without friends. recently I reenrolled in high school. I've been trying to regain new friendships and rekindle old ones. I messaged one of my old friends the other day. she was upset with me and told me the only way I can be friends with her was to message an apology to all of our friends. why? honestly I dont know but I did.

they all said thank you for the apology.
but after that when I tried to message them they blocked me or didn't bother to read or respond.

I feel like I have 1000 guns pointed to my head.
also i live in a small town so the whole ""just find new people"" doesn't work. 

I've done everything they asked i just want at least one friend.",27Mar2020,1
248,I work late night at a pizza store and I see an old woman in a dress who doesnt look the least but homeless walking around muttering to herself. I feel terrible but dont know her situation. What should i do,27Mar2020,1
249,"I’m only 20 years old and this has been my biggest thing holding me back since senior year of highschool. 

The idea that I could pursue something, become successful, and have a decent life, sounds great! Especially when I’m really into something (examples: Music, Stand-Up, Culinary, Writing). 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not sitting here saying “Man I wish I could like, just have the success now”. Nah, I like formulating and grinding. I like putting things to work. It’s the literal though of: “I want to be a Musician” or “I want to become a chef” that cripples me with anxiety. I guess it’s partly due to having an extreme change. Like looking into the future, how would my life be different from what it is right now. 

I will be honest, I do lean towards wanting to work on music, but realistically speaking, the chances of me “making it” would be near to none. Being a chef! I work in a kitchen right now as a line cook. Not to brag, but I’m quite good at it. I’m clean, I drink responsibly. Pretty much breaking Linecook stereotypes every chance I get. I just think back though, on those long nights, breaking my back, being cussed out by customers, feeling like absolute shit about myself- and I don’t think I can do this my entire life. It’s fun when it’s fun. But it’s not every other time. 

I hate to sound dramatic, but part of the reason why I’m asking for advice is because I literally can’t see myself doing anything else (Being in culinary). It terrifies me. I just feel like my life is already being paved in this industry and it’s hard for me to look back at all those dreams I had. Like I said, I try to be realistic about it, but still. The fact I haven’t even fucking tried is what kills me. **And yet, if I ever even try to pursue something, I always convince myself it’s not worth it.**

I think that’s the bottom line. I feel stuck. I feel like no matter how hard I try, there won’t be any point to it, because I know the chances of me succeeding are so low. 

To pretty much TDLR this: How can I get over myself, and pursue projects that I have a passion for, without feeling like it’s all in or bust? How do I form hobbies without getting too sucked into fantasy.",27Mar2020,1

251,"So seven months ago I posted a track and this guy I know heard it, as of three months ago he started basically taking that style and finding more success. I'm not mad at the guy, he sent me a beat once and has supported my music. I'm proud that I laid the groundworks down for him to find success but there's still this tinge of ""this is MY style, I inspired him to start doing it in the first place"". I don't quite know how to place it. I've always wanted to help start a wave but I'm having this mix of anxiety and jealousy (thats the closest way I know how to describe it). It's like I'm anxious because I don't want people to think I ripped him off even though as far as I know, even I was the only person to invent it but at the time I'm kind of like, ""Damn, I wish that was me"". Keep in mind, neither of us are widely successful musically but still. How do I process these feelings? Are they normal to have?

On top of that she is terrible with replies, I typically wait  30 minutes to an hour on a reply, I know she can be busy, but this week she booked off work (for my cake day) so I know she isn't in work, I know she isn't busy. She is most likely playing a videogame with her friend.

So first off sorry if my punctuation and capitalization looks like shit I typed this on my phone. Anyways theres a few people i work with who are pretty rude to me. they don’t communicate with me and when i communicate with them its just shady attitude for no reason. their body language when I’m around them is rude and idk wtf i did to these people i seriously mind my business and don’t do anything to anybody. 

i would confront these women on what their problem is with me but its like they never outright have said something really rude to me or have physically done anything to me its their attitude and body language when I’m around them, its the fact that they’ll great others at work but won’t talk to me at all so i don’t see any point in confronting them or even telling my boss. its just petty stuff its not a big deal but i am a sensitive person i get mad and angry over the smallest things and i try and not let stuff like this get to me but its so hard for me not to.

 I grew up being bullied so people being rude to me for no reason bothers me so much even if its something little. I especially hate the fact that two of the 3 women are about 20 to 30 years older than me (I’m 20) it’s like you guys are grown adults old enough to be my mom but acting like petty high school girls. Today i bumped one of the women with a door on accident i didn’t know she was standing outside of the door and i apologized repeatedly and she ignored me and just sighed dramatically rolled her eyes and tsked and she didn’t have to except my apology at all but i felt the way she reacted was unnecessary. how do i deal with the rude behavior these women display towards me? How do I not let it get to me?",27Mar2020,1

267,I always remember things from my childhood that no one else does I can literally remember people from first grade if I see them and they won’t have a clue who I am. My siblings even come to me when they want to remember something from our childhood because most of the time I remember and even in good detail. For example the other day I was talking to my younger sister about how when she was about 4 I was 5 she wrote my initials on our game cube and I got into big trouble for it and my mother didn’t believe me when I told her it wasn’t me. My sister said she doesn’t remember it happening and even when I asked my mother she had no recall of that ever happening. I’m just curious to know why I remember so much more than everyone else does. My memory is good with a lot of things and even when I think about them like my body feels like I know this things happened 100 percent this way.,27Mar2020,1

These optional assignments have been given to us and I don’t know whether it’s worth taking my time to do them.

My AP US History teacher has sent us a tweet by the head of AP exams that our exams this year will only be over 75% of the year and no multiple choice questions. All FRQ’s online. Huge relief as this past unit was horrible and that unit isn’t going to be tested on. As for the actual assignments it’s all just review of UNIT 1 of all my classes on a site called Albert.io.

272,"I want to keep this issue separate from my regular account so sorry about the throwaway. I’ve rented my house with my partner for about a year now. My neighbor has two dogs that don’t go inside their home. In other words, they strictly live outside and it shows. One is a german shepherd who we have continuously had issues with and have tried reaching out to the neighbors about her only to get little feedback from them. The other dog is an elderly, white dog. So a little background on the dogs. I’ve seen the little white one wandering in my back alley before. He escapes through the holes the german shepherd makes. The german shepherd barks at all hours, tries to fight my dogs through the fence, she jumps on it, bites the wood off of it. They’re constantly putting “barriers” in front of the shitty fence like old tires and other fence pieces.

This afternoon my three dogs (dutch shepherd, lab, and cattle dog mix) were outside with my partner and I, in our fenced yards doing yard work. The gates were shut and locked as usual. I’m trying to politely ignore this dog biting at the fence when my dogs walk by. I can’t ignore her anymore when she rips a large wood chunk off so I put a temporary barrier in front of it and thought nothing of their tiny dog and went inside (i’m kicking myself right now for this). 

A little later, Im in the front yard with my partner when we see our dogs bolt into the backyard (this isn’t unusual as they chase birds and squirrels occasionally). Then suddenly we hear high pitched screeching and run as fast as we can to the back yard to find our dogs leaned over the white, curly dog attacking him. We call our dogs off immediately and the white, curly dog runs back into his yard from the hole he came in from. 

My neighbors don’t speak english and I don’t speak spanish so I had to texted their daughter who speaks english and told her that her german shepherd ripped two bottom fence panels off and the smaller dog came into my yard and got attacked by my dogs. I suggested that the white dog should see a vet and politely suggested that they take control over the german shepherd because this wasn’t the first time this has happened. At first their daughter was being really reasonable but then I got the dreaded text a few hours ago that said that “my vicious dogs killed their dog”. She also stated in a separate text that they made the choice to euthanize their dog because of his injuries. Of course this was extremely heart breaking to hear. I feel like complete shit for what happened. There’s no way I could imagine something like that happening to my dogs. I genuinely feel really bad for the owners and the dog. It’s really hard now to know I have to live beside people that see my dogs outside and think of their dead dog. I have to live with that and it sucks. I’m at a total loss for words right now and I haven’t replied yet because i’m trying to figure out how to even process this, let alone respond to her.

My dogs are good dogs. They’ve all completed balanced training. We go on leashed walks often and I let them out in the yard to use the bathroom and play with each other. Otherwise, I don’t let them out of my sight. They’ve never gotten out of my yard or destroyed property. They’re dog and people friendly outside of the home. They’re a bit protective of the home when it comes to other dogs but it’s something we’re learning manage. 
I don’t feel that what has happened is my fault necessarily, and honestly I don’t think it’s my dogs either. They’re high prey drive dogs that were unexpectedly intruded on. 

Although I feel horrible, I’m mainly concerned that this situation could potentially get hostile. I don’t want someone to come try to take my dogs or issue a citation or something. There’s also a high possibility they may try and harm my dogs and I want to know what I could do in that situation. I'm kind of numb over the whole thing and I think I just need to vent.

276,"Hi! Before I start, I would like to say I'm aware that none of us know what this guy's true intentions were unless I ask. I'm just wondering what other people think.

Long story short, I [21F] met him [21M] my freshman year college and it was obvious that he wanted to get to know me from the very beginning. He eventually became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he showed up with hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what he wanted and he said he didn't want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year, nothing really happened. He made the effort to hang out with me here and there, but we never actually hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to talk a lot through Snap and he tagged me on stuff on Facebook. When classes began, he immediately asked me to chill the very first week. This became a consistent thing throughout the school year. Every time we hung out, he tried to hold my hand. Some things he did that made me think he wanted a relationship was: he would always pay for my coffee, bought wine a couple of times so we could drink it together in our dorms, bought and cooked me food (dude specifically bought me steak too cause i asked for it), bought me a bottle for my birthday after I jokingly asked for one, asked to chill in the city and Facetime over winter break, he invited me to pregame with his friends (which has never happened during our 2 years of being friends). First semester, we were both at two parties together and usually he hooks up with other girls but both times he just stayed with me throughout the party. One party, I was dancing with another guy and it was obvious that he was mad but didn't say anything. Not only that, second semester, I had a birthday party and he bought me a bottle. I got drunk and was apparently touchy with his friends. The next day, his friend told me that I was touchy with them and that he looked mad stressed when I did that.

Anyways, last week was basically our last week of college because of everything being moved online do to the coronavirus. On our last day of college, he asked to hangout because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, once again he pays and tries to hold my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. He then asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no and he asks why. I know I should've asked what his intentions were then but I just couldn't so I said that I wasn't good at this physical stuff and he kept saying that it was fine and he didn't care. I said I'm only comfortable with being kissed on the cheek so he kisses me on the cheek and neck for a little bit and then we cuddle for 2 hours (this is the most physical we got all year). Later that night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he'll be coming too. He comes, we're both on the dancefloor, I dance with my guy friends, and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

So did he want to just hook up with me or did he want an actual relationship? I'm confused because he spent so much time and effort throughout the year to hangout with me -- but just for a hookup? Anyways, I feel like if he really wanted a relationship with me he would make the effort to make his intentions more clear and would reach out first. What do you think?",27Mar2020,1

yeah, I get that their inst that much explicit sexual content in this show, and most of the women are pretty homely, but the other parts of the show really put the dark magician in my duel disk, all the beatings, abductions, executions, and general shenanigans inflicted on the characters.

there is just something about women being kept as breeding material, and being brutality taught to know their place that really makes a mans blood hot, maybe its the actors fine, Thespian performance that truly brings the fear in their eyes to life, its a lot more realistic than the kind of stuff you see in normie erotica

After all, my mom has been married to 2 men and she has never shown interest in women before from what I’ve known. But I have since heard them having sex in my parents room twice. This was extra strange because I knew my step dad was home, both times.

This was shocking but I thought it could’ve been a threesome. But I never heard any noises from my step dad. I still wasn’t certain it wasn’t a threesome, until my recent discovery...

I found my step dads notebook by chance that had some notes related to this. It is obviously meant for himself so it’s hard to understand, but I learned that my parents are not together anymore. He also describes feelings of betrayal, jealousy, and many other things that make me worry for him. He just wants to move past it, and to be able to love and be loved again, according to his notes.

Yes I feel bad about reading his private notes, but this was a mystery I had to solve for my own sanity. They weren’t hidden, but just laying in the living room.

I’m not sure what to do. I feel bad for my step dad, but I don’t know the whole story. I’ve already decided not to tell my siblings for their sakes, but I had an idea to write my step dad a note explaining how much his children, including me, loves him. 

The problem with this is it makes it pretty obvious that I know or that I looked through his notes. I don’t want to make things worse by putting myself in their business. Lemme know what you think I should do, please.",27Mar2020,1
286,My grandma who I never really talked to until moved to live with us this year plays music that teens listen to which at first I didn’t mind but as time passed it became very annoying. She blasts music at inappropriate times. Yesterday I was woken up to drip too hard by lil baby and gunna at 7 am in the morning. I love that song but I’m on spring break trying to sleep. I tell her to turn down her music and she tells me she has a hearing problem and it’s not even that loud. When me and my parents went to Home Depot to buy supplies last week. We returned to her playing post malone full volume with the bass shaking up the entire house. And we turned it down and she got angry and says we don’t love her and she is better off just dying. It’s VERY annoying. I don’t know what to do.,27Mar2020,1
287,"Recently my 6 year old grandson has started telling my wife and his parents that I'm mean-in front of me. Like every mean person, I don't consider myself mean. Grandma has stated that she ""just wants to love"" our grandkids. She doesn't want to correct or discipline them-that's their parents' job. I agree. However, when he does something to intentionally hurt his little brother; when he melts down if he doesn't get everything he wants; when he interrupts adult conversation constantly; they do nothing.  And I just can't let it go.

I was raised in the ""kids should be seen but not heard"" era. My Grampy was a larger than life figure to me who I would never dare to disrespect. We were expected to play in the other room when adults were gathered. And I better have had blood gushing out of my body if I interrupted their conversation.  I know things have changed. But I fear that kids are so used to being treated as equals and catered to and so little time playing with other kids  that there is a growing lack of respect that I feel should be there. I'm half-expecting him to say ""OK Boomer"" to me (at which I would have a hard time not laughing out loud!)

I play with my grandkids. I read to them. I go to their games and recitals. I am so much more involved in their lives than my grandparents were in mine. We retired a year ago and moved 1000 miles to be closer to them. There was no problem when we saw them 4 times a year.  Now we live a 5 minute walk away. I wonder if familiarity is breeding contempt? 

I want to enjoy spending time with my grandchildren. I don't think I can just stand by and let them act badly while nobody corrects them. I don't yell ever. I just let it be known that I'm not standing for their behavior. In my mind I am trying to be an example of how people should behave and am holding him to a standard. Am I expecting too much from a 6 year old?  Am I really just a mean grampy??",27Mar2020,1
288,I have really bad insomnia and more terrible things. Like I'm not going crazy but last night I kept hearing a car door close and open repeatedly.  I fall asleep at 4 am and can't fall asleep any earlier. I searched up why this is happening and I concluded that it had to do with the quarentine since I have no way to burn energy. I dont have motivation to work out at home so theres really nothing I can do. Since I'm quarantined my depressions been getting worse it's like I'm living in a loop every day. I wanna kill myself and I know I dont have the balls to do it. The only reason I'm saying that to myself is so that I can feel like I can finally rest. I'm not ready to leave yet.

There’s also the fact that this girl definitely has zero interest in me in that way lol.

I just find myself liking her more and more as the days go by but I feel physically ill every time she makes me smile or laugh because I know there’s absolutely nothing that can come from this. What should I do?? It’s starting to even affect my ability to perform in school (just failed an Orgo exam because I chose to spend time with her instead of study).

This is my first post on reddit I’m kinda shocked with the news I got today that I am positive for herpes. I really need advice I am so devastated on what to do/ what I can do i am really trying to educate myself. I had my first outbreak 3 days ago went to the hospital because I couldn’t take the pain of how bad and blistered it was down there. I called my boyfriend to tell him and he is in shock/ denial. I’ve never had anything like this I’ve always been clean literally have always been OCD about STI’s/ was in a long term relationship before him. I am currently in a relationship w my boyfriend we’ve been together for about 8 months now. We didn’t use condoms in the beginning of our relationship but due to a scare we started using them for the past 3 months until I went on birth control in the beginning of this month. We had unprotected sex for the first time since January about 2 weeks ago maybe around March 10th? He is very hesitant he thinks that it has to do with me and basically telling me it’s my fault it happened to myself etc. he’s kinda refusing to getting tested he said he’s scared due to Coronavirus. But I just think if anyone’s partner were to call them saying they tested positive for herpes the FIRST thing that person would do is to go get tested. It’s just such a weird situation. I don’t know if he cheated on me or he has it and doesn’t want to admit it because we have had sex without condoms in the beginning of our relationship.

301,"      I’ve never posted here because usually I find a way out but this time I’m lost. I’m a 16m and recently just moved from NY to TN. I’ve known about the move since middle school, but I was told up until half a year before the move that it wouldn’t happen until I was finished with high school. Nope. In the middle of sophomore year it happened. It was very sudden. I hadn’t really got the chance to hang out with my friends or say goodbye, sudden.

        I was super close with the friends I had, since most of them previously turned on me or left. We would smoke weed, get some food and do something like play some basketball or smash or something like that. This was really my only escape since I frequently got panic attacks (still do) and it calmed me down and actually made me pretty productive. After years of feeling extremely depressed, I was finally happy for a while. I’ve asked my parents to go to therapy or a psychiatrist or whatever for as long as I can remember but they push it off as me trying to get freebies or attention.

     My other friend I haven’t seen for a year recently moved back to NJ after having to stay with his other parent. I also found a girl that I actually appreciated and vibed with, and she wouldn’t use me for anything like the others would.

       Now It’s been 2 months and I haven’t left the house once. My mom wants me to go to therapy but I’m at a point where I’m not willing after all the years of asking. She says she’s losing sleep because the way I’m making her feel, and I try super hard to go out and find something to do but I can’t. After all I’ve been through in NJ and the real friends that I’ll lose soon, all the experiences I’ll miss out on, no more weed to calm me down; I’m stuck in my room all day wanting to go outside but can’t push myself to do it.

309,"Hello r/Advice, 

I have a long one. I hope I can get some help here.


This is about my Dad. He holds an immense amount of guilt. Dad was dealt a rough hand early on and it hasn't let up. Beat as a kid, possibly raped. Dad saw some nasty things in the military, and my mom committed suicide right after a bitter divorce.

My dad has a heart of gold though.💛

He was beat as a child by my grandfather. He would be beat nearly everyday. I don't know the reason, and havent brought it up in conversation with my dad. I know it got to the point that my grandfather threatened to kill him. My grandmother took him and left. She struggled to survive, but somehow managed to do it.

Dad saw several people be killed in front of them in the military. He was the only one allowed to live. I don't know too many details of it as he is reluctant to talk about it.

I imagine my Dad harbours guilt over the death of my Mom. The suicide was abrupt and traumatizing to all of us. Mom had lost custody of me and didn't have anywhere to go. Mom suffered from depression and was an alcoholic. Dad doesn't talk about it, although I have brought up the conversation and Dad seems willing to dicuss the topic. Dad appears to want to do the right thing. He is intelligent and is able to work conversations pretty well. He seems to be a kind soul, but in the past he didn't always know how to raise me.

If I ever need/needed something, he would bend over backwards to help me. He is the same to all of his friends, selflessly helping them. Idk how many times I watched as Dad would say ""You don't have to pay me."". 

He has a strong affinity to helping those in need, perhaps because he wasn't helped in those situations prior in life?

Dad has always been emotionally vacant when it came to dealing with us growing up. He prided himself on the food they provided us. We often ate pretty well. I think this is important. More on it later.

Dad has always helped take care of stray animals that found their way to our home. Growing up we had 6ish cats. All neutered and spayed. They were indoor cats as we lost one to a outside animal. When I was in 12th grade we inherited a couple cats, they didn't get fixed for one reason or another and one ended up pregnant. They gave birth to five cats. We were going to spay the mother but she ended up getting pregnant again...

When I graduated highscool I moved out. I tried to visit, but it was tricky being a bit away. A year after I left, my dad remarries to someone he's been with for about five years. They are kind, but not the brightest. I don't attend the wedding. For several years after graduation I only visit a couple times a year. My dad spends a lot of his time outside the house and in a side building. So when I visit he's almost exclusively there. 

Fast forward to this year. It's been several years since graduating. I'm not good at communicating with my family and want to start being a better person. I visit once a month when possible. I'm pretty good about it. I visit my grandma (Dad's Mom) and also visit Dad. In the side building are a bunch of wild cats, which are kept safe in the side building and Dad buys food for. I hear rumours from my grandmother that dad now has 50+ cats. They seem to be safe and happy, but its worrying as none of them are fixed. I visit recently and no one is at the side building so I go to the house, the house I grew up in.

Right outside the house is also a motor home that my step mom seems to live in.

The next five minutes I live a horror I've never experienced. I open the front door and the nostalgic coloured carpet I'm expecting to see is brown and gray. It's covored in cat excrement. I take a few steps in and look around, closing the door. Everything is covered in excrement. In shock I feel an otherworldly force push me to explore. The next room has a pile of excrement six inches tall and several feet across. This feels like something right out of the Baker residence in RE7, complete with rusty heaters. I wish I was exaggerating. In the kitchen, half of the cupboard door are hanging off their hinges and open. I don't have the guts to explore further towards Dads bedroom. I check my old bedroom. The room is virtually untouched since I've left. No cats. Same with my siblings rooms.

I leave. I go to the side building and call one of my siblings. 

""We have to do something.""

I believe this situation stems from the cats needing him. Much like me and my siblings needing to eat when we were younger. I believe Dad may be craving that feeling.

This is where it gets difficult. This is where I need your help.

What should we do?

I don't want to have my Dad to be forcefully removed from his residence. I'm willing spend a lot of time and money to help fix this situation. 

How do we deal with the animals? There's no easy answer for this. There's no way we can take care of all these animals. My option seems to be humane put downs. These animals may be alive and well fed, but they live in desolation.

Please r/Advice, I need you to help us.",27Mar2020,1

312,"Me and my friend have been talking about moving in together as roommates, so we can share the bills. We've been actively searching for apartments in the city we want to live in since the start of the year. The apartments in this city are rare to come by, you have to be quick or know the landlord. Now we found the perfect apartment, with the perfect location.

Right now I'm still living at home, with my parents and sister/her bf. I don't have to pay any bills, except my own, for the sole reason that my sister is building a house - parents don't want to encumber her with additional bills.

2 days ago when I had to decide if I'm gonna do it, I asked my family for advice. I got some feedback from my sister and her bf, while my mom was mostly dismissive and dad basically said nothing. I decided to move anyway. 

Yesterday my dad finally spoke up. He said what the hell I'm thinking, moving at this time when I don't need to. How the future is grim, how I might loose my job, how the whole world might get economically screwed in 3 months. He even pointed out that he might get the virus and since he's almost 60 it might kill him. I listened to him and said nothing. 

My friend said if we don't move now we never will. And I have no idea what to think. I've been so stressed out and tired for the past two days. What if I really loose my job, what if the economy really goes to shit? Really need some advice here, thanks for all the answers.",27Mar2020,1

315,"Hey, today I got super in my feels and started thinking a lot. I am in my early 20s, and currently am working a full time job. I have a really good job for my age, but I feel as though I am not not doing enough with my life right now. I work 5 days a week, and go to the gym 4 times a week (when everything wasn’t shut down because of vivid-19), but other than that, I just hang out with my friends. I have no other hobbies or things that I’m passionate about, which makes me feel as though I am not making enough of a difference in my community or life. In high school I was super involved in extra curricular activities , and loved any social clubs (student council president, etc), or clubs that raised money for charity. Since I’m not currently in school, it’s so hard for me to find opportunities with  like minded young people. I’ve done a little bit of googling, but I don’t even really know what to google to find something for me. 

I will be going to college in a year, but for now does anyone have any advice on where I could find some clubs or volunteering experiences? I loooove planning social events, I love working under stress or in a high pace environment, I’m a very social person, I like public speaking, I like being in leadership positions, and I love the feeling of accomplishment after something I’ve worked to make happen is over and went well. 

I am not much into politics but honestly could be down to learn more, I don’t like math, or science too much, and although I know how to use computers, I’m not much of a technology freak. 

I live in Ottawa, Ontario so if anyone has any ideas in my city that would be amazing, but any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks:))",27Mar2020,1

319,"My phone # is one digit away from a popular conference call service's #. For months, I've been getting random calls from misdials. Most of the time,  callers hang up when they realize their mistake. But sometimes when I ask, they give me the code to join the conference call. I've joined a couple of them. I've found that instead of getting angry at the misdials -- some of them wake me up at 6:30am -- I feel better if I make a game of it. 

Today, I listened in to a couple of the calls. I played a ringing phone sound effect for a minute til someone wondered aloud what it was. On another call, I played the old AOL dial up sound effect. (Thanks youtube)

This has been happening more often with more ppl working from home and I'm guessing it will increase even more. 

Any ideas on pranks or other stuff I could do? Or how to get the calls to stop?  I've called  my cell phone co to see if they have any solution but they said the only way is to change my # and I'm not about to do that. And I don't know the name of the conference call service.  It's always workers from random companies calling me.

320,"I’m a high school senior and need some serious advice. 

Ok so I have a dilemma and it’s just eating my brain and stressing me out. Through my whole life since I was literally a child up until high school I knew I wanted to be a doctor. Why? Idk because I like science. I find bio interesting along with anatomy so I was like cool imma be a doctor. I’m going to med school and the whole deal. 

HOWEVERRR

I started doing a ton of research since the beginning of the school year and it seems finance also seems interesting to me. I love public speaking and want somewhat to put that skill to use. Also the culture of becoming an investment banker or being in corporate banker excited me. I’m not very entrepreneurial but I seem to be interested in banking. The thing is I don’t have a lot of insight or knowledge about finance because our school doesn’t have those opportunities. I took ap macro and that’s it —got a 4 /5🙃. 

It’s just that I like science... mainly biology I don’t really like chem or physics but I can get through them. But at the same time my personality seems to be suited for business or banking. I’ve asked around and a lot of people, including my own principal, told me that I actually kinda lack the skills for health professions( loll) but will thrive in business. It’s just that I’m not a very caring, patient kind of person. I’m more direct and just blunt. 

Medicine also takes a long time to start earning and to art your job. I can work right out of undergrad for business. 

Other important information is that I have gotten accepted into UT Austin’s McCombs business school for finance AND Vanderbilt for Biochemistry. I have  good financial aid for both. I really need any help on making a decision between these two schools because Vanderbilt is great for premed and mccombs is like #5 in the nation for undergrad business. Is Vanderbilt good for business too?? I’m just so lost y’all!

In conclusion, I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO!

TLDR: I have gotten into top schools for undergrad business and undergrad medicine. I’m not sure which field to go into. I like science and biology but my personality seems like it would fit in business.

326,"Hello, I am a 20 year old guy who is going through a weird phase of life. And i need your advice to come out of this phase.

About me - I am about to graduate in summers this year and my major is Statistics. I want to do Masters in Statistics after my graduation.

 In my country, we have to give an entrance exam for getting admitted to a Masters program and I was preparing for the exam since last year. Recently, the result of one of the exam that I gave was declared and I scored really well and will most likely get into one of the best Statistics Courses in my country.  Also, my semester results were declared recently and i scored really well there too (to my surprise)

But even after doing so good, i seem to be dissatisfied with life. Like, the entrance exam happened in first week of February, and ever since then I haven't been able to focus on studies or anything else. Initially I thought that it was because of anxiety due to results but even after the results were declared, I have not been able to focus on anything. I seem to have given up on life and I can't understand why. 

Could it be because I worked really hard for the exams and i might have reached my trigger point?

Another factor that should be considered is that I have been single for the last 3 years and I feel lonely from time to time but after my exams got over, I am feeling lonelier than ever and have installed dating apps to just talk with women but without any success. (Also, I think I look okay but i didn't work out at all  until now)

I am an ambitious guy and I want to achieve a lot in life. I can't see myself wasting time and being unproductive. I want to get back on track as soon as possible and work hard to achieve my goals. But i seem to have entered this phase where I just don't want to do anything. I want to exit it. 

Can anyone advice me on how to tackle this problem?
Thanks for taking out the time and reading it!

tl;Dr- Can't focus on anything after working hard, preparing for an exam for over a year. Even though the results were positive, I seem to have given up on life. There's still a lot left to fight for and i want to get back on track.

The issues are that I constantly sneeze in our new house, my young daughter constantly has a runny nose and productive cough at night, our cat sneezes and vomits, and our elderly dog coughs like crazy which I've never known a dog to cough. I am a hypochondriac and am deathly terrified of the new virus. Our coughs as far as my daughter and myself are productive.

331,"Hi! Before I start, I would like to say I'm aware that none of us know what this guy's true intentions were unless I ask. I'm just wondering what other people think.

Long story short, I [21F] met him [21M] my freshman year college and it was obvious that he wanted to get to know me from the very beginning. He eventually became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he showed up with hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what he wanted and he said he didn't want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year, nothing really happened. He made the effort to hang out with me here and there, but we never actually hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to talk a lot through Snap and he tagged me on stuff on Facebook. When classes began, he immediately asked me to chill the very first week. This became a consistent thing throughout the school year. Every time we hung out, he tried to hold my hand. Some things he did that made me think he wanted a relationship was: he would always pay for my coffee, bought wine a couple of times so we could drink it together in our dorms, bought and cooked me food (dude specifically bought me steak too cause i asked for it), bought me a bottle for my birthday after I jokingly asked for one, asked to chill in the city and Facetime over winter break, he invited me to pregame with his friends (which has never happened during our 2 years of being friends). First semester, we were both at two parties together and usually he hooks up with other girls but both times he just stayed with me throughout the party. One party, I was dancing with another guy and it was obvious that he was mad but didn't say anything. Not only that, second semester, I had a birthday party and he bought me a bottle. I got drunk and was apparently touchy with his friends. The next day, his friend told me that I was touchy with them and that he looked mad stressed when I did that.

Anyways, last week was basically our last week of college because of everything being moved online do to the coronavirus. On our last day of college, he asked to hangout because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, once again he pays and tries to hold my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. He then asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no and he asks why. I know I should've asked what his intentions were then but I just couldn't so I said that I wasn't good at this physical stuff and he kept saying that it was fine and he didn't care. I said I'm only comfortable with being kissed on the cheek so he kisses me on the cheek and neck for a little bit and then we cuddle for 2 hours (this is the most physical we got all year). Later that night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he'll be coming too. He comes, we're both on the dancefloor, I dance with my guy friends, and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

So did he want to just hook up with me or did he want an actual relationship? I'm confused because he spent so much time and effort throughout the year to hangout with me -- but just for a hookup? Anyways, I feel like if he really wanted a relationship with me he would make the effort to make his intentions more clear and would reach out first. What do you think?",27Mar2020,1

Finally the unimaginable happened, he called me and asked if we could talk about his behaviour ( I never ever let him get away with what he said to me and would always tell him what a piece of shit he was and how he didnt deserve her). He asked if we can meet up at our local university, by then he had proposed and was going to marry her. We come from a VERY family oriented background so I decided this could be his turning point, where I might be able to salvage my relationship with my cousin ( by then we were barely speaking and he was not permitted in my home!

I arrived at uni a little late so we met close to his classes, I had selected all the choice words I had to say to him, and relayed them in my mind on my way to the basement levels. the corridors were empty and he did listen to my rants about his behaviour, then he shifted and started saying the worst vile words like 'arent you turned on by this .... or ive had my eye on you. ( honestly I grit just thinking about it!!!  he touched me then, grabbed my thigh and breast and pushed into the corner of the study booth. Kicked him in the gutt and ran back to the train station ( I know some of you will say that is more along the lines of molesting than rape but it may as well have been! 

I showed up to the wedding because my family would bury me if I didnt, stood beside my cousin smiled in the pictures and never spoke to her again. I wanted nothing to do with them. period.

The family knows we no longer hang out, she thinks Im jealous shes married and I am not and I gather that is what the entire family and friends think also. I dont mind, as long as they are out of my life.

 She just had a baby girl and my aunts an uncles are currently knocking on my bedroom door telling me to get over my jealousy and to talk to my cousin again.

351,"So I recently moved into a house with a friend that they own and I’m renting out. I signed a lease agreement with them and everything has been really good...until this week. 

Their birthday is this weekend and they cannot handle canceling their party due to the pandemic. It’s absolutely selfish and horrible but I cannot get them to change their mind.

I told them that I would not be participating and locking off my side of the house. I further told them that it is illegal for them to host a gathering, according to stay at home regulations, during the time of the party. They won’t take no for an answer, and I’m not sure what to do.

I could call the cops, but I am stuck here and if that happens I will have a foul relationship with them as we live together for awhile. I’m trying to think of anything other than that to prevent it from happening. 

I absolutely understand how upsetting it is. Trust me, I’ve TRIED to make it clear I am not ok with it and how unacceptable it is. I’m not sure what to do. Thanks.",27Mar2020,1

Now my only hope is to chegg the shit out of everything but I’m just having anxiety thinking about that bc we’re going to be monitored over webcam. I’m planning to have my webcam angled so that you could only see when I’m working on the problem and not when I’m typing in answers.

I’m praying to god that the answers will be on chegg but someone said that the professor is making up his own problems which is going to be way harder to cheat on.

356,"This is the most lost I’ve ever felt and I’m only 18. I spent the begging of my high school career playing football at a powerhouse high school, I’m talking we’re privileged as hell , alternate jerseys and helmets, big ass weight room, a stadium to play in and unfortunately my mental state was so shit aswell as my grades and I ended up quitting  shortly before my varsity year started. I became severely depressed, cut everyone off, and regretted it for the rest of my high school career. I’ve always had this mentality that everyone hates me so quitting sports made it worse, and of course I took it all out on video games. I spent my junior year in a deep depression. Fast forward senior year, hopped on no fap, I still relapse here and there but I definitely notice benefits, my grades finally got better, but I was stuck in a vicious cycle of school work school work, but eventually added the gym and became more happier. Now fast forward to now, corona has cancelled out my senior year, I’ve always struggled with loneliness, which I can probably blame myself for, but I feel like all my friends are temporary and just want to play Xbox with me, so it’s whatever. This is also bother which I can’t seem to get over a couple of weeks back this girl at work which I never said a word to her but then she started latching on to me, mind you I’d been hitting the gym constantly and started taking care of Myself,Ive always had low self esteem and figured no girl would want me, but I asked her to get ice cream as a joke and she was down, but I got sent home early since the store was slow, then she asked if we’re still going but I said I can’t. I bitched out. Next week the same shit happened but somehow her friend at work confronted me and asked me if I liked her and I kept denying and it got pissed, I felt like she was trying to fuck it up for me. Another example of the everyone hates me mentality, but the girl I liked was smiling and cool with it, yet I was pissed the whole time after that. She even came up to me at the end and asked if I wanted to eat with them after and I said “I don’t know” In a pissed tone, because I thought she felt bad for me or some shit. I can’t believe myself, but later that night she followed me and didn’t see it till 3 days later because I was off social media. We got to snapping and shit but it was so dry. Then next week we kept smiling at each other and messing with each other. So the week after I asked her if her prom didn’t get cancelled, that we would go together, she said that she was trying to get my info that day I was upset but it was too late and she had to find someone quickly because of her group. That was the biggest slap in the face for me, I’ve legit thought of myself of a loser my entire life and here I am brushing off the one girl that actually showed me attention. I don’t want to snap her anymore because it’s just lame face pics. But the deeper problem is me. I have a supportive family, everything I could ask for, yet I am depressed as fuck. I’m just so lost in life, I feel like I’m gonna die a loner or become a bum again.. I’m just at a lost for words typing this. I know all of this reversible what steps can I take to better myself with all this free time and not blow it all on Xbox? I know damn well I’m overthinking everything. I just need the right guidance.

I looked at it through the window, and prayed whoever was in the car didn't see me. I wanted to go tell my grandpa, but I wanted to make sure whoever was in the car didn't move either. After like five minutes, whoever was in the car flashed something towards the front door and drove away. Nothing has happened tonight, but me and my grandpa are scared. He said he went to file a police report, however without a plate all they can do is tell him to call the police next time and they will send a patrol car to scare whoever it is off.

I can’t detect what’s weird or what’s wrong so I have a bad time choosing decisions. Wait back to what I was saying, I need you guys to help me and give me advice on something.

(this is before the corona entered my state so like 2 weeks ago? Idk). So I’ve been thinking about him a lot and I was thinking if I ever saw him again should I go hug him? Or would it be weird?

361,"16M just moved to a whole different state last October. started school at a new (VERY GHETTO) school. no particularly bad experiences, just a bit lonely because i just dont seem to fit in as well as i used to. got a decent job as a host at a seafood restaurant. nothing notable except that most of the workers are work release/ex convict so they are all very interesting. 

nohting seems to satisfy me anymore. i just sit in my room and play video games with a couple online friends, which is fun except for that we all have become bored of all the games we have. because of this we play a bit less often and that leaves me with HUGE gaps of time to do nothing. especially since coronavirus hit all my days are wake up at 1, watch YouTube till 4, play monster hunter till 10ish, then watch YouTube/anime till whenever i get tired enough to fall asleep. im just so bored i dont know what to do. and most of my time ""playing"" video games is spent just refunding shit steam games that i thought would be fun.

thats not the big issue though, the real issue is i dont know what im going to do the rest of my life. i had shit grades in high school because of lack of effort. so college is not much of an option for me. im not particularly good or interested in anything. im just kinda average, but i would consider myself a good worker. when people ask me what im going to do i just say ""trade school"" and they dont ask much more. but i think id rather blow my brains out than get some shitty 9-5 working as a plumber or electrician because whats the point, i want to go into some work that i enjoy because why work a 9-5 to make enough money just to be unhappy. i have no idea what i would want to do thats actually *reasonable*. i dont want to spend my days sweating my balls off cooking in some kitchen but i also dont think i could start a career in plumbing HVAC or anything like that. any time i have a conversation with anyone regarding this i usually get a ""you'll just have to find your passion or something i really want to do"" or just get accused of being lazy. 

one wise old drunk man once told me that "" nobody's ever pushed you hard enough"" which might be right but what do i do with this information? i want to change things in my life like start working out and socializing but i just dont have the energy or drive to do so. i have lived a pretty blessed life  mostly nice home life, shitty father that went away, free car, easy job, nice computer. but nothing seems nice anymore. i just seem to laugh less at the thing i used to find funny and pay attention less to the shows i watch. is this just apart of being an adult? is this because im lazy? is this my fault or is this a common thing? 

socially im nothing special, average white kid, average height, not very funny, not very awkward, not good looking but not ugly. i make friends with people but never close enough to get any closer to anybbody. this makes me feel VERY alone. i once went on a date with a girl which went okay but got ghosted afterwards. the closest thing to a real life friend ive had in the last six months is a convict at my work that keeps promising ""we'll get you some DIGITS this summer"".

370,"There are a lot of reasons why I broke up with my ex but mostly cuz of a sort of cheating thing. He says he didn’t cheat but honestly it’s easier to explain by saying he cheated anyways here’s what happened. One of his friends said she liked him and wanted to get together she proceeded to say if he went out with her she would be really happy and he should say yes. Instead of saying “no” like you should when you’re in a relationship that isn’t polyamorous he entertained the idea. Meanwhile this is happening while I’m on a call with him and our friend. I have no clue what’s going on and get very concerned. My ex proceeds to ask our friend(Jed)for advice on what to do Jed says he should say yes. So they flip a coin three times to decide (heads was yes tails was no) he got heads twice and he explains he’s taken to the girl. After this happens I ask him three times for him to tell me what happened he refused to tell me then he sent our other friend(angel) to tell me. Angel tells me what happens I get sad I get mad I get over it and ask friends how to breakup bam broken up with and done. But I was talking to him cuz apparently he still wants to be close friends and he asked why I didn’t want to be close friends anymore. I told him my side getting a bit heated cuz I couldn’t yell at him or he would spiral even tho he won’t admit it. Basically saying he broke my trust and my heart and I can’t see him in the way I saw him before the whole cheating thing. He said he didn’t cheat cuz he didn’t say yes to going out.  Either way I’m not getting back together with him because he needs to learn to love himself before getting into relationships because what he’s doing isn’t healthy and it kinda really fucked me up but like whatever am I right. Bottom line did he cheat cuz like I’m a bit confused. I don’t know it just didn’t sit well with me that he entertained the idea of having “bitches” even if it was a joke I don’t think it was justified.

I had a rough time growing up, my mom never had the money to spend on extras, and sometimes she never even had a job.

But about 2 years ago my grandfather started having issues with his balance, and his memory, and we just thought it was old age, and a year ago he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. I'll be honest we fought a lot, and I was always rude to everyone in my family, but as soon as he was diagnosed with it I started chilling out.

373,"TLDR: my girlfriend was messaged by a random account on instagram with an image of her house on google maps and a message reading “I want you so bad”. I need advice on how to handle the situation and keep her safe

Im going to preface this by mentioning that I’m 17 and she is 16 so we are both still living with our parents. 

The other day my girlfriend was messaged on instagram by a random account with a picture of her home on google maps and a message saying “I want you so bad”. She is very scared for obvious reasons because right now an unknown person knows exactly where she lives and he seems to be a major creep.

She immediately blocked the account and its private so I cant see its followers and such which would be useful cause then we could possibly pinpoint whether or not he actually lives in our city or not.

Out initial thoughts were he had been stalking her instagram account for a while, eventually learning her full name and going on whitepages to find her address. Our second thought is maybe he also had my girlfriend added on snapchat and saw her location on snapmaps. My gf has not previously been very secure with her location and such so it’s not unlikely that he found it through there.

As far as I know she hasn’t noticed any unusual behavior of people around her neighborhood or irl stalkers but she is generally pretty apprehensive when it comes to going out by herself so it’s unlikely that she would notice anything odd in the first place.

So far I’ve created a somewhat realistic female instagram account using a random girls pictures to try and follow his account but he still hasn’t accepted the follow request. I want my girlfriend to be as safe as possible, any advice as to how to handle the situation would be much appreciated.",27Mar2020,1

375,"So, as the title says, a cat showed up at my house late yesterday night. He was meowing around where my bedroom window was, and when I called, he jumped up on the sill and kept yowling, so I let him in, because it was cold outside and there are a lot of coyotes around. He let me pick him up and curled into my arms, purring harder than I’d ever heard a cat purr before. I got him some food and water, and he ate like he was starving, but as soon as I walked away, he started meowing and looked around for me. He’d only eat while I was by his side. I very quickly found that he’s a clingy cat. Wouldn’t leave me for anything. So he’s got to someone’s cat. I live in a rural area, where pets are considered “outside” animals. Cats roam freely, dogs are kept chained outside. I checked with all the nearby neighbors, and he doesn’t belong to anyone. One of them said it’s very likely he’d been dumped by someone. Now I have two options: keep him, or take him to the animal shelter. It’s not ideal for me to take in a cat right now. And I know most shelters take good care of their animals, and he’ll probably have no problem getting adopted with his friendly personality, but the thought of leaving him alone there breaks my heart a little—he just hates being alone, just wants to be by my side 24/7. I also feel bad when I think about how most cat owners here have outdoor cats, and I feel like I’m contributing to that problem by giving him up, which is probably silly. If I keep him, I know he’ll always have a home, and vet care, and anything he needs until the day he dies... but I don’t know if I’m ready for that in my life. I’m absolutely torn on this.

I keep up basic communication by asking her how things are back home and the like, but she never responds to me and then acts like I don't ever want to talk to her and then begins saying manipulative stuff like ""you don't love me, you would just abandon me"" and ""I gave everything to you and this is how you repay me"".

We’ve been friends for a couple months now and we on now each other through mutual friends. We live in the same neighbourhood and talk a lot. She’s never called me bud or buddy or pal or anything like that (which I’m told is like a sign that you are in the friend zone) We don’t really talk about relationships to each other but when we go with our mutual friends and stuff like that get brought up she kinda turtles when I talk about stuff like that. We’ve done stuff together just one on one and it always is fine. Maybe I’m overthinking it. I think I’m letting it get to me. Or maybe I’m not. And I’m missing out and letting this girl get away from me. I just need some thoughts from y’all,27Mar2020,1

380,"Hey reddit i neven thought i'd be writting here but here i am, 
So a little back-story, about three years me and a five otheres made a online friend group on the ps4 now three years is a long time so alot of other people came in and out of the friend group, one of the (og) and i dated for a while (this will be important later) then she ghosted all of us that made me paranoid about everything i did i became extra nice to everyone 

Fast forward a year and a half (two weeks back from now) only four og left in and someone am going to call db joined and became close friends with my friend whom am going to call j i had no problem with this other than db being a little annoying.
The problems started two weeks after when db got cocky and when he didnt like something he would start saying how hes gonna kick me out of the group and i would replay with i made the group and to just have fun without ruining it for anyone else.

Yesterday most of us were playing together and having a good time db was playing fortnite with a full lobby with j and the two other og i was playing borderlands with two other people the night goes on and the two people i was playing with left so i joined in fortnite with the rest now its iportant to say that were a big party so if theres mor the 4 in a lobby we play creative so i said i was joining j and the others were happy about it db didnt like that idea he kept saying no i dont want you and just throwing a tantrum j and the others were quiet
As they were close friends with both of us but then my friends said no dont join i didnt want to overthink it so i thought their just doing something am sure i can make a map for it we can all play(i make maps in all games)
But no they just said you can only watch and then were kicking you all the flash backs of the girl i dated before came back and it felt like the worst thing ever! I broke down that night and kept overthinking it when i tried to text him he just ignored me 

I havent talked to any of them yet this is the first time this happened

381,"My son is a pretty normal 10 year old. Plenty of friends. Laughs, has fun. Kind of fucking bummed when it's time to turn technology off and do physical activities. Typical. He's been playing a ton of Fortnite with his friends lately and been locked away in his room. Wife and I aren't paying too much attention to screen time since it's quarantine and we are all stuck at home, however we usually have him take a few hours off midway theough the day.

Not sure ANY of that has to do with my question. We just haven't seen as much if him as we used to since he started playing on the PC I built him and I don't know if that will make what I am about to say worse or not.

Ever since he could talk, this kid has talked. He talks to us as well with no issues. He actually holds adult conversation very well. But he talks to HIMSELF all the time. In the shower, talking. Like thoughts out loud or questions, almost as if he is on one side of a conversation. Since we built the PC he has been unnaturally responsible about waking up at the buttcrack of dawn to get a shower and make sure his school stuff is ready so he can get some gaming in before the bus. This habit hasn't stopped since school let out. So he was just up now at 4:30 am and I thought he was on Fortnite. No, just sitting with the cat, listening to music and talking to himself. Or the cat I don't know, but honestly I might be worried more if it was the cat because this was like 10 minutes lol.

My question and tl;dr is: Should I be worried that he talks to himself so often? What does that signify? Am I doing something wrong as a parent to cause him feeling like he needs to do that?",27Mar2020,1
382,"I have a friend (let's call her K) who lives in Japan, and her possessive now ex-friend (let's call him B) has managed to make it so nobody can text her. 

B is currently quarantined with K because of the coronavirus, he had to stay with K because none of B's family wanted him staying with them, and for a while B seems fine, but then K stops talking to me for a couple days and i assume she's drifting away from me which kinda has me sad. 

After a few days of no talking she texts me saying that B went through her phone, and went through mine and K's messages, and saw that on one occasion we said we love eachother, though this is not romantic as I'm in love with somebody else and she has a boyfriend, but B used this to say that if K talked to me again that he'd tell K's boyfriend that she was cheating on him with me. 

This obviously isn't true, so i message B asking him to stop doing this and he absolutely goes off, i have many screenshots of awful thing's he's said (claiming he gave K hickies, calling K the n word, etc etc) that K was originally planning to show to her mom to get B out of her house or at least get him to leave her alone, but K was waiting until B was asleep in order to show her mom, but she never got any chances to do so. 

Then today, B somehow manages to convince K's mother to take K's phone away, and then he got K's phone and started texting me from her account but would mostly text me from his account, and he's as of right now completely isolated K from everyone but her family and him. 

Any additional information that may be helpful:
-I'm not sure which part of Japan they live in 
-I've been friends with K for almost two years 
-B has an impressive lack of self awareness 
-B can never admit when he's wrong 
-B is stupid but knows to plan ahead 
-When K tried to tell something B did, B got K's mom to tell K to apologize for ""making him look bad"" (this might show you a little about her mom idk)
-I live in Vista, CA 
-K's boyfriend lives in Canada (pretty sure it's either Toronto or Ontario but can't remember for sure) 
-K has said repeatedly that she's lost all respect for him 
-K and B were childhood friends up until about a week ago when this all started 
-K lives with her mom and her dad isn't around 
-B said he'd give her phone back once the coronavirus pandemic was over, but that's who knows how long 

If any of you have any idea how i could come back into contact with K as soon as possible then please comment it.",27Mar2020,1
383,"I don't know how to describe this feeling but it hurts and it feels resentful, disgusting and annoying. I was brought up in a cultural and religious family and was taught to have pride when it came to these kind of stuff. As an ex religious person and somewhat culturally disciplined it is hard to adapt to other values. 

I am having a very hard time fighting this emotion and it makes me feel extremely depressed and angry sometimes. 

I also want to add that when she performs oral sex on me, she does it pretty well, so well that it makes me think she had oral sex before although she claims she never had but only with me. 

Part of my problem can be my OCD, superstitions and other mythical believes that makes me question a lot of stuff including indefility.

387,"I know what you're thinking, imagine your partner writing a book, and you didn't even read it. How terrible would you be to do that? Well, that's how I thought until my partner had his book published. I honestly do find his work really interesting. It's a very specialised academic topic. So the book is essentially an academic journal. For someone like myself, let's just say it's heavy reading.

I have read my way through about 1/3 of the book, and understand the general intent, but the heavy detail I struggle to retain as the topic is so jargon heavy and not in my field of expertise.

My partner reminds me often how disappointed he is that I haven't read his book. To the point we're he makes me feel guilty if I read anything else with comments like ""do you think you'll ever get that into my book"". So I have hardly read anything at all since. I hate that I feel too guilty to read another book in front of him now.

I just feel like I'm wasting my time reading his book when I don't really understand half if it because of its heavy nature?

How can I let him know this? Or should I just stick it out and finish his book before anything else? Am I being selfish by not reading his entire book?",27Mar2020,1

390,"First off, sorry for the long post, but without at least this much length, I don't think I'd be able to properly explain my desperation and the intensity of the situation.

We're classmates and didn't really talk much, probably because I was frightened and got anxiety when I talk with her. You know just the usual feeling.

Since school came to a close due to the quarantine, I took it as an excuse to text her. We talked a lot and found that almost everything about us were similar. Our likes, dislikes, preferences and all that. We even share a common favourite country (Japan) and even a favourite weather (the calm before a storm). We've had a lot like a weeks worth of late night discussions, going really deep and exploring our insecurities and things. That's when I found things about her.

She just believes she's the worst person out there. She keeps saying how she wants to die and how she's done really bad things. I've tried a lot to convince her otherwise. She agrees at times, though I don't know if it was wholeheartedly. It's hard to make that out through text.

Well yesterday, we were talking deep in the night when she abruptly left the conversation. She almost never sleeps and I was a bit worried. But I hoped she went to sleep and I did the same. The next day, she didn't text me for the whole day. I was starting to worry, considering everything she had told me about her issues. She did text me that day, but not with the best of news.

She told me she was sorry she didn't text me but it's because she had been grounded the whole day because her dad caught her making a drawing on her hand. WITH A NEEDLE. She also accidentally cut a bit too deep and lost a lot of blood and the whole night was messed up. I tried to comfort, talked to her, told her how dangerous what she did had been. She was actually doing it when we were chatting. I was really shook by it. But the worst part was that she just didn't see what was wrong about her actions. I tried to make her understand but to no avail. 

And just now, she texted me saying she was deleting all social media for a month or so and would text me after. Completely out of the blue. I'm really worried for her and I don't want anything bad to happen to her. I do have her phone number but we promised each other we wouldn't call because we're both awkward at conversations. 

I might be over thinking things and all. Probably because I just finished reading 13 reasons why but still I am worried and I wanted advise. I want to save her. I don't know what to do next. Sorry for the long post and all but I'd really love it if someone could offer me some advice.

Thanks in advance",27Mar2020,1
391,"Coworker male (30+) made sex noises while putting hand creme on in front of female co worker (20) and said  this is better than sex.  Shes already told me she's felt uncomfortable with him before since he's text her out of the blue about drugs and when they work together he insists on walking her home even though he usually drives. (They both live about a 10 minute walk from work)

 I told her she should tell the manager since it's made her feel this way but she said that she wouldn't say anything unless it happens again.  She does know that he's gotten in trouble with one other co worker.  He's said two things that didn't sit right but I called him out on it. I  know that this isn't the first time (or even just the 3rd) he's made a woman in the workplace uncomfortable and my manager told me if male 30+ does something like this again to let manager know. 

I don't want to get 30+ male in trouble but I don't want things to escalate and 20 female to quit over this.  Plus she has a right to not feel uncomfortable in the workplace. The other thing she said when I told her to tell the manager was when is manager in when 30+ male isn't working?  

Side notes

20 female is very timid, friendly and socially awkward. She would probably just take it all and keep it to her self.  I know all our hand are cracked from covid-19 crazy hand washing/ hand sanitizing but I think most young women working with a guy (30+) would be uncomfortable with male coworker making sex noises while putting creme on there hands.",27Mar2020,1

I do a part time job in a hotel so I suggested her to find a part time job for herself as well (she doesn't work currently).

I'm not narrow-minded, but I'm just uncomfortable with my girlfriend stripping naked and dancing nude in front of strangers and giving them lap dances etc. But I've not told her that I'm uncomfortable with this as I don't want to hurt her or break her heart, as I love her a lot. At the same time I really don't want her to do this job, but I can't think of any way to convince her to abandon this idea without sounding like a jerk and hurting her.

So there's this person I've been talking to online for a few months, let's call them S. I met S through reddit around last december and we've been messaging each other pretty frequently. I always enjoy talking to them and recently, I've realized that I have developed romantic feelings them. The problem is that there's a lot of things that are making me question whether it's right to confess my feelings for them or not.

Roadblock #1) They're very similar to a sibling of mine

I have a sibling that's very similar to S. They have the same age and similar preferences. I, in no way, shape or form, harbor romantic feelings for my sister. It's just that it would seem weird from an outside perspective to want to date someone that's similar to a sibling.

Roadblock #2) Their ongoing mental illness issues

Without going into too much detail, S has major mental health issues, one area of this concerning their romantic state. They are generally confused romantically and I don't want to confuse that further by confessing to them.

Roadblock #3) Our current situations

I (M18) am about 5 years younger than S. As well as this, I am currently studying in university while S is a NEET. I'm just not sure if confessing my feelings is the right call considering my situation compared to that of S.

Roadblock #4) Fear

Just general fear, to be honest. Fear of being rejected, a fear that we can't go back to being friends if she does reject me, and fears that, even if we do enter a relationship, that it wouldn't work between us. I like this person. A lot. But I'm an extremely anxious person so even beginning to think about confessing brings up all of these fears at once.

Roadblock #5) My family

My family is very conservative when it comes to relationships. Arranged situations, at least one party being very rich in some way, and only looking in our own ethnic pool. If I were to confess to S, my parents would need a LOT of time to process this and even then, I don't know if they would be happy with me dating someone who is a NEET.

I've thought about confessing for some time, but I can't bring myself to do it with all of these roadblocks. This is the first time I've felt like this about someone, and I want to embrace it instead of hide these feelings out of fear that one of the roadblocks will prevent me from wanting to be with S. 

So with that, I ask for your advice.

I'm 20 a yo guy. Okay so i think i have 3 main emotions/characters that lead me and take over my personality.  Happiness, pride(which is accompanied by aggression) and then feeling down.
They sometimes take over me suddenly and i can't really recognize any pattern between them nor a trigger.  But most of the times, i feel pride and that i'm better and smarter than anyone else, that's because no one ever introduces something new to my mind, i don't think i'm in denial i just think that i'm above average when it comes to intelligence.  So when i feel this pride i'm also aggressive so i get into fights and so on, just to stimulate my mind, sensation seeking. Then usually my third character takes over, i isolate myself and i'm completely drained, i feel detachment from reality and emotional numbness. I try my best to go out with my friends and basically distract myself,  because i tend to be destructive in this phase and cut ties with others, which i regret later on. I can't find a pattern between the 3 as they come randomly and go suddenly and in exact cycle. I'm so tired and drained because of this, everytime it's getting worse and i don't know what to do. I know that i need to learn about these emotions more and understand them more, but that's also very difficult for me... most of my answers towards this understanding are always ""i don't know"", ""i'm not sure"", ""yes maybe this or maybe not"". I don't know if my third character is considered to be ""depersonalization"" as a defense mechanism, because it developed after things got really tough when i was 17.

Ever since I was 12 ( I'm 19 now)I was terrified I was gay. I dont even know why i grew up in a house that mainly supported lgbt rights and a few of my friends growing up were gay and never had the slightest issue with it but For around a year now my anxiety has gotten  worse I have lost my attraction to heterosexual pornography like I wont get an erection like I use to but I will if I look at gay porn and  even when I do finish to gay porn it doesn't feel good like 95% of the time where as with heterosexual pornography I will finish like after 30 minutes but it will not have an erection but it will feel a bit good. When I was 15 I watched a bit of gay porn but i did not feel any attraction what so ever as I did with straight porn.

Would there be something ethically wrong with masturbating to the latter part of the video where things are consensual? I thought about this and to be honest I couldn’t answer, on one hand I feel I would be distrurbed and felt like I was condoning what the violater did by masturbating but on the other hand I’m unsure if I would actually be condoning what they did because I don’t think it would be ok what they did in the beginning and I don’t condone it, but at the same time the sex does become consensual later on and would seem like a separate entity from the beginning. Honestly I don’t really know how to feel, I feel if this were to happen in real life even if i was able to masturbate I would feel bad after even though the parts I did it to were consensual.

I'm also a student researcher who's been joining some science fair competitions and I've already established some expertise on a certain field. However, I don't like being in this certain field. Sure, I've won awards and got recognized in this field but it's not my passion, I just feel that I got lucky all this time. And now, I'm being asked by my supervisor if I should continue this path for my 12th grade. I wanna tell my adviser that this isn't for me, that I prefer being in some other field than this one. I'm scared to tell her though because I've been trained in this certain field for 2 years already. I wanna make my adviser proud but I don't think I can do it the third time around, I've this urge and feeling that I'll do better in my preferred field.

412,"I (29M) live with two other people (30M, 31M) in London and we rent a flat for £2000 per month. I quit my job due to stress and began being self employed at the end of Feb. My plan was to do this while I looked for new employment.

I applied for Universal Credit while I waited for clientele to build up or Employment. I have applied to university, and been accepted beginning Sep 2020.

I have £15k ish in savings that I wanted to use as a house deposit once I had enough. But thought this safety net was there so quit my job that had me on Sertraline and in CBT.

Making £30 an hour as self employed but this was only a couple of hours a week as I built it up. With lockdown its looking like this will be 1 hour a week.

I need to pay £650 in rent for the month on 1st. I do not know what I will get in UC but used an online charity calculator it looks like £737.12 a month, not enough to cover rent and bills. Definitely not including food.

Should I cancel my rent payment? 

Should I tell the landlord? What should I say?

 Should I tell my housemates? What should I say?

Happy to move out if I could and wait to September and Uni to move back to London. But were Locked Down.

What will the repercussions be?

Will not paying fuck my friends and house mates?

Will it fuck my credit rating? And possible mortgage?

Will it fuck me being able to rent again?

What should I do?

Thanks.",27Mar2020,1
413,"Essentially what the title says, he’s been emotionally abusive and threatened to be physically abusive but I don’t really have a way to move out... yes that’s clearly the bigger issue but for today here’s what’s on my mind:

He says that I need to stop wearing my septum jewellery because that’s not how he wants to see his daughter (18F) and that as a father he has the right to say that. In my eyes he just wants to see me as what he wishes I was not what I am...

Anyway so I don’t want to take it out but every time he sees me he makes a point of it and today he said I need to (he didn’t ask more just ordered me and got stern about it) remove it (which I refuse to do) or change it to jewellery I can tuck (anything like that is too small to wear out for mine) but besides all of that I just don’t want to change who I am for him?!

If I try to stand up to him he’ll get angry and after a childhood of trauma from that I honestly can’t take it anymore... but with that being said I’m done letting him have what he wants. It’s my body and my choice.

With his abusive nature in mind and the fact that I grew up terrified and am emotionally traumatised from it all, any advice on what to do...? I can barely stand up for myself without crying but I just refuse to change it for him ...",27Mar2020,1
414,"So a little bit of backstory, my girlfriend was with her ex for about a year, they broke up and ended up moving away from each other, but they still stayed friends, and continued to hang out regularly (online chatting and gaming). But after a while her ex became controlling, always guilting her into feeling bad about herself and things she says and does, and other general things that abusive people tend to do to feel like they have control over someone, I'm not going to go into too much detail but it has led to serious depression for my GF. My girlfriend wanted to stay friends with her, but after so much for so long she finally blocked her totally from any and all phone/online communication recently. Her ex has always tried desperately to seek out any contact in the past times my GF blocked her and apologize and try to make up for anything she did, then she starts the abusive and controlling habits again, and it has been a cycle for far longer than it should have, but my GF just wasn't able to find it in her to drop her totally until now, and she has committed to that after serious long discussions between her and I.

The complicated part is that her ex is best friends with our best friends who we talk and game with online on a daily basis, and after a while of her ex not hanging around any of us, right after my GF blocked her, (funnily enough!) her ex wants to get back into the group and start hanging around our friends again. She only ever told me about her ex's abusive ways and her depression from it, so none of our other friends are in the loop. Now she's effectively ""blackmailing"" (not sure for a better word for it sorry) us by forcing my GF to interact with her if she wants to hang out with everyone else. I just see it as a way for her to try and weasel her way back into my GF's life, and start the abusive cycle anew. My GF is scared that if we say or do anything we might lose friendship with others, as her ex has no problems with lying about everything and turning my GF into the bad guy (as she has done with her other friend groups). The only way I see anything working out is that we have to just tell them everything honestly, but I just need some other opinions from people with clearer minds right now...

Sorry for the long read, but thank you if you made it this far.",27Mar2020,1

the thought of her being in contact with someone that raped her obviously made me uncomfortable. i told her that i couldn’t cope with her remaining in contact with him. she understood and blocked him on her social media after we talked about it for a couple of weeks. a couple more weeks went past and he’s been trying to contact her on different social media websites. she spoke with her therapist today (who has been trying to help her move past the stockholm syndrome) and she called me to say that she needs me to be calm and understanding if she does start talking to him again. i’m honestly at a loss. the thought of what he did to her makes me shake uncontrollably with anger and i find it very hard to deal with the emotions surrounding this situation. her feelings towards him are a toxic mixture of fear and love, she describes it as brainwashing. she says there’s a side of her that will always want to speak to him.

The training period took two weeks, plus a couple more weeks of shadowing. Last week, it was my first time selling on my own and I was ecstatic about my progress.

But unfortunately, even with the pandemic going on, the company would still not shut down and has no plans of closing any time soon.

A couple of weeks ago, we began sheltering-in-place.  
For a while, my mother-in-law was going between our house and my sister-in-law's house to take care of my sister-in-law's child so that my sister-in-law could finish her dissertation.  
We were okay with this until my sister-in-law had friends over from a nearby population center with confirmed cases of COVID-19. In light of this, we recisited how safe we felt with our mother-in-law traveling between the two houses. My brother-in-law works in an industry where his coworkers interface with the public.  
  
We decided we weren't comfortable with the situation. Because my sister-in-law needed help, and because we weren't comfortable with her traveling back and forth, we decided it would be best if we gave up her help. My sister-in-law assured us that my mother-in-law could stay there.  
  
Fast-forward 4 days... we just discovered that my mother-in-law is staying at a hotel instead of with my sister-in-law. We're concerned that she is at higher risk of exposure to COVID-19 at the hotel than at either our home or my sister-in-law's home and traveling between the hotel and my sister-in-law's.

How do we convince her to come back to our house?

Reddit, I know there’s some awesome, insightful people out here in this community so I thank you in advance for your ideas and inspiration in trying to make the most of a not-so-fun situation! 

Some background: The original plan was to head to Hawaii to get away from the cold, take advantage of the kids having time off of school, and basically to have a few days off from cooking to enjoy the family and hopefully see/swim with some sea turtles.  When back at home I was supposed to go out for breakfast with friends. I’m a bit bummed we had to cancel our trip and that I won’t be able to go out with friends to celebrate, but at the same time, I’m taking it mostly well in recognizing that the situation just is what it is and that I’m am grateful for my friends, family and I to be healthy and that we are not adding to stresses of the locals, including those in Hawaii. We know we will explore and swim with the turtles when the time is right, and eventually I will get out with friends ... just not knowing when is the only sad part.

What would you do to celebrate that’s a little out of the box?  Please no “Over the Hill” stuff... not because of the age thing (I’m fine with that and happy to continue to learn and grow, hopefully wiser, lol) but just with everything going on it’s a little too close to death then I really want to think about right now.

449,"I'm 26. I just got out of a toxic 8 year relationship, my son is like the sun and fresh air at the end of a very long dark tunnel that was almost impossible to escape. He's my dependant its going to be much harder to reinvent myself with a small child to worry about but he's my entire reason for existing and he's all the goodness in the world. Everything I did and will do is for him. I need the best for him.

 We're in Ontario. I just left Toronto and im in a smaller town. I have a little money saved but with mediocre credit and no current employment I can't buy a house not just yet. Rent is high in general so for the time being him and I share a bed in the spare room at my aunt's place. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have enough to go back to school and this where I need some advice. I need to make up for the fact that I'm only going to be a single income household so I need a career where I'll be able to provide for my son and I without depending on anyone else. Is it possible that I'll find somebody, ya, but if my life depends on on having someone else that seems like a plan to fail, I need to prepare for the possibility that its only ever gonna be me. For those same reasons I feel I need to have benefits, I would rather a mediocre salary with amazing benefits and job security. I can live within my means. Having hours that allow me lots of time with my son or even being able to work remotely would be huge. I want to provide for him but I also need to be there for him. 

I'll tell you some things I've considered but I'm also hoping for suggestions on directions I never would have thought have or may have overlooked. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Programming: I've put a lot of thought into taking something like computer programming or software engineering and analysis. The salary would be amazing the jobs are plentiful and if something like this covid quarantine happened again or become a regular thing that happens I would have a very safe job that I can even do from home. Flaws? I hate math, I really do, I'm hoping that with a tutor I could push through but its honestly a huge deterrent for me. Its also a three year program which might be a long time to have my son in daycare and have me not working. We can only live in a room together for so long. Side question, can I get a job in IT without a degree? I've started teaching myself python online if I really put my mind to it and teach myself all the skills I need online for the next year or so could I possibly jump straight into the workforce or do I have to have that degree? 
2. Massage therapy: I've always thought of this as one of those dream careers. Sure it may take a told on my own body especially my hands but I actually enjoy giving massages I don't think I have one friend who hasn't received a massage from me. This one does offer a good salary and I really have no cons so for now its at the top of my list. Its a 2 year program, so fairly quick and painless. If anyone has any pros or cons to throw my way I'm glad to hear them! One potential pro is that its considered a healthcare position so I believe that having this degree will help if I ever wanted to try my hands at the highly competitive nursing degree. Which I might consider doing if my hands get sore, or I just feel the need to try something new. 
3. Personal Support Worker: Pros! 10 month program, option for weekends plus online, I wouldn't have to put my son in daycare at all if I do the weekend/online option. They're pretty desperate for PSW's so if I start Sep 2020 I could by job ready by summer 2021 even. Theres career paths, community which would be driving to peoples homes or the other option would be to work at a retirement home. Each of those have pros and cons too. Another pro is that they are so in demand that there's a $5000 bursary I'll probably qualify for so other than the textbooks this one is free. Cons cons cons. Where do I start. Well cleaning up shit or puke is a pretty huge deterrent although as a single mom I'm now pretty used to it lol. Private homes are pretty scummy and pay little more than minimum wage and 0 benefits. Government homes usually pay pretty decent and you do get benefits after a year I believe. I don't know much about the community option but blasting my music while driving to each home sounds like a nice way to reset myself before helping the next person. Sometimes people just need their dishes washed,  their yorkies walked and. help with getting in and out of the shower. More pros I love helping people. 
4. Early Childhood Educator: Pros 10 month program I weekend per month the rest online. I could work at a daycare and maybe even have my son their with me (not sure about the rules on that) I could be a kindergarten teacher. Having the same hours as my son would be amazing! Having the summers off with him, march break. I feel that not having his dad in his life and not having any siblings he'll need me even more. Cons, well they just cut a lot of teachers and EA's there was JUST a huge strike. The pay isn't really great and that might mean taking up a second job anyway.

Ok so those are my top 5 choices, there's also a marijuana plant opening near here and I did see a one year program on ""Cannabis applied science"" my aunts boss is the one opening it so I might have an in.

Already annoyed by the trashed house, that was undeniably the consequence of my shitty roommates prior escapade the night before, I pounded on my own door with no answer. Finally, I carded my way in and broke into my own room, only to find two random strangers, whom I have never met, asleep naked in my own goddamn bed. At this print I am already late for work and burning with rage. I kick the two freeloaders out of my house, still naked, and slammed the door shut on them.

In case this helps with and extra details, this is basically the part 2 to my currently crumbling life, I also copy and pasted this from discord, so sorry for any mistakes. I'm 12 btw

So recently, I couldn't endure the screams of hell that come from my sisters and stepmom, and I've tried all that ***I*** can do to get it to stop, but it always comes back to ""well you can't change who they are"" and ""you have to have more (meaning infinite) patience because they're you're family"", so what I've been doing is just staying in my room to avoid anyone from saying anything, but now that my dad sees that I'm upset and he just gets mad because ""no matter what I get you or take you (meaning buying stuff for me), you're never happy"", he just tries to find any reason to be mad at me.

So next what happens is my stepmom pulls me downstairs for and """"talk"""", where she just yells at me and says that my issues are ""very little"", meaning basically nothing to them, and how I should have more (meaning infinite) tolerance towards them because ""they are my sisters"" and ""it's nothing, she literally said ""just be like a robot and just take it forever"", and ""how does he think he's a person when he's just twelve"", and my dad just tries to repeat what she says, but in a different way, which I only guess so he can feel included, or to make her think he's on her side, they're trying to blame me for my problems without ""blaming me""

So my dad takes me somewhere, so he can find a reason to try to start a problem with me, and once he does, he just insults me, threaten to ""beat me up"", or just tries to hurt me, and then when he see's that I'm ""about to cry"", he tries to take it all back, by apologizing, and making me remember the good things he said and forget the insults and just generally hurtful things he said, for example ""it sucks my son just became a sad guppy of a boy"", ""it wouldn't matter if the CPS took him, he doesn't want to be here anyways"", ""I don't care anymore"", ""you spoiled ungrateful bratty kids"". there's more, but that's just what I can clearly remember.

but I feel like I'm just stuck in a loop, just being abused and neglected, and doing it over again. and I'm just scared of telling anyone, because I'f I do tell someone, then CPS would likely take me away, but all my relatives do drugs, so I could just me in a worse situation And if I don't tell anyone, then my dad will likely just escalate and actually hurt me

and I'm literally helpless, and all I can do I just have a fake smile, which is really hard when everyone around you is just bringing you down.

I guess I'm just really unsure what to do, because I feel like just killing myself would make it easy for me ( I've already tried a few days ago) but I sometimes, I think about what I could do in my future if I just keep holding on. I'm really just looking for answers to this mess, thanks for reading",27Mar2020,1

462,"I’m on a mobile device so pardon any spelling or grammatical mistakes. 

My father was in a state penitentiary with a life sentence and I helped put him there. It was the kind of justice that every monster who preys on children deserve. He was locked up for nearly 7 years so unfortunately he had a lot of victims. Decades of abuse he heaped on the innocent. When he was sentenced I found peace and rarely thought about him. That is until about two weeks ago. 

I woke from a nightmare and of course he was in it. From that day I would check the inmate lookup to see his status because I just KNEW he was either dying or dead. Nobody from the prison system ever notified me of what happened. Yesterday I was going through to check his status and it was updated to say deceased. I held my breath for what felt like an eternity when I read it. 

All day yesterday I felt a type of glee that the universe removed him from the planet. His poison would never again hurt anyone. Then the sun went down and I found myself obsessing over the past. I’m trying to figure out how to stop giving him space in my head. My previous peace is obliterated and I don’t know how to handle this. 

Have any of you kind internet strangers found yourselves in a similar situation? How did you process it without going down the rabbit hole and mentally reliving the nightmare that was your life as a child?

472,"I’ve been living in my head thinking about what went wrong with this woman I’ve fallen for. It's not exactly a break-up but we've gone out a few times!

We first met back in mid-2018, connected briefly, then went back to our respective countries which are on opposite sides of the world. We stayed in touch and met once again at the end of the year when I travelled to her country.

During the second half of 2019, we got in touch again and started text almost every day and have occasional scheduled calls. While we still lived far away, I felt there was a connection between us and the conversations have always been… natural, raw and personal. As we grew closer, I picked up the courage to do things that I hoped would show how I felt, such as sending her a gift on her birthday, which she seemed to love. I’ve been honest about how I thought she was special and amazing - although I never said “I like you”.

Then, we met again in Christmas 2019 when I travelled to her place again. At this point, I started to really like her but was unsure of what would happen with the distance - and the fact that there’s no chance of us moving closer to each other in the next 2 years at least. We went out a few times and had the best time. I did what I thought would show how I felt - flowers, gifts with handwritten notes, picked up the tabs and planned the dates to her liking. By this point, it was clear that both of us really enjoyed each other’s company. She has always been receptive of my advances and said she had lovely time with me, asked me to visit often.

I was still hesitant to tell her outright I liked her, as I was still hoping there would come a day in which we’ll live in the same city together, and I’d stand a better chance then. Throughout our interaction, I've felt she's not the type who could do a long-distance. I was trying to make an arrangement in which I would live closer to her for a few months mid-year and wanted to use the momentum to tell her then.

Anyway, after returning home, we still texted. I did a couple more things to keep keep the “sparks”, e.g. sending flowers to her office, which she said she liked! 

However, several weeks in, things turned different. After she came back from a trip to visit her parents, her schedules had turned busy with work and other commitments, and she started responding less. I didn’t have any reason to believe that she didn’t want to speak with me - everything was going well just before that. I didn’t hear back for a couple of weeks, couldn’t call her. Finally managed to hear back. She said she’d been hectic so wasn’t able to text anymore. I was surprised so decided to tell her outright how I felt. She then said she just wanted to be friends and saw me as a friend/brother figure and that she doesn't want me to waste my effort/time. I was surprised because she never referred to me as a ""friend"".

I've been replaying this to figure out if there was anything I could have done to save the situation. Or is trying to build a relationship someone you barely know long-distance a lost cause from the beginning?

Last semester I was a biology major with no minor; my grades weren't stellar because of my mental health. I had already moved out of my mom's house thinking it would fix the situation, but nothing changed. On top of that, the school had never given me financial aid for the fall semester after accidentally including something on my FAFSA. I tried to go in to fix the issue, but they never ended up following up on fixing it, hence they hadn't given me aid. When it was time to apply for classes for Spring 2020, I never enrolled and instead just stopped attending. I never put in anything official saying I was taking the semester off.

The initial plan after that was to go to a technical school and become a med tech, but I had no money for the downpayment they were demanding. Then my grandparents had graciously given me a car, only expecting that I pay for gas, insurance, and any repairs it may need. I have been working in order to do so, but I'm currently living paycheck to paycheck because of the pandemic with all my bills just barely being paid for the month.

480,"Hey everybody it's my first time posting here and I will keep it brief. I'm really at a loss, I don't know what to do in this position and nothing feels like the right answer. I am wondering if I'm the only one, or if I'm being completely lame and melodramatic but here it goes..



I(22m) have had a very rough time keeping a job the past few years. No excuses, I lack discipline, I smoke a lot of weed, and Im not entirely good at being talked down to and taking it respectfully. I know, eat your heart out im a clown. I've come to terms with this and have been working very, very hard to turn my life around. I recently moved out of a toxic living situation back in with my mother, who is a work from home hair dresser. I had a hard time finding a job at first but it wasn't long before I got my old job as a Car Salesman back. It felt good being able to financially contribute in a meaningful way. 



Not long after, the dreaded COVID-19 strikes. I was already facing some challenges, I was anxious about jumping back into such a cutthroat business and largely forgot a lot of the process. I have come back at a *terrible* time to re learn. Now my issue is this; I'm in VA, a state still largely open with the exception of nom essential retail. I'm *terrified* of contracting this virus at work and bringing it home to my **at risk mother.** She is self isolating and terrified of the virus, and it would kill me to bring it back home to her. I am of a personal belief that we should be taking this *way* more seriously, and dealership sales departments should be closed, if not severely reduced staffing (showrooms are easily 10+ people at any given time). We're still expected to col call every customer (how the fuck am I supposed to convince someone to come in whom I want to stay their ass at home?) dealership sales have been hit, but we're still selling cars left and right, but it just feels so irresponsible! Because of the financing deals with 0% interest due to COVID, they're acting like we should be selling *more* cars. 



I recently ended a few days of isolation after discovering a potential exposure tested negative, but I'm coming back to work today and I'm fucking *terrified.* We have one bottle of Lysol to share for everyone in sales. People are scared. I am expected not only to keep moving business as usual, but to overperforn and ""prove myself"" as I'm just coming back and I used to be quite good at this job. When I share my concerns, I can tell by the face of my brother, by the face of my bosses (pretty much everyone except my mother), that everyone thinks it's my lazy innate laziness kicking in looking for an excuse to stay home. I feel very much like the boy who cried wolf. I've lost a lot of jobs over my ""mental health issues"" and now I'm in a position where my mental health is being hugely, hugely affected. And not only that, my physical health (moreso my mother) is at risk! Again, **I'm not afraid of what this virus will do to me. I live with my mom and brother and both me and bro work with people.** 



I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place with this one. Does anyone else feel like this? Anyone else stuck in this mindset right now? 




Thanks so much in advance to anyone who decides to help me out with this.

482,"Hey Reddit,

I am 28M and weigh 118 kilos today. I thought it would be best to try something new since we are all quarentined and researched a little about Keto dieting. I weighed 122.5 on 23 March when I started the diet.

The meals I have now follow a series of foods which have high fat and low carb(average 50 carbs per day). Now, the thing is I'm from the southern part of India where rice is staple food(High on carbs) and my average per day consumption would be ~1 kilo of cooked basmati rice containing 500-600 gm of carb whole meal included. 

My carb reduction has reduced 10 folds since the last few days and I'm feeling a lot of fatigue in simple activities such as walking for 20 mins or cleaning my house. Is feeling fatigue due to change in diet normal or is my body telling me something is wrong? If I should stop my new diet and go back to the staple diet, my carb consumption would shoot up and my weight may go more than what I was. 

I really don't want to get messed up during this time, there are hardly any health care services nearby accepting patients other than the Covid right now. Any advice would be great 🙏",27Mar2020,1

Since I can work from home and still get things done, and since there’s a stay-at-home order and cases in my state have BALLOONED as they have everywhere and tripled over the past week, I am super uncomfortable with coming back any sooner than I have to. It makes me anxious and it feels ethically wrong to put others at risk or being Risk to myself by going out unnecessarily. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to explain to my boss that while I no longer have a fever and I may be fine, I would feel irresponsible coming into the office if I don’t have to? I’m stressed out. 

Thank you",27Mar2020,1
487,"So this will be a bit long 

First half of it I’m innocent 

Second part I’m not so I guess the first part was my karma 

The third part is just 
Aftermath months later 



First part 
So last year around September one of my friends (lets call her B) and her boyfriend for no reason make up these sick and twisted rumours about me. Brainwashed my best friend (N) and said that I said shit about her and that I laughed at her anxiety or when she was having depression. Which wasn’t true at all!!!! I have bad anxiety and depression my self !! My bestfriend N ended up believing them since she had doubts about me. 
B and her boyfriend also made up some disgusting period rumour to make me seem disgusting  and gross. N went ahead with it.

Before this drama Me and N had always been close like sisters. We became best friends as we related allot with our mental health and also other stuff. Beginning of friendship was amazing. She made me get out of my shell and made me feel confident. We were both alway there for eachother. Later on her anxiety got worse it ended up me being there more for her and mine being shrugged off or seen as not as bad !, friendship ended up having no boundaries. Even prioritised her before allot of my other friends, my problems. Even having to cancel dates or valentines days with my BF since she would have breakdowns and I wouldn’t want her to hurt her self. Anyways she believed everything B said and said her reasoning was I was barely there for her and she had doubts about me which I never knew of !! 

N then decided to take revenge and expose on something like we BOTH did!

Part 2 

Now this is where my friends 
S and Z come along 
They are my close high school friends! We were basically a trio! 
S and me were always close however she used to be a bit controlling back then. She introduced me and N. Me and N ended up having allot in common and eventually hung out more but S would get annoyed or upset about it although at the time we would never exclude her however she would exclude her self which lead us to hanging more and eventually we became best friends! S at the time would question or be upset at everything Everytime we would all hang as a group. However if one of us wasn’t there it was actually all g! Anyways later one me and N started talking bad about S which continued on for a year and half! Now although S was controlling, she did have an extremely nice heart and was actually always there for me on my worst! She actually even started changing. But instead we continued. Her and N stopped talking but me and S still talked. Which makes it worse on me because I could have just talked to her face to face instead of continuously talking about her. At the time I honestly just kept thinking about the minor bad stuff when she actually had allot of good in her. Later on it all stopped when we all became one group again! I started to feel guilty as I realised I never made effort with her and she still did! She always made sure I was okay, included me in plans. Prioritised me and All I did was bitch about stupid shit. This was when I wanted to start trying and becoming a better friend to her.
Z was also my close friend! She’s this chill extremely cool person to hang with. We had great banter. Never had anything bad to say about her. 


Anyways 3 months after we all became a group. The drama started! That’s when B brainwashed N. N ended up wanting revenge exposing me to S telling her all the things we BOTH said but made it seem like she felt bad. I owned to it and my part told S how sorry I was.


The thing is I didn’t wanna cause more drama so  I didn’t wanna bring N into but I did mention anything that was said we BOTH did! This also upset Z since she always had my back when S felt upset when She thought I was being distant from her. N also told Z I said this one particular thing about her which wasn’t true nor do I remember !!! It was hard for me to deny anything at this point since the disgusting rumours and sick rumours which weren’t true made these shitty things I actually did worse !! S actually also had my back with the rumours and even after finding out what I said about her she still didn’t believe those rumours. But was upset that she had given me the benefit of the doubt about the stuff I actually did say about her! She also knew N wasn’t as innocent but it was worse on me since I knew her longer! 
After this I basically had no friends left. 
I decided to make the last of 2019 fixing my self. And getting back to a good mental health and back to my studies. 


Part 3 
3 days into 2020  N calls and apologises to me and mentions how B was brainwashing her and that she’s sorry for everything. She also ended in hospital for harming her self. I didn’t want anything bad to happen and was honestly willing to forgive and move past. Me and Z also talked again for a bit. 

I was happy that something had been cleared up ! However still had yet to apologise to S and Z ! 

I sent a message to S and sent a miss call if she could call me back to clear things up. I had not gotten a response.

However I’m extremely confused what to do with Z since this something I don’t remember. However during the apology N said she remembers me saying it but understands if I don’t remember. This confuses me since she accepted she did do just as much as I did to S but remembers me saying one hurtful thing to Z ! 

It’s made the apology harder since I need to explain something I didn’t do! 
I’ve accepted and owned up all those numerous terrible things I said about S !! But I know that one terrible thing about Z I wouldn’t have had any reason to say!!
However I just wanted things to be over and done with and fixed so I have tried calling z! 

Anyways me and N have been civil. And she was wanting to make plans to hang out. I kept having to change them since I had allot fo stuff and family problems going on. I ended up sleeping in today due to bad anxiety overnight 

However today N got annoyed and said that I shouldn’t have slept late if I knew I wouldn’t wake up and that there’s no point in stressing about something small that would ruin the plan.
Although I understood it would be annoying for someone to keep bailing but knowing what happened between us I felt a bit annoyed. We have a 10 min argument and then cooled off and rearranged another day.
Her bday is also coming up and she mentioned how she wanted me and z to make up and she would be upset if I couldn’t come to her bday.

Although last year I had cancelled mine due to the drama. Also her saying I owed her money for Ubers which she would do on her own. Even when I told her I was broke! I paid her either way. And with the money I saved for my bday. 

Anyways I’m still willing to try to fix things with S and Z ! I know this is karma in a way and honestly if this didn’t happen I wouldn’t have actually learnt my lesson. 

But I just feel annoyed about N still taking things like nothings wrong ? Even making me feel guilty if I missed her birthday. 

When our friendship started having no boundaries I was literally there for her though any problems she had. While I had to literally spend ages to explain mine if I couldn’t come to her house. My problems would barely be taken seriously. There was also a time she blamed me for giving her alone time when she had asked me to! She later said I left her alone.
Through everything I still apologised. Even after being told I’m never there for her or I don’t have sympathy as I did before!

I don’t wanna lose anyone as a friend. I just don’t know what to do.",27Mar2020,1

But recently she's been extremely paranoid, she talks to no one, she's always agitated, anytime I try to help her she sees me as her enemy.
Altho sometimes I can convince her that whatever she's saying I get it but I'm not her enemy.
She doesn't have a job nor a structured life, she's been with this guy for a year and they seem to always be fighting and abusive to each other but idk how Is that related to anything.

489,"I \[M28\] am a straight male. However, I've always had a preoccupation with being naked in front of groups of people. This preoccupation includes a fascination with nude scenes. I enjoy watching male actors do nude scenes and imagining what it would feel like to be naked on set.

I was recently sharing my screen Skyping with one of my best friends, and I accidentally opened up a different tab that I had mistakenly left minimized. It was a clip from a mainstream HBO show of a male actor doing a nude scene. I closed it as quickly as I could, but I am sure that he saw that it was a naked GUY, not a naked GIRL. Now he's acting weird, and I can only assume that it's because he thinks I'm gay (which obviously makes sense). 

What should I do? I feel that the actual explanation (preoccupation with nudity) isn't exactly less weird than actually being gay. I feel like any conversation we would have about it would just make the whole thing even more awkward. BUT -- I also don't want him to think that I'm gay. I'm torn.

491,"CA, USA. Sorry, this is kind of long winded but I don’t know who to ask or where to ask this

A week ago I purchased a car off of a private selling site, so it was a one-time payment and now I outright own the car. One issue that we didn’t fully notice until the paperwork was filled out and the money was handed over was that the registration wasn’t paid for since 2018. When we asked him about it all he said was “Yeah, things got piled up and I just forgot” He said the amount due is at or about $400.

One day I was talking to my manager about it and she mentioned registering the car as non-operational and whenever I can afford to pay the registration and the title transfer the fee would be way less than paying for the registration. 

However, now with the quarantine going on, all DMV offices are closed and the registration is so overdue that I can’t do anything about it online. 

What do I do or really what can I do? Is the non-operational idea a good one? How is the process of registering it as non-op and then registering the car again when I wanna drive it?",27Mar2020,1

493,"i don’t really know how to explain this, but i’ll try the best i can. 

i’ve been with my boyfriend for almost a year, and it’s been... ok. he has anger issues so he gets mad at the smallest things, then he’ll get super rude and call me a bitch, stupid, whore, etc. sometimes he even tells me to cut myself deeper and hopefully i’ll die. even when he’s not mad because of me and he only does that shit to me. when he’s not mad anymore he usually gets sad and says he regrets everything and he’s so sorry but then he keeps doing shit like that. 

he lets his friends be dicks to me and doesn’t care at all, and this one girl he talks to is such a bitch, she constantly tells him to breakup with me, she talks shit about me for no reason at all, and she tells me to kill myself too. i already struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts so i don’t need that shit. when i bring up the fact that i hate that he just lets his friends make fun of me he ignores me or gets super annoyed like i’m the one that did something wrong. 

i think he’s cheating on me too but he promised he’d never do that, but he got mad before and told me he’s cheating on me and he has another gf, and because im super sensitive and gullible, i believe that. he’s tried to tell me he just said it because he’s mad and didnt mean it and i want to believe that but i can’t. 

there’s so much more shit he does and did but i’d rather not say them all. 

on the other hand, he’s the only person i have in my life right now, and i love him so much despite all that. i honestly think i might kill myself if we breakup, because i can’t handle being all alone again, but i don’t wanna tell him that so he doesn’t think im trying to guilt trip him or anything.

However, my PRINICPAL manager (hes above the senior managers and just below the owners of the company. So he oversees my entire department) has treated me unfairly in the beginning. On my first day working, he was like scolding me and being really mean. ""YOU WILL NOT BE LATE! YOU WON'T LIE TO ME. I DONT LIKE LIARS!!.."" etc. I didnt understand what the hell his issue was since that was my first day and he didnt know me. 

Later, one of my managers said ""the person you replaced was Hispanic and was a terrible worker. Maybe he doesn't like Hispanics and that's why he talked to u that way. I understand if he would be wary of hispanic workers. I'm not excusing him but I understand."" 

 I am Mexican.. the principal has gotten nicer to me (I'm an excellent worker and have done nothing but excel and bring in money to the company) but still doesn't talk to me much. 

I just dont know if it's worth talking about with HR during my exit interview about the way the prinicpal talked to me and the fact that one of my managers things its because I'm hispanic? It hurt hearing that from my manager and also being talked to like that from the principal.

She asked about some details and I was reluctant to give them, but eventually did. She has not hooked up/went on any dates since the breakup, which I was not expecting. I didn't introduce this info to make her jealous or feel bad, and I'm really regretting it now because she might still have some feelings for me. I do not see her as anything but a close friend at the moment, and I guess I felt like mentioning Tinder because it's something I would talk to close friends about. After telling her, she wanted to make an account and I helped her, which further makes me feel like I made the wrong choice and that she now feels pushed to ""catch up"" to me.

499,"Sorry if this post comes across aggressive or like a rant I was trying to be as calm as possible but I am a bit frustrated. 

My partner has a best friend who I have become friends with us well over the course of our relationship overall I think he's a good guy despite disagreeing with him on a few issues. 

The problem that I'm facing is that I feel this friend has an extreme lack of self-awareness when it comes to one issue in particular which is making it very difficult to talk to him without getting upset. 

Basically he has a very well paying job, over double the average wage of a person in my country. And although he does have expenses he is lacking some of the major ones such as rent. Inshort he is very well off much more than 90 percent of our friend group, consisting mostly of students, or people with lower paying positions as him, and less fortunate circumstance. 

Here's where I have an issue, he has a habit of spending a lot of money, which is fine if he's got the extra cash I don't see any problem in him having fun with it, the problem is after he spends all of his spending money he will complain to myself, my partner, and other people in our group about how broke he is. I have always found this very frustrating because his idea if broke is our standard living. he thinks because he's run out of spending money after going on expensive trips, buying luxury items, eating out, and drinks he is poor and struggling at least that's how I feel it comes across. he will come back from a very expensive trip ( at times approximately $2000+ for the weekend) and complain that he has no money and he's concerned about paying bills. Hes invited me to come on these very expensive trips before and when I told him I couldn't afford the plane ticket let alone the rest of the trip (including other expensive activities) or have the time to go (work and school) he seemed confused because to him that amount was chump change, but to me it was over A month's rent for the flight alone. 

I usually try to explain to him as politely as I can that his idea of broke is our and most people's idea of very well off. but he just doesn't seem to get it and will get very defensive and for lack of a better word butthurt over this. 

It's only gotten worse since the virus. Most of my friend group has lost their jobs including myself because of the quarantine and self-isolation. He was very concerned about losing his as well which is fair it's not optimal for anyone to lose their job, but recently he was informed that his job was secure and he would not be laid off he informed us by messaging our group chat about it in what I considered kind of a boastful way, but maybe I'm being oversensitive. I am understanding that he's just happy and I'm happy for him as well but it just comes across as very insensitive considering almost everybody else in the chat has lost their jobs and is struggling. 

This upset my partner and myself as well as a couple of other friends in the chat which led to a bit of an argument about finances. with most of the points being that he is one of the most if not the most financially well-off one of us in the group and if being laid off for a little while would break him as much as it would break the rest of us it is because of his luxurious lifestyle and if he cut back on his spending he would be in a comfortable position unlike the majority of us. 

He seems to have the belief that people are poor by choice and not by situation. Which greatly upset one friend in particular who has had a very hard life, I won't go into details but he's been on his own since he was a young teenager and is in constant financial struggle because of it and other tragedies. 

I feel like he doesn't understand the position of privilege that he's in and it is getting increasingly more frustrating to talk with him because of this. I don't want to cause any problems because like I said he is my partner's close friend but it's getting very hard to keep my mouth shut when he goes off. 

I'm not sure if I should continue to keep my mouth shut and maybe just distance myself from this friend as much as I can to avoid this behavior. Or if maybe I should speak up and if so how I would go about that. I would like for him to understand where we are coming from because I don't want to lose him as a friend or have other friends drop him because of this (some are currently very angry with him because of this behavior.) But I feel like it might be a situation that he will never fully understand unless he's experienced it.

501,"(Wrote this on mobile, sorry if there's layout problems and if it's too long.)

I am a 4th year university student in the UK. I have only 1 semester's worth of work to complete and then I would graduate.
That means I've completed 85% present of my degree already.

I have 3 essays and a dissertation still to do, all which require extensive research. I am also expected to carry out a presentation online to a professor and around 10 other students in a conference call however, my internet is not fast and I also don't have a good mic/audio setup (I have voiced my concerns to my professor but she hasn't replied to me).
I will also have some form of take home exam it seems, as in-person exams are cancelled.

My problem is that I am feeling a bit too anxious/depressed about the whole coronavirus thing to sit and focus on essays. 
I am back at home with my parents and they watch the news all day. I also find it hard not to look at the news at every given opportunity. They also unload their own stress about the situation onto me.  Anytime I get slightly motivated to do my work, it's like I have a mental wall that blocks me from doing it. I just can't seem to care about my university work right now. Usually, I enjoy writing essays and I would say I am a hard worker but I feel like my essays and my degree does not matter anymore.

Since we are in lockdown, theoretically it means that I should have even more time to do my work and less distractions. But, I just can't bring myself to do anything university related. I am the kind of person who is easily concerned and worried for other people, even if I have not met them (I used to cry myself to sleep about poverty in Africa).

My grandma is feeling sick and we don't know if she has it or not, but she had 3 friends over recently before the lockdown and 1 of them have died while the other 2 are in hospital.

So, is this all just an excuse? Do I just need to stop feeling sorry for myself and take my head out my a**e and do my work? Is anybody else feeling like this?
Im seriously considering just dropping out of university since I probably cannot graduate without completing these assessments. I wasn't even planning on using my degree after I gradaute anyway.

DISCLAIMER : \*trigger warning\* DEPRESSIVE CONTENT. ONLY READ IF YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT MOOD.

**Background** : M 26 living and working with parents.

**Story** :

I am recently trying to uncover myself and have gone into painful childhood trauma.

My mother has always been mentally ill, exhibiting schizophrenic behaviour and has always been emotionally unavailable. Even though she smiles, laughs and talks (rarely), there has not been a single day I can remember her giving me emotional support of any kind. I understand that its her illness that has stopped her from being a normal mother, but it just feels alone sometimes, that I have missed out on essential love and care everyone gets.

My father has been abusive towards my mother a couple of times and during my childhood I was always afraid of him. Hence, never was I able to express fully and talk my heart out with him. Now growing old, he has been telling me I am his only friend and he only wants me to be happy. I understand because of my mother he himself has been through a lot, but does that justify his behaviour with my mother and me. He always said that the reason they did not go through a divorce was because of its ill effects on us(their children). I never understood this.

I was molested by my biology teacher(male) when I was in class 10. He made me do things which I never knew was right and even had the audacity to tell me to call him for more. I never went back. But what is nagging me now, is did I do it intentionally ? Did I not stop it because somewhere I did not want to ? Was I that weak to not stand up for myself when I was as old as 15yrs ?!

I had a normal schooling, did engineering, came back to support my aging parents by joining our small family business. But since the past year, I am getting restless as to what kind of a person I am. I have never really connected to anyone. More of a ""who cares, shit happens"" sort of a guy. Never romantically involved with anyone, which does make me feel if something is wrong with me. More than being afraid of being understood, I was always afraid of not understanding others and the world.

On top of all this, the most shameful thing(yes), is I might have started to develop feelings for one of my cousins, getting obsessed with her. BUT, only because she too reciprocates by saying that I am her #1 priority and the most important person in her life. She too gets restless when I dont reply to her texts soon and keeps thinking what I am doing. Same me. Only difference, I guess is I am getting ummmmm.. not so sistery feelings but more of something just shameful. And she probably feels protected because I am her big bro. And this is causing a lot of guilt. Sometimes I want to deeply know how exactly she feels. But then I remember that I do not look good (average height, started male pattern baldness(surprise, surprise)). Its a lot of confusion.

I have started comparing myself to others realizing how much smarter and mature everyone is more than me. I have started feeling small and unworthy. I had suicide ideations, and running away from home fantasies, but I those have been manageable. I am feeling more sensitive than normal and gets easily offended at any slight remark. I have been feeling that my mind is regressing. I was more mature when I was 20 perhaps, as these things did not bother me. I had more of a carefree attitude, and a happy go lucky personality. Rarely anyone remembers me these days and I have to knock on everyone's doors to talk to me.

Sometimes, I am really comfortable being alone. And it doesn't scare me living alone my entire life. It really doesn't. But sometimes, I just wish to find someone as broken as me to get to know my scars.

Sometimes I feel I have been through a lot and proud of how strong and far I have come. But then I realize there are many others going through worse situations and still being content and happy. I just feel weak.

**Help** :

Kind reader who did read the entire thing, thank you. My question to you, Do I have any reason to stress or I am overthinking things ? Is this normal or I have been through a lot and need to assure myself that I am strong ? Am i just being dramatic ?

Kind  but true words will be appreciated.

P.S. Any of you telling me to go to therapy because of my suicide ideations, dont worry. They are well under control. I will definitely try therapy once this gets over. Before that, just want your honest opinions. Thanks.",27Mar2020,1

I got kicked out in July from my parents and live in my own with him. This month bills were okay from savings but going foreword idk what to do. My landlord won’t freeze rent because he can’t freeze the mortgage. 
The government “help” with 1,200 per household isn’t going to help us either. Due to us making less than 23,000 a year we would’ve gotten 600 each (my rent is 800/mo plus utilities). But because we both had to file as dependents for 2018 and 2019 we won’t even get anything from the gov to help. Neither of our parents help us financially in any way. 
Our city we live in recently went on lockdown as well. If anyone has advice or knows what I can do to make more money during this time let me know. 200-300 a paycheck is not living wages and I don’t get vacay days or pto. Neither does he.

I work in a office job that makes good money, and she works at FedEx making good money as well.

It's hit super close to home and I'm more worried than anything about our 9 month old daughter being exposed to it.   


FedEx is a huge place where a lot of people from this specific area that's infected goes to work. All it takes is one person. FedEx told the workers that if someone working there has the Coronavirus, to tell them and they'll tape the area off. I'm surprised they think that's how contagious airborne virus', that as long as the area is taped off it can't cross that line.   


 The other day my fiance was working with a new girl on her line. A day later she gets a message saying the new girl is sent home on leave because she said she had symptoms of the Coronavirus, and that someone tested positive for it at a job the new girl just left.

526,"In around 6 weeks the first exams for my Abitur (it's the graduation at the end of high school) begin, and I have 3 subjects I need to study for. I think it is enough time, when I would start now, and I planned to do that, however I can't get myself to begin. The material appears to me as a huge pile and everything I do seems to contribute nothing to the big picture. I sat down with by book and college block, but I dont even know where to start. I have such a strong mental barrier agains learning. I had very bad experiences at school in general and I don't really have friends there, so I will need to study alone somehow. It also has something to do with me never really having to study for any tests before. I always somehow managed to get a 3 (or a C in the american grading system) without doing much. So learning over a long time period is a big struggle for me. So then you may say: Why not just do the exams without learning and you will at get a C or something? The problem is: The content of the exams wont be just what we did in lessons 2 months before, but what we did over 3 years. So I definitely somehow need to learn most of the stuff in the 6 weeks. Otherwise I will miserably fail. But somehow I always distract myself with my fcking smartphone or something else because anything except for studying feels so much better. All of the shit we have to learn does not even interest me. Additionally, I never really organized myself because I never had the need to do so and that's why I struggle there too. But somehow I managed to make myself a calender with the dates on which the exams are and so on, but I keep procrastinating. I set myself to wake up on 11 AM and guess what, I overslept. Then I gave up the plan and didn't do anything that day because I felt like I already failed the entire day. Reading in the messages in the chat group of the others how they are exchanging about specific excercises and so on gives me a bad feeling.

529,"Okay so I’ve (M 23) been dating my GF (F 20) for almost 6 months now. A bit of backstory before I get to my question:

- We met at a bar/club in mid September and hit it off right away. She just moved here the July before.
- I took her to a concert, rock climbing, and various other dates before we hooked up for the first time in mid/late September.
- On October 5 she invited me to go out to the bar I met her at with her friends but I was busy because an old friend was in town, but I said maybe our groups could converge which didn’t end up working out.
- In Novemeber, I was using her phone and I accidentally (then purposefully) saw messages between her and a guy in mid September where she said she wanted to have sex with him. Because we had already gone out a few times at this point I was upset about it and couldn’t conceal it. I brought it up to her and she apologized, saying she was in a bad place since moving and liked acting out like that even though she had no intentions of going through with it. I accepted this and asked if there were other incidents I should know about. She said no.

Fast forward to now: Six months later

I had a bad feeling in my gut and I snooped. This time it wasn’t an accident. I didn’t find anything recent at all that would raise concern. I think she has been very loyal.
However, I saw texts from an unlisted contact back in October and I read them. This time felt different because by October we were already getting more serious and had started hooking up.

The first text was dated October 5th at 11:50, right after I told her maybe we could converge groups. It was from a guy who she gave her number to. 

Him: you should come by later
Her: where at
Him: *sends address*
Her: Actually I can’t tonight. I’m hella on my period
Him: Oh you thought I was tryna fuck?!
Her: Haha not this week
Him: Oh so you would?
Her: That’s a pretty loaded question 
Him: I didn’t wanna come at you strong but you’re  cute don’t get me wrong I’d definitely fuck your fine ass. What’s your snap/insta
Her: *gives snap and insta* also not gunna lie, sometimes I do need a good fuck.
Him: well I give some pretty good dick I’m not one of those quick pumpers.

At this point she left him on read for the rest of the night. The next day I ask her if she still wants to hangout like we talked about maybe doing. She says she’s super tired after work so she probably wouldn’t be much fun. I say no worries maybe next time.
Around the same time this dude hit her up and asked her what she was doing later, she didn’t reply...

Until later that night. Out of nowhere at 11:00 pm she texted him asking for his address. I’m sure they were talking about meeting up over snapchat because she wouldn’t just ask for his address out of nowhere like that. He sent her his address and asked how far she was. She said 15 min. He said to text when she was there. She didn’t reply and he asked again. She said that her sister had a break down and that she needed to stay home to help her so they would have to reschedule. After that it kinda fizzled out, and I don’t think they ever actually met up, but they might have sexted.

My main problems with this:

- I asked her in November if there was another incident I needed to know about and she said no.
- she told me she couldn’t hangout but seemed perfectly fine making plans to go have sex with this guy.
- She gave him her number at the same bar I met her at 
- at this point we had already started getting more serious (even though we weren’t technically exclusive) and I was already considering other girls off the table.
- We also had talked about her possibly picking up a girl for a threesome that night (since she’s bi) and later on she said she didn’t like trying that night because it made her feel weird since she was sorta seeing me. But she had no problem doing that with another guy.

I need advice. I am pretty sure I want to break up over this, but I’m torn on whether or not I should bring up why. I don’t want her to try to convince me to stay with an excuse as to why she did it, and I also don’t want to admit I snooped, but I still want to know why, and to know if she sexted him before agreeing to come over. My stomach is hurting and she can tell somethings up, but I keep saying I’m just not feeling well. I thought maybe reddit could help me.

TLDR: snooped on gfs phone and found racy texts with another guy from early in our relationship.",27Mar2020,0

Me, Grace, Jessica, Rebecca, and Tom (Not real names btw) There has been an argument been all of us for the past almost 2 months, changing the subject of the argument about once every two weeks. I’m on Graces’s side, everyone else is against us. The reason for this argument is according to Jessica, Grace has been controlling her ever since they met (Primary School). This was so out of no where. And regarding the fact that is has been happening for 7 years, I feel like they are trying to make an argument. (Grace has never controlled Jessica, that’s a lie)

Let me just give some backstory of our friend group. Jessica, Tom and Grace have been friends for quite a while now. In september, me and rebecca joined. We were all super close, and Tom and Jessica would never seem like the people to get on like this.

Anyway back to the argument. I do not have snapchat, so I do not know everything that’s being said. I do know Grace has said some things she shouldn’t have, but rebecca, jessica and tom has as well. They are all in a group chat on snap and grace keeps leaving it, but rebecca keeps adding her back, which i feel is to keep the argument going because this is giving them all some type of pleasure.

My chairperson was also a bit controlling and didn't allow me to do any IEP meetings for a long time. I felt a vibe around January that I wasn't well liked and I saw my job was reposted for next year. I talked to my principal about my performance and she said that there was no problem and that I was overthinking things. They reinterviewed me for the job and acted like I had a chance, then they went and hired someone else. I asked my principal why she went with someone else but she blew me off and said she needed to talk to HR before revealing anything. I asked very politely and just wanted to know why going forward. I was kind of hurt so I asked if I could just resign with 30 days notice as specified in my contract and she said that if I did that I would not be eligible for rehire in the county.

I have been considering giving up my US citizenship because from a practical point of view, it seems to be more of a hinderance. A few family members live in the US (including my grandma), so if I do decide to give up my citizenship, I wouldn't do so immediately.

I made a short pros and cons list.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros of US citizenship:

\-Easier to visit family

\-Possible to work there (it would be unlikely given that there are better opportunities and quality of life where I am)

Cons of US citizenship:

\-Have to file for taxes twice as well as pay extra taxes

\-It's more difficult to get a bank account or do anything finance related

Right now I am really enjoying the lack of responsibility and freedom but it is time to think seriously about career options. I worry that I'm going to drift through life enjoying my freedom and in 40 years time I will look back at my life and be unfulfilled in terms of my job, career and achievements. 

I have just secured a job working with children in hospital and am considering going back to study and do medicine but obviously that is a big decision so I wanted some healthcare experience before hand. I worry that if I do decide to go to medical school and become a doctor my achievements would be incredible but also I would be dealing with patients who are a result of a broken system (alcoholism, obesity epidemic etc). I think I would find this hard to come to terms with and ultimately that it would leave me dissatisfied.

Despite a lot of enthusiasm in this field, a lot of research and reading I do not have any relevant experience. My background is in bioscience which doesn't really cross over.

541,"Me and my boyfriend have been living together for 3 years now. There have been a lot of ups and downs throughout our relationship and a lot of me questioning whether or not I want to continue in it. Overall, I do enjoy most of my time with him and keep staying. These past few days have certainly made me wish I had made a different decision earlier. I'm extremely upset and embarrased to be with someone like him.

We live in Dutchess County, NY about an hour and a half outside of NYC. Things are not as bad here but I'm pretty sure it's only a matter of time before it starts to take off. There are already 200 confirmed cases in our area.

Boyfriend hasn't been taking any of it seriously. Though I beg and beg and try to reason with him... he refuses to take any precautions. He's continuing to work as a delivery driver for Dominos which I didn't like but wasn't objecting to. I was just hoping he's being safe while at work, protecting himself and the customers. He's explained that no one has been taking it seriously there either. For example, one of the guys has been joking around about having it and licking/coughing on his hands and going about his work. I'm disgusted and absolutely furious. I keep wondering if I should call management to report but I'm pretty sure they're aware &amp; I don't think they care. I don't think delivery places should even be open but they certainly are... so, I don't know if there's anything I can do. (This is a whole nother issue for me) 

In addition to leaving the house for his shitty job... he also demands that he drives for Doordash. He leaves the house to take $8 orders. 8$ that is all he needs to put our lives at risk. Also, we can make it without that money right now. There's absolutely no reason he needs to be going out. Any time I try to get him to see reason and stay home, it just turns into an argument and I'm the one that always loses. I gave him an n95 but he refuses to wear it. I have gloves and sanitizer but he wont use anything. Yesterday he came in from running around and just sat down to eat his drive thru food, then got back up and left to do another delivery - all without washing his hands once. (The McDonald's two blocks away was just shut down because all the staff have coronavirus. No one should be getting drive thru or delivery right now, stop it)

So, I'm pretty alone here and I have no idea what to do. I could stay here, in my apartment and try to be as safe as I can be. But with the way he's been, I feel like it's a guarantee that I get it and I've just got to hope that I'm not badly affected by it. Or, I'm considering staying in my car. I have an SUV so I've got a bit of space. I'll be able to lay down in the back and sleep... I can't cook or heat anything so I'll just drink protein shakes. It'll suck. But the likelihood that I get the virus will drop dramatically.

What should I do?",27Mar2020,1
542,"General info: Australia, Tafe setting (not a university - kind if like a college) also I'm terrible at explaining things I'm sorry if it's a hot mess to read. 

I'm studying pharmacy and, since before I started, the entire things been a bit of a shit show. I didn't even get put into the system till after a week of classes had started. Very disorganised planning - they have a general idea of what we should be learning and when but other than that it's a ""feel as they go"" thing. 

We have 2 pharmacy related study days, one practical and one knowledge. The practical pharmacy day is split into two separate groups - on different days of the week. Each group has a different lecturer. 

Mine is horrible. The lecturer is by her words strict. Her education style can be equivilated to the stereotypical bare Ikea instruction manual with complicated furniture to build. (Here's the basic know how and here are your tools, get to it). She refuses to answer questions she believes are too simple, or have been spoken about once before. When students do ask her these questions she belittles them and acts frustrated as to why she'd get asked that question and why the student wasn't listening. She doesn't seem to understand the students are not confident in the knowledge they are being taught and are seeking reassurance so they can be. 

She has on one occasion bullied a student and allowed two students do the same. She went on for what felt like minute at this student saying things like ""I told you already"" ""you should know"" ""you need to listen"". It doesn't matter to her that this student speaks English as a second language. At the same time as she was ranting she allowed the 2 other students to giggle at the 1 student till they managed to amp up into full on laughter. You could probably have heard them down the hall. The lecturer ended up laughing in frustration at the student as well. You could see in the 1 students face she was upset. I was so angry. 

I'm worried if I say something I'll be committing professional suicide before I'm even qualified to work in the field. The lecturer is a distinguished pharmacist who still works in a hospital based pharmacy. She has power. The other lecturer is a push over who doesnt want to get into these sort of things (also a pharmacist)

543,"Hi everyone! I kind of just need to vent/get advice/or have people tell me that I'm being too uptight and need to loosen up? I don't really know what I need. Lol 

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend and I live together (with 2 roommates). We are in our mid 20's and have been friends since elementary school. She is EXTREMELY extroverted and I am pretty introverted at heart (can have extroverted moments). Anyways, we have all been quarantined at our apartment for about a week now. I love our friendship and I really do not want to take it for granted but I feel a bit sophisticated by her at times. For example, I have been going on walks lately just to get out and get exercise. I love going on walks alone and listening to a podcast. Every time I leave the apartment to go on a walk she looks like I've betrayed her (lol) or says no don't go! She just kind of makes me feel guilty for going without her. We went on a walk together the other day and afterward, she said, ""what are you eating for dinner?! do you want to go get take out together"" and I was like""no I'm okay, but I'll ride in the car with you"" and she literally begged me to get take out too... like she couldn't do it alone. Last night I hung out with her practically all day and watched tv with her and the other roommates until midnight. 

&amp;#x200B;

This morning she texted me and said ""Do you wanna go on a walk today"" and I honestly just want to do my own thing today... but I don't want to be a bitch. Like obviously she can see that I don't have anywhere to go. But I just truly want to go on a walk alone, read a book alone, etc. Even typing this I feel like I sound ungrateful for her friendship. I do appreciate her and enjoy her company but I feel like she's just really needy with me right now. Am I being a little too introverted? advice?",27Mar2020,1

545,"I dropped out of high school because the traditional setting wasn't good for me. I have ADHD, so waking up at a certain time, paying attention to the teachers, keeping organized, and all that were difficult for me. It didn't help that I was undiagnosed because my mom doesn't believe in mental illnesses, so I never got any accommodation.

I'm not stupid or anything, though my grades in high school seem to imply that. I studied for the GED and passed every subject with an honors in science. I'm also learning Dutch and learning various topics from paleontology to computer languages. I'm currently looking for an online class for python that is interactive but in depth. 

My problem is, which makes it nearly impossible if not impossible to get a job, is that I have times when I'm productive and times I can't focus on anything, and they don't happen on any set time. That makes traditional school dificult for me, and even online classes require a set schedule. If I could have a class where I have to listen to 5 lectures a week and do the assignments, I can do that, but if I have to listen to the lectures live, I can't. Unfortunately, even if a college could accommodate me in that, I wouldn't be able to get a career in anything. Evening worthwhile requires you to work a set schedule, which I just can't.

The only options for me are freelance work , art, or writing, but those are very risky careers to have. I'm currently working on the outline of a novel, but I don't know if that would be a good career for me. 

I'm on SSI, but I don't want to live on $782 a month and seen as a leech on society. I want to do something worthwhile, but everything requires a set schedule. How can I earn income while having freedom to work at my own pace at whatever time I feel like it?",27Mar2020,1

I mean I only have one drink but usually I can’t really eat after as I’m not too hungry and then I usually smoke weed in the evening.

548,"First off I want to say that he's not a bad person. I just don't know what my problem is with him.

He and my sister got together last year and at first I was fine with that, but after a few months it started to irritate me. He is always over at our place. I think the first thing I didn't like, was that he ate so much and even my mum has said, that it would be nice, if he sometimes bought food, since he is here so much. There have been numerous situations, where he eats the food and I have to go and buy it. It's usually very small things that annoy me, like not washing his hands, being a too loud etc. Sometimes he and my sister are a bit rude to me, but so am I.

I feel like I don't have the privacy I used to have at my home. It bothers me, because I don't have anywhere else to go, but they do. They just choose not to. It has come to the point, where I don't want to deal with him and that means I'm stuck in my room all day. I don't mind being at home, but  being stuck in my room is a bit too much.

I have tried to talk with my sister, but I never know what to say. I have told her that it annoys me, when he's always there, but I feel like she doesn't really understand. 

What should I do? Should I just suck it up?  Should I try to talk with my sister again and if so, what should I say?

I would be really grateful, if someone could help me, since I feel like this situation causes problems between me and my sister as well.",27Mar2020,1
549,"Sorry if this is long. I just want to make sure I explain everything fairly to both sides.

Background: My sister and I (who are both single and in our 20s) rent a house together. We moved in back in December, but due to us both having started new jobs and working long hours, we never got the house completely set up. It was to the point of being functional but extra dishes, clothes, etc where still in boxes in a the corners. It will also be important later that my sister has bipolar disorder and is currently off her medication due to some issues with her previous doctor.

On to the issue: A friend of both my sister and I (who we will call Amy) asked if she could move into our third bedroom for a few weeks. She was in the process of moving to a different state, but the lease on her current apartment was going to be up a little before she was moving. We said yes, with the plan being that Amy was going to move in with us for at least 2 weeks but no more than a month. (We had previously talked to our landlord about someone staying with us, and we don't have to get special permission if it is under a month but need to if it is going to be much more than a month, but there is not anything in our lease about it and our landlord is very flexible.) Amy agreed to chip in a little less than a third of rent (she was the least nice bedroom) and help with groceries so we could all eat together. Since it was only for a few weeks, we didn't ask her to cover any utilities.

I should also point out at this time that my sister and I have a small (20lb) dog and two cats. Amy brought her large (50lb) dog with her.

As the month came to a close, it became evident that Amy wasn't going to be able to move as quickly as she wanted, as the place she was hoping to get a job after she moved went on a hiring freeze. She asked what would need to be done for her to stay longer, and we said we would talk to the landlord.

It has now been almost a month and a half since she moved in, and I haven't actually talked to the landlord yet, but I keep holding off because my sister and I are actually wondering if we should ask Amy to move out.

We feel like she is kind of taking advantage of us. She hardly cleans anything, and when she does, gets frustrated if we don't help her. (Last Saturday, we all agreed that we would work on cleaning, but then Saturday afternoon, she text that she would help Sunday instead, but then got frustrated that we weren't helping her clean on Sunday, even though we had spent several hours on Saturday cleaning when she wasn't there). She hardly ever cleans up after her dog, and my sister and I are mostly taking care of it (I don't think she has even fed the dog in three days... the dog just end up stealing some of our dogs food, which we then have to put extra out of. We have also given her dog a bath the last 3 times she needed it).

Amy is currently upset at us that we said ""no"" when she offered to have her sister (who we barely know) come and reorganize our kitchen for us. She is also upset about the boxes everywhere (which she knew where there when she moved in), and doesn't understand why we haven't taken care of them now that I am working from home temporarily. The last three nights have kind of been the last straw for my sister. My sister is currently having a mixed bipolar episode (which are really hard to explain if you have never seen one), and isn't really sleeping well at nights. The last three nights, Amy has told my sister chores to do if she wakes up in the middle of the night. My sister tried to explain that mixed episodes are not really conducive to getting stuff done, and I tried to explain that I am a really light sleeper and the choirs would definitely wake me up, but Amy still keeps giving them.

There are a lot of other little things. This just doesn't seem to be working. If it was just another week or two, we would survive, but now she is thinking she might not move till May or June (which is way longer than we ever agreed to). Amy also has a sister who lives in town who she could stay with (although it there is a lot less space), and she is still working her old job here (actually making more than my sister and I combined) and could definitely afford her own place. (although getting an apartment right now might be hard with CoVid19)

Should we ask her to move out?",27Mar2020,1

559,"so, a friend of mine is being abused by her mother at home. I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do, when and how I'm supposed to contact the authorities. I've been telling her to call the CPS but she always brushes it off as ""Asian culture"" or ""her fault"". I'm not sure if I'm supposed to take action in her place, or tell an adult, which, there aren't really any I can confide in. 

some of the things that her mother does include:

\- getting mad, shouting at and scolding her for no real reason

\- insult her ( like calling her fat, useless, ugly etc. )

\- kick her head

\- slap and punch her

\- saying that she'll kill my friend

\- throw stuff at her

the first two occurs on pretty much a daily basis, the others, however, still happens more often than it should. It's been going on for years now, ever since I first met her. I really don't know what I'm supposed to do. Her parents are divorced, so if something happens to her mom, I don't know what'll happen to her. I haven't done much other than listening, which i really, really regret. i've been keeping it a secret because she has told me countless of times that she's okay and she doesn't want me to take any sort of action. but she sent me a screenshot just now, and I really cannot just do nothing anymore. she has to deal with ""friends"" who take advantage of her, her mom does nothing but abuse her, and her helper just laughs and pretend like nothing's happening.

So I’m going to give some background but check my other posts about my abuse sister for more info.

My sister is very verbally abuse. And before people say “oh she’s just being mean” no, that’s not what this is. I have PTSD from all the things she’s done. I was told I’m not part of the family because I’m an egg and sperm donor, I’ve been threatened and even told to kill myself. (Note: I’m not suicidal, and am going to therapy for the PTSD)

It’s gotten to the point where my mentally health is really deteriorating. I feel worthless and like garbage. My parents know that it happens but ignore it because “she an adult we can’t stop
her” or “ she’s 22 she’ll grow out of it”. They also don’t want to upset her because she is the mother to their grandsons and they don’t want to be cut of from them like she’s threatened.

Here’s the hard part. I’m 14. I have no power what so ever. I want to get emancipated but know that would be impossible as a 14 year old (I intend to wait till I’m 15 or 16 to try). And I can’t stay where I am. It’s really mentally deteriorating and I’m stuck.

I’ve tried to talk to my parents about getting her to move out. (She 22, engaged with two kids living here for free, and has her FIL or MIL to stay at but choose our home.) I know this isn’t a good time with corona, but I want advice to make a speech together and talk to them when this is all over. I want to prepare for the fight that will happen when I try to talk to them and prepare my argument.

How should I speak to them about this? Is there a way I can talk to them in order to avoid a fight? I know I’m only a minor and really have no power but I need this to change. I can’t stay like this for much longer. If the talk doesn’t work do I have other options? If so what are they?",27Mar2020,1

To this day, it seems like he cannot wait to prove me wrong when it comes to these subjects. He’ll tell me something going on in the news, and I’ll respond normally, just casual conversation - and he will look at me like I’m an idiot. Then he will start to dive into what laws are what, facts, and trying to show me proof on his phone - throwing it down in front of me, showing me I should read/watch whatever it is on it. He’ll chastise me when I don’t have an answer to his question, and make me feel so terrible that I don’t know. He combats everything that I DO respond with, to the point that I will start crying. At this point I wish it would just stop, but it doesn’t. I usually have to walk away. But when I do, he will sometimes tell me that I don’t want to be informed. 

Today, he told me he believed that “only landowners and people who pay taxes should have the right to vote, as stated in the us constitution”, - he’s told me this many times before, and I just responded with, “I know, you’ve told me” - just acknowledging him. He stops and then starts to ask me a series of US law questions like a quiz - “what amendment states xyz” and some other questions. I responded that I didn’t know to each one. Felt like a series of interrogation questions. Then he tells me, “don’t tell me that you know when you really DONT”. It was so aggressive, I had to leave.

He's also religious and believes is some stupid ass shit about medical stuff that a 'Hoca' it's like a priest but for Muslims (I'm an atheist so idc) and right now we're going to buy shit tons of stuff. I always stand for logical approach and sciencetific researches but he's so fucked because of all the fake news he's getting and
in the bank we have about 25k and he tried to buy a tv of 6k i talked/lied to him about 3 hours to make him buy a 2,5k one making him believe that 2.5k one was the better choice at the end he still didn't wanted to buy but the tv he wanted to buy was sold so he had to go with my choice (Idc about the tv, I don't even think it's necessary he wants to spend as much as his money right now before the ""GREAT INFLATION"" comes) i talked about it with my friends who study economics even tho they're in Middleschool me aswell they think this is ridiculous.

My friend, call him R, just lost his wife, call her K, to coronavirus. She leaves him behind as well as their one year old child. K had been fighting brain cancer for a few years but had mostly recovered. She was obviously considered especially vulnerable to coronavirus given her weakened immune system and frequent visits to the hospital, physical therapy, and so on. I just learned that she passed away this week.

R, K, my fiancé, and I had not been spending as much time together mostly because they were busy dealing with K’s treatments, and R was busy juggling work, her healthcare, and their young child. We really tried to stay in their life but it was hard to get together often. But we did get together here and there and try to be around. Even though we didn’t see them often, I think I was among R’s closest friends, simply because he didn’t have that much of social life anymore. 

I should not that I found out about K’s passing from someone else. R didn’t reach out and tell us. It hasn’t been announced anywhere.

Our city is on complete lockdown due to coronavirus, and my fiancé and I left town weeks ago and went to family vacation house where we can work from home and wait out this pandemic. I’m 1,500 miles away from R. Even if I flew back home to see him, I’m not sure that would be recommended given the need for social distancing. Also I should mention that two of my coworkers have confirmed cases of coronavirus so I very well could have it and be carrying it. So visiting and attending a funeral seems out of the question.

Upon finding out I texted R and said the usual things, how sorry we are, told him we are just a phone call away. All he said was thank you. It’s been a few days so I’m planning on calling him today. I have no idea what I’m going to say really. “I’m here for you, well not really actually I’m 1,500 miles away”. You know what I mean?

I have no idea what else I can do. I so badly want to be there for him but I can’t. I don’t even know if I can send flowers as florists are shutdown. It’s just such a weird situation. I may not be back to our city for weeks...

580,"Currently during quarantine I’m wrapping up coming to terms with the break up from a girl I think was my first love. Now that these feelings are FINALLY beginning to subside and have decided I want to get back out there and talk to girls again. Problem is two things...

1. With this quarantine going on I can’t meet any girls at my local university. Even if I could I find it incredibly daunting and doing so much as making new friends is a MASSIVE challenge at school. I talk to girls and guys alike at school but establishing a actual connection platonic or romantic seems impossible. The girl I last dated I met online on kind of a whim because we were both there to mess around and we just ended up hitting it off. Which leads me to my next point.

2. I went on the internet to fool around because whenever I take dating apps seriously they DEEPLY disappoint me. I recently got back on tinder  and currently have only 8 likes (which I’ve already had for a week) none of which I’ve matched with. Super low numbers with badoo and bumble too. I never even got a single like on hinge. So those to me are a lost cause. I have funny and personal bios and I do post the best pictures I got (which isn’t much but how am I gonna go for a photoshoot when I can’t meet up with friends?)

Currently I am a full time student in Kentucky with a tutoring position that has dropped me 7 hours in the past 3 ish weeks going from 16 to 8-ish hours paid that are not always promised for the 24 hour time window kids can cancel. I use this job and savings from the summer to pay for all my needs such as rent, textbooks, and food without my family's help because they made it clear I am pretty much on my own. I realized recently that I probably cannot keep up with restricting my lifestyle/food/electricity for the next few months on the hope there will be work available in the summer.

My dad out of the blue texted me last night basically suggesting I quit my position to receive unemployment benefits in light of the fact that I will probably not receive the 1,200 that Americans will get because I am a dependent under my taxes. I would definitely lose this job if I try to move my hours to zero and be unable to come back next semester even though it works amazing with my schedule and pays above minimum wage (which is rare on campus). I tried also looking for jobs nearby but postings are pretty much dead and without a vehicle I can't go out too far in my city. I don't know what to do I guess and there is really no one in my life that can give me advice that I truly trust. 

Is there any ways to make extra money online or ways I am not thinking about? I know a decent amount of Japanese, can tutor numerous classes, and I really do devote myself to any job I get.

584,"Hello! :)

My objective by 2021 is to establish myself in a new state, and begin my life as an independent adult.

I'm currently 20, a high school grad, and have a sparkling personality, good looks (maybe), and a metric ass-ton of motivation. Ok, but seriously I like to think I can get along with anybody, and I have a good work ethic towards anything I commit my time to. I have experience as a barista (my preferred career path), but I'm open to any job at a restaurant.

Keep in mind I'm fairly young, and therefore don't know anything about anything. I'm willing to admit that I'm fairly ignorant.

 I just want to move away from San Diego (and California) because it's basically impossible to afford to live here if you're not a rocket-surgeon-lawyer. 

Hopefully I can contribute to the economy of another city/town and justify my wage so I can live comfortably

I have a plan, but I'm sure it is flawed. I need help.

So, I'm going to lay out my plan based on what I've gleaned from my ""research"". 

Step 1: Find a job, and do my best to keep that job for at least a year. Reasons: to invest towards funding my moving, and paying for anything related to this goal, also to gain experience so that I have some kind of advantage in any job market.

Step 2: Develop a good credit score. Simple; This is something landlords look at to gauge the reliability of a possible tenant (at least I think this is how it works, I mean you also have to make enough to afford rent/mortgage ect) (?)

Step 3: While I'm working here in San Diego I will begin trying to secure a new job in any of the cities that I'm interested in after I feel like I've earned enough money, and developed a good credit score. That way I can have a job waiting for me before I move. I intend on putting a lot of thought into this particular process; no hasty decisions.

Step 4: Visit some of the cities I'm interested in before I even consider moving. I also plan on asking locals opinions, meeting new people, and maybe looking at properties if possible. I understand that this would be difficult to schedule, and relatively expensive. Fortunately I live with my family, and I'm expected to only pay one bill as long as I'm doing chores; so perhaps this would be possible if I spend my savings wisely. (?) This step is probably not possible for me.

Step 5: And then... Well, I'm not entirely sure if this is a good game-plan. I'm job hunting at the moment, researching cities I'd like to live in, the cities minimum wages, cost of living, and what not. 

So this is where my fellow Redditors come in. 

I'd like some advice on this subject, maybe a recommendation for a city or career path, and maybe just some words of encouragement.",27Mar2020,1

So I have this girl we gonna call A (F19), A and my Best friend (F18) broke up about 4 months ago, my BF was mentally and even physically abusive with A, she knows the shit she's made and recognizes it.

My BF broke up with A out of the blue, she said she never liked A and stuff. A was extremly sad, i was there for her. After 1 month and half after they broke up we were having feeling for eachother.

I spoke to my BF about this, since i dont want to make things weird for us, and my BF was super supportive of me and A, she was totally fine with it and said she didnt care.

That's when the things go down: everytime i would talk A in front of my BF she would be super mad and dont talk to me for about 3 hours, after a while she said to me ""Hey you should stop hitting A in front of me (I NEVER did this) cuz its triggering"" (Yeah she used THAT word) my BF also said not cuz she likes A, but cuz she remembers the things she did wrong in the relationship.

Yesterday I posted a photo of me and A on Instagram, and my BF blocked me, A asked her what's wrong and she called us a much of names like slu* and b*itch. It was a total mess.

What should I do in this situation? I dont wanna be a total dick with my BF since she has been struggling with depression and anxiety for quite some time, ik that aint a excuse but tbh i'm totally lost.

587,"Hi everyone, I [M26] come seeking some advice on relationships, and post might be a little bit long. I've always struggled with relationships, and finding a girl to date. Most of the girls I've had a somewhat formal relationship with, has been because they either have approached me or it miraculously happened. I've been told I'm not bad looking, and I get complemented every now and then, so looks are not an issue. I have a somewhat okay life I want to say, I come from a poor background and have been working to make a better life for myself. I was able to attend college and get an engineering degree, I work full time for a company that at the moment is considered ""essential"" and I'm one of the leads in my department. I don't think I can say I have nothing for myself, I help my parents (still live at home) since my dad is disable and my mom can't work. I help pay bills and mortgage, so I'm definitely responsible and can care for others. 

I've been trying to talk to girls and seek potential relationship in the long run. Unfortunately I'll talk to girls for a few days and they slowly just fade out the conversation. Most of them make it seem like I'm not good enough or just put no effort into it, and they'll end up dating some random dude who has done nothing of his life. At times it makes me feel as if I'm not good enough or just not the ""right"" type of guy. Lately I've found myself, talking to some and I'll just simply distance myself cause I don't want to go through the whole chatting for a few days then getting ghosted. Am I doing something wrong? I usually try to have solid conversations, jokes here and there, ask about them, and try to make the conversations more engaging. I usually text a few days after I'm left on seen, but lately I've been giving more of a ""moving on"" and don't insist anymore. I really feel like I'm just not going to find the one person. It seems most girls are either stuck on an ex, talking to a herd of guys and seeing who is ""better"", or simply just bored (not everyone). I've had girls as me to out in more effort, while they basically ignore me and give zero effort.

I agreed to be his guardian and give him a safe place to live.   He moved here full-time in January, we have seen therapists, local support groups, bought a new wardrobe, and gotten a lot of advice.  Things are going really well and he is actually consistently happy for the first time in many years.    

 That said, he is incredibly negative about women, especially women in their 20s - 30s who dress well, wear make-up, etc.   He claims that 60% - 75% of all conversations he had growing-up where about body image, make-up, weight, wardrobe, hair, nails, etc.   I believe he is significantly inflating that number, probably due to his body dysphoria.      He believes that girls / women are incredibly negative, feel persecuted, and are terrible beings.   Again, this isn't the case, but he is 15 and going through a lot.  

How much time and energy do girls / women truly focus on their body, make-up, fashion, etc?   What can I tell my nephew to gain some perspective on this, or is it even worth the conversation given his age and what he is going through right now.

Long story short I went there to see her in person, and we got engaged after couple of weeks. My first impression was that she is very intelligent, family oriented and wife material. There was some lack of physical attraction initially and I had doubts about getting engaged but due to family pressure and her many positives and so on I decided to go with it and got engaged in hope that romance and attraction will come later and she will grow on me. Her Fiancé Visa recently got approved and she has been living with me for couple months now. She is a sweet, caring family girl and always has my back but unfortunately, I’m lacking physical and sexual attraction towards her still. It’s eating me up on the inside that I can’t be better for her. She is the one initiating the sexual acts most of the time and I feel guilty and scared that I can’t be a better lover for her.

I'm an 18 year old college student back at home due to the pandemic. My parents have always been super controlling (not to mention toxic in a number of ways), so I was very excited to get to college. However, now obviously I am back home and don't know when I'm going to be able to go back to school. Disregarding some of the other issues at home, I really wanted some advice with the rules.

Since I've returned, the rules that were in place in high school have stayed the same, and have even escalated a bit. These include having to hand my phone over at 10pm at night, having an enforced bedtime, not being allowed to do my work in my room, not being allowed to listen to music (or at least it's not looked kindly upon), and not being able to FaceTime my college friends for long periods of time or not being able to FaceTime them at all. 

I know it probably doesn't sound that bad, but it's been kind of driving me insane. I already feel pretty isolated and not being able to really call my friends definitely isn't helping. I've tried approaching my parents before, but that usually results in a huge fight and them taking away all of my electronics, leaving me completely without any way of talking to my friends at all. I just need some advice on how to deal with this or how to instigate a peaceful discussion. Am I being unreasonable with the rules thing here?

602,"This is long, TL;DR at bottom.

My dad is an avid Trump supporter, this drives me nuts on a normal day but it seems to be coming an ever more hyper sensitive issue. I refused even to have a conversation with my dad about politics anymore as it usually ends up with him telling me what an effing idiot I am or how effing stupid I am or what an effing bleeding heart I have. How he raised me and my siblings better and how the effing liberal media has taken our minds and turned them into mush.

He used to be able to get a rise out of me but as I have birthed my own daughters this past year I realize that I don’t want to ever alienate them and not have them in my life so I refuse to converse with him about politics. He doesn’t seem to have a problem trying to start fights with me or my sisters and while my brother is a Trump supporter he would never allow politics to create a wedge that my dad seems to let grow during these times. 

My twin girls are a little over four months old now. My problem comes now with the fact that my dad comes once a week to spend time with his granddaughters because I always swore when I was younger and watched the pain he went through with not knowing my brothers children that I would never allow him to not know my kids. However it was a different time and I was naïve and idiotic. With the spread of COVID-19 I have really limited contact with pretty much everybody for the sake of my girls.

My partner is considered an essential worker working as a manager in a grocery store and when he gets home every day he basically has a decontaminate himself so that way we can make sure that our girls are safe. Every cough, every sneeze, every minor issue he has we worry does he have it? Do I have it? Do the girls have it? It’s a constant worry.

My mom works in the healthcare field and as much as I love her coming over every weekend that had to stop. Now I’ve asked my dad to stop coming because I can’t risk him spreading it. His job has given him the ability to stay home as he is over 65 and work from home and he refuses and he still meet with clients and shakes their hand and thanks to Fox News thinks that this is all just blown out of proportion. Even my in-laws who support trump decided a week and a half ago to stop seeing the girls just to be on the safe side.

My dad thinks I’m being unfair and that this Chinese virus as he and Trump likes to tout are just bull and that not allowing him to see his granddaughters is wrong and I promise that I would never do this. 

Even before all of this my visits for him we’re probably going to come to an end as I don’t want to fight with him anymore and I don’t want to hear about politics. I don’t care to get into the arguments end up with him yelling at me and telling me that I’m stupid. Even though my girls are only four months I don’t want them to see that behavior and ever think that is acceptable. It’s the furthest thing from acceptable and I won’t raise them to think that it’s OK for even your parents to talk to you like that. It’s not OK and I’m over him and his politics and how this presidency has just ripped my family apart. 

Are any of you going through this? Your parents think that this is all just overhyped and just a bunch of bull. Getting mad at you because you want to make sure that your kids who don’t have an immune system yet are safe? How did you handle it what did you do? How do you make your parents realize that they have their heads in the sand and they need to come up for air. It’s just the most frustrating thing, I don’t understand.

Sorry this is so long I’m really just trying to get all my feelings out. Thank you all for whoever read this far please tell me what you did and how maybe you healed your family because this just sucks.

TL;DR my dad is ruining our family over politics. Thinks the Covid-19 isn’t serious. Mad I won’t let him see my 4 month twins because I’m worried he will give it to them as he is still working and shaking hands with people in the public. What did you do about your parents?

My husband is supposed to get a special suit for the occasion (we are going to order it regardless, we don't want to cause any issue over this point because it's not super expensive and he could use a new one anyway, and we don't want to stress out the couple), but we are not going to buy plane tickets right now for obvious reasons. If things calm down and the wedding proceeds as planned causing us to get more expensive tickets in 2 months so be it, but it seems like a terrible idea to buy them at the moment. 

Anyway, my husband doesn't want to cause a stir, but we both see that there is a potential for us to not be able to make it to the wedding because of flight restrictions, or quarantines in California or our home state (or even one of us getting the virus). How should we proceed? Our plan was to get the suit soon, not ask questions for now, and see what happens; but we do wish to know if they have possible alternative plans. Besides the wedding, the bachelor party was going to be around May/June, and several people would need to fly or drive long distances for that as well.

 As a final point- I feel for the couple, I really do. This is all very stressful &amp; crazy. I hope their wedding goes off without a hitch. I cant imagine being in their shoes and I get to an extent not talking much about it with wedding guests because it's so nerve-racking. But at the same time my husband is part of the wedding party, we are friends with them, and we want to know what is expected of us right now. 
At this point, though, if I'm being practical, I foresee this affecting their wedding at least in some regard. 
Thanks for any and all advice and suggestions, and I sincerely hope everyone stays safe during all this.",27Mar2020,1

We talked about doing some stuff, but it never ended up happening and he went full cover up on the whole situation and, for a small time, we stopped talking cause it was weird, which was understandable. Recently, he asked me about dildos and how they felt and stuff like that, and told me that he’d want to try one someday, but when we are with our friends he openly exclaims that’s he is not attracted to guys at all, like no part of guys. And I’m pretty sure he’s serious but I have no idea and I don’t want to ask him about it either. 

Anyway, we’ve been spending a lot of time together recent both just us, and with friends, and I always find myself looking his way and smiling and just finding everything he says interesting and just really enjoy his company, plus I really respect his opinion on things, we have great chemistry, I feel like I can trust him with every/anything, I feel comfortable and safe when I’m with him, he treats me well because home life isn’t the best and I don’t know if it’s just because home life’s tough that he’s being so nice to me or if it’s because we are good friends or if he likes me.

610,"I've been stuck in the hospital for the last six weeks and will maybe be here for another six weeks. I'm in a small section of the hospital where there aren't too many nurses. I've had maybe 10-12 different nurses over day and night shifts, with occasional substitutes coming in from a different department. I like most of the nurses really well. 

There is one nurse who, I feel, doesn't care one bit about her patients. It seems like she can't wait to get out of the room. She skips taking vital signs occasionally or skips doing parts of vital signs. She didn't come in one day for like 7 hours. I'm used to being asked by every other nurse where I'd like to get my shots, she just chooses for me, and after a single extremely cursory swipe of an alcohol wipe, jabs them in. She doesn't wipe my stamach off after monitoring me so I end up getting gel on my blankets, leaves the straps sitting on the bed instead of putting them away. She seems... not careless... but like she just doesn't care. 

I know the other nurses occasionally forget things, or things get mixed up, or they have a super busy day with other patients and I don't take prioroty but this seems different. 

I would like to not have her as my nurse anymore but I'm here for another six weeks and it might make things awkward in the unit and could make things tough for the other nurses for scheduling, which I don't want but I also really don't want her as my nurse. 

 Am I being unreasonable? Is it just a difference of personalities or do I have a legitimate reason? How would I tactfully handle the situation if I do ask not to have her as my nurse again?",27Mar2020,1

My daughter texted back that I should NEVER mention it again.

I am sure the rich friend remembers this, and I don't want to bring back past trauma. But I feel this is something the friend's mother should have paid for. It would be more like, ""you remember I helped you a lot when you were 17, could you help my daughter a little now?'",27Mar2020,1

I was very lethargic and weak though and actually started to hate my body image even more. I began starving myself and refusing to eat more than 500 calories per day total while excessively working out. It had a lot of negative effects on my body though and eventually I started to lose it healthier. 1200-1500 calories per day and a moderate workout. 

I JUST reached 140. I felt so great and confident in my body. I started birth control about a month ago- I didn’t notice myself getting fat until I got my first period since being on birth control a few days ago. I am absolutely freaking out- I do not want to go back to that disgusting, fat creature I used to be. I worked so hard just to feel so satisfied and happy in my own body and it’s absolutely ruined. I’m crying so hard because I feel like my year worth of work was all for nothing. I feel so disgusting I can’t even look in the mirror without feeling like I have to throw up. I hate this.

636,"I know this seems like an obvious answer but it doesn't seem so to me. So I'm 27 and currently I am a supervisor at a company that is deemed essential. While most places are cutting hours and workload, we're actually being offered more hours and pay, which means for me 50 hours a week and a lot bigger pay check than I'm used to. One of the reasons for this is because we're losing a lot of workers right now due to my company also allowing employees to take leave of absences (LOA) if they're considered high risk for the coronavirus (people over 65, pregnant women, and underlying medical conditions). The LOAs are paid, generally about 50% of your salary for 2-4 weeks, depending on your position, salary, etc. For me, being a supervisor, it'll likely be around 75% for 3 or 4 weeks. 
As I said, quite a few people have taken these LOAs, leaving those of us staying to be understaffed and trying to make up for it. 

This is where my question comes into play. I have an enlarged spleen I was diagnosed with in August. When your spleen is enlarged, you can't fight illnesses as well you normally can't. Also, generally an enlarged spleen is caused by something else, typically an autoimmune type disease. Doctors haven't been able to find out the cause of mine yet but she did recommend I take an LOA for a few weeks as I am a higher risk of COVID-19. 

I feel bad about doing this because we're already understaffed and I feel more responsible as a supervisor.

I told her I'd think about it over the weekend and get back with a decision on Monday.

640,"Hello Reddit,

like the title said I screwed up my life. I never imagined to end this way but I did. So here is my current situation:

I am 29 years old, live in a small apartment on the outskirts of a very big city with my elderly retiree parents. I dropped out of university 3 times, and held various odd jobs in the past three years (I only started working at age 26). I have no marketable skills and, other than my highschool diploma, I have nothing to show for. Currently I have like the equivalent of 500$USD in my checking account. And due to the pandemic I lost my last odd job.

What do I want out of my life? Financial Independence (ironcally thats the least thing I have). What do I mean by that. To make it short: Through my jobs, my own familiy and friends I realized that being employed as an employee, no matter how high ranking you are, is not a safe bet to make ends meet. I have seen friends and familiy with supposedly ""safe jobs"" getting unemployed and subsequently losing their homes, and or had to struggle quite a bit. I realized what I wanted very late in life, hence why I dropped out of university 3 times.

I have three options:

1. Stay the way how I live now and support myself with odd jobs, safe money and move out after a year or so. During the time I am still at home, I would start my own business (flipping stuff on ebay), and learn how to code (I already started learning Javascript). Then I would go on making little personal projects, help people on stackoverflow, then move on to do freelance jobs, and then at the end start a small software company. All the while living on my own, and supporting myself with odd jobs here and there between projects.
2. Stay the way how I live now and support myself with odd jobs and start university for the 4th time studying applied computer science. Due to the course being pretty tough, I would likely not be able to move out in the forseeable future, maybe in like 4 to 5 years. I would then apply to a normal company learning the ropes of software development and making side projects.
3. Apply for a vocational degree in computer science, which would last about 3 years(in my country you can do that, and you get paid pretty well). I would get paid during the time of training and could move out asap. After that I would work either for the company which trained me, or find another equivalent job. Then I would work on projects on the side, eventually moving to part time and then starting my own software company.

Option 1 is for me the most comfortable, and the one with the most ""freedom"", since I think I suffer from social anxiety. I could also explore selfemployment without risking not being able to pay my rent and other bills. The biggest downsides of option 1 is: I would still won't have an employable degree, and the risk of me slipping and not doing anything is pretty high.

Option 2 would be the ideal scenario in regards to future employment and having a solid backup plan. The negatives are: I would still be living at home until my mid 30s, which mentally I could not bare. If I fail to finish this degree, due to the stress of still living at home until my mid 30s and the difficulty of the course, I would be back at square one with no degree. I think this option is a high risk and high reward one. If I make it I could pretty much do anything.

Option 3 would be the safest option. A vocational degree in computer science in my country is the equivalent of a code monkey. At best you would do the same job as someone with a bachelor's degree, but would only receive like 60% of the salary, with the reason of one having only a vocational degree (source: I personally know two guys with bachelor's degree's in CS, and they told me that this happens regualarly.) I would also would go back to school, and attend classes with people starting at age 18, so the chances of me being ostracized would be great. I am actually TERRIFIED of this option because of this. I also fell like a complete loser for even thinking about this option, since ALL my friends have degree's. The upside of this option would be that I would have a sensible degree that would make me hireable, I would earn MUCH less than with a degree (I even heard that some of these guys earn just a little bit over minimum wage!), but at least I would have something.

Sorry for that extremly long text, but unfortunately I have noone in my life to talk about that. Not even my parents or friends really care. Thats also the the reason why my parents haven't kicked me out yet, they just don't...care.",27Mar2020,1

644,"The situation:

-I work at a grocery store currently

-I have been offered a job with another store/company that is offering me better hours, and promotion opportunities.

-I told my supervisors on March 21 I would be putting in my resignation on Monday for my last day to be April 4.

-Monday &amp; Tuesday I called out sick (Stomach bug symptoms)

-Wednesday I developed a fever, yesterday it reached 101. So I called my public health office and they instructed me to stay home for 14 days.

-I am unable to find the email for my hr rep to send them my resignation.

So can I get some device on how I in one fell swoop tell my employer that I quit and I’m not able to come for the customary 2 weeks, when I can’t go in person or find an email contact? All I have is phone numbers and texting such a message feels wrong.",27Mar2020,1
645,"To set the scene: we’ve been dating for some time and I truly love him, he’s amazing and sweet and absolutely hilarious, I’ve known him long before we even dated and he’s always been so, well, perfect. The perfect boyfriend and even more important: he was the perfect friend before we started dating.

But sometimes, he really hurts me. Since the both of us have been self isolating, we haven’t seen each other in a while and the only means of communication we have is texting and calling each other. That’s where the whole issue arose. He’s a really cold texter: he disappears for an hour or so, but is online, he gives me one word responses and is rarely affectionate, which hurts me a lot, as I’m usually there for him and give him attention when he needs it. I feel very unwanted around him and I don’t know what to do about it. When I try to be affectionate, he blows me off and continues being mean or cold but when I give the same energy back, he acts hurt or just continues to not care. Whenever I say something about how I wish he would talk to me a bit more, he jokingly tells me that I’m a brat  or needy and brushes it off, going back to either talking to his friends or playing video games, which makes me feel bad, so I’ve stopped doing that all together.

I’ve had a really bad relationship before him, which he of course knows about. The guy cheated on me a lot, he was very controlling and I let him basically do whatever he wanted to, since my stupid ass self though that that’s how a long distance relationship works. So him acting like this makes me feel paranoid and unsafe, which he knows since I’ve told him about that guy way back when we were friends. 

So all in all, I miss him a lot, but him ignoring me hurts me. The thought of breaking up crossed my mind but I don’t want to do that since I’m happy with him most of the time and he hasn’t done anything that my last boyfriend did, which is a huge relief. I’ve asked a few of my very close friends about what should I do, and all of them have told me that he’s distracted by video games or that he’s just forgetful, which has made me feel a bit better, especially since I feel like he just hates me and ignores me until he wants affection. So, I need some advice. What should I do?",27Mar2020,3
646,"Hey, everyone. I'm  a musician and producer in Colorado. I've always been very shy and turned to music as a way to connect with people. I've started releasing my music over the past year and with it made all the major social media accounts. The problem remains that I'm still inherently shy and just not good at social media. I've read marketing books, blog-posts, articles, tips-and-tricks posts, and everything in between in attempts to get better and gain more of a following. Although, my execution is still lacking as nothing seems to be working.

647,"Hi all,

My bf, a junior designer, got laid off from his architecture firm on Monday. On Wednesday he sent out an email, to the VPs who called to fire him, offering to work for free. The principal just responded saying he'll discuss with the other VPs and take his offer fully to consideration.

For more info, he was the only junior designer to get laid off. The other 2 junior designers apparently got 25% pay-cuts. He believes he got laid off due to his project being potentially getting shafted because of the COVID-19 virus.

My bf's main reason for sending out the email to work for free, was to 1) basically guilt trip them into paying him something (but he never wanted them to catch his bluff), 2) gaining access to the portal so he could download his work, and 3) getting experience hours for his architecture exams.

How should he respond to his principal if he doesn't actually want to work for free?",27Mar2020,0

Our inbound call outsourcer is going to greatly reduce their staff temporari;y starting next monday due to COVID and my boss on a conference call told us we need to be prepared to take inbound sales calls as a last case scenario. I've done call center work when I first started at this company. I absolutely hated it. I'm shy and talking to people all day is mentally exhausting for me. I'm considering just saying I won't do it and letting them fire me if they want. I won't judge people who do that job, but I found it demeaning and very taxing. I assume most people in call centers would leave if they could.

My boss claims the company could shut down if we can't answer a good chunk these sales calls, but that's not really my concern. I've been looking to leave way before the COVID pandemic anyways because I only make 40,000 which isn't enough to live on my own. 

I currently live at home still, I can probably cut my monthly expenses to around 500 dollars, possibly even less, and I have roughly 4,000 in savings, add on the 1,200 from the stimulus as well.

We talked and it seemed like he was chill and then later on he asked me to send him a pic of me so I did and he deleted me off snap right after, I mean to be fair the pic I sent him I looked ugly in it, like the angle and lighting was bad and my hair was not done and overall I did not look good at all, 


I just sent that cause I thought why does it matter what I look like but nope I guess he wanted girls that only looked a certain way like makeup all done and hair done and shii. The weird thing is I never understood why that mattered tho cause if I was a guy I bet u he wouldn’t care what I looked like if I asked to come. 

So anyways fast forward to today someone on my Snapchat mentioned him so I added him again just out of curiosity cause I was bored but apparently Snapchat tells u when the last time u talked to someone was even if they deleted u so he saw that and I guess remembered me and then deleted me again right away. 

I mean i don’t care because I don’t know him in real life but it still kinda hurts and now I feel insecure about the way I look even tho I know I don’t look bad, if that makes sense so I guess my question is how can I not let that effect me and effect the way I feel about myself because now I feel ugly and I’m over thinking and I feel like all guys think I’m ugly",27Mar2020,1
655,So me and this girl let’s call her (Jessica). Me and Jessica were best friends since freshman  year. We were inseparable I was always at her house we always hung out in all our spare time. At the end of our sophomore year through a series of events we fell out of touch. Towards the end of our junior year we started talking again and we were as close as before. However we both had a much stronger connection we were both attracted to each other but weren’t doing anything about it really. Then through another series of events we weren’t allowed to see each other again. We got into a fight and she said she didn’t want to be friends with me but still wanted to stay in touch and I told her no I couldn’t do that I’d be torture for me and stopped talking completely. 8 months past and I’m on tinder and I see her profile I swiped right and instantly matched. I messaged her just to see how she was and we started talking again. Although it’s been a few weeks and some days she talks to me like we used to but others it’s nearly impossible to carry a conversation. I’m not at all sure what she wants if anything.

657,"Some time ago, my father found his dad through Ancestry and got in contact with him. Now none of us, including my father had ever met him. My dad just wanted answers about his family line and to give him a chance to get to know us.

I was hesitant because I had never met him so he was practically a stranger to us but I wanted to give him a chance, for my dad.

Things just got weird as I tried to let him in. I was talking to a store owner in a small shop while I was showing my grandfather around town about some books and he mentioned that he had more in a warehouse. Now I had no intention to go to a warehouse alone with the owner and after we left all I got from him was nagging and how I should know better then to go somewhere with a stranger. 

I’m a 26F so yes, I do know better and as I said before I never had any intentions to go anywhere with the store owner. But it was like suddenly he was the overprotective grandparent that suddenly knew what was best for me. I was frustrated but decided to let it go.

Until he messaged my father to inform him of what happened... like I was a teen again with no idea of the outside world and not a 26 year old with her own life.

Things got stranger, he would constantly message me, morning and night. He would tell me stories about his life which was fine at first until they started drifting into weird territory. He told me how much I reminded him of a female friend he had in his teens until he ruined the friendship by messing around with a friend of his friend. 

He would tell me how much I reminded him of my grandmother which was even weirder. Let’s just say my grandmother disappeared to another state to get away from this man (which I found out later) after something not very nice happened to her at his hands.

He would call me beautiful and his sunshine in his messages. He didn’t seem to know when to back off and the messages just kept coming. He would claim to my parents that we “had a special connection” and that he “knew me better then my own parents”.

He would stop by ALL the time, sometimes even letting himself into the house without knocking if the door was unlocked. He would bring chocolate and fruit which at times he said they were for me (???). 

My siblings were more weary of him and didn’t open up to him which I think frustrated him since I heard from one of our close family members that he visited them and called my siblings weird.

I soon stopped answering his messages but he didn’t stop. I soon didn’t want to even see the man who was my grandfather. I didn’t leave the house because I was worried he’d be driving through town and see me. 

I went to my parents for advice and showed them the messages. To say that my dad was furious was an understatement and my mother looked very uncomfortable. My dad cut off all ties with my grandfather and told me I did the right thing coming to them for advice. 

My grandfather started sending mean messages to my father, bringing up the “connection” he has will me and how he “knows me better then them”. 

At one point he messaged my mother and told her the last time he saw me I “looked like a desolate woman looking at her lover” WTF?! I was looking at him and maintaining a distance from him while still saying goodbye to him when he was still allowed in the house.

I blocked him some time after since he didn’t give up and continued to send me messages.

Does anyone have any advice or information that can help me understand what happened? I have a feeling but wanted to ask you guys on Reddit.",27Mar2020,1

I have a tiny side-income from selling gold in games, which I make by playing poker, but I don't play for real money. I could improve at poker and play for real money, but the courses generally cost money, and it's not really something I can see myself doing for a good future.

A few years ago, I started to cheat a little. Just to ease my insecurities. When I struggled drawing a hand, I'd just trace it in. I couldn't get a face right so I'd just copy another artists work. This bad habit quickly spiralled out of control until I would be tracing entire drawings- always telling myself ""I'm just doing this to learn. I'm just training and one day I'll be able to stop and draw my own things."" But that was three years ago and nothing has changed.  
I don't go as far as to trace entire drawings anymore, just a pose that I'll chop up and re-arrange to look different or a hand or a hairstyle or the frill of a skirt. But now I have a following. I have followers and friends who think I'm some amazing artist that I'm not. I've had commissioners who are unknowingly purchasing art that has been frankenstiened together of other artists works and the guilt is starting to keep me up at night. I'm getting nightmares of all my friends abandoning me because they found out I'm a fraud. I still cant draw on my own and I suddenly have a reputation I need to uphold and my only source of money that I need to protect.

It was the middle of her spring break so she has been visiting her parents while I’m moving out of my apartment in the same town. We were moving in together in 4 days, on April 1st.

The urge came whilst talking with a customer so I held my breath until we had solved the issue with his order. The urge went away for a few minutes so I continued to assist customers (I work in customer service we had a nonstop line), and I had another urge to cough, but this time it was bad and I had to excuse myself to go cough and get water. I didn't think anything of it and simply washed my hands and returned to the service desk.

 Then the urge came again and I excused myself again. The coughing became very frequent to the point where I stayed in the bathroom for a few minutes to cough and wash my hands repeatedly. I started to get upset because I haven't coughed at all recently, and I knew if I coughed on the floor that I would get all sorts of looks from customers and coworkers alike. So I decided to call my mom and let her know what was happening, and she told me just to come home. I told both my head cashiers and a manager on duty and they didn't seem very pleased with me leaving, but let me go anyways.

So I told them my problems, thinking I probably said too much and wouldn't get a response. But they asked me for my stats (age, weight, etc.) So I told them. To my surprise, they didn't tell me ""oh, you're too young to lose weight, don't worry about it"" and stuff like that. I am a teen after all.

They proceeded to ask if I wanted them as my personal trainer. I said I'd like that but I didn't have the money. They said they'd do it for free and that was another red flag. What trainer would hang out on Reddit to give free advice? Are they even certified?

They asked weird questions, like how squishy my belly was and if I had belly rolls. Maybe personal trainers do ask these questions, but I'd never know because I haven't talked to a real one before.

The redditor proceeded to ask me for pictures of my body to see how much fat I had on my stomach. They asked for my face to be included. That was the third red flag.

And for months after they broke up she would send my friend manipulative messages like ""I just hooked up with another girl but kept calling her your name"" until she eventually blocked her.

Now it's been a year since they broke up and my friend added her again and is sad (sad would be an understatement) because she is with someone else. But I've still had this girl on snapchat this whole time and oh my god she's horrible. Somehow in the last year she's had like five different girlfriends and even got ENGAGED to one of them. She airs out all her relationship drama on her story an then posts cute pics of them the next day. There are just so many other bad things about her that I could go on forever.

I don't know how else to comfort her other than saying ""but she was so bad for you"" even though that's not helping anyone. My friend already has her own issues and I'm always scared I'm going to say something that makes it worse. She has depression and anxiety and has attempt suicide in the past. She had a really bad childhood with an abusive dad who she no longer lives with but still manages to abuse he. I'm worried she's going down a dark path again and I don't know what to do.

And as horrible as it is part of me is just annoyed that she always wants me to comfort her because again I honestly just have issues with people's emotions. It's not that I have no empathy its just that most of the time I can get the basic jist of how they feel but just don't really care.

678,"Hello, how r u doing?

So, I have a crazy story that I'm currently living. I have a stalker. And I'm in to her, but I don't think she wants anything with me. She's still stalking me though.

So, I met her online while I was selling some stuff through our version of Craig's list. She was interested on a coffee maker.

So, she arrives in the building and I ask if she wants me to go down to meet her but she said she would rather go up to my apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

She gets in and we start chatting, and chatting, and she was actually really nice. But then she start making some crazy excuses to not go. I said I wanted to sell some stuff so she said ""So let me help you take pictures of it for you to advertise it"" and start taking pictures of every little thing in my house.

Things that I don't even want to sell, things that have absolute no value like an old rusty spoon. She just start taking pictures of everything in the house and wouldn't leave. Along with that she cleaned all of my dishes and said she would come back later to do a full cleaning of the house(????)

And don't get me wrong, I was really attracted to her. Believe it or not, she is kinda hot! So I was hoping that eventually she would stop her madness of taking pictures and we could start making out, but she didn't give any signs of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

When she finally said she was leaving I though I was finally getting some. But then she refuse to hug me and said ""with this corona virus times, we should just hand shake""

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so, after that, she starts crazily sending me messages telling me to go to her house or asking if she can come to mine. EVERY DAY. MORE THAN ONCE A DAY. She says ""I have to go there to clean the house""  


And then, she started to come to my house. With no heads up, nothing, she would just ring the intercom and I had to not answer and pretend I wasn't home. 

&amp;#x200B;

And she's so fucking crazy. Like, she comes to my house, ring the intercom and send me a message. Then I reply saying I'm not home(Even though I am). And then she says ""r u going to take long? I don't want to have to wait"". Then I say yes and she says ""so tell me as soon as u arrive then""

&amp;#x200B;

And the worse part is that I am really into her. Like, she is really hot. But she doesn't seem to actually want anything sexual with me. She's just fucking crazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, don't know what to do. I know this will make me sound like a jerk, but I'm looking for a polite way to tell her ""are we going to have sex? Because I do want it. But if we are not please stop stalking me"".",27Mar2020,1

685,"Okay so let me give you some background, I’m 28 years old, my sister is 3 years older than me and my cousin is 24 we grew up together closer than any other cousins in our family. We’d spend every weekend at each other’s houses until recently and this is where I need your help. I want you guys to have a fair idea of the whole picture so stick with me while I give you some insight on who we are as people. Mia (fake name) is my cousin who has always loved baking since day 1, in fact she’s trying to make a career out of it which we fully supported and even helped her come up with a name and set up and Instagram and all that, recently she has said she was thinking of ditching the baking and becoming a veterinarian which we supported too. Now Mia and me are really close and she gets me on a whole other level. I admit I’m needy and I call her maybe 2 to 3 times a day just talk random bs but we always had things to talk about( I know it’s a lot). She always says she’s knows when I’m mad cause I don’t call lol okay so years ago something horrible happened to me and I got through it with the help of my sister and her. Fast forward to now and that person is getting held accountable for doing horrible things and it’s been a whirlwind clusterfuck of emotions and just really took me for a loop. So Mia is at my house one weekend and we find out that I have to go to court because of what happened. I’m terrified and ask that they go with me for support she’s hesitates and says she needs to think about it. I was taken back and said okay but the court date was Monday (it was a Friday when we all found out) so I said take your time but please hurry by Saturday night I couldn’t help myself I said what’s holding you back?! And she said she had to make cookies for an order she had but the cookies were due Friday so I didn’t understand why she couldn’t get started on them on tuesday?! Idk but I said okay and she told me she would be there in spirit. I was beyond hurt that she choose cookies over me. A couple weeks went by she never called to see how it went or checked in on me until my birthday. She texted me happy birthday and said I deserved a good day she even came down that weekend and I asked her why didn’t you go to court with me and she said cause I had to make cookies. She doesn’t see an issue with it at all but I just can’t look at her the same. And it’s not like she had to make a ton of cookies, it was only 24 cookies. Everyone is saying I should reach out to her and make emends especially at a time like this but every time we fight it’s always me reaching out it’s always me calling it’s always ya going out of our way for her and trust me we’ve had talks about that too and she just says she’s not one to reach out first or she doesn’t call cause she knows I will, she has an excuse for everything so my question to you is, am I being over dramatic? Should I reach out and make emends? Should I just distance myself from her for a bit? Help me please regardless of anything I still love her deeply I just can’t get over this hurt, I thought she’d always be there when I needed her and I really needed her on that day it was one of the scariest things in my life but am I wrong?",27Mar2020,1

My mom seems to always find a way to call me out for being lazy or how I’m just like my dad. (They’re divorced and did not end on good terms) I know that she compliments me maybe once a while, but these complaints come way more often. 

I don’t know if I’m on the lazier side of the spectrum or average for a teen. For example, I do the dishes on alternating days with my sister, I finish my homework on time, I’m the only one in the family that walks out to throw the garbage away, and I also clean my room. But yet somehow my mom never thinks I do anything other than sleep, eat, and play video games. 

I also have to deal with getting compared to my sister who is older than me and is constantly assisting my mom whenever she starts to complain. I’ve noticed this in recent years where I am always worried that my sister is going to start to talk bad about what I’ve done during dinner, and it’s like she enjoys seeing me fail. 
Aside from that, I usually have a fun relationship with my sister, just that part of her makes me want to punch her.

690,"So I live with two roommates, we're three girls all living together and it's been great for the most part. We all work at the same place and got close outside of work, then we moved in together in a 3 bedroom apt. We all made a pact at the beginning saying we would pay everything 3 ways, we've done a good job of it, the bills are all divided by 3, we take separate grocery karts and pay for our own food, etc. The thing is, I've been supper sad as of late, to the point where I noticed I was being overly fake happy just for the sake of being happy hanging out with my friends. My sister noticed this and since then I've stopped trying to put up pretenses, but then a distance started growing with me and my roommates. They work mornings and I work nights, so I usually come home to them asleep. I wake up and they're gone, they come home and tell me all about their day, then I leave for work. I can't help but feel i'm just a soundboard for them to talk to and I never get to say what I really feel, how my day was, how i'm a sad sack of shit, that sort of thing. I just retreated into myself I guess, and to top it all off, they sat me down and told me they started dating a while ago. This was unexpected, I didn't see it coming. I'm happy for them, they're super cute together, but it makes me lonely. I already felt a divide forming between us, and now what was once us all being friends/co-workers/roommates has shifted. Now they spend all their time together, leaving me alone and going for walks together, not saying goodbye. They've taken over the living room with they'e cuddling and hushed whispers, and I can't help but feel like I don't know them anymore and they haven't tried to talk to me in so long it hurts. I've been single as hell ever since high school so I tell myself I'm just being bitter, that i'm jealous, but I miss my friends. They only time I hangout with them one-on-one is when the other one would be at work. We don't spend quality time together, we just spend time together, if that makes sense. My silence has been noticed, the silence stretching for uncomfortable amounts. It just makes me even madder, that they don't ask. It's like they don't even know me anymore so they don't know what to talk about with me, then they eventually leave me and go snuggle with each other in their rooms, giggles being heard immediately. It hurts more than I can describe that they don't seem to care about me anymore.

I  was recently told that I was too anxious about being detailed oriented  by the manager at my new job who sided with a 15 year employee training me. The trainer does things differently than other employees and the manager says he is concerned about me. I ask a lot of questions. 

Background: I have recently quit 3 jobs because one VP said I have great work ethic but I need to leave tasks undone indefinitely, another complained that I was too slow another the staff complained because I said something about an unsanitary cook.

I  spoke with my mentor who said that my behavior changed when project managers started giving me poor evaluations because of my attitude and behavior. When he first met me, I did not get along with people but the job wasn't an issue. I said what I had to say and moved on. I ended up in the office only because I got reported by someone. He did say that he noticed a delay and increasing questions when I was not sure about something or questioned they way someone else performed the task but improvement once the question was answered. Now he says he has noticed that I talk too much and the question asking has gotten worse for some  reason after the bad evaluations. He says I now get along with everybody and the job is a question and before I did not get along with people but got the job done. I was told that people don't have the time to deal with me.

So I have a law degree from a foreign jurisdiction, but have completed all the necessary conversion exams to allow me to practise in my own country. But first, I need an articling position, and to write the bar.

Problem is the grading system where I did my degree is very different, so my grades look awful to potential employers, and I've had zero responses to applications in over a year. But it's not an option to send applications without a transcript. I do explain the difference in cover letters, and attach a conversion chart, but still no luck.

I'm at the point of giving up my law career and looking for something else. I have very little experience beyond admin work however, and am getting few responses in all other career areas as well.

So I work in a VERY busy retail pharmacy that is quite understaffed at the moment and has been for a while. I'm fairly young and this is my first job, so everything's quite new to me. I've only been working there for several months, and I think I am OK at my job, but there are still many responsibilities and specific insurance problems that I still don't understand. Most days I am fine, but I will just have those days where I keep messing up and feel embarrassed and guilty for having my coworkers fix my mistakes. It has gotten to the point where I dread going to work and have intense anxiety the night before I have a shift.

&amp;#x200B;

Some other info is that I do not plan on going into pharmacy school anymore, as I originally planned in high school. I am now pre-majoring in an unrelated field that I quite enjoy so far. I also do not financially rely on this job as I am being supported by a pretty good scholarship and my parents help me pay the rest of my tuition. I was originally pushed to find a pharmacy job because I was enrolled in a classroom-based pharmacy program that allows you to get your CPhT license in less than a year, and my parents wanted me to make at least some money from it. The only things I buy with the money I earn are stuff for myself or B-day/Christmas gifts. The rest I've been saving.

&amp;#x200B;

So my real dilemma is when to quit and how should I approach my lead/boss about it. To be honest, I want to quit ASAP. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic going on, the pharmacy has been 10x busier with everyone panicking and stocking up on maintenance meds. Some of my coworkers have been working overtime every week to make sure every day we have enough people to function as smoothly as possible. I do not work that much as I am just a part-timer and a full-time student. However, it sounds like they're expecting me to take more hours when summer break comes around, and it seems like COVID-19 will still be very prevalent in the upcoming months. I feel bad thinking about quitting during this whole pandemic, so I don't know if I should prioritize my mental health or help out at least for the entirety of the summer and then quit before the next school year starts.

TLDR: I want to quit my job during COVID-19, but my workplace is already understaffed, so I feel bad

705,"Hello! So, I was a bridesmaid in a wedding months ago. The bride was pregnant so we didn’t have a bachelorette party and instead, planned one post baby. Obvious with COVID, the trip was cancelled. I booked the trip because I work in the airline industry and get really good rates for travel, hotel and what not. The girls Venmo’d me their part. We paid for the bride’s share so she paid zero. 

Backstory, there were 5 bridesmaids. One of them, let’s call her Debbie Drama brought her boyfriend as a plus one. He was neither there for the bride or the groom. This wedding was absolutely gorgeous, in a vineyard, open bar, bride and groom paid for the bridal and groomsmen’s hotel for the weekend and a wine tour for us and our plus ones including their family aka BIG MONEY. We got there on a Friday, wedding on Sunday, checkout Monday. Debbie and boyfriend were both there the whole weekend.

Well come wedding day, Debbie’s boyfriend gets everybody’s attention right after bride’s dad made a heartfelt speech, and uses that time to propose to Debbie. TACKY TACKY CRINGE CRINGE. Everyone was shocked and furious, which is obviously justified. B&amp;G have a verbal altercation with Debbie and Debbie’s boyfriend and tell them to check out and leave mid wedding. They’re no longer friends, still. 

So back to the bachelorette weekend. I get a call saying the trip has been cancelled and I’m getting a refund and credits for future use. I forwarded the email to the 5 bridesmaids and bride, so they can read about it. I get a call from the bride furious that I’m giving Debbie her money back and credits. I told her I’d be giving Debbie back her money but not credits. She says I shouldn’t give her anything because she ruined her wedding. I technically blame her boyfriend and not Debbie per se but I also never liked Debbie so it’s whatever to me. I have no clue what the right thing to do is. 

p.s. worth it to say, Debbie hasn’t tried to reach out to any of us, or asked me about the trip since the wedding.",27Mar2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, currently I work as a part time gardener at a hotel. I like the work, but the hours are few and far between, and due to the pandemic the hotel has temporarily shut down. The current plan is for the Hotel Managers to reassess the situation if the government loosens the rules in a few weeks. Obviously this means I don't get any work until it reopens. I have also yet to ask about furlough pay, but since I am really just called in as and when I'm needed rather than having a set rota and a set salary I don't know how much I would be entitled to. However I think the pandemic may last much longer, and the shutdown may continue for months.

Currently there is a large push for crop pickers in the UK, as between COVID and Brexit there aren't any migrant works to fulfil those roles. I have several years of agricultural experience and have a few relevant qualifications to boot, so I believe I'll be in with a good chance at landing something. There's a few organisations that help people find those jobs, so I am thinking of applying to one. Here is a list of pros and cons I can come up with about applying.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

* I get to actually work instead of being stuck at home self isolating
* Some money in the bank
* New experiences, and it's something to put on my CV

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

* If I apply now and the shutdown gets lifted, I'll have given up my hotel job for a temporary, seasonal job, and will have to find another job after that end
* This work involved living on site in accommodation provided by the farm. I would have to travel, and since I don't drive I would either need to get a lift or get a train, the former of which would be impossible if the site is on the other side of the country, and latter of which would be expensive depending on distance. I don't want to apply on a website, that then 'matches' me with a farm I won't be able to travel to.
* The pay isn't great. It could maybe be more than what I make from the hotel, but after doing some research it seems like many of the farms deduct mandatory costs from wages. It's still more than what the migrant workers would be making in their home countries, but for me I would expect more, considering my experience and qualifications. Of course I wouldn't be able to find out how much these costs are until I have a contract in front of me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for some outside opinions. Applying for these jobs would be a bit of a risk that may be difficult to come back from, but I'm feeling a pull towards it all the same.",27Mar2020,1

Well about a few times early on I broke up with him bc I felt he was too needy with me and I explained the relationship is new and I’m trying to figure out my new life in this new city. Fast forward to March and we are still dating. He is so sweet and visits me frequently we talk everyday etc. I know he wants a life with me but sometimes I am Unsure if that is what I want. I feel like I’m keeping him around because I do love him and I love talking to him but I’m nervous bc i don’t know where this is going. I don’t know what to do. I’ve thought about ending it but I just don’t want to although I’m worried how I’m going to feel long term. I don’t know what to do.

712,"Ever since I was born my mom and dad put an idea that I’m spoiled. They would always get mad at me for really dumb things. I was really bullied when I was a kid and it’s not just in school but by family too. My parents put on everybody’s mind that I’m spoiled and that I’ll always be a failure. When I was grade 7 I was already planning to end my life. My moms friends are the shittiest people alive, they like to talk shit about me and my mom ofc believes them. So my parents are kinda rich and her friends aren’t rich because of that they saw me as a spoiled brat even tho I never raised my voice at my mom like my brother does. I never begged my parents to buy me designers or anything... I would always help babysit my sister but no matter what I do I’ll never be good enough. My parents always told me that I’ll be a failure and that I deserve to marry an abusive husband. Everyone likes bothering me including my teachers and classmates. I don’t know what to do anymore... I’m still 16 and I feel like giving up. Even when I talk with my mother about my feelings she would tell me that I’m spoiled and that I’ll never succeed in life. The only reason that is keeping me here is my little sister.I can’t leave her alone with them. I just want to know how can I be stronger? I’m veryyyyy emotional and I cry easily.

714,"Sorry, this is going to be a little long...

I know what I am about to share is crazy, I am being completely irrational and I know this, but for what ever reason, I can't seem to kick it. I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder about 15 years ago and I am finding this issue in particular really triggers my anxiety big time.

My issue: I met my boyfriend 3 years ago in January. It was an instant connection right away and we fell head over heels almost instantly. In March of that year he threw himself a birthday party for a bunch of his closest friends, I had not met any of them at that point. We got to talking about who was coming and he mentioned a couple of his ex-girlfriends would be there. Last minute one of them cancelled and they made plans to get brunch a few weeks later to celebrate his birthday. After his brunch, he mentioned that his ex had told him over breakfast that she was getting divorced from her husband and she had just recently moved into a new condo. She asked him to come for a visit just the two of them. By this point I was completely uncomfortable with the idea and I told him I wasn't thrilled with him going there alone. This started one of our biggest fights that would continue for the remainder of that first year, on and off. I didn't like the idea of him being alone with her knowing she was going through a divorce and I couldn't understand why he needed to be there alone. He finally agreed not to go and she kept insisting on seeing him for the following few months. They messaged frequently and there were times when we were hanging out and he would pause to message her back. I was feeling more and more like second place to this person who I had never met. She kept insisting on seeing him so we came to an understanding that he would go see her but he would not go alone which I felt was fair. After they hung out, the messages became more frequent. What I was having a hard time understanding was why she needed to get so much support from my boyfriend, when he kept saying 'we really aren't that close'.

One of my biggest concerns was that he was going to be putting himself into a situation where she would throw herself on him. (I am aware that I needed to trust my partner enough to be in that type of situation and know how to handle it but it was overwhelmingly obvious to me that there was something going on, especially since she was so adamant about him coming over alone, I couldn't understand why he didn't see it and would want to put himself in that position). I told him everything that I was thinking and he dismissed it as me being paranoid.

At the end of that first year, we had one of our most explosive fights on the situation. I traveled a lot for work so I left the next day. When I came back we both apologized for how we had handled everything and life went on.

January of the next year we had a date night and he told me that he had told his ex that he did not want to talk to her anymore. He had said he needed time to give his current relationship a chance and their relationship was making it very difficult. I asked him why he made that decision and he said ""because I finally realized that your fear about her doing something wasn't so far fetched, because they had a history of hooking up when one or the other ended a relationship"" For a year I asked him if there was anything else I needed to know about this girl, and he always said 'no, we are just friends, there is nothing else'.

I was really upset hearing that, I felt like I had been lied to and it made it worse to know that my insecurities about this whole thing may have been right. The whole time I felt like I was going crazy because he was so nonchalant about it. It took me a while but I did start to forgive him for that.

A few months later, she reached out to him again, asking if they could be friends again, to which he said, not yet. She because belligerent and started saying some very hurtful things to my boyfriend. that was the last contact they have had since.

A month after their explosive conversation, she reached out to me. She wanted to explain that she had a boyfriend now and that her boyfriend has an ex girlfriend who she is getting to know and she just wanted that same experience with me.

I thanked her for her time and that at this moment it wasn't the right time. That was the final contact either of us have had with her, that was about a year and a half ago.

Since this whole ordeal, me and my boyfriend have gone to therapy to discuss this unresolved issue. I now understand that he was feeling like I was making him choose between me or his friend and he didn't like being in that situation. I also now understand that it was not because I was insecure about her specifically, it's that he felt like I was trying to control who he spoke to and when, which I can agree is not a good feeling.

Our therapist suggested putting boundaries around that friendship, ones that allow him to still have her in his life but also allows me comfort with their relationship. We gave him my list of boundaries and he agreed they were fair but at that time he was not ready to re-connect with her just yet but before he made that connection, he would make sure I knew first.

That was a year ago.

Which brings me to my issue. I can't get her out of my head. I go through a roller coaster of emotions, from feeling bad about not letting him see her one day, to being mad that this happened the next. I have days where I feel guilty that they aren't friends anymore and that it is my fault, to being mad at her for interfering in the first place. I find myself on her social media every once in a while to 'scope out the competition' if you will. It was getting to be so consuming that I deleted my social media in hopes that it would deter me.

From what I can see, she had a good life. She got married to her boyfriend and they had a baby, but now I find myself envious of her life. She has what seems like a perfect life. Happy marriage, a little boy, she's gorgeous and they just bought a new house... ( I know I should take social media at face value because no one ever depicts their true life on it, but it's becoming harder and harder to remember that)

I have a wonderful life, a job I enjoy, a good social group, I was able to buy a house with my boyfriend last year with a big backyard perfect for BBQing and having people over. And yet, with all the things I have going for me I shouldn't be so jealous of someone else's life... But I can't help it. I want what she has which causes this vicious cycle of checking out her social media again to see what she is up to and feeling guilty/angry afterwards because I don't have what she has.

I know my issue is that I am missing closure, something that could help end this whole thing once and for all. The way this situation wrapped up with my boyfriend seems to be okay and I don't feel anxious about that part of it. However, I think I need closure with her. I find myself thinking about it more than a normal amount, almost like I am obsessed and I don't want to feel this way anymore... I can't, it is slowly taking over.

Sometimes I think I should reach out to her, but then I stop myself, it has been over a year since the last contact was made, would it be weird now, and what would I say? I can't talk to my boyfriend about it because from his point of view, this has been dealt with and closed, I also don't want to start another fight, I am over fighting about this.

If anyone has any ideas or tips please send them my way. I am desperate!

718,"My ex (25m) of almost 3 years broke up with me (25f) a few days before Christmas. It was completely out of nowhere. We were 15min from leaving to visit my family across the country. He quit his really good job in the medical field, packed his car, and moved 2000 miles away back with his parents. This was the most traumatic event of my life. Ive never been so devastated and I feel like I will never have the love of my life again. We were planning on marriage soon. He said I did nothing wrong he was just confused about his purpose in life and secretly depressed..

We havent talked much since. Times that we have talked he sounds like a completely different person that's entirely self absorbed.

I did counseling, was started on antidepressants, and after a few months started dating again.

I really like the guy I'm seeing now, but I cant get my ex out of my head. It's keeping me from enjoying my current relationship. I sometimes feel like my ex would ultimately be my preference. I feel like I cant connect with others because of this.

719,"Recently I (18F) started talking to this guy (20M), we met through mutual friends and we get along quite well and I enjoy talking to him. I’ve been in two relationships beforehand and I never got angry with them or cared about anything they’d do or say. I always knew I never genuine loved or maybe even liked my exes all that much because I was never really myself with them.

I like to pretend to play hard to get or seem not interested because I feel vulnerable being affectionate, for some reason whenever he pretends that he isn’t interested too and does the same things I do. I get extremely upset or annoyed and its been happening everyday. He’s gotten pretty annoyed since he feels like I don’t like who he is because I keep getting angry.

Is it because I genuinely like him that i’m starting to actually care? Or do I just not like who he is?",27Mar2020,1
720,"right so this has started becoming a problem about 18 months ago . my aunt has always had a couple cans but it was never anything major until 18 months ago i started to see her either asleep ( i say asleep because i wouldnt be able to tell is she had pass out because other than this i havent seen anyone pass out) on the sofa with a drink in her hand or on the armrest of the sofa. one night i wake her up and tell her to maybe cool it a little but she takes so much offence to it saying i dont' know what its like to live with someone with a drinking problem after a minute of her not listening i just go back into into my room but she follows me and tries to rant at me at the door of my bedroom but i am in no mood to deal with it so i try to close the door on her but she gets angrier things were said which were not the nicest but then the next morning she comes in starts crying saying she does have a drinking problem and that she will stop being naive as i was i said dont fully stop. 

then around 14 months ago its after christmas and the family dog died naturally were all depressed so when i go back into to school in januray i take a day off saying i'm not mentally up for it but later that night im saying the reason i really didnt feel like going in was because of my dog dying my aunt who has had a couple cans says thats okay but then goes on about how i shouldn't use it as an excuse. i said i didn't i even say wasn't feeling up for to avoid using that as an explanation but she i know just don't use it. the next morning she wakes me up to sorry and that that happened because she had a couple to drink and that its okay to say that what happened wasnt okay. i wanted to have a go at her but didnt feel it was to do so because of the state she was in after we lost our dog. 

so after around 5 months of tension due to other conflicts of personality she is again asleep on the sofa with a drink in her hand. i also forgot to mention when im talking to her after she has a couple cans she gets this attitude thats real passive aggressive and she goes into a good rant about a few things there was couple of those scenarios where she was like that because her and my ma are always asking me to have a drink with them. after i bring up how shes doing drinking so much she falls asleep with a can in her hand we get into a fight that was really bad where for two weeks i only spoke to her in one word answers and when ever i was in her car i had headphones on. eventually the fight stopped when she agreed to stop drinking but then later that day she asked was it okay to finish the drink that she had left in the house something i agreed to however ive noticed she ocassionaly  has a glass of wine however when quarintine started for the corona shes been having cans again and last night i saw her asleep on the sofa with a drink on her arm rest  and i had to shake her twice to wake her up. then i asked her how many she had she answered and asked why do you ask in a very defensive tone. 

what should i do to help her im out of ideas at this point",27Mar2020,1
721,"So with Covid going on, lots of people are getting paranoid that they might have it since it's so common with the flu. It's a bit hard to tell especially if you're in self-quarantine and there's no testing kits available in your area. 

Now I wanna ask how can I help my boyfriend be at ease with this? How to distract him in a positive way? My boyfriend has asthma and has been a smoker for about 2-3 years but he's stopped now. Then he has a bit of existing medical issues like acid reflux and gallstones issues. Usually when he gets very anxious he has a hard time breathing. He often gets coughs as well before this virus began. He kind of often gets sick too and I'm beginning to think he might have weaker immune system than mine although he looks more athletic than me. 

He's currently getting paranoid he might have it due to itchy throat, hard time breathing--but asthma like not severe (probably due to his anxiety), dry cough, he feels like he's about to get fever most of the time, and he gets headaches, but he doesn't have fever and he tracks his temperature and he says it's always normal. We suspect it might be due to his flu season? Also lack of sleep? He only gets to sleep around 3 hours everyday, though starting tomorrow he'll try to change his routine for the better. 

He's worried about his mother which is around 50 years old and his younger brother around 15 years old. He doesn't want to infect them but they live in a small house. Can you guys suggest what he can do to ease his mind about this? He doesn't want especially his mother to catch it since she's old and has asthma issues as well. What are ways he can do to self-quarantine while living in a small house with 2 other people who are more at risk with Covid? 

The last time he went out was about 5 days ago? He went out to pick some groceries which was full of people. But he was wearing the right gear, face mask and everything and when he came home he did the right things to be safe-washed his hands, took of his clothes and left them outside as well as his shoes, and took a shower to be legit clean. 

I'm worried about him and I don't want to see him getting stressed and paranoid. What can I do to help him get distracted? What can I say to help him while we're away from each other? 

I suggested to not look at Twitter often but he wants to get updated about the news. 

What can we do if we feel like we have the virus, other people are with us in the same house, what can we do to properly self-quarantine and as much as possible not infect our family members?

DO NOT USE BOOK IT TRAVEL SITE! Beware!

PLEASE HELP!!!! Located in USA(North Carolina)

My family booked a trip this summer to go to Jamaica (5 adults, 1 minor) through the site: Bookit.com. The trip was booked for July 22-26 2020, they emailed my mom on March 25, 2020 and let her know they canceled our trip and will not be refunding us. Diving deeper this company has canceled all future booking in non-US destinations for every single customer due to global pandemic. The company’s website is no longer accessible, if you go to the link, a government disclaimer pops up. You cannot access any other information. On a section of the disclaimer it says: We are currently unable to to process refunds to you, please contact your bank for options as a card holder. They will not be refunding a single customer based off the disclaimer on the website. 

Bookit.com has since disconnected all their 1-800 numbers, so you can’t even contact anyone from the company. Or even access the website. 

Our family friend suggested we contact the Credit Card company and submit a fraud claim. However my mom informed me they used their debt card. The bank stated there is not much they can do since it was basically a cash transaction due to being debit transaction. 

Couple of questions, how is this legal? What should be do to try and recoup our lost $6200? How can a company steal from its customers? And do we possibly have a case? 

I am feeling very helpless and we are out a lot of money for a trip we will not be taking. 

Side note: this trip was for my little brother’s high school graduation as a gift. The COVID-19 outbreak has stolen many priceless memories from his last fleeting years of his childhood. Any advice helps.

734," I’m in a bit of a predicament and I'm not really sure what to do or what other options I have. 

I’m not doing the best in college. It makes me feel pretty bad about myself considering that my parents have poured so much money into my education. On top of that, I could lose my loan.

I've always believed that no matter what, there is always a solution to the problems you have. If college doesn't work out, then I'm going to need to do something to get a decent paying job. I don't want to work minimum wage all my life (no offense to those working for minimum wage).

I was originally going for Mechanical Engineering then when I realized I didn't want to do that I switched my major to Industrial Technology (ITEC).

I chose ITEC because I really love technology. I don't want to develop anything new, though. My interest is mainly learning how existing technology works and learning how to fix it when something goes wrong or further enhancing that existing tech to enhance its life expectancy. I also like to inform people about the best possible technological solution for them. Kind of like the guy who runs the youtube channel [RetroRGB](https://www.youtube.com/user/RetroRGB/videos) or [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/user/LinusTechTips/videos). I see myself as the middle man that informs you of what options you have out there.

I also like to fix things. I'm into vintage tech like vinyl records, cassettes, reel to reel, laserdisc, etc… and owning that stuff requires that you know about how the technology works so that you can fix it in the future. With stuff that old, companies don't make parts for them anymore so it's up to the owner to know how to fix them. 

The only issue is that I don't know how working on obsolete technology will help me in the future. It just seems like a hobby at this point. 

What do you think I should do and what other options do I have besides college if i want a decent paying job?

735,"I live in an apartment complex, and this has happened more than once. My $200 order from Nike was delivered to the wrong building by FedEx error. I have been stuck at home quarantining, and when I realized that my order had been delivered, I immediately knew something was wrong. I submitted a claim with FedEx and spoke with a Nike representative.

Later, I got a call from Julio with FedEx and he asked me questions about the delivery. At first, he tried to relinquish accountability that FedEx had delivered incorrectly, making it seem like it was my fault. He continuously blamed [Nike.com](https://Nike.com)for their third party software, and said sometimes people ordering make mistakes. He proceeded with educating me on how bad petty crimes are with people stealing packages for example. Apparently people follow trucks from a distance and steal packages more during a pandemic. I guess the driver had just gone home, so Julio was going to follow up with me next in the morning. I received two calls from FedEx the following day, from a new person, and Julio again. Both callers carried the same condescending tone about the situation. They refused to accept fault for this error, and proceeded to blame Nike's 3rd party system, stating they put the wrong building letter when all of the buildings have their own unique number to begin with. (I feel like he was lying about the building letter)

Anyways, long story short, Julio with FedEx told me where they delivered it and told me I should go see if it's there. I knocked, left a note, and received a call later from the neighbor. He had a convenient alibi, stating he was working the night shift. He saw the packages at 3 when he left for work, but they weren't there when he got back. Well, the packages weren't delivered until 4:45 according to FedEx, so it sounds like his alibi was a lie if he starts his shift at 3:30.

What can I do from here? I cannot prove anyone stole the packages, but I have a hunch. I cannot speak for Nike, but it seems FedEx thinks I'm the one lying about not getting the package. It's frustrating that people steal, and no one does anything about it because the proper party responsible doesn't take accountability.",27Mar2020,1

beyond that, my mom tells me that she loves my hair and she wishes she could have my hair color. i think i would feel like an asshole, and im pretty sure she would be even angrier with me than with the eyebrow slit. what do you guys think",27Mar2020,1
737,"I'm 26 year old woman happily married to my absolute favourite person. We have very traditional roles within our marriage. I do all the housework, my husband manages the money. That's how we both like it. I'm financially incompetent and enjoy making our home nice, my husband detests housework and likes being the provider. It might not be the modern way of doing things but it works for us.

My life before covid isolation looked like this: get up early for work after being awake most of the night with my 3:30am insomnia, spend all morning feeling sick due to tiredness, get home exhausted from insomnia and a day of work, make dinner which adds to the tiredness, then have to choose between spending time with my husband and doing housework, usually end up neglecting the housework resulting in a messy house which makes me feel like a terrible partner. I am also autistic so every time I leave the house I have to put immense amounts of effort into pretending to be neurotypical which means even more exhaustion.

Since isolation came in and I'm temporarily not working, I can wake up around 8:30 meaning I don't feel sick and tired all morning. My husband works from home in the spare bedroom, as soon as we're awake he starts work, I make him pancakes and coffee. I do some housework. I enjoy doing the housework because making my home nice makes me feel proud. I haven't left the house so I haven't had to put effort into passing neurotypical. It's lunch time, my husband comes downstairs for an hour, I stop housework and we cuddle up on the sofa watching TV for an hour. He goes back upstairs to work I do more housework, if I finish I might read a book or play animal crossing. He finishes work and comes downstairs. I make a fabulous dinner because I have the energy to actually cook properly. I don't have to choose between housework and spending time with him because the housework is done and our environment is lovely, we can play games with our online friends or watch a film. I start to feel tired late into the evenings rather than having been tired all day and even though I'm still awake at 3:30am it's so much easier to get back to sleep because I'm not stressed.

Objectively covid isolation is a terrible situation. People are dying. I'm not trying to say the current situation is good. But it is absolutely perfect for me personally.

We'd always planned for me to quit work when we started a family as I earn very little anyway. But we haven't had any luck so far in conceiving although we've only been trying for 2 months so that's normal and plans are on hold anyway because being pregnant in a pandemic doesn't sound fun! I just hate how I've had a taste of my absolute dream life and I know I'm going to have to give it up to go back to that permanent tiredness and feeling as though I'm being spread too thin between my job, the household and my husband. As soon as isolation ends it's back to perpetual exhaustion and feelings of failure and I don't know how I can accept that?",27Mar2020,1
738,"Hey everybody, I apologize in advance for my mobile formatting. 

So, a stray cat had kittens right near my house. I spent my last bit of money buying her some food that I put in a bowl next to her and her kittens so she could eat something. I noticed that she’s highly aggressive towards the runt, to the point that she’s not allowing it to feed. It breaks my heart to hear it’s little hungry meows knowing that it won’t be fed. My boyfriend and I have been desperately wanting a cat, but because we lost our jobs due to covid can’t afford to get the necessities. We called several different animal control resources and shelters, but no one is willing to help with such a young kitten. I’m afraid that it will die without our care, but we also can’t afford to buy what we would need to care for it as it’s so young. What do you all think I should do?

   I’m 21 years old and going on 22 in August and I just feel mad at myself for not starting college right when I graduated from high school. I feel like I’ve given 3 years of my life to the company I’ve worked for, and it might sound dumb but I feel kinda old to be starting college. 
   I also feel like I’m going to regret my decision of quitting my job with the company I work for because I’m making a good living and I’ve been doing better than ever, but I feel like I’m going to look back 20 years wishing I would have gone to college.

She already bought the ticket and I would feel terrible if I stayed because she would've bought it for nothing. But at the same time I know I'll be unemployed with nobody to turn to.

The pandemic isn't making things easier because either way, I'm going to remain unemployed for a while because hardly anyone is hiring new people lately because of the plague.

I texted her, called and snapped her and said hope your okay and call me when you can. I haven’t heard anything. I guess my question is should I be worried she not interested anymore or  am I overthinking and just wait till she contacts me. I mean we talked everyday for the last like 25 days.

I snapped her two days ago, she hasn’t opened it or sent any snaps since then and she’s not answering the phone.

746,"So it's actually a very long story I'm gonna try to make it as short as possible. So there is a girl who has loved me for 5 years and then had a boyfriend. When she started having that boyfriend we became good friends and she became my only true friend. 1 year passed and we are still good friends but she thought she didn't love her boyfriend anymore and they have separated. I went to her house and we decided to watch a movie. During the movie she started holding my hand and we started hugging. She even kissed me and told ""I wish I had separated earlier."" That moment was like the happiest moment of my life. 

I went back to my house and we had a period which we couldn't communicate much. Then one day she asked me if I loved her or not. When I asked why she told she is about to reunite with her ex boyfriend and I was confusing her mind. My world crushed that moment. I told her that I am not really sure to at least see her happy with her boyfriend.

Some more time passed, and I couldn't stand life anymore. That moment we hugged each other was so happy that it blacked out all the other happinesses. Things didn't enjoy me anymore. So I decided to write her that. I said I am scared of that moment never happening again. She got angry at me.

She didn't tell me why she was angry. I became sad and suicidal. I told her that if she doesn't tell me one day I'm gonna suicide so she explained it. She actually reunited with her boyfriend after I told her that I am not sure about my feelings. She told when I told her I wanted to have that moment again I was confusing her mind. She got angry at me because I was confusing her mind. I told her that if she is confused then it's not love but she didn't listen. These all happened in an argument style conversation. 

After this we stopped arguing and she said she isn't angry at me anymore. I said I loved her and that's the last thing in our messages, she saw it but wrote nothing. 

The problem is I can't feel anything right now because that moment blacks out every happines I used to have. I don't know how to solve it, I don't want to make her sad or angry at me cause I really love her. 

Thank you for reading this useless text, if you cab advice something I will be very happy.",27Mar2020,1
747,"So, I frequent the Aspergers forum. It’s my safe heaven, but there is a specific moderator on there who has it out for me.

I don’t know why. But recently over the past few days this person supposedly has been following me about and writing hateful messages, beneath all of my posts.

They told me not to talk about Quarantine but everyone else is allowed to talk about Quarantine. So why am I not?

Well they now banned me because I said the abusive account was another user, but how am I supposed to know it’s not that person if their name was used?

I uploaded a photo the other day and this person has been defacing my photo and writing hateful messages on it. What sort of moderator would do this?

Account number 1: /user/Angus_Alt

Account number 2: /user/Maiden-Angus-Wanker

Photos:

I am at a complete loss as to why this person is defacing my photos. I’m also confused as to why a moderator who is supposed to be cordial and non partisan is banning me from my safe heaven because I questioned a person if they did this.

How is that deserving?

Then the hateful messages below the photo about not talking about Quarantine and struggling? Well I am struggling and there is nothing wrong with talking to other Aspergers people who might also be struggling too.

Is there anything that can be done about this moderator banning me? Is it possible to find out if the posts are from the moderator in question?

750,"I know there's dance tutorials, I've heard all the advice about ""just move and not care"", dance like no one is watching etc and I think this advice is very good but a big problem with me is that music doesn't mot ""move"" me.   


I've listened to songs across multiple styles, genres and eras and I love a lot of tracks but even the catchiest songs and funkiest beats can't move me to nod my head or tap my foot. The age-old advice of ""just listen to your body's instincts"" is moot with me as no impulses are triggered. Most cases of people dancing its people saying ""I'm afraid of doing something dumb"" and it's them holding themselves back. My case goes a step further as there is no impulse or desire to move and just stand still as that's all I feel like doing.   


Because of this, I don't go to dances, I avoid parties with a dance floor as I hate being asked (I've also passed on various weddings of friends and family) and even Karaoke trips and concerts. Mainly watching everyone be able to physically express themselves through music while I just calmly sit down and listen just makes me feel like a giant outsider.

751,"TLDR: My best friends boyfriend is an  *insult*  and I can't let it go. It's now starting to make me and my best friend break apart.


First of all, this is a story about teens so it will probably not be a big deal for most of you but I need help to sort things through and let something go.

   I've been friends with M19 for five years, and F18 for about one year. All of us suffers from different kinds of mental illnesses which makes this so much more complicated than it should be. F18 and I became best friends pretty quickly and M19 and F18 started dating quickly after that. 

   At first, I was really excited since they made each other really happy and lifted them up... but then the argueing started, and I found out that M19 had been flirted and sending pics to another girl for months. He said that because of his mental illness, he has very low self esteem and needed validation. I got mad, F18 got sad but they solved it pretty quickly. 

   More things happened (ex M19 tried to forbid F18 from drinking/partying, something he did regulary), but some details should stay away from the internet forever so I'm just gonna jump to it.

   He broke up with her after saying that F18 should be like his ex because she was so much better and that it's F18 job to make him happy (which it's not, especially since he has depression (diagnosed by psychologist but untreated)) He broke up with her through snapchat after saying an hour prior that he loved her soo much etc etc. 

  The day after he hooked up with his ex and became cold. Refused to say anything nice when she picked up her things. Refused to explain why he ended things.

  I watched my best friend break several times during the relationship, and sometimes I begged her to end it so she could work on her mental health because she poured all her energy into helping him. When he ended things, I was glad it was over but furious in the way he did it. 

   A month later M19 knocked on her door, begging  F18 to take him back. She did. And I can't let things go.

I KNOW it's wrong of me to even post this post since it's not my relationship but I need help to stop being angry, to stop seeing him as someone who destroyed my friend's heart. To his credit, he has behaved well since and I shouldn't worry 'cause she can take care of herself. So please give me advice, my therapist just says that I should ""let it go and just be friends with F18"" but I can't hang with her, he is always there.

752,"We were classmates for 4 years,then we entered high school

And she had a crush on me for 2 and a half years when we got together,I was pretty bad psyhycally because I was rejected by my crush again and she was there on my side,and I started having a crush on her too

After that,time passed,and she was pretty non talkative,as she mostly gives me emojis and in reality we talked a lot only 2 or 3 times,out of the like 6 times per week we would see each other for 2 months and a little

We kissed for the first time after 2 months and 1 week,time in which I tried kissing her twice,first time she understood that I wanted to kiss her,but did nothing,and second time she backed off

She gave me a quick kiss,and then I ran to her and kissed her longer,and she thought I wanted to do a french kiss and just stopped me

Since then,we haven't seen each other,and for like 2 weeks I would be happy thinking about kissing her again

Now,I am thinking why I am with her if I am not feeling happy

My friends told me she is way below me,as I am at the top high school in the city on the hardest profile,meanwhile she is in one of the worst high schools in the city,on an ok profile

And we don't really have too much in common as far as I can see,as we can't really talk about anything else than our life,like asking ""what is your biggest fear"" etc

756,"This is really frustrating for me to write for I have been dealing with roommates from hell that I can’t escape because I can’t break my lease. 
One of the roommates (shares a room with another girl) recently got a boyfriend. She’d bring him over every night and sleep with him in the living room. At first I was empathetic because she has to share a room with another girl and doesn’t have much privacy, until weeks went by and it started to become uncomfortable for me to walk in on her and her partner (naked but covered with blankets) in the living room constantly. I was uncomfortable with leaving my room to go to the bathroom or go to the kitchen to make food. After a while I expressed my feelings to her and she seemed to understand; however, I noticed her attitude towards me change, and she began spending more time at her boyfriend’s place. Of course my roommates never clean up the apartment, it’s always filthy and I have to be the one who vacuums/wipes floors and counters. One day as I was cleaning up, I moved some shoes from the front door to near her room so that I can wipe and vacuum underneath (there were around 30 pairs of shoes that belonged to this roommate, which seemed excessive since later she’s going to claim that she doesn’t live in the apartment anymore). She happened to come home soon after and immediately texted the apartment group chat (because she didn’t want to confront me in person maybe) that I am rude for moving her shoes from the doorway and that she doesn’t live in the apartment enough to help out with the cleaning, and hence announcing that she will no longer be paying for utilities (which include gas and electric, water/sewage/trash, and WiFi...so 3 separate bills). I was livid. These girls have been emotionally torturing me for months, locking me out of the bathroom, banging really loudly in the kitchen early in the morning, turning up the volume on their shows/music at 5am so I have trouble sleeping...and they get upset at me for cleaning up? I told her that doesn’t seem fair, because she signed a lease and is required to pay for her share of the bills. I was told that I can’t force her to pay, and the other roommates sided with her. 
Now because of the covid situation, my hours have been severely cut and I barely make enough to pay for rent this month. I don’t know what to do.
I’m sorry this is really long, but I’ve been really anxious and sad, to a point where I didn’t want to get out of bed or my even my room just to avoid the roommates. I’ve relocated to my parents who don’t live very far for the time being, because it was starting to affect my mental health.

757,"Before I start, I just want to say overall my parents are great and loving, they just have their moments. Me and my family are very close, extended family too. Me and all my cousins are like siblings. 
So basically, my parents broke up a year ago and it’s thankfully been quite easy. He comes to see us very regularly, and normally my mum hates this. She obviously would never stop it, and my mum and my dad are still best friends (they were together for 20 years. My mum was 16/dad was 23) My mum is a very stressed person. She gets angry at the smallest things, like using the wrong hoover, doing something she told us to a minute later etc. (I have 2 full siblings that live with us, brother 19 sister 13). My mum slags my dad of to me constantly, saying how easier it is now my dads gone, how much he annoys her. And it is true, my mum has calmed down a lot since my dad left but it’s hard to be put in a position where my parents are slagging eachother off to me. 
My dad tells me a lot of stuff like “this wouldn’t break if I was still here” “that wouldn’t happen if I was here” and it’s difficult because I don’t think they understand how much pressure it puts on me. 

Okay, to the problem. My dad has come to stay with us so we can see him during the quarantine. Ever since he has temporarily moved in (4 days) everyone’s been arguing. It’s my mum and dad vs me and my siblings. One thing my mum complains about is how early my dad goes to bed. When he stays over he sleeps on the couch, and we all have to be upstairs for around 6:30. It annoys us all, but now suddenly my mum is on his side, and we have to be in bed for 7. A 17 year old in bed at 7pm. My mum said earlier today her anxiety has been playing up which I understand because I have bad anxiety. She’s been screaming at us constantly all day about how much we don’t “help” her around the house and how we “are selfish”. My dad has been defending her saying “take all their shit away”. “They should be doing EVERYTHING” “they are selfish”. This doesn’t sound bad but having them say this as if you weren’t right next to them hurts. So my mum decided to have an early night in bed. This was an hour ago at 7:30pm. I was on my PlayStation and my dad came in and said “Are you getting a bath?” I said I’ll get one in the morning. About 10 minutes after I went to my mum and said I’m gonna get a shower so she shouted my dad up. They went crazy at me saying how my mum should be able to rest and how I only decided to shower because she is trying to rest. I said “it’s only 8pm I want to shower” and his face dropped, saying how I’m taking it personally. He also went mad at my brother too. I rolled my eyes and went to bed. 

My mum is a person who likes to be a victim. She basically thrives off of having “bad kids”. 
I put my parents through a lot a few years ago. I was depressed and suicidal and sending nudes to men online. We have gone through hell and back and I have finally grown a relationship with them, but I dint think I can handle them in the house together constantly ‘ganging up’ on me and my siblings. I know it sounds like I’m being over dramatic but it’s different when you are actually there. I’m very anxious and don’t know how to communicate how I’m feeling to them. We all got used to my dad not being here and now everything’s so different and it busts just sucks. I’m not good at wording things but I hope this made sense. 

This is already really long so I’ll tell you some stuff they do in a shorter sentence:

Mum constantly criticised me for my weight, clothes, motivation
Dad thinks he knows everything
My brother has robbed money of everyone in the house and my mum says she will do something about it but hasn’t. 
Before the quarantine my mum got 2 weeks of work and went out drinking with my older cousins for around 10 days out of the two weeks (either to the pub or brought them back to the house) - this ones kinda hard to understand because my extended family and us are all very close and like siblings but having them over drinking EVERY night is stressful. This pisses my dad of A LOT because mum goes out with cousins of his side of his family (he doesn’t see them as much as my mum does I think he is jealous+ he can’t go out too because he’s been sober for over a decade)
My sister is a newly teenager and she has a bad bad attitude and makes it hard to talk to her. 
I’m introverted and never leave my home and this causes even more problems with my mum. 

I don’t know, maybe I am the problem I just want some advice on how to communicate with them and get through this quarantine with less stress. Any help? Sorry if this is a mess",27Mar2020,1
758,"My landlord is evicting me and I’m planning to leave in early April.

They’ve told me that I should pay the full rent and then they’ll give me back some of it when they get a new tenant, however given the current situation with lockdowns and quarantine etc I think it’s very unlikely that’ll happen, and so I won’t see a penny of my money back.

Currently, evictions are not allowed where I’m from due to the COVID-19 outbreak, however that’s being dealt with separately.

Given that he’s illegally evicting me in the first place,  would I be the bad guy if I paid him what he’s due for the period I’m actually in the property and nothing more? I’ve calculated a daily rate based on the number of days in the month, the monthly rent and then have a figure in mind for what he’d be due for the days I’ll actually be there.

759," 

Alright,  so. Throwaway for obvious reasons because I follow a sub for my small  town and I'm trying to remain as unconnected to these calls and this  situation as humanly possible.

I  have a neighbor. We'll call her Tyra. Tyra is up at all hours of the  night and plays music so insanely loud on top of being outside,  screeching, hollering, singing, clapping, snapping. Any noise you can  imagine, she's making it. Her door is very near mine. Sometimes Tyra is  out with Peter. I have called the local PD multiple times for noise  complaints because I have children and while I don't entirely care  during the weekends, I care during the week that they're up at 3-4AM  playing their music. Tyra is close with the leasing office and the  maintenance men here as she has lived here for 3+ years so she seems to  be able to get away with anything.

Every time  PD has been called, she flips out and claims she's going to find out  who has done it (pro-tip: it's me).  The police come, they tell her to  quiet down. She goes inside. They leave. She comes back outside and  yells for an hour that the cops says whoever has called is jealous of  her and ""wHy WoUlDn'T tHeY bE jEaLoUs Of Me."" I sometimes call 2 times a  night and the cycle just repeats so I give up and put headphones on my  kids to try to keep them asleep.

Two  nights ago, she was outside fighting with another resident. The other  resident kept trying to disengage but it wasn't happening. Tyra kept  screeching and yelling for an hour even after the other resident went  inside of her unit.

Last night, we  have a lockdown at 11:00 and you are not to be outside past 11:00.  Additionally, it was a weeknight. They were being loud enough to disturb  my household. Yet again. So I called non-emergency. They came out. The  cycle happened again. She went inside. She came back outside. She  started yelling that she was mental and she was going to find who was  calling and she was going to shoot their house up.

Fast-foward  to 7AM this morning, I hear an altercation outside. She was like  camping the resident's car who she had an altercation with the previous  day to confront her about calling the cops. I didn't go and claim it  because this lady is clearly dangerous. Around 7:30AM, my windows are  shaking from her music blasting. She is screaming over it that she will  be up at 4-5 AM every day doing this because she's going to find out who  it is, and again, she's mental and she's ""plotting.""

All  day she has been outside pacing outside back and forth. She is  intermittently turning her stereo up blaring ""You don't want no problems  with me."" (Cute). And yelling ""CALL THE LAW!""

Okay  so clearly this is not normal behavior and I cannot go to my leasing  office because they will do nothing about this and they have done  nothing about this. The police just tell her to cut it out and then she  goes completely berserk after this and goes on for days on end tirades  tormenting everyone in this very close together building setup day and  night because the police department here has shown her that she is  untouchable.

This is insane. What  are my options? What can I do? Now that there is quarantine it's  significantly worse because I can't just leave to get away from this and  my kids are home all day and can hear the profane music she is blasting  and the things she is yelling.

761,"I know this is not relationship\_advice but I already posted there and want a second opinion mon my situation.

I'll keep this short and sweet. I have been in a relationship for 8 years and we have had different lives. I grew up not knowing what was truth or what was my imagination.

My family would say things that would upset me and then tell me to take a joke regardless of how it made me feel I always believe that even if you didn't mean to offend anyone still apologise.

Well, my boyfriend jokes about stuff like if he finds a girl who has the same music taste as him then I'm gone but I can't help but feel like is this really a joke or not as I grew up with people saying 'jokes' that were not jokes but portrayed as jokes so if I took offence they could just say it was a joke.

whereas my jokes are actual punchline jokes or puns and none that offend anyone (I hope).

But my boyfriend has said stuff where I have demanded an apology because he didn't give me one himself but he tells me no and to learn to take a joke and how I used to be more fun and now I am too serious and it is really hurtful to hear that so then I end up double offended.

My whole backstory is kind of dramatic and so when I describe it to my boyfriend he thinks that I am taking things out of context until he sees it for himself, he is very logical where I am very emotional and want to make sure everyone is happy so when his family says something I try to comfort him but they has been times where he family has called him a victim when he was upset and it was then I realised about how he called me a victim once. I began thinking is the reason he doesn't want to understand me is that his family doesn't want to understand him but I don't want my feelings to be ignored as well I can't give him all my matches and watch my own flame burning out.

He says stuff like we need to act like adults and that he doesn't want me to change him or want him to change and I explained it all that I am not wanting him to change I am trying to make him be more understanding and also trying to make him more open to things so that it will impact our relationship positively like talking more, understanding each other etc. The person he was 2 years ago was an asshole, to put it bluntly, and I have spent the past 2 years getting through to him, he is changing from what he used to be it's just we are 2 different people. I have also told him when he said about how his dad jokes with his mum that we are not them and I don't want their relationship nor do I want us to have anyone else relationship but our own, I don't care if his mum can joke about her weight I can't and if he wants to be with me then he needs to stop telling me what he expects and to instead cater to our relationship because I am not going to stop being offended to let him feel like we are having the relationship he wants when I am feeling miserable about it.

I also want to add his family has toxic masculinity where the men are not meant to cry so he has been cold to me before when I cry because he 'doesn't like it' when I cry but we have been working on it for him to be more supportive and open, I have to break down a lot of walls to try and make him be himself and not want he was raised to be.",27Mar2020,1

I was staying with my now boyfriend for the past 6 weeks or so and only came home to see my mum and sister and grab clothes etc but they were always off with me and seemed hostile whenever I asked it’d either be an argument or theyd ignore it.
I was spiked 8 weeks ago and have had ongoing mental health problems and have been off work since this. My mum, fully aware and involved as she says she wants to be, tells me my life’s a loser due to not having any money says I’m 23 and my life’s shit and has worded like that too, I’ve got addiction problems, smokes cannabis daily and have used cocaine and alcohol to cope which she’s always told me I do. 

Today she locked me out because she thought I met a friend when I hadn’t, and it took her locking me out and me finding a way in to explain to her where I went.

774,"My best friend, or so I thought so, didn't invite me to her birthday party last weekend. I found out she had her other 2 friends over through one of her friend's posts online. This is not the first time they hung out without inviting me and of course I don't expect them to every time but it's been happening a lot more recently than it ever has. And they know I'm always free.

We haven't seen each other or spoken in a while and I always just chalked it down to her being busy/working a lot. But the last few months I have been getting vibes that her and her friends don't like me anymore, and I was right. She ended up actually sitting me down and telling me that she wasn't hanging out with me as much because of certain things I did, like make stupid jokes about her bf &amp; cat or not contributing money to the expensive things they wanna do.

About that: I'm a full-time student and the only one of my friends without a job. Nobody told me I had to pay up for anything before and I vividly remember them saying whosever idea it is they have to pay for it, so obviously I would never suggest an activity I couldn't pay for. Whenever I do bring over alcohol and food no one touches it. Now I always ask if she needs me to contribute money, every time she has said no thanks.
And my sense of humor is just shitty, idk why she's taking my jokes so personally/seriously. I thought we were close enough to where we can make the jokes where we talk shit you know? She's always telling me my dog is stupid but then when I make a joke about her cat or bf it's like she gets butthurt because her bf and cat ""keep her from killing herself and it hurts her feelings when I say bad things about them"". Okay whatever so I stopped joking like that around her. 

Ever since she had that talk with me things are just off. Idk what I'm still doing wrong. Maybe it's because I recently took up smoking weed and even though they all used to love weed now that I finally do I'm the only one who wants to smoke while they drink without even getting drunk even though they're ""so ready to get fucked up"". Or maybe it's because they're all getting on with their adult lives and I'm falling behind because I'm too terrified of the future.

Idk I'm just trying to figure out what to do. My only 3 other friends are just okay and one is my ex bf (I know I have no right to be picky rn). I don't want to just give up on our 10 year friendship. But I'm not feeling wanted by her anymore so I don't know if I should keep trying. I've lost 2 other best friends in my life for various reasons I know weren't entirely mine but I'm starting to wonder if it's just me and I'm actually just that unlikeable of a person.

783,"*Sorry for possibly bad english

So me and my friend met in 1st grade of highschool and we got along pretty well since the beggining. We could talk about anything, we were pretty similar in our mindsets and all basic happy stuff. But second year she became a liiitle bit more distanced on some days and I thought well maybe that's okay, that happens. But then she started being more and more quiet then the next day as if nothing had happened, all happy and such. This last month was probably the worst. Me and my other friend are aware that she thinks really low of herself and we often had conversations about how low school grades don't mean that you are stupid, or about basic looks. Also her family is also someone that wants her to be the greatest so that could also be one of main reasons. Before our schools got locked down because of the coronavirus, she wouldn't want to talk to us. We would sit together but would ignore me and my other friend. When I managed to talk to her she wanted to move avay so me and my other friend could sit together so that she doesn't bother is. I stopped her from that and we spent the rest of the day normally, happy. Days before I saw her google about toxic friendship. Now when our school is online I talked with her, short conversations tho, mostly because how hard and demanding online classes are. From what I figured, she spends her time to be the best at school now, that is okay but she is really putting her whole time into it, you probably know what I mean. Now she ignores me, first was my other friend. When us two wanted to help her anyhow with what could be bothering her she would brush it off.
Could it be that she probably feels low because grades of me and other friend are higher? Sounds kinda dumb asking it but you probably know what I'm saying.
Now she texts others and that's good, but she is ignoring us two.
I am questioning myself if it is me that probably did something bad that could anger her. This most likely is a falling friendship that's happening but I had to ask.
It just hurts me to think that way because she became really important in my life and it's hard for me to accept that she (most likely) wants nothing to do with me now.",27Mar2020,1

785,"**Context:**

* 26/M/US, graduating senior (May2020), studying hospitality at a large state university
* Was on father's HMO until I turned 26 (roughly 3 weeks ago), he is faculty at my school but is technically employed by the state due to the nature of his occupation. Sufficed to say, he has good healthcare.
* Thanks to the *timely occurrence of the lovely Covid-19*; I was recently laid-off from a paid internship I started in May of 2019. Initially, I had planned to assume a full time role with that firm after graduation and subsequently enroll in my own healthcare plan.
* Am prescribed medication for ADD/ADHD

**Situation:**

After 8 years of undergrad, spread across three different schools, and a myriad of *trials and tribulations*; I thought I had finally *figured out my life* and was ready to transition into my professional career. Since a pandemic is by far the greatest threat/disruption to my industry, the proverbial monkey wrench has been thrown into my plans with catastrophic results.

Due to my age demographic and self-proclaimed ""flawless"" immune system; I am not too frightened by the virus as it pertains to my health. However, due to the current state of affairs I feel that it would be in my best interest to have *some* healthcare as opposed to none. 

**-Disclaimer:** Please don't generalize me with the media's portrayal of millennials disregarding the gravity of this pandemic; I have been proficient in my social distancing and am obviously worried for the people who are/will be directly affected by the Coronavirus.

**Here are the options I'm looking at:**

**University Student Policy:**

**-Pros:**

* Prescription costs are covered
* Pro-rated just under $1000, my dad is willing to cover the cost as my graduation gift (he's joking...*I think lol*)

**-Cons:** Only covers me from now until the end of June -as of now I am unsure if things will have improved enough to warrant my return to my previous employer-

**Marketplace Healthcare Plan:**

**-Pros:** 

* Still have 40 days left to apply within the Special Enrollment Period
* Policy lasts the full year
* I *assume* prescription costs would be covered

**-Cons:** I imagine this will not be as cost-effective as the student plan

**COBRA/Obamacare/Medicare:**

Currently researching but am painfully still uninformed. 

**Here’s what I know:** I know they are not synonymous. I believe to qualify for medicare I need to have made &lt;$30k in the past year.  

**Lingering questions:** 

* Do Medicare and COBRA overlap in certain ways? Or not at all? 
* Are they separate programs that fall under the Obamacare “umbrella”?

**Endnote:** Hopefully I provided info that is sufficient and not extraneous. Based on my lack of knowledge on the subject matter, I would imagine the student policy may be the most cost-effective option but obviously it draws some cause for concern as I’m still paying a decent sum of money for only a small amount of time. Meanwhile it is still too hard to predict the status of the macroeconomic climate at the end of June. Simply looking for anyone to refute any and all fallacies in my assumptions as well as provide insights that I failed to address. Wishing all of you good health and safety amid the current chaos in our world. Thanks!

I went back for a Bar Mitzvah my Junior year of high school and I noticed him the moment he walked into the room. We sat next to each other throughout the service and talked for hours afterward. I went back to the state I was living in, and we started long distance. We visited each other a lot. Thanksgiving, Christmas break, his birthday, his prom, after he graduated, etc. Then, I moved back. We spent the summer together and then I ended things. He was going away to college and I was scared. I also wanted him to experience more than just me as I was his first girlfriend. We tried long distance on and off that year but it never stuck. Now, I live in Virginia and he is going to school in Wisconsin (we're from Missouri). He's my best friend. We talk almost everyday. We've discussed the idea of him moving wherever I am once he graduates, but that's still two years away. We know we should try long distance first and see if it sticks, but I think we are both scared. I hurt him. Badly. Multiple times. But I want him in my life. I've had a lot of experience for someone my age with romantic relationships and I know I don't want anyone else. I've been single since we broke up for good over a year ago. He has been too. We see each other everytime we're both visiting home and he's going to come stay with me this summer. I think he's the love of my life. But the distance was always so difficult. I think we've both grown up a lot, but it would be hard to be apart for 2 years minimum. I can't travel very often because of my work, and he doesn't work so he can't afford to come and see me a lot. He spends his breaks with his parents, and wouldn't be able to use them to see me. I still work over most breaks and don't have the option to take off. He also worries about his parents. Specifically his mom, who hates me because of my childhood behavior. He doesn't tell them we talk or see each other. I don't know.. Sorry this is so long. I just feel so lost. I want him so badly but I don't know if it's a good idea.",27Mar2020,1
791,"Okay, I’m 23 and on my own (currently in NJ) because of family issues so asking them for help is out of the question. It’s nothing petty because I know some people might suggest asking them but this is trauma and abuse related.

I have been lucky enough to move out and get a job that pays just enough for rent and some groceries and I cut it a little close with utilities but It was always ok. I was doing good on my own, except now this entire COVID situation is now making me fear that I’ll end up homeless. I have less than 2,000 in savings. I also am a full time student, my classes are online so school is okay. Everything else? Nope. 

I work at a retail store that was deemed essential but the hours are cut. We open later and close earlier. Everyone is getting two days a week and less than 8 hours.

Can I file for unemployment? I’ve been panicking and crying because I don’t have any family. Is there any government assistance that could help me right now? I don’t know if me having a job would prevent assistance but I am not making enough and bills are coming due. 

To be honest, I’d rather be homeless and ever talk to my family again. Are there programs or anything? I am really ignorant to all this stuff, I never imagined being in this situation.

795," **TL;DR:** Neighbour always plays loud music. In the breaks of the music struggling noises are heard. Met neighbour once, came off as incredibly creepy.

Hey all. I have what most people would class as their nightmare neighbour. All day and most of the night all he does is blast loud dance music, with the bass turned up to max. I have complained to the landlord twice about him (he never answers his door) and have also written to the council who never even bothered to look into it.

Unfortunately, moving out isn't an option and the loud music is ongoing to this day. I also believe this neighbour has stolen my bicycle in retaliation (joke is on him if he did, it was knackered) and clearly is quite aggressive in his behaviour as the music hasn't stopped.

Over the last few months, I have started to suspect that the music is being played to cover something up. Originally I just thought the guy was a dickhead, however there have been many occasions where it often sounds as if a dog is in distress (imagine the noises dogs would make in a fight), or a woman starts to shout. These are always followed by a slammed door. The noises are definitely coming from within his flat and not out in the corridor and only he lives in the flat.

I had heard these noises quite a few times and thought them to be strange, but I didn't know what they were so I never thought anything of it. I noticed that in the post there seemed to be letters arriving addressed to various women with the address of the flat which would then suddenly stop. Again, I thought maybe the guy had numerous relationships over the period so thought nothing of it.

What really made me think something was up with him was the first time I saw him. I had lived in this flat for about 5 months at this point and this was the first time I had seen him. I was coming up the stairs to go into my flat just as he had left his, and therefore he had to move out of the way to let me past. I instantly got a bad gut feeling about him. He didn't look anything like I had expected (I was expecting a chavvy sort, this guy was well dressed), but the way he just stood and stared put my back up. I passed him and into my flat but noticed that he didn't start to go down the stairs straight away and just lingered there until my door was closed. I haven't seen him since, but I have a terrible gut feeling about him. He seemed incredibly intense and seriously fucking weird, even though he didn't say anything.

What should I do? (if anything)",27Mar2020,1
796,"I was fired from my job a while ago due to a variety of non-Coronavirus related matters. I didn't tell my family and have been pretending to go to work each day while I spend that time looking for work. I normally spent my days at the library, but thanks to Covid-19 I can't anymore. Instead I told my family that my workplace closed for two weeks (that two weeks ends today). I can't continue my routine of heading to the library each day, as there's no where to go since businesses are still closed. 

I'm contemplating telling my family that work has been closed for another month, but they're sending me work to do at home. But I could also tell them that I've been laid off, but that will be difficult to sell as the law firm is rather successful. My job was pretty non-essential so it's not unlikely that I was let go. 

I'm working with a recruiter so its only a matter of time before I find another job, but with the coronavirus it's difficult to say if I'll find a job anytime soon. If I tell them I've been fired there is a 100% chance that I'll be sent back home to my parents (My family lives far away and I'm staying with my uncle and his son). It's possible that I'll get to stay here if I tell them I've been laid off for a short time as many people have been laid off, but there's no guarantee.

The date went exceptionally well and we hit it off right away. Today about a dozen dates later and also being quarantined together (we've been staying at her house, it's bigger and has enough space for her 3 cats and my dog).

This is where things get odd. After a hike a few weeks back I take her phone to set an alarm before bed, we know each others passcode, and I see she is messaging some guy (we'll call mark). While laying in bed I ask her about it and she is very open. Ann tells me that her and mark had gone a few dates in the past back in the UK, Mark asked her out before she moved back to the USA, but after coming back tells her that he wants to date multiple people (her and someone else). Ann tells me that she hated that idea so ended things with him, not only because of that, but that she did not like the way he treated her. I asked why they are still talking then and she goes on to tell me she's been meaning to have a conversation with him when she returns to the UK (it's been pushed back due to COVID). After all of that, she begins crying telling me: ""I really like what we (her and I) have, and I knew I would find some way to mess things up."" She then proceeded to tell me that she wanted to say ""I love you"" during our hike but was too afraid. I kinda just said ""well this is a pretty shitty time to say it"" I was pretty upset at the whole situation.

TL;DR Trying to get advice on what dog breed would be best suited for uni student lifestyle 


I thought this would be the best subreddit to post this in (if there’s a better one please suggest it). Basically, I’m a soon to be university student who’s going to be living off campus with a friend. I really, really wanted to get a dog sometime when I move out, once I’m situated and everything. I have a list of dog breeds I really adore, and I’ve done research on all of them, but I’m still not entirely sure which one would be best to get. 

For some more information: 

-I’m going to be living in an apartment or something of the sort, though I have no problem going on long walks, going to the park, etc, and the area I’m moving to has plenty of dog friendly places

-I currently have a medium(ish) sized parrot who’s often out of the cage (supervised), and the friend I’m going to be living with is planning on getting a cat

-I plan on getting the dog as a puppy, and doing so during the summer so I have a decent amount of time to start training, housebreaking, etc

-When I’m not at classes I’m usually home/I have a lot of spare time, so again; walks and exercise isn’t an issue

-I am going to be supporting myself. I know that I’ll have to put a decent amount of money on the side to properly care for a dog, but I’d still prefer one that doesn’t have a tendency for high vet bills, and grooming isn’t an issue - I know how to do it myself and have the time to do so, or I can easily budget to add monthly grooming fees

The list of dog breeds I love and want to choose from:

Great Dane 

Labradoodle

Newfoundland

German shepherd 

Bull terrier

Belgian malinois 

I would like to get a dog from this list. It doesn’t have to be a “perfect” match as I’m not brand new to owning dogs, and I’m ok in handling a bit of a challenge here and there. I just want to know which would the *best* option. That being said, I can still consider other breed suggestions, or mixed breeds


Note; please don’t tell be about adopting instead of buying. I’ve already decided that if I can’t decide on a dog breed/mix that I want, I’ll just adopt

Any other tips/suggestions would be very much appreciated",27Mar2020,1

803,"I’ve never done anything like this and I’m incredibly nervous.

For the past two weeks, my mom has put my family on quarantine. None of us were exposed to the coronavirus, and her decision contradicts what our state recommends, but I went with it to appease her since we’re going to be stuck together for a long time. 

Earlier today I mentioned how on Sunday, when quarantine should end as it’s been 2 weeks, I was planning on seeing my boyfriend. She said that no I wasn’t going to, and I said I was. I’m going to have a conversation with her and my dad about me leaving the house, but I’m worried it’ll end with them once again not letting me out.

I’m pissed because my understanding was that we were quarantining for 2 weeks and then we would be allowed out. I simply want to see my boyfriend who has been practicing social distancing. I am beyond upset.

I’ve hit the point where I’m considering either sneaking out of the house at night and returning before anyone sees in the morning, or just walking out the door Sunday morning and coming back that night. Sneaking out means I could maybe get away with it, but there’s always a risk. 

I know doing either thing has the potential for big consequences, but I am at the end of my rope. I don’t know what to do. I’ve never snuck out or rebelled like this. My mom is historically over controlling, and both my parents have bad tempers.

TLDR: I want to sneak out to see my boyfriend or just walk out of my house and take the punishment. I need advice on the best decision to make (should I stay or should I go).",27Mar2020,1

806,"Hello this is my first post and I’m just stressed, writing on mobile and have no one to turn to. Hope it also is in the right sub, I don’t really know were to post in that case. 

My family is my mom my little sister me (16 f from Sweden) and my dad. My mom and dad are now separated, in my opinion they were both bad in their own way. According to dad she stressed him on, making him aggressive (just words, he never laid a hand on us and exploding in rage on small things). They separated when I was about 6-8 I don’t know. When they separated he went to a therapist and got meds, he was also diagnosed with some disorder such as anxiety (don’t remember) due to mom being so harsh. Now my mom hasn’t really done anything to fix her past and just adds boyfriend after boyfriend, 4-6 (I don’t know) since mom and dads breakup. They have all been bad. My dad on the other hand has done well and even gotten a fiancé I like. She is kind and has known dad when they were young, we also knew her before and we have never been bother by their private life. But back to my mom. Her boyfriends are usually very trashy, one was even a nazi but I was to stupid to get that. I even designed a tattoo to him a few years back. When mom brings a new toy from the garbage she introduced them by telling us about their good things, such as: they have a dog or they have a cabin. So if she states something good about them: they’re now my new step dad. I could write a single book for each the scumbags but we’ll stick to the worst. Laughed at my sister when she cried in her room, touched us a bit to much. Made my mom smoke more and get absolutely wasted in front of us (we were 11 and 12 and had never seen her that way). The absolute worst was the 2 she had sex with in front of us. One was from my sister who might’ve lied but I do trust her in this. And the second was the nazi who she wasn’t quiet with. Endless nights without sleep just to hear them have fun and him complementing how she looked. When we were 12-13. They all feed us lies about getting this pet and going camping in the north. One time I was in a Skype call with my friend and I could hear her getting a pounding, I didn’t want her to hear that so I interrupted them saying “hey stop that I’m in a call” they were denying it but I went back to my call. My mom comes in and lectures me on how I embarrass her and how it shouldn’t matter since I’m in my room all day. I was in my room more and more because of her and him. I was almost suicidal due to it and even tied a shoelace to choke myself to death with if I stepped to far. Dramatic I know but I didn’t know what was right. I’m writing this post since she had brought in another one after a 3 year break and my friends aren’t there to help. I don’t want to involve my dad since I don’t know how he’ll react being 4 hours away and not being able to come to us. I know it isn’t my friends  responsibility for me to feel good but I can’t go to a therapist. I was sent to a school counselor one time for telling my friend that I got raped ones but I wasn’t effected by it even though it was 3 years ago at that point (it wasn’t bragging since she was telling her experience with something similar and I meant it as a way to say it gets better). My parents got involved even though I said I was fine. It tore my healed wound up and now I can’t forget something I wouldn’t have remembered today if I hadn’t been told on. So I can’t trust them since they’ll send it to my parents and I’ll get yelled at by my mom. My little sister talked to me about seeing a therapist since I have some social anxiety (I don’t know since I’m afraid to go to get a diagnose, but you get the gist of it) and I said maybe. She told mom and she was so mad that both her kids might be broken. But I denied it since she was so mad about it and she can’t handle people with problems such as my dad. So I’m sitting in my room with my two cats, since the new guy has a dog, they can’t get food or water since the dog eats it up. It was planned for spring break that I would visit my dad but since the corona virus is making so that trains randomly don’t go and busses as well. I feel so alone now. My sister isn’t bothered by the new boyfriend. The first time he was here he and mom was going at it after 2am and finished in 3am at night, while playing metal loudly. I slept for 2 hours that night and went to a friends house the next morning, but all the friends I try to tell that I’m not feeling well isn’t responding like they care. I should be thankful that I can have someone. But I might need to have a internet friend to write to in times like this since all my friends are bus. I know I shouldn’t beg but still I feel like I need to find someone to talk to that can maybe understand. Or I need to find a way to contact a therapist who won’t tell my parents and that I can trust. I forgot to explain my problem with mom getting boyfriends, except the things I’ve already told. I can’t stand her giving this trashy dude the title of my step dad or as a replacement for my dad. It feels childish but it has never felt right.

A few days ago, we got into a big argument. Basically, us and 2 college close friends have been working on a video game project together, but when I mentionned the fact that he was actually the only one not working on the project, he flipped on all of us (go see my AITA post for more context). 

Right after the argument, he dm'ed me, saying he's very depressed. Thing is, as said above, I've dated him, and I can tell you, he's a hella manipulator and will flip any situation to make himself the victim. 

Short example : when we just started dating, I noticed he never brushed his teeth. Disgusting right ? When I told him, he accused me of being insensitive because what I said was very hurtful, and that he was disapointed at how superficial I was. .... Yup. Yes I stayed. Yes I was an enourmous idiot. Hi had no self esteem and thought I'd never have better.

Ok moving on : so as I said, after the fight, he told me he was depressed. I told him his emotionnal guilt tripping was not working anymore. He flipped again and said something like "" I can tell the others about stuff you don't want them to know, and trust me I don't wanna get there"". He then mentionned times when I badmouthed my friends in their backs (which are not made up, I did it), a specific time where a was very very rude to a friend about a bad situation in her life, another time where I reacted very stupidly towards my friends after a difficult moment, and all the times where i'd get drunk at parties and start to cry and pour out my insecurities to people. He essentialy threatened to paint the worst image of me to our friends circle basically. I said I wasn't affraid and told him to fuck off my life, then blocked him.

After 2 days I unblocked him on discord, because we have a group chat with our friends and us not being able to see each other's messages could have an impact on the group dynamic, so I unblocked him and apologizes for not thinking it through before. 

So tonight, I told an anecdote about when I touched something in a museum, not knowing it was authentic, and saying it's ""a bad thing I've done in my life"". He then answered ""Oh so that's what you call ""a bad thing I've done"" ?"". Yes, blatant passive aggressive behaviour, I know him too well. 

Now, I'm posting this here because I'd like advice as to how to handle this. I want to block him again, get him out for good but I can't just throw him out of our group discussion. I don't want our personnal matters to affect his relationship with the others. I'm not very affraid of him actually releasing the ""shameful stuff"" on our group chat, because most of those are know already, and I know I did shitty stuff and I'm ready to pay the fair price for it if my friends are going to be mad about it. But I just... Don't want to hear from him anymore !! I want to block him but feel like I can't !! So I just ignored him until tonight where he really annoyed me. What would you do ?",27Mar2020,1
810,"my mom is a bipolar alcoholic with a history of anger issues associated with her manic episodes. she is a stay at home mom and has been using medical marijuana for 3 years now (probably smokes 2 grams a day and about 100mg in edibles). she recently started giving 3 of my brothers (20,17,15) doses of thc gummies after cbd oil helped my 17 y/o brother calm down at school. He has autism with intense meltdowns. The other two also have behavioral and mental health trouble including developmental delays and violent behavior. My other brother and I who are older are home for quarantine and have discovered she gives them each close to 50mg edibles a day as early as noon on non school days, which thanks to COVID is now several months. My 3 younger brothers all wake up at 10ish, watch tv until the afternoon when my mom wakes up, she doses them out and then she spends the rest of the day smoking outside. They have all gained weight from this and have stopped walking the dogs, eating before getting high and then binge eating, cleaning up after themselves, and showering. My brother with autism routinely breaks down crying a couple hours in, and they all seems to hit the high where they cannot function for several hours. My dad says it’s fine as long as they are safe and not bothering him. If my mom is out of edibles or tells them not today because she is low, they will all have a several hour meltdown and demand a higher dose next time.

I asked why not something else as a “reward” and she said it’s their medicine.

818,"Apologies in advance, it is my first time posting on reddit. 

Currently I(20F) am in my last year of university doing English Language and Literature degree. I love literature, I love to read and I love to write. I would love to be a writer one day, I have plans to volunteer in a local library and maybe even a museum later. I love books and I love to study about them. But I hate university, since the first year nothing related to university went as planned. I worked a full-time job too much and studied a lot so by the end of my first year I was exhausted, I wouldn't go out, I was always tired and sleepy. The second year I worked less (part-time now) but due to an ugly breakup and health reasons university went down on my priority list, I failed one subject and had to retake it, only to fail again with only 10% higher mark. This year, the third year started out so good, I prepared for the lessons, I attended the lessons, I did my assignments but at some point I just cracked. I have no strength to go on anymore, it's like being at uni drains life out of me. 

My mother knew about it, and today we had this conversation for the nth time, and I think she just realised I was serious about not finishing university. She herself went to uni, but after first year she dropped out, she worked in as a cleaner for majority of her life, and blames her not finishing university for it. When I said it to her today she begged me not to tell other family, my grandma and my close friends, she said she finds it shameful and that I will end up like her - I know money is tight for us but I don't think any honest job is shameful. 

Im lost, I don't know how to apply myself, I'm just a 20, I love stories and everything related to books, I have no idea what my life will be like. And now I have this panic that I need to have a degree or my life will be worth nothing. It's to the point where I feel like suicide is better than no qualifications. 

I am so hurt that my mother feels to ashamed of me she rather lie to grandma about my life and my achievements and failures, I remember how proud I was in the beginning thinking I will be the first in my family ever to have a degree. I feel like a failure, who let their family, their mother down. I am so lost and have been for the last 3 years, I don't know what to do. Any piece of advice will be welcomed.",27Mar2020,1

827,"So where should I start? A good friend of mine recently got a new girlfriend. I barely know her, maybe 1-2 Months. I’m looking to move closer to the place I study at. She is looking to move out at home too. Last week I got a message from my mate who told me that she asked him, wether I found a place yet, wether I’m looking for one for myself, wether I would mind if she moved in with me. Not giving it too many thoughts I said yeah why not. Then a day after I started breaking my mind over it. First off, my mate has turned increasingly obnoxious in the past few months. He’s constantly needing attention, is socially incompetent, doesn’t know when it’s enough. Yells in public like a moron and even in buildings, I highly suspect him coming around daily, turning his music on and being a nuisance. On the other hand he holds me big in regards, his family knows me well too. And he’s a nice guy in general. Maybe it’s just a phase idk?

She seems to be rather relaxed, but what do I even know about her?

Here’s the thing, when she asked him, he said that she could trust me blindly without hesitation. Behind her back tho he told me “not to dare start anything with her” I’m not even remotely interested in her, and I’m not a douchebag. 

So couple days later I talked with her a bit, asking if she’s even sure about the whole situation, she answered that she was and she gave it a lot of thought, and that she looked for people to move in with before but barely knew them and that I was the only guy she’d trust. (Weird right? but the only thing I could think of is that my mate must have talked a lot about me, which I’m assuming judging by his family saying how he was always talking about me)

On one side I need to move out of my current living situation as it’s turning me mental, but on the other is this cloud  of uncertainty. 

I could ruin some friendships, but saying no or declining now is just as much of a bad taste for everyone involved.

839,"This is going to be a very long post, so bear with me and please stick around until the end. I have actual questions that I really need help with, but there is a lot of backstory that I need to explain first. I will try my best to make it as comprehensive and unbiased as possible. Im sorry for my formatting, I’ll try my best to make this as easy to understand as possible. 

A few months ago, I met my boyfriend (29M) on Tinder. No red flags or anything, things went well, and we are now in a very serious relationship. I turned 18 in December, by the way. Now, I want to get this out of the way before I continue - my boyfriend and I have an amazing relationship. There is no sort of grooming or abusive behavior going on in any capacity here. I have never been forced to do anything I don’t want to, sexually or in general - he doesn’t give me drugs or alcohol or money for sex or something weird like that. I have told a lot of trusted adults and people my age in my life about him and no one has been concerned about me or him. I am not asking for advice about him and I, and while I realize the age difference can be jarring (especially to my parents), it isn’t the focus of the post. 

Now, back to the story. I have been sleeping over at his house on the weekends and telling my parents I’m at my best friend’s house. I want to clarify that, from the beginning, I felt absolutely terrible about lying to them, and my boyfriend was upset knowing I was lying to them too. However, because I am 18, I felt as if I had a right to be wherever I want to be as long as I am being safe. I know that I do not have a right to lie to my parents, and I shouldn’t have done that, but I didn’t do anything illegal or wrong by staying at my boyfriend’s house. And, honestly, we’re pretty boring, we stay in, cuddle, play with his dog, watch movies or tv, eat, and stay up until 5 am talking about religion, politics, life, anything and everything. Yes, we do have sex, but we are very safe and careful and I have never had an issue of any sort with this. 

However, I slept over Saturday March 7th. My mom was out of town for work and I told my dad I was at my friend’s house. My location on my phone was off. The next morning, at like 8 am, my dad knocks on my boyfriends door. (Neither of us have any idea how he knows where my boyfriend lives - I have been over several times that they know about, so maybe they looked at my location then and saved where I was at; or they tracked the car, or looked his address up). My dad is obviously pissed off, and takes my phone before we leave. 

We get home, and he says he doesn’t want to talk. He keeps my phone, and locks me in my room. I’m very upset and I can’t stop crying (honestly, I was just mostly embarrassed he showed up at the house instead of just yelling at me when I got home, and I was super tired too and didn’t really process what was happening). I message my boyfriend from my laptop (my dad saw these messages on my phone in real time) and tell him that I’m okay, etc. Later, my dad and I talk, and he’s pissed off that I lied, and that my location was off. He refuses to give me my phone back, fair, he pays for it. He keeps me locked in my room. This goes on for a few days, I go to school then straight home. He was messaging all of my friends on my phone just pretending to be me. I assume he’s going through everything, which I don’t really mind - there is absolutely nothing illegal on here, and I haven’t done anything to get myself in trouble. However, I had plenty of nudes on my phone and sexts saved between my boyfriend and I, so obviously I’m pretty upset over him seeing all of that. 

My mom gets back on Wednesday (11th). He takes the lock off my door. I told her about it, and he denied it. 

Anyways, my mom ignored me until later that night when she was ready to talk. They’ve seen everything on my phone and know that I’ve spent a lot of time with my boyfriend. I tell her the truth about everything. I apologize to her - I really do feel bad about lying about where I was and know I was in the wrong there; but being sexually active or in a relationship isn’t morally wrong or illegal (my parents are not religious no premarital sex type people). There are so many minors that do this exact same thing, and my mom did this too when she was 16, she told me stories about getting caught. The only difference here is that I am actually 18 and I believe I have a right to be doing so. However, she calls me a lot of hurtful names and insults me a lot. It’s okay, she’s mad, I don’t blame her. 

My dad shows me that he has taken pictures of my nudes and my sexts on my phone and they are all on his phone and my mom’s phone. I had warned him that Sunday that if he looks through my phone, he will see private things that no parent should see about their kid, and I am very hurt and feel very violated that these things are now on their phones as “evidence”. 

Over this time, I am making plans (from my laptop) to buy my own phone, car, and move out, because I was really scared for my safety after being locked in my room. 

They keep my phone for the next few days. I keep trying to discuss things with them - hey, do you want to discuss things? hey, what can I do to help? They ignore me, but act snarky in whatever ways they can, relating to the most random things but it’s clear that it’s just anger from everything. I forget when, but eventually, we all sit down and talk. It starts out okay, but goes badly. They accuse my boyfriend of grooming me, pimping me out, forcing me to make porn for money, and crazy things like that. I had made jokes about selling nudes for money and they had seen that conversation between me and my friends on my phone; and they are absolutely convinced that I am somehow stuck being pimped out by my boyfriend or my friends. 

My dad reveals to me that he called the police about my nudes (none were taken before I turned 18). He asked them to check if they were leaked or posted online by my boyfriend or friends or something. It’s sheer insanity and I feel so violated over that and him in possession of these things. 

I get my phone a little bit after that, but I go through so much verbal abuse, belittlement, and manipulation, and have been dealing with this ever since. I can give details and examples of this if necessary, it’s just a lot and this post is long enough anyways. I’ve been called a slut, bitch, whore, liar (which is fair I guess), been yelled at and been physically cornered to where I was backed up against a table so hard that it bruised my leg, had my arm grabbed and scratched, and intimidated. 

Now, because of Corona, I am stuck inside my house. No school, no work, everything is closed. My parents won’t let me see my boyfriend but they let my brother’s girlfriend come over so it is clear that it has nothing to do with Corona or quarantining but all about punishing me and my boyfriend. They did let me see him one time, this Monday, ONLY IN A PARKING LOT, before my state’s shutdown went in effect, because they knew I was really agitated and upset over everything. 

I want to move out. I can afford to do so, and my boyfriend is willing to let me stay with him. My parents will continue to keep me grounded after the quarantine is over; and they will continue to emotionally abuse and manipulate me. 

However, after all this, they are my parents and I still love them. 

Finally, this is what I want advice on - how do I tell them I’m moving out? How can I do this gracefully and as simple as possible, without hurting them? How can I do my part in trying to maintain our relationship? 

I want to leave so that we can have dinners together and go on outings; but have our own space to maintain healthy distance and space for our own mental health. I really don’t know what to do. I don’t want to lose them but I absolutely cannot live in this environment anymore. 

Thank you!

Hey all. I could really use some advice for the situation i’m in... I’m a 20F and looking to become a sex worker (nothing physical). I know it would help bring in money especially during this time, I’m out of work because of COVID-19 and my state is currently shut down. I also have a kid to support. The only thing that’s holding me back from actually doing it is the conversation I’d have to have with my bf.. He’s very loving, caring, and supportive. And he’s usually very understanding. But even thinking about talking about it with him gives me anxiety. I’m very nervous for how he’d respond/react. I’m not expecting him to just shut down the idea, but I’m very scared that he will. I’d understand if it makes him uncomfortable, I respect him as my partner so if he were to tell me he wasn’t comfortable, I don’t think I could do it. But this would also be a good way for me to bring in money at the moment. If anyone has any advice on how to bring up the conversation.. or some talking points? Some of the positives of being a sex worker that I could point out to him.. anything will help. thank you",27Mar2020,1

851,"Hey! I need help identifying if this could possibly be coronavirus. My mom is 50, she has asthma, kind of severe I'd say. Like 4 days ago her throat stared to hurt viciously, she had been coughing ever since. It's a very dry cough and constant too. She lost her voice almost completely and she had a fever one night (37.2 degrees, very mild but I guess it can still be considered a fever?). My country has 600 cases of coronavirus and my town has none. Testing isn't really an option since the hospital where they do tests is far away and she refuses to go anyway claiming she'll be fine.

852,"Someone I used to work with and am Facebook friends with has posted on Instagram that she's been to (or maybe still is in) North Wales. 

It's beautiful here right now, blue skies and warm days: perfect spring adventure weather. I'm itching to get out climbing and hiking as I've just moved much closer to North Wales myself.

The UK is in lockdown to flatten the COVID-19 curve. It sucks but we're all having to deal with it. Working from home or furloughed unless essential workers, can leave the house once per day for exercise or essentials like food and medicines. No travelling outside your local area except where essential. No access to countryside areas unless you already live there.

We have to stick with this because the sooner these measures work and we can stop hospitals being overwhelmed, the sooner we can all go back to living our lives. I'm bored, I'm lonely, I'm putting weight on from inactivity and stress eating, I want to go climbing. I know I can't and am dealing with it.

I want to say something to this person - selfishness like this is leading to the spread of this virus to isolated rural regions that do not have the facilities to cope with it. The entire county that snowdonia national park mostly sits in has ten ITU beds. Ten. Add to that mountain rescue volunteers often have NHS day jobs, and risking calling them out is selfish and can take them away from someone who really needs them. 

Would you say something? Or would you just leave it? It's really pissed me off but I'm a bad judge of a lot of situations (suspected ASD) and I don't know if it's appropriate or not.

He’s super nice, and I know that he’d let me down easy if he’s not interested, but I’m super worried that things would be awkward. We’re two in a bigger group, and it would be awful if he told them after rejecting me. I haven’t had an S.O yet, and all of my friends (including him) have, so I have zero confidence or experience in the matter. Does anyone have advice on how I could go about asking him out, if at all?

However, my walls are thin so I can't sing in my bedroom, and I have to sing loudly to hit certain notes!

 If I go outside I might disrupt the neighbours and the sound quality would be awful, I can't go in my closet because I use it for storage space and it's absolutely packed. Even if I went downstairs whilst my family were asleep, they could still probably hear me as my house is quite small. I also don't have a car.

What else can I even do? Should I just maybe put it off until I can move out or something? 

Many people are probably going to say that I shouldn't be shy and just sing as loud as I want, but if I sing loudly someone in my house usually tells me to shut up, and I also can't help but get embarrassed when I go all out anyways.",27Mar2020,1
855,"DISCLAIMER: Before you read, keep in mind that this isn't the only time they have been manipulative. In the past, many times, they have always been able to push my buttons during an argument that was all their fault and somehow deny it and make ME the one to apologize. Onto the story. 

I think last week, I ended our relationship. I realized how bad of a person they are.  Here's how it ended. They were talking about how they get mad sometimes and punch holes into their wall. So I thought, ""Okay. Maybe I can tell them my problems and we can have a talk on how to deal with each others emotions. Because that's what friends are for. Getting over bad emotions."" So I told them my biggest fear. Being a bad person. I talked about how a lot of times I wonder if I am worthy of being successful or loved, because I believe that a lot of times, bad people get punished for their actions, and don't deserve much compassion. And if I try to figure out if i'm a bad person my brain chooses sides and I panic all over again. And after I told them, I was expecting a bit of understanding or advice, but their response was actually ""Omg quit i'm the only one who is like this"" and ""Sometimes you are a bad person"" and stuff like that. I started crying and blocked them. But before I did I saw something else about it being someones fault. A few minutes later I got a text from my other friend screaming ""ARE YOU OKAY? PLEASE BE OKAY"" so I said i'm fine and asked whats going on. So I checked ex friends Youtube and they thought I had committed suicide or something I commented on how i'm fine and how I just couldn't go on with them anymore. Because if someone TELLS YOU their BIGGEST FEAR you can't just reflect it back and AGREE with it. And that would be the last i'd talk. NOPE. The next day later they posted another video which is now deleted (But my sister saved it) about ""A long 15 minutes of crying"" (I had been crying since the day before) and how blocking them was NOT a good thing to do because ""First of all, anxiety."" and how ""I don't know WHAT I did wrong."" and that they were just ""Being their self"" (Which, if that's YOURSELF then I don't wanna be apart of that.) Then they said that ""I'm probably just gonna quit youtube all together"" and said ""Heartstruck"" multiple times all while it looked as if they were holding back fake tears. And that I need a reality check or something. They also said that i'm high if I don't think I have a good life. Which I actually don't. My mom is financially in danger, and my sister has meltdowns about how she hates being in a cramped house of 5 and want's to live her own life. I told my friend about how my ex friend is being manipulative AGAIN and she went NUTS. She commented on her video about how she is making everything worse and telling the REAL story. But ex friend quickly deleted the comments to hide them. We're not in school right now, and it might close for the rest of the year due to COVID-19 but at the moment, ex friend is posting around like ""You won't hold me back, stop making your friends spam me"" Which I NEVER DID. At this point I can't tell if i'm an asshole or not, but I can't fight back. Everyone else is on her side. And I don't even wan't to fight back. I don't want to make things worse.

860,"Okay Reddit, I am going to preface this saying I know not everyone will agree with why I plan to do this but here is the quick backstory. My HOA board closed my small community pool and gym today because of COVID. Everyone who went followed all social distancing guidelines and were very good about wiping down equipment and sanitizing. There were never more than 10 people there at a time and much farther than 6 ft away. Anyways, they said they were going to follow local public policy and cdc guidelines none of which say this is the action they should have taken. Myself and many others are upset and they basically caved to a few people complaining it was open. I don’t want this to turn into an argument but wanted to give a quick backstory. Let’s focus on best ways to piss off an HOA.

TL;DR- HOA closed pool and gym with very little reasoning, I want revenge within the rules.

Here is what I have so far:

1) tan in my driveway in speedo blasting music and hosing myself down.

2) wash truck in driveway in speedo blasting cherry pie.

3) tan in lawn chair on sidewalk right outside pool gate and constantly mist myself down with one of those misting fans...in speedo of course.

She's the best and although is upset about it (like myself), understands the risks and why I made the decision I did. Thinking about this now though, how long is this going to last?

871,"Hello everyone :)

I'm using a throwaway account for this since my other half is aware of my Reddit username. To put things into context, I'm a 21F in a straight relationship with a 24M - and therein lies the problem - I don't think I'm straight.

I'm a very shy female, and I always have been. My first ever relationship was when I was 15, with an 18 year old male, and to put things simply it was the thing farthest from a kind and loving relationship. A lot of my trust was betrayed at such a young age, and I guess that's kind of snowballed into all of my relationships since then. I currently have weekly counselling sessions for depression, anxiety, and PTSD, so generally, I'm just a mess of a person for someone to be with.

Now, I haven't had many. The guy I'm currently with is my fourth ever relationship, and also my longest. We've been together for just over a year. He's kind, understanding, patient...and also very, *very* horny. A lot of you would think that is a good thing, but as someone who doesn't like to be touched a lot, much less in a sexual manner, it is very emotionally draining. And before you say it; Yes, I have spoken to him about this. He seems to get it when the conversation is happening, but then things just go back to how they always are.

I know some of you are probably wondering what this has to do with me questioning my sexuality, but I'll get to that at some point. I'm trying to make this as short and sweet as possible but there's so much I feel like I need to touch on.

I feel like I fail at the role of his girlfriend more times than I succeed. We live two and a half hours away, so whenever we do see each other, he's obviously very riled up and wants that release. But that's pretty much all the visit consists of if I don't give in on the first night. If he doesn't get his sex, then the rest of his trip is him *thinking* about it, which obviously affects the way he acts around me. I feel bad when I don't give him what he wants, but how do I force myself to be 'in the mood' when I'm not? 

If I've just gotten out of the shower and I'm changing into my pyjamas, he's straight off the bed and all over me. If I'm trying to get ready and do my hair or makeup, he's all over me. If I'm trying to sleep after a long day, he's all over me. At first, it was sweet. It made me feel desirable because he'd admire me and kiss me and tell me that I'm beautiful. But now it consists of him trying to push me back onto the bed, rather roughly, to try and initiate something. Bearing in mind I'm shorter than 5'4"" and he's just over 6'0"", so it's not exactly an easy thing for me to get out of unless I'm very stern with him, which I struggle doing because I'm generally mute and soft-spoken. It consists of him touching me when I don't want to be touched, just because I'm naked. It consists of him making constant sexual jokes that just make me feel uncomfortable rather than make me laugh.

There have been times where he's tried to do something whilst I've been asleep. I woke up to him in between my legs at one point, fully prepared to enter me, and I cried myself to sleep that night because it brought back a lot of traumatic events that he knows about. One night, I pretended to be asleep just to see what he does. I 'fell asleep' with my hand on his stomach, and he moved my hand down to touch himself, and essentially use my hand to jerk off. In the morning he told me I grabbed it in my sleep. I was too scared to tell him that I knew he was lying.

For the longest time, I just thought I wasn't that into sex. The severity of his sex drive and his refusal to listen to me has caused me to lose any kind of physical attraction I have to him, and *I* feel bad for it. I feel horrible, actually, because aside from that he is a kind guy with a heart of gold. But I just can't keep up.

On top of that, I've been having a lot of problems with my sexuality. I've always been interested in both men and women, and I've had experiences with both. But I just feel so much safer with women than I do with men, and I think my sexuality might stem further than me just being bisexual. How do I even begin to explain that to someone I've claimed to love for the past year? At the start, I was convinced I was in love with him, but now I'm not so sure. I just don't feel safe, but at the same time, I don't want to be the reason someone's heart is breaking.

Please help me Reddit. I'm sorry for the length, but I have nobody IRL I can talk to about this. It's just been stewing for the longest time and I don't want to cry myself to sleep anymore. I just want to be happy and comfortable. Any advice is welcome.

TLDR; My current boyfriend is very sexually demanding and sexually aggressive and refuses to listen, and I'm the opposite. I also might be gay.",27Mar2020,1
872,"Long story cut short, my dad is a cunt. He's caused me severe anxiety, depression, has given me panic attacks, low self esteem, made me essentially hate myself. A year of therapy and a (fuck knows how) strong sense of will (I'm thankful that I have this), I got better. But I now just have a ridiculous amount of anger.

I really hate my dad. He's a selfish, childish, humiliating man to be around. He talks literal shit to other people, he's wasted thousands upon thousands of pounds on unfinished cars, he stopped buying groceries to save money (for his fucking cars), he's wasted a special savings his mother gave my mom (11k on a garage that isn't even finished), he couldn't even pay for my brother's wedding (cultural thing. He said he'd pay for everything in front of everyone else, but he fucking didn't). He degrades me all the time. 

He does dumb shit all the fucking time. For example, my younger siblings are watching the telly. I came down to see what they're watching. My cunt of a father was there and he asked me to make him food. After being a dickhead - earlier today I waited 1:30 hours for my mom's prescription at the chemist, and was supposed to do a spot of shopping (milk and bread) but the queue was too long and I was exhausted from waiting so I went home (we have enough for two days). So at home I checked if we could possibly do home delivery or pick up a slot... Knowing that it was probably gonna be impossible anytime soon, but all the slots were completely gone. And I was amazed and said the same out loud. And his reaction:

""Well I told you that but you never listen to me anyway."" like why does he feel the need to fucking say that?

Which reminds me. I left a job before the virus became a pandemic (with potential stuff lined up that may fall thru but that's a different stress). Whilst in the job, I was coming home very upset and stressed.

And he'd tell me to do stupid shit at work that was just a big no. And then he'd say ""I'm trying to help you but you just don't listen"". Like what??

875,"I'm an unemployed senior staying at a college that has been shut down due to the Coronavirus.  All classes are now online and residency halls are sending anyone who can go home, must.  I was approved to stay at my dorm, but not until after I had moved a lot of my stuff over to my friend's (Friend A) place.  I don't have very much money left over and will just be surviving on any potential refund I get from taxes (which I'm filing pretty late, I know) and from my dorm room (if I choose to leave).  I also plan to apply for the government checks (I did work for most of last year). 

I've had two friends (A and B) reach out and offer me a place to stay.  I chose to stay at Friend A's for the time being because it was easier to move my stuff in there.  I have only just found out yesterday that I could stay in my dorm, but nobody knows how much the refund is yet.  Now I'm at an impasse.

I guess my options are as follows.

1. Stay where I'm at.  I've moved most of my stuff into my friend's place, I can take someone's room who is not coming back (though this has made living space right now difficult as they still have their stuff here).  Rent is a little high, but I can make the first few month's payments with my refunds and aid.  
2. Move back to my dormitory.  I don't know what the refund is going to look like, moving my stuff back is incredibly easy (I don't have a lot and my residency hall is just down the road).  At the end of semester move into Friend B's place as that was our plan for the summer. No school refund though.
3. Move to Friend B's place.  The rent is cheaper, there's more certainty with living space, and it makes the summer transition easier.  Living in with them for the first few weeks (until mid-may) will be difficult as there are a lot of roommates (too many probably).

So it started back in December he started ignoring me and avoiding me this frankly wanted to make me die and this lasted for a couple of before I confronted him about it. He said that due to the why I behaved during when he was in a relationship (he was and she was 13 and so told him that’s kinda weird and I don’t want to be  friends with him if leads him into trouble. They broke up and he told me I had nothing to do with it. I felt guilty and worked out my feelings with another friend. I never brought it up with him again because I didn’t want to cause drama) and that I never apologized for my behavior and I didn’t seem guilty about it and due to this he was ending our friendship. I told him I was sorry but had worked my feelings about this whole thing with another friend. Eventually I sent him a long letter over Snapchat that basically said what you did to me wasn’t okay, by acting like a child and ignoring the issue you made it worse as I would’ve apologized on the spot if I realized you felt like you needed one, you used my worse fear (abandonment and isolation) against me and I know you know because we talk about it all the time, and you made me want to die. I also told him to reach out to me as I need space and time to think but I would still treat him normally at group functions and dnd. Every time I see him I get start shaking because and overwhelming sense of complete panic because of how he made me feel and that this isn’t the first time he has abandon me. 
Slowly our mutual friends started pulling away from me and then it hit me. He was talking about it with them. So I let my side of the story out and a few sided with me but most of them sided with him (he’s kinda popular and everyone knows him) this cause major issues with my mental health, I had a break down and started seeing a therapist and I was diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression (unfortunately my sessions have been canceled for the foreseeable future due to the virus) Also I got major trust issues with my remaining friends and I’m still trying to work through it. 
Fast word today. I was play video games and he texted me this: 
“Hey OP so this is a message to let you know that I will no longer be DMing a game with you in it. I know for a fact that what has come between us will inevitably seep into the game and I don’t want to put the time and effort into being a DM for someone that frankly I don’t like.” 

I get it is his choice but he has isolated me, caused me to have major trust issues, and I’ve told him I’m willing to behave like an adult. I don’t know what to do. To make things clearly I haven’t responded to him yet but from the few commutations that we’ve had I’ve told him I’m willing to behave like an adult and I’m not going one to cause trouble. I need help with what to respond to with and how to handle dealing with him from now on. I don’t have to go back to high school with him until April and I don’t see him much but I just need help.",27Mar2020,1
881,"So i have a couple of close friends, we do stuff and theyre nice, but lately one of the friends has sorta drifted, and i started to feel more alone, so my idea was that id meet new people, and it feels like it goes good at first, but sooner or later they end up ghosting me and i feel bad for even going out of my way to build connections if this is what happens.

How do i sorta build connections without it feeling like work? And how do i avoid getting ghosted?",27Mar2020,1
882,"So I never gave my old job, Home Depot, my bank info. So they issued me a credit card form Bank of America. I thought I put the card in a safe place but now I can't find it. I've called my Home Depot's Human Resources twice this week and left messages. I also called Bank of America and waited an hour for someone to take my call,  no one ever answered.  

I'm currently a substitute teacher  in NC. Since I dont earn a living wage my mom helps me financially. She is also helping me file for unemployment. Which needs, according to my mom, the exact start and end dates of my jobs. I do not know the exact start date for Home Depot. 

In even without the Coronavirus I would be reluctant to ask my friends for help.  If I do is there anyway to set up a Go Fund Me page without seeming selfish? Am I wrong to think my mom is being unreasonable?

Any advice is welcomed

885,"Bit of a rant ahead

The self isolation is really getting to me. Every flip of a coin I'm starting to question things I did that were tough decisions especially a recent class and how I'm handling the situation.

I'm part of a group in charge of making sure everything is running well in a comic class and we are very far behind. Not many followed the rules/guidelines, ive started bringing up things to make them aware of whats going on. Sometimes this involves calling someome out, never by name but more like ""the hands on this page werent drawn (multiple people assigned to that) because of that the inkers will be forced to do a lot more work and if we leave holes in the inking the flatters will be forced to do more work"" I was a part of the concept art team for the project and put in hours of work that no one used. I feel like shit for calling some people out and I sometimes catch myself assuming people wont do a good job. Which I dont want to do but every time I let up on the reins something happens thats really not good, problems that would cause the project to fail, or teach students bad habits that could cause them to be fired from jobs in the future.

I'm trying to let small,things go and im proud on letting those things go but then there are larger things or percieved larger things. Like after hours and hours of work on the concept art every place I turn every environment is completely different from what I designed causing huge issues with consistency and causeing me to fall behind on work needlessly. (I didnt even call them out on this just mentioned the problems and redrew some things) 

Then theres other times when I just forget things, and struggle to keep up with things. I just recently forgot an assignment, and am constantly feeling like I'm not good enough. It feels like I'm hated at times by friends or other students even though I'm not being really ignored. I know people not responding doesnt mean they dont want to talk to me and,it may just be how they are, so I am comfortable with that logically, but again over-thinking. I feel like a hypocryte, and I dont know if being strict is the right thing. I'm trying my best but man is this hard. I make mistakes other people make mistakes but I cant help but feel like me and a few other students are bearing the brunt of the class not being willing to put in effort. 

Am I making the right choice to try and clean this up in a way that as kindly worded as I can?how should I handle these feelings? 

I'm happy to answer any questions I can if theres anything that's confusing you. I want things to work in this course but I also feel like an asshole since I dont know whats going on right now for everyone. 


*Tldr*: scared I'm being a dick in a class where in the past people having put in effort required/caused problems for others by doing so. I'm one of the people in charge of making sure things run quickly but I'm not sure if I'm taking things too far. Ie ive made assumptions before or been too strict or controlling (I try and catch them and make it clear in working on this)  I recently gave up a role telling people ""I know I'll take the reins on this too much, and that I can get in the way"" 

Btw Every class we make it clear that if there are any problems with getting work done due to the corona virus, so if theres something in the way even if it isnt corona they have other options. I'm just scared that even with all of the reminders we will get unfinished work, and I'm not sure if I'm over reacting. Should I let go of the reins a bit? I'm not sure what to do. 

Any questions welcome, especially if they can help you give better advice. Sorry for any typos I'm on mobile.",27Mar2020,1

888,"Before I start I just want to say that I am very anxious about posting this so if it is not for the right subreddit please tell me so I can crosspost it to another one. I also don't use Reddit a lot so if I make mistakes please excuse me. 

I am 15/F. Recently I got out of an extremely abusive relationship with a person almost a decade older than me which lasted for about 3 years, but prior to that relationship, I had already been a victim of abuse for about a year. During that 4-5 year period, I lived in complete isolation in my room and refused to go to school (though I went anyway because I had to). My grades were still strong (I have no idea how), but my overall knowledge and learning abilities were heavily set back not only by the lack of practice but also by the emotional and sexual abuse I went through. 

I won't dive deep into what happened to me since this post isn't about that specifically, but in the last year of our relationship, I started going to high school and began to realize that something was not okay. But I also noticed that I was very slow at understanding things and often needed help when it came to understanding my own mother language (not English) among other things. I also have a big problem visualizing my thoughts (if that makes sense) and remembering things like numbers and words even when I'm very focused. I also have a lot of difficulty reading in my mother tongue (we have a different alphabet from English) and understand English a lot better, and outright panic when I have to speak in my own language, which makes it pretty hard to socialize. 

When I was younger, prior to when I got addicted to the internet and met my abusers, I excelled at everything I did, like art, language, maths, sports, and so on, I was a bit of a prodigy if I remember correctly? But ever since I was 10-11 everything started going downwards and I have only realized just now. The only thing I am still good at is language since I am obviously speaking English right now but it's generally the only thing I can CONSISTENTLY excel at and not in small and short-lasting bursts like writing or art. I am a huge fan of sciences, so naturally, I love maths, chemistry, and physics, but am just unable to be good at any of them except chemistry but only because it's easier for our course (I attend a specialized course for philology and the English language.) 

I really really hate this because math is one of the things that makes me genuinely happy but I just keep having a lot of difficulty with it since I can't even count properly without writing everything down step by step and checking it over and over again to make sure it's right. I also love physics but my physics teacher is a really rude woman who keeps putting me down because I don't understand much.

So as I'm writing this I realize I need help with a few things and I am not sure if that is allowed but Reddit is literally the only thing I can go to to ask for advice about this because I cannot tell my family about this happening until it blows over in a year or two because they will not believe me and they will only make my mental state worse (I tried a few times before but both times it was futile). They don't really see me as serious since I'm just a teenager and they think I'm entitled and stuff since I used to be a huge shut-in. Sucks, I know, but I think this subreddit is my literal last chance since I'm on the edge of breaking down. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. I need help on how to generally focus better and maybe train my brain a little since I'm very slow.
2. I need help with relearning mathematics from the start. I know one of the rules says without requiring specific expertise but I am not asking with help with homework or something- what I mean is if there is maybe a site or process that could help me learn it over again? The same goes for physics and chemistry but less since maths is the really important one. 
3. And finally, I need to figure out how to focus on things I'm good at. I've been told I'm good at writing or art but as I said before it's in very small bursts because when these periods of inspiration are over I have absolutely no motivation nor talent left to continue and often I leave my works unfinished no matter how much I like them.   


I think that should be it but before I post I have to beg anyone who reads this to please disregard if my title is weird, I really don't know what else to set it as. Also if I am on the wrong sub or should go to another one please tell me so I can post it to an appropriate subreddit.

And if you've gotten this far and read through all that I said, and to anyone who will try to give me advice, thank you. I know I'm young so that's why I'm doing this now to avoid ruining my life in the future when I'm older.",27Mar2020,1

890,"Background about the guy:
We have known each other for a year because of my ex. He is still my ex’s friend, but when my ex broke up with me 3 months ago, he started texting me to know what had happend, because my ex is very private and yeah, just weird.

The situation:

I have been texting this guy for over 2 months now at Snapchat (sometimes also messenger) and we always have something to talk or write about, but the other day and today he just opened my snap and leaved me on read.

In the snap I only confirmed to the point of something we were talking about with a “ya, you’re right”, and I know that you can’t really answer to that, but usually he responds with either a question for me or just a picture of himself, but it’s like something has changed.

We have seen each other one time, after my ex and I broke up. He still flirts with me often, but does not really take initiative to see me. (But I asked him about why he didn’t for about 2 weeks ago and he said that it wasn’t because he wasn’t interested, because we do spend a lot of time on eachother)
But he did tuesday, and we agreed to meet up next week at his apartment when I had the time.

So my question is, how would you interpret this behaviour of his? What does it mean when he leaves me on read, when he says he is interested? 

(Now I’m Creepy) but I can see that his snapscore goes up, so it’s just me he isn’t texting",27Mar2020,1
891,"I’m a sophomore in college and I’ve liked the same guy since I saw him for the first time in  fourth grade. We were best friends in middle school but definitely grew apart in high school. When we would talk though he would always tell me how perfect I was so it always gave me hope. We hadn’t really talked since junior year of high school but about a month ago I decided to snapchat him. It was going great and it was like we had picked up where we left off in middle school. He would reply to me in like 2 seconds and I thought I really had a chance this time around. He even suggested that we hang out a few times when we got home from school. Because of coronavirus, we got sent home from school early and I’m not saying I want to hangout with him right now because I want to stay healthy, but basically as soon as we got home he started ignoring me. I only snapchat him when he snapchats me first but then he opens it and doesn’t reply. I can see he’s on snapchat and I know he’s not doing anything because he’s on lockdown so what’s up? Why did he go from on to off so quick?",27Mar2020,1

896,"I hate being moderate at everything. And not in the sense that I don’t like getting an average result, or I don’t like blending in; I just hate being moderate in a different sense. I have a moderate amount of stress. Enough to make me uncomfortable, but not enough that I feel like I deserve to complain about it. And I’m moderately anxious I think, but I can’t seek help for any problems I have or think I have because it only feels moderate. 

I’m tired enough that I can’t concentrate, but not enough that I can sleep. I’m stressed enough that exams and worries are always in my head, but I’m not stressed enough to feel like I have to trouble others to get any help or complain or use any advice given to people in times of stress. 

I try my best to improve myself and yet I don’t feel like it’s enough because I always stay moderate in everything, and when I succeed, I feel guilty because I can’t help thinking that it was just a fluke or just surface level knowledge. I keep thinking I’m going to let everyone around me down, because I used to be considered smart YEARS ago, but everyone’s impression of me is still like that and yet I can’t live up to that anymore, and I wasn’t even passionate about that kind of stuff in the first place. I feel like the people around me expect more from me than I feel like I can deliver.

Is it right of me to feel this way? Am I just subconsciously looking for attention? Is this a problem with my mindset or a problem I can fix by working harder?",27Mar2020,1
