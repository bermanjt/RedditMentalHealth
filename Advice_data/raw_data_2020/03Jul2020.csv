0,"Don’t know what to do about my Dad.

Hi, 

I don’t know how to tell my Dad that I think he has an alcohol problem as he never listens to anyone about anything. I live at home with my Dad and my three younger brothers(parents are separated as they cant stand each other).In all honesty I think it started a few years ago but I didn’t really notice at the time as a can or two a night was all it was and I wasn’t really old enough to know. It was probably around the time of my parents splitting up. My Dad used to be really fun and people used to enjoy having him around and he had loads of friend and we would have people round our house for parties and what not but now he’s completely isolated himself from everyone apart from his drinking/golf buddies. He used to be so fun and outgoing but now all he does apart from work is moan about things, slag people off, say all his old friends only liked him for his money etc which I know isn’t true as they always ask me if he’s ok and why he isn’t returning their messages etc(I know how that sounds but they were all fairly well off too and we would go to their houses so it wasn’t a one way thing). It’s just really sad to see I feel like his personality has changed ever since he started drinking a lot I don’t know if this is common but I guess he’s hungover everyday and maybe thats why? 

He drinks every night to the point where he passes out watching tv in the living room, it starts when he gets home maybe 5ish with a few beers and then usually either a bottle of wine followed by several large glasses of vodka with a mixer or he’ll just drink most of a large bottle of vodka. I’m really concerned as he gets aggressive and argumentative about stupid things when he’s drunk and the most worrying thing is he will have a massive shouting fit and then wake up and forget it even happened. Obviously I’m also worried about what will happen long term (liver damage etc) and I worry it will only get worse as me and two of my brothers are likely to move out soon and he will just be alone with my youngest brother. 

I don’t really know what to do he wont listen to Me, my brothers, or my Mum as he thinks we don’t know what were on about and he practically hates her and all his mates think its ok and just encourage him which really doesn’t help. The one person that I really feel that I need to talk to about this and might be the only person who could help is my Auntie but she lives miles away and is pregnant during lockdown and she really doesn’t need that kind of stress in her life right now so I don’t feel like I can burden her with this at the moment.

What can I do? I feel like if this carries on I will either not be able to stand my Dad for the rest of my life or he will drink himself to an early grave. It really hurts to see this happen in front my my eyes and feel powerless to do anything about it but the man that I see and speak to every day doesn’t feel like my Dad at all he’s cold and rude about people and I can’t see him ever being happy for the rest of his life and meeting someone else who’s good for him if he carries on like this...",03Jul2020,1
1,This guy who I'm friends with has stopped talking to me after this party I had at his house where we were drinking a year ago. full disclosure I'm bisexual and I'm not sure if he knew that. this has made me think that I did something inappropriate with him. we were normal friends prior to this party now he barely speaks to me. Any advice on what I should say to him would be very appreciated.,03Jul2020,1
2,"So to start it off I’m a scrawny 17 year old about 5”10. I’ve been bullied n beaten on all my life and was out with friends when a guy I didn’t know but was a mutual of people I knew called me a pussy. So i asked who called me a pussy he said it was him and asked if I was gonna start swinging, I told him no n just wanted to dead it (solve the problem without fighting). He starts swinging on me and completely bests my ass, busts my lip all that. A little while later we walk back home and run into the same guy who continues to chirp me. I get the courage to swing on him and completely beat his ass, he had two black eyes and I was gushing blood from my face. He hit my girlfriend at this point. So I swing on him again for hitting her and he ends up getting on top of me all while pulling my hair (u don’t do that in male fights) and pummeled me until I end up connecting a couple of good hits enough that made him get off of me and leave, and say “yo this guy just keeps going”. I ended up with more damage or so it looked because of the blood n bursted lip. (The guy also put on 2 full hands of rings the second round).  My girlfriend thinks I lost and I’m a little embarrassed, but she’s also never seen anyone take that much damage and keep going. Idk what to do I feel ashamed",03Jul2020,1
3,"I had a conversation with somebody for a while (three days), I sent them private photos. They eventually turned around and attempted to scam me. Threatening to post it online if I didn’t. 

None of the pictures had my face or any identifying foreground/background features (did this on purpose). But they know my name and have separate photos of my face.

I deactivated all of my social media, reported them twice and blocked them. 

We were both consenting, I didn’t do anything that can incriminate me.

I called their bluff, but what are the chances that they actually do what they threatened? 

Will they just move onto their next target? I hear this is common and most are attempts at quick cash. They really have no motivation for doing anything at this point now that I cut communication and money is no longer on the table.

I took screenshots of the conversation before deleting/reporting it. I did NOT pay them.

I would appreciate some reassurance. I know it wasn’t the smartest thing ever. I even suspected something was up. Never again.

I don’t want to take legal action unless something happens, which I don’t think it will.",03Jul2020,1
4,"So i used to be friends with a guy from work and we got along really well, but everyone kept telling me that he liked me, and I definitely didn’t feel the same about him. I still wanted to be friends so when he eventually asked me on a date I politely declined and said I see him as a good friend, and we continued as normal since then. I eventually left the job and it was obvious he really liked me still, and it seemed like he thought I might change my mind because he asked me out again, so I stupidly didn’t reply and as more time went by I just couldn’t bring myself to say anything. I know that was harsh of me but I felt like if I kept giving him hope by replying, he’d always be disappointed. 

So basically it’s been a few months and I keep missing the friendship we had but I’m worried that if I talk to him again he’ll only be hurt that I still don’t like him in that way :( What do you guys think I should do? 

TL;DR: Should I get back in touch with a guy who likes me for the friendship even though I will never like him back?",03Jul2020,1

Ok I know this sounds like bullshit, I honestly wasn't too much of a believer but I just came to the realization that karma bit me in the ass and I need help figuring out how to balance it again because I can't take the feeling that it's following me anymore.

Long long story short, I dated this girl, I thought I liked her alot but turned out I liked someone else, as soon as I found that out I broke up with her because it wasn't fair to her, but I didn't tell her it was because I liked someone else, and I later found out the breakup broke her heart for months and actually crushed her, also for reference for later in the story when I broke up with her I said something along the lines of ""you deserve better, you deserve someone who isn't confused about their feelings"", anyways fast forward, a summer and a couple months after that I developed depression &amp; anxiety out of nowhere (i hadn't really had mental health issues before then) and that caused me to gain a shit ton of weight throughout the year, also I had developed a strong crush which I later fell in love with very deeply (this is the person that I had feelings for which caused me to break up with my girlfriend), things seemed to be going really really well with my crush but then out of literally nowhere it was like a train hit and she just lost feelings (just like how it probably seemed to my ex-girlfriend) anyways months pass and I ask my crush what's the deal between us because I'm tired of guessing, and this is the part that truly made me realize I was dealing with karma, she said and I quote: ""you deserve better, you deserve someone who isn't confused about their feelings"".... when i tell you my jaw dropped after re-reading this text months later and realizing it all, I was at a coffee shop at the time and I literally had an anxiety attack and ran to go buy a pack of cigs because of it.

I felt like an asshole already when I first broke up with my ex, and now that i'm experiencing what i put her through, I feel even more like an asshole. I know for a fact this is karma getting back at me but I don't know how to escape it?? I feel like I've already paid my debt because I've been heart broken over my crush for almost a year and a half, so I just want to find a way to balance it out again.

If you have any experience in this type of stuff i'd really appreciate it

also for non-karma knowledgeable people any advice on how to stop feeling like an asshole for what I did? I mean I thought I was doing the right thing breaking up with her when I realized I had feelings for someone else but now I just don't know anymore. I feel like I should've told her that I had feelings for someone else so she could get closure but I wanted to spare her feelings at the time, I just feel like such a dick.",03Jul2020,1

10,"I am a five year employee of the three red letter pharmacy chain (I can't post their name because it has a huge online presence, and they can and will fire you over social media posts) I have a year experience as a cashier, two years experience as a pharmacy technician trainee, and the last two years as a front store shift supervisor. I've worked hard to get where I am, but they have kept me at part time despite the years I've been with the company. 
In the last two years the corporate office has made some decisions that had doubled and tripled expectations in certain areas, and then cut our hours on top of it. I started out making around 20 hours a week as a part time cashier, and continue to get the same amount of hours as a supervisor. This summer I was lucky and was asked to work at a store that had hours due to a mass quiting (should have been my red flag) so I have been lucky to have been working 30-40 hours a week for the last month and a half. now, though, my time at this store is ending in a few weeks and it seems that the old store may not have any intention of transferring me back.

With this information, what would I qualify for?",03Jul2020,1

Dear CO-Redditors,

I'm at a turning point in life surrounding my relationship with my ""family"". I don't have a close relationship with them due to the fact that I'm never home. So living alone isn't a gamechanger for me.

As a kid ( m) raised by a single mom, I'm proud and humbled by everything she's done for me. She had to migrate and work her ass off to provide food and buy a house. But she was and still is never at home.

I'm 19 years old and want to leave the house where i reside together with my mother and brother for different reasons.

First of all because of my brother's ( 21) constant hostility and need to assert dominance, and second of all for more freedom of course. Third, because my brother is getting married and his wife is moving in. The last reason is the fact that i'm the only non-religious person in my family, I'm kind of the black sheep.

Last night she told me that if i left she would never contact me, i would be all alone.

Due to the fact that the country that i live in has a way of supporting young people who are alone( so bills would be paid).

This isn't the first time that i tried leaving, and every time i follow the advice from all of the family members. That i just have to stay under the radar when my brothers at home and i have to sacrifice my present for my mother's happiness who wants me to stay in her home.

During my first year of college, i couldn't study at home due to my brother being here and constantly trying to assert dominance and wanting to fight. That's when i took the decision to take matters into my own hands.

All I've heard from my mom and family members is that i'm being selfish and a hypocrite and ungrateful for my mother's ""gift of life"" ( who still works around 10 hours a day).

My girlfriend tells me that i don't deserve this and that i should go away.

This caused me to question myself

Am i being ignorant?

Thanks",03Jul2020,1

21,"I turned 21 about three weeks ago and since then I’ve been having a bit of a crisis and I want to run away from everything but I don’t know how. 
Here’s the backstory:
I have a great paying job that I hate. It requires me to talk to people all day long that exhausts me to no end. I’m pretty good at it but I dread going to work every day; I feel like I’m a fake. 
I just signed a year lease on a house in a great area in the country with my boyfriend of 2.5 years. I’ve wanted this type of living situation for while due to the fact that I have 4 large dogs who are my entire world. 
My boyfriend and I are not great at the moment. I love him but due to our work schedules I rarely see him and I feel like we are just glorified roommates at this point. We talked about breaking up a week ago and he said he’d change his work schedule but idk if that’s even the issue. I feel like we may just not be compatible long term. He says he wants to stay together and figure out our issues and I’ve agreed. 
I dropped out of college last year as a junior. I hate school but I know I need to finish my degree which is why I need to stay put geographically until I can (I was failing when I dropped out so transferring is not a good option)
I have a hobby I love that I’d love to turn into a career but can’t afford to quit my job and pursue exclusively yet. It could take me 2-5 years to get to that point. 
From the outside I feel like I have so much going for me. Great job, great house, great dogs, great boyfriend, great hobby. So much to be happy and content about. 
But I am miserable. Probably depressed and very anxious and irritable all the time. My coping mechanism is to run away from things which isn’t ideal but lately I feel so trapped in my life I want to move thousands of miles away and never look back. 
I don’t know what to do. I’ve been diagnosed with type 2 bipolar and I don’t know if I agree with that diagnosis or not. I know I’m depressed and anxious. Medicine hasn’t worked well for me. Therapy hasn’t worked well for me. So I stopped both while ago. I have a really hard time deciding what is real and what is magnified in my head due to my poor mental health. Most of my friends were on college with me and have since disappeared so I’m incredibly lonely as well. 
Part of me longs to go back 2 years and enjoy my youth and be a kid again, because for Christ’s sake I’m 21 and have a full on career started and never partied or enjoyed my time in college (I dropped out/failed classes because I was working 60+ hours a week)

23,"Hey Reddit, so this is something that's been bothering me for a good while, but I just needed to get some advice from people who know way more than me. 

So ever since COVID started I've been dealing with awful lapses in my psyche, from thinking the mob was after me, to thinking that some items left on my car meant something.

So basically recently I got furloughed from my job due to Coronavirus, and said aforementioned job was literal hell. Well I recognized that and ended up getting rid of all my co-workers social media, including one of my few friends who worked there who also happened to give me drugs once or twice (just small amounts of weed). 


Well fast forward a week, and when I go back up to apartment complex to get rid of my dead car which I'd left behind since I was going to scrap it when I got back, I found some rocks and a crushed alcohol can on my car, and almost immediately my mind drifted to thinking that this was the coworker who I had been good friends with trying to send me a message, thinking that he was mad at me and potentially thought I was snitching on him even AFTER I got a go ahead from him telling me it was good and that he had no hard feelings.

Well after this I reconnected with him briefly to explain what'd happened because I was getting anxious what happened, and he simply told me that it was sketchy and that he hoped nobody was planning anything. Which, me being the moron I am assumed that he actually really did it, and was just saying that as some sort of smug or sarcastic response. 

Fast forward five days and I find nothing on my car when I come back up again to sell it, but even a month from then, which is now, I still can't shake the thought that he really did something, and that I have a target on my back despite him having no motive, reasoning, nor any idea where I live or what my car looks like to do any of it.

This is just an example of the thoughts I've been having, and I know they're unreasonable, but my brain just cant let them go.

What do I do to make myself realize that this is all bs and is basically Occam's Razor?

Basically I (15M) am stuck in an abusive house. My parents don't let me go inside my bedroom unless im sleeping and definitely don't let me take my phone up there. Because of this the only place im allowed in is the living room and I never get any privacy. Recently my parents wrote a contact for me stating that living in their house was a privilege and I am lucky that they let me use things they have bought for themselves (ex. food) my mom has told me she's extremely unhappy that I recently applied for a job and my dad refuses to teach me how to drive. I have told them I'm unhappy living here and they ignored me, they truly believe that they are doing nothing wrong. Living here is seriously wrecking my mental health and without my friends I most likely would've committed suicide by now

I really need a way out, but everything seems so unideal. If I were to go into foster care it would severely reduce my chance of getting a solid education, and getting emancipated means that I have to be self-sufficient but I can't do that without a car and a job (let alone knowing how to drive)

30,"I am in an odd situation.

Am a Senior IT Development professional just under the Director at my company.

Have been working on Database/Cloud services for more than 20 years.

Thing is that I have almost no education beyond high school for this and I know that if I want to get to the next rung I need some letters after my name.

I am Canadian but living in America for 20+ years.  The closest thing I have to more advanced education is an equivalency to some business courses that I took almost 30 years ago and apparently on the American side they equate that to an Associates Level.  I know this because I had to get a visa to work in America and the border guards accepted an evaluation of my education level to Associates degree.

So my question is about steps to advance this except that I am really not keen on sitting in a classroom (online or in person) getting the basics on boolean logic.

That kind of stuff is doomed to failure given my work experience.  Though I could use the sleep.

Anyone have any information about this or can point me to some kind of resource on it?  Preferably without getting my email spammed from a plethora of online colleges just trying to make a buck.

Am thinking in terms also of schools that offer credits based on experience sort of thing.

So a little backstory about this For the sake of the story and for privacy I’ll be calling my friend M 

Me and m are best friends we meet near the end of 8th grade and Stay together throughout high school we both are 20 now and i’ve been through a lot of stuff and we’re very close even to the point where he takes trips with my family and I take trips with his (water park, going to a big city , Disneyland etc) . 
My sister is three years younger then me And me and her are kinda close  but you know we are brother and sister so we pull pranks, try to make the another mad the usual. But let’s get to the main story.

About a week ago my parents were gone for the weekend . A relative got sick and they went to visit them and see how they were doing  leaving me and my sister in the house . On the first night of parents being gone I was trying to sleep and I kept hearing stuff from my sisters room I thought nothing of it but it kept  going and I decided to go see what’s going on . I start walking to my sisters room. Her door Is slightly open so I decide to look in and see her well... getting fucked . In my head I was like omfg and laughing because I Decided I was going to Embarrass her . And so I burst into the room shocking the her and  m ,  I didn’t recognize him at first and then I realized it was him and I just lost It started yelling what are you doing to my sister and what the fuck is wrong with you . My sister starting crying and m just stood there shocked .

Me and my sister got into a huge fight she said I had no right and I violated her Privacy and and I told her you’ve been fucking my best friend how dare you why would you put me in this position . Personally that’s a big violation You can’t fuck your friends relatives because It puts them in a hard spot , if something goes wrong .

36,"I’m not sure if I should delay my graduation by a bit:

To summarize, I was supposed to graduate in Spring, however I took a quarter off to study for an entrance exam. That being said, in the case I don’t score high enough, (which is inevitably going to happen), and I know no school will take me. 

I was thinking about taking time off to pad my GPA. For the programs I was looking at, they don’t care about classes taken after your bachelors. Similarly, many of my friends who were the class of 2020 are struggling to find any position during their gap year. 

So it makes sense to delay it, however my parents are vehemently opposed to the idea. They’re scared I won’t graduate and keep guilt tripping me/yelling at me for it. It’s like I try to tell them that it makes more sense to delay it, but they don’t want to hear it.

Obviously this guy never knew who I was, but after so much time I know so much about his personal life, his relationships, his family. It’s like he was a good friend of mine. I’ve watched his battle with depression, all of the highs and the lows, but I never ever imagined this day would come. 

I can’t even talk to my friends or family about how I feel - what would they think? It seems so trivial to be crying over the death of someone I’ve never met who never knew I existed, yet here I am, unable to stop the flow of tears.

42,"Hello, I am currently 19 years old and I really need some advice right now... I am dealing with my mother a lot and I mean A LOT lately because of her behaviour, but what really made me uncomfortable is when my boyfriend came to my place one, I expected my mother to be respectful and nice towards him, but instead, she asked him ""will you massage me?""... I was shocked and so was he... It took him 1 minute to respond and try to dodge the question.... I never felt so uncomfortable in my life, later on he texted me and told me he felt really uncomfortable... I knew because I felt uncomfortable aswell... The worst thing is I asked her to apogise to him multiple times and she would always get mad at me... Yep.. She would literally get mad at me and say ""You kids can't take a joke at all! He means nothing to me and I won't apologise to some kid!"" This went on for a week until she said that she is apologising, not to him but to me for doing that to him... But you could say she did that only to stop me from bugging her to apologise... A few days ago my boyfriend met my dad for the first time and I was so happy because he was respectful and they clicked emmediatelly and it went more than well. But my bf at this point knows how rude she can be towards me and he gets pretty mad as well... I am trying to keep my boyfriend safe apart from my mom but I know this can't go on forever and it's actually quite upsetting me and I don't know what to do... Luckily I will move out pretty soon but the recent events really made me even more dissapointed in her. Not to mention she told me to close the door so she can gossip about me to her friend and I still heard her say ""when he goes to college he will leave her, she is just something ""by side"" to him for now"" I cannot explain how hurt I was and I bursted in and started yelling at her and called her a disgusting human being and she got mad because I called her that, and said to her friend ""look what I have to deal with"" for me yelling at her for insulting me in every possible way. I had every right and reason to do so, I was in so much emotional pain and actually told my boyfriend she said that about us and he got really mad as well and I ended up trying to calm him down as well and he almost started crying, I really don't know where is the end to her horrifying behaviour. I'm still a little shaken up from the things I have heard she said to her friend about me for no reason... My boyfriend is the sweetest boy and person I have ever met and everyone who meets him loves him because he is extremely kind and good hearted, I really do think we both do not deserve this kind of treatment...",03Jul2020,1

46,"Hi everyone,

So, let's call my best friend Jay (22) . He's been with me (23) for over 10 years, and we've made it past high school together. He's in the states now and I'm in Canada. We spent a ton of time on discord playing DotA together, even through university, it was a routine for us. However there was an unusual amount of toxicity that he came with (which I thought was in good intention) but he was just never supportive in any aspect of my growth. He'd always reassure me that I'm a piece of shit, and that I'm a simp to my girlfriend, that I'm nothing like my brother, that I'm a failure in multiple aspects of my life etc. I reduced time on DotA because I had to work on other things, and he'd complain that I'm getting worse in DotA because I'm spending so much time on my girlfriend etc. I'd just laugh it off but over years and years of hearing it, it's slowly starting to weigh on me.

He's been a very controversial person since high school, making jokes about black people, women, liberals etc. He passes them off as jokes but, I figured we left that stuff in high school when we were just stupid teenagers, but he's still at it to this day. I'm just not that person anymore, but he'll casually throw around the N word and call me a leftist if I don't say it with him, stuff like that. 

Recently, new information came to light that he talked shit about me to my ex girlfriend from highschool, and when I confronted him about it, he apologized saying they were just joking around.

Basically he told her that I'm still the same retard from high school, and that I haven't changed and that I treat my current girlfriend the same way I used to treat my ex etc.

But the thing is I feel unsafe that he's comfortable talking shit about me to my ex, and I entrust him with a ton of private information. How much has he revealed to anyone else?

I took some time to think about it, and my current girlfriend pointed out that friendships can grow apart when the people in them change, and she agreed that I changed a lot since high school, I've grown a lot as a person and she feels that I'm only sticking to this friendship because of the time I've invested in it. She said that the reason I'm so upset is because of a ton of underlying issues that I've bottled up, and that this one was the trigger for me.

I currently don't know what to do. I haven't spoken to him for a couple of days, because I'm wondering if the time I spent with him is worth fixing this, or am I really going to have to rethink the boundaries of this friendship and maybe find something more in sync with the person I am now. 

I don't know what to do. I would appreciate some advice. 

Tldr: Best friend broke my trust and now I'm doubting our 10 years+ friendship.",03Jul2020,1

48," So I (24M) have been talking to this girl (21F) for a couple months now. We've gone out a few times and last week we decided to become an official couple. For a few months we've literally been talking all day everyday from the moment we're up until the moment we go to bed. There have been a couple bumps along the way (mostly just uncertainties, but all have been quelled and discussed prior to us agreeing to become official), but nothing major. However, since we became a couple about a week ago, things just feel a bit different, and I'm not sure why or what is going on exactly, but it's very distressing.

I can't exactly figure out what might have changed since then, but our text conversations don't seem as fluid, and she seems less excited to text or talk on the phone. The weird thing is it's inconsistent. Throughout most of the day, it feels weird. She seems distant and a bit uninterested in talking, but usually at night, she seems much more engaged in the conversation. Basically from like 7am until 6 or 7pm I stress out feeling like she doesn't want to talk, but after that she usually seems more happy to talk to me. We're supposed to go out again on Saturday, and she just doesn't seem excited about it at all. I'm not sure what I can do better but it's gut wrenching that I'm only a couple months into talking and a week into dating and I already feel like she's bored of me. Literally last night we were talking about the future and even talked about the ideal times for engagement. Yet today, her texting just seems like she doesn't really care to talk that much. If this were just a today thing I wouldn't worry about it, but it's been this pattern every day since Sunday.

I've considered bringing it up, but then I run the risk of looking very insecure, which could cause her to think I'm not ready for a relationship if there IS nothing wrong. But not knowing for certain is genuinely eating me alive. When I get stressed out I can't eat, and I've only been able to force myself to eat food twice from Sunday until now.

I really feel like I love this girl, I just wish I knew how mutual that feeling was. Any advice? This is my first relationship so I'm not sure if this kind of this is normal...

tl;dr we've only been going out a week, but she already seems less interested in talking and less excited to see me, and I'm not sure what to do about it.",03Jul2020,1
49,"When I was very young, my stepfather would manipulate me into touching his genitals after my mum left for work. This happened between when I was four and eight years old. Once when my mother was away he climbed on top of me and pinned me down onto a bed, but somehow I convinced him to stop. The only reason this kind of thing stopped was when I took some of his canned soup to give to the school charity and he pinned me down by my mouth onto the floor until I bled and was nearly passed out from lack of oxygen. My sisters called the police but he convinced me that it would be the right thing to not say anything and I didn’t want to make a big deal anyway. The police came to talk to me but I didn’t have a lawyer to speak to. Instead I spoke to my stepfathers lawyer who told me it was all my fault and I was a bad girl anyway and deserved it and if I didn’t want to give him a handjob I didn’t have to it was my choice anyway. This meant I had to live with the guilt of it being my fault for 7 years because I was afraid of being called a whore or looking vulnerable. I’ve heard about things on the news where many girls speak up about it and have to relive the abuse but the abusers get off Scot free anyway. My stepfather didn’t even get a restraining order because I lied about the whole thing. I recently have come to terms with what happened and have been starting to uncover some repressed memories and this comes with some of the repressed guilt. I’ll be turning 16 soon and at that time it will be too late to seek law enforcement and I don’t trust them anyway because when my mother kicked me and punched me they told me that if I had behaved none of it would have happened. I have been thinking recently and I’m concerned about him getting a new girlfriend and possibly a daughter.

50," My 87 year old disabled grandmother with Alzheimer's was on a flight from Hong Kong to Toronto with a layover in Vancouver on June 30. She is unable to care for herself anymore in Hong Kong so we are caring for her here in Toronto.

We requested Assistance Services at the check-in counter as she cannot walk and requires a wheelchair + additional assistance from terminal to terminal. Upon arrival at the Vancouver airport, she disembarked the plane and while on the bridge, she ""fell"". **This fall, under the care of Air Canada's personnel, resulted in a broken wrist and broken hip joint.** She was transported to the hospital by ambulance. We have been told that her broken hip requires emergency surgery and she is unable to travel to Toronto. She is also required to stay 7-14 days in the hospital for recovery (approx $3k per day for the stay itself, not including surgery).

(Question is, how does one fall from a wheelchair? More importantly, how does one fall so hard that they break their wrist and hip from the height of a wheelchair?)

I have not been contacted by Air Canada regarding this incident. We have been attempting to contact them by phone and email since June 30 afternoon. We were told by the Customer Relations department that the incident report is internal and cannot be shared with us. At this time, we do not know any details of her fall - how she fell, who she was with, whether or not a wheelchair was provided, etc.

I have reached Customer Care and Medical Assistance by phone and was advised that compassionate travel cannot be provided and that no medical expenses as a result of this injury will be paid by Air Canada.

After tweeting about this issue, I finally received a response from General Claims indicating that they are ""familiarizing themselves with the matter"". This response was from 11:56 am today (July 2), two days after the incident.

We are unable to pay for all the medical expenses upfront and the hospital is asking us to contact Air Canada to request a letter stating that they will cover the medical expenses of the injury.

My grandmother has travel insurance but insurance ppl said they need all the documentation to claim so it will be after she is discharged from the hospital. Regardless, all medical expenses will have to be paid upfront (which we don't have). My grandmother is currently waiting to do surgery.

51,"It has been fourteen days since my last interaction with Reddit regarding this situation. Here is the link to that post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hb3zau/serious\_how\_do\_i\_explain\_to\_my\_best\_friend\_female/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hb3zau/serious_how_do_i_explain_to_my_best_friend_female/).

ALRIGHT. I trust I have no need for a throwaway account, as the friend doesn't know I have Reddit. If she finds this, good for her. I don't think this needs to be hidden behind a throwaway account. In any case, this account is so rarely used that I could probably turn it into one if need be.

I'll be recapping the above post and providing a little more context to the situation because it has progressed, but if the full story is too controversial for here, I will slim it down and repost. Also, apologies for how long this is, it become something of a rant. Before I mention anything though, please keep your answers civil, as opposed to messages that boil down to ""you'd never understand"", ""racist swine"", and/or ""you absolute scum."" I'd like to say I wouldn't expect such messages, but I'd be lying if I did, given how the U.S. is nowadays. For your understanding...

My best friend is a smart, headstrong young woman and an advocate for the LGBTQ community. We'll call her D. She has various social medias, where she posts about equality and her art. Now, I'm only bringing this up because her artwork has gotten recognition from the bands she does it on. So she's not exactly your everyday 200-something follower media artist. D is very stubborn, and, as I've found out recently (mind you, this is three years into being very close friends), very wrapped up in her own ego. She is usually a great listener, and honestly, I'd trust her with my life. She's one of the top three people (non-family) that I trust. D is a very laid back person, and is normally able to joke around despite not being the most social of people. Also, please note that this person wanted to be on the debate team a while ago.

Now, there's no way to get this post across professionally without explaining some detail on myself as well. Otherwise, this post could be misconstrued as me complaining about her. I am nearly two years her senior, and don't have much of a presence on social media. D and I are very similar. I am stubborn like her, am confident in myself like her, and am generally laid back. I'd like to think that I am an accepting person, and I like to believe that I'm a good listener. Here's what has me concerned. We are incredibly alike. I've been told that she was caught up in her own ego. But what if I am too?

We live in New England, if that matters. Probably the biggest reason we had such a falling out was because we were so similar that we probably never even considered that we might not see eye to eye on some things. I certainly hadn't. Also, the first part of this story takes place on a Sunday.

Our characters? D = best friend, M = third party, and Me = me.

So, essentially, it started in a group chat of D, M, and myself. M mentioned something her older relative said a while back. ""Are those foreigners illegal?"" This was said in regards to her neighbours, whom the relative had never met before. These neighbours had lived in the U.S. for 30+ years. Well, D basically called the older relative racist. I spoke up in that relative's defense, saying that she was a woman of her values. D questioned me defending the relative, saying that racism doesn't count as a value. Now, while I agree with that statement, I'm fairly certain that the relative's question was not, in fact, racist. D and I were given no hints as to what tone of voice the relative used. Plus, it's an honest question. That relative was also raised in a time when foreigners were less widely accepted. This is important to note because D's next message read ""I suppose that as long as we learn not to be racist now then the world will be a better place when all those really old people die.""

Now, I don't know about you, but I felt like that message wasn't exactly the kindest belief. So I told her that the world will indeed be better in the future, but that does not depend solely on the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands of people raised in war times, when international propaganda was big. I said that it is also a matter of accepting that some people have their own rigid beliefs they won't break free from. Should those intolerant beliefs be kept internalized? Absolutely.

And this is where things start getting off the hook.

Essentially, D then says that tolerating the relative's intolerance ""makes absolutely no sense."" Of course, I wasn't saying to just accept it and move on. But she was trying to be righteous in her own way, and I want to commend her for that.

I next advise that while stuff is wrong, and people are flawed, we cannot all just take offense at the slightest drop of a hat. Doing as such shows a lack of fortitude. I also explain that I agree, intolerance should be spoken out against, but some people would refuse to listen. D responds simply with ""obviously we aren't going to agree on this point.""

So, some small talk happens now. After, I mention that ""politically correct"" is changing the definitions of racism, xenophobia, and intolerance. I give an example that D claimed to understand, and she then says that by being politically correct, we don't hurt feelings. I follow up that I am in 90% of agreement there. Here, I go into a bit of a rant that I'll summarize. I say that being politically correct has to stop somewhere, that people are getting offended too easily nowadays, and that in some places, with some people, referring to someone's nationality earns you the label of racist (if you're white and they aren't, at least. Haven't heard of any situations where it happens in reverse where the other person is labelled racist). I ask D if I'm the only one who's been aware of more racist minority people than paler people. I tell her that we can agree that racism must end, and that defending racism is not a good thing. But I also ask her (and here's where I think I set her off) how much of what is nowadays considered racist is legitimately racist or is just guilt for actions committed by ancestors over a century ago. How much of it nobody took offense to thirty years ago.

Now, I don't know about you, but honestly? I don't see what's racist about mentioning someone's nationality and heritage. I am of the belief that those are things to be proud of. I'm not ashamed that I was born with paler skin. I'm sure that, if I was another nationality, I wouldn't be ashamed of it. So why then, is it racist? Like, if I (white, male), referred to a couple (we're talking very clearly of Asian descent. Which individual country doesn't matter for this particular example) as Asian, I would probably be called a racist pig in at least a few people's eyes.

So D responds that I am a ""straight cis white man"", and that I'll ""never really understand being offended based on uncontrollable factors."" What does that even mean? She then backtracks upon my questioning, and tells me she doesn't mean to be mean. So, I ask why she brings this up. Her response?

""By saying that you don't agree with being politically correct you aren't considering the fact that you can't be offended in that way. You will never be the victim of racism, homophobia, sexism, etc.""

Now insulted, I begin to lose my cool. I tell her that I actually have (true story, by the way), to the first and third.

In her defense, D did ask me to elaborate here.

I tell her that people of whiter complexions can experience racism too, and she just tells me that ""that's not how that works."" If anyone reading this is of the same belief set as her, would you be kind enough to educate me here? She refused to explain it to me, astounded that I didn't understand her baseless (in my eyes) logic. I don't want to offend her in the future.

Finally, I decide I need to explain through a simple question to her. ""Is it okay for you or I to call someone darky?"" To which she says, no. The only problem here, is that my follow-up question ""Then why is it okay for others to call you or I whitey?"" earned the response that it's just different. When asked to explain, she just tells me that she doesn't know how, but it is. And that if I wasn't one of her closest friends, she'd probably block me.

At this point, I'm thinking to myself, in what way have I proven anything but tolerant? In what way have I managed to offend her? Because that is not at all how she normally behaves.

So I try again. I explain that a foreign friend we both know was kind of racist, and she tells me that yes, he ""is the most racist Asian person ever \[crying emoji\]."" I'm not gonna lie, I was tempted to tell her that by her logic, she was just being racist. But I wanted to keep things civil. So I tell her that some people really are racist, but racism is a double-edged sword. It can go both ways. She then tells me that our foreign friend can make comments about his race but we cannot make the same ones.

Now, I sort of get what she's struggling to say here. The whole thing about how ""self-racism is okay."" As she explained it, ""an overweight person can joke about being fat but you can't joke about them. WHITE PEOPLE HAVE NEVER BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.""

Can we just take a moment to appreciate just how...idiotic that statement sounds? Can we just...think about, the thousands of years that humans of different skin tones have been interacting with each other. Can we just...think about, how many people there are in the world? How many there have been? Her statement here is just SO insensitive and covers such a wide span of decades that it really just makes her seem incompetent, which is sad because it's the furthest thing from the truth.

Anyway, I explain to her my experience with a formerly close friend who happened to be a darker-skinned person (she was very obviously Indian, for context) who ended our friendship by being racist to me, and in the same action, threw my trust in her to the curb. The reaction I get from D? ""That's most definitely not a truthful statement.""

So, ever trying to be helpful, I elaborate further on the event, and get told that ""events like that seriously don't happen,"" and a few details I'm not comfortable sharing to the internet. WELL, D now decides to get M back into the conversation (she had been staying quiet, and as I later learned, trying to understand my point of view) and agree with her. As if M couldn't possibly choose to stay neutral or see things differently.

I then essentially tell D that homophobia is nowhere NEAR as prevalent as it was in the past five decades. That many people laud others for embracing themselves and who they are.

What I get in response? ""STRAIGHT PEOPLE DON\['\]T GET CALLED DEATH THREATS. STRAIGHT PEOPLE DON\['\]T GET CALLED SLURS."" So when I say that yes, in fact, they do, she says that ""IT. IS. NOT. THE. SAME.""

Anyone care to explain this for me? She didn't.

So I ask if she's seriously telling me that men cannot experience sexism, and she says that she understands that one. *Good,* I think. So I explain to her that I went to a very sexist school in the past (basically, *any* one of the girls could have slapped another student across the face in front of a teacher, and she'd get a pat on the hand. If the victim was a guy, he'd probably be questioned what he did to cause it. If any single guy slapped another student across the face, be the victim guy or girl, he would get detention. I wish I could say I was joking, but they didn't even try to hide their favouritism).

Unfortunately, D responds with ""But men don't get catcalled by creeps \[o\]n the internet."" Can we just appreciate how much this argument has covered now? How...inane this all is? But that wasn't all. ""It's not your fault that you are a straight white cis anglosaxon male, but you just can't understand these points.""

And once again, she backtracks, this time realizing that she is arguing my case for me. She tells me that she recognizes that by using that as an argument, she's kinda (no, D, not KINDA) discriminating against me. So props to her for being self aware, I guess..? She finishes by saying that it's still very different.

As we draw to a close, I tell her that I don't see her any differently, and I meant it. I still do. If you're reading this, D, you know full well who you are, and I love you like the sister I never had.

But, she instead sends me a message about how if I began transitioning to a woman, I would without a doubt understand that I had it easy before.

So, digging the hole deeper for myself, and if an effort to understand her thought process, I indulge her and offer an example outlining the flaws in the way she's presenting her case. How it is so twisted that it negates some of its own effectiveness. And now, we decide to end, as we don't want to spam M, and we agree to disagree. I finish up with my own personal belief that all lives matter, regardless of who is treating who which way. That racism is a double-edged sword with too many hands vying for it, and that everyone should be held equally accountable for their actions, and that race and sexuality should NOT, in my eyes, influence justice. I also explain in this message that no one gender gets to be held down while the others get away with the same actions committed by the first, regardless of which does what action. I end with the statement that I believe anyone can anyone can experience racism, heterophobia/homophobia and/or sexism.

End guess what? She doesn't let it end there. Now, you'd think such a statement is incredibly fair. It is nothing if not equal. Well, she tells me that she agrees all lives matter, but that I *shouldn't say that*. Because it's apparently taken as a slight against the Black Lives Matter movement? Now, I want to make something clear, if I haven't already. I am all one for equality. For TRUE equality. I fully support the rights all races and genders. You wanna identify as a wolf/helicopter hybrid from Narnia? ...sure. You do you. You get the same rights as everyone else. But can someone, ANYONE, tell me how my statement that all lives (which includes BLM people, folks. I said *all* for a reason) matter is offensive to BLM? Because I sincerely hope that their mission statement hasn't changed to Black Lives Matter \*more than others\*.

In D's defense, she seemed to agree with me here. A bit more followed on this day, but I've hopped through enough rabbit holes just typing this, and I'd really rather not leap through yet another.

So, later that day, I text her, asking how her day went. I was under the presumption that when we agreed we were still fine, both of us meant it. Evidently she didn't? Because she doesn't read it until the day later (rare for her), and leaves the question on read for days on end (something she has never done). This prompts me to, on the Thursday immediately following the Sunday this took place on, post an abbreviated version of this story here on r/AskReddit. I received a couple comments with some advice, and one that helped me realize that yes, D is, in fact, tripping over her ego a little. Maybe it wasn't quite as evident in the way I portrayed it above, but I want to be fair to her. She was clearly acting on emotion and in a bit of a rage for part of it. I maintain to this day that I kept my cool. Was I upset? Totally! But did I let it control my civility? No. Also, everyone is a little biased. It's inherent. From my point of view, I was right, and I was calm. In her zealous point of view, she was undoubtably right, and I was probably ticking her off majorly. So I have to concede and not make her seem so flawed. Because really, D is a wonderful person. I don't know what I would do with myself if something happened to her. Anyway, y'all are probably here either to help or to get it on the juicy gossip here. So I'll quit blubbering.

Unfortunately, I was so wrapped up in the idea that understanding her point of view would make us get along better, that I couldn't stop thinking about it all day Friday at work. And so, I'm sorry u/[Throwaway1234asdfxx](https://www.reddit.com/user/Throwaway1234asdfxx/), but I did end up engaging. I guilted myself into trying to understand her once more. And admittedly, I was in the wrong for bringing the topic back up.

So I send a follow up text later in the afternoon asking if things are really okay. She plays it off as if they are, and asks how I've been. So, I do as I always am with her, and tell her the truth. I tell her that I cannot stop thinking about our conversation. She immediately says ""Why not? I suppose you're entitled to your opinion,"" which, honestly, should have been evidence enough that she wasn't over it. I inquire if she would mind me asking her a few questions in order to better understand her answers. I like to think that my response there was neutral enough.

So, I ask one of the questions I have more of a passing interest in first. I want to get the tedious ones out of the way. So, I ask her if she truly believes that men cannot and do not experience sexism. She does answer that she believes it now, but says that it can't be compared to the amount that women experience regularly. She tells me that no, she is not saying men cannot be discriminated against, just that men have far more social justice than women ever will. Now, to her credit, D was correct. Unfortunately, only in recent decades are women being treated like equals to men. There is very much a social problem.

I offer only the statement that in a lot of professional situations, like in office businesses, women may wear shorter dresses or skirts on very hot days, while men must keep wearing long pants. She never really justifies that with any answer, just sort of tells me the situation has made her see me in a different light that she's not happy with.

*Well, of course*, I think. And so I let her know that abusiveness in the gay dating scene is kind of a big problem nowadays. I tell her that I want to understand her, and that I don't understand why this should make her see me any differently. She answers that she doesn't get why I'm not understanding her point already.

Do you see how similar we are yet? Are you noticing any of my subtle hints that we're very stubborn yet?

I tell her that I'm merely looking for explanations, reasoning, that could change my mind. You know, how most people tend to change their minds? With new information? I explain why I asked if she believed men experienced sexism (she really, actually had me worried at the time), and her reply is that ""the gay dating scene for men is a major problem, but all that physical abuse is from OTHER MEN.""

Yes. Of course. Because women in a relationship could never be abusive. Also, is that not...redundant, given the context of the question?

Anyway, I concede, as I had more questions to ask. I try moving the conversation onward, but she continues dragging it back. Get this, she tells me, ""Your point of view is incredibly ignorant, you haven't looked at it from a woman's perspective. Women definitely are discriminated more that men.""

Yes. Of course I am. I literally, physically, cannot replicate an entirely different perspective. But it's not like she can see things from a man's perspective. So, I tell her that she cannot see it from a man's perspective. Her reaction?

""I AM SEEING IT FROM A MAN\['\]S PERSPECTIVE.""

At this point, D kind of shuts down. I reference her own argument from Sunday that she can't understand it. I wish I included that she couldn't help it for some vindictive justice, but I'm not that cruel. I instead try to level with her that it was my point all along. Neither of us can see every angle, and the only way to get the true angle is by seeing every angle possible. So, she gives up. She tells me to leave her alone. After trying once more, I yet again concede.

I send her one last message that, to put it briefly, admits I was in the wrong for bringing it up again, that I made a mistake in one of my arguments, that I've accepted that I'm not getting answers from her, and that I am incapable of understanding. I dedicated an entire paragraph to an apology for my assumption I could understand her. I apologized that I thought I could learn, and that I thought we could think on the same level again.  I admit my fault, apologize for upsetting her on so many levels, and tell her I hope we can be friends again. And lastly, I tell her we should change the subject if one of the debated topics comes up in a group chat that has the two of us in it if we want to avoid conflict. I tell her that the only way we would get over this is by not talking for a while, and I make sure to hammer in that I missed her, and don't see her any differently.

Well, nearly a week later, she texts me, telling me she's no longer mad, and asks if I was mad. Evidently, she was no longer hellbent on telling me I was wrong. So, I tell her that no, I was never mad, and let her make the choice on if we were going to remain friends or not. In the end, she decided that yes, she did want to mend our friendship, and that despite the past two weeks, she still considered me one of her closest friends.

We have chatted a little since then, but it feels like I'm walking through a war-torn battlefield. Like hallowed ground and like everything is uneasy.

SO! Question time. I'll bet you my dignity that you forgot you were supposed to be offering advice after reading that freakin' short story. Like, I could make two full chapters of a story out of this condensed version of it. Anyway, my questions are as follows: Can anyone help me better understand this? Do you believe that our friendship is truly on the mend? Am I deluded at all? Any advice on what I can do to ease the tension? Any advice on how to deal with the tension? Any idea when I won't feel so uneasy when talking to her? Do you know where I can find a life? And, lastly, why do I feel so badly for telling my best friend my standpoint on this?

I don't care much for politics, but I want answers, and if there's anything the internet has taught me, I can find answers on Reddit or 4chan, and I'd really rather not visit the latter based purely on its reputation (and because I already had a Reddit account, hahah). So, please, tell me your thoughts.

HINT: Joke's on you if you didn't forget you were supposed to be giving me advice, I don't have any dignity left!",03Jul2020,1

58,Ever since I was young I have felt things different than other people. I have always put on a fake persona when interacting with any people. Basically if you saw me alone without me knowing I would be like a completely different person I would talk act and do everything completely different. Not only is this just a fake persona to everyone else it feels like it’s automatic I think feel and do everything different. When I’m alone I seem not to feel much at all. I have very bad anxiety and mild depression so I know I’m not a psychopath but if my pet died even though I love it I wouldn’t really feel anything at all. I’ve had 2 cats one died of some animal in the woods and one died of being sick. I felt nothing even though I loved them. I constantly run scenarios through my head about all of the possible outcomes for every situation in my life that could happen. Whenever I sit or act around people I am aware of everything I do where I look if there is a reflection where I’m looking how will that make me look the way I walk talk act it feels like everyone is always watching my every move. This may have to do with the fact that I act completely fake around everyone else besides 1 person. I have never really had a good connection with my parents. I just don’t understand why when I’m alone I feel pretty much nothing at all and act completely different but when I’m near any person I feel and act completely different. I don’t fear death at all I don’t believe in god heaven or any higher power and I take everything burley logic based there have been many times I’ve gotten into arguments where I was taking everything the other person was saying purely logically and couldn’t understand what they meant when they tried to explain feelings taking a part in their decision. I see a therapist for my anxiety and depression I do not have any harmful thoughts. I do not use drugs. And I don’t really want help for this issue mainly because it makes me feel special.

I keep spending my money on shit I don’t need but makes me happy in the short-long term (its a problem at this point) and I just keep crying and procrastinating everything. 

I know the ideal life I want to have and I’ve gotten all kinds of advice from loved ones, strangers, friends, hotlines, the internet, self-help books, youtube, myself— and yet nothing seems to be enough. i can never satisfy myself and continue to push away loved ones most times. im so sick and tired of living sometimes and just want to give up on life because i know my life is not ideal and the way i want it to be because of my lack of action and yet i just can’t seem to push myself to be able to do more than the bare minimum.

I found it in the bottom of his cup holder and I don’t know what to do. I know my parents aren’t/haven’t been sexually active for a while so I can’t help but to think my dad has someone else... Because of work circumstances, my parents are physically apart for most of the year but their relationship has never been strained from that at all. They call multiple times a day when they’re apart and I genuinely believe they communicate more than couples who actually live together and see each other daily. Since corona and all, my whole family is living together again for at least a couple months, so in general, everything seemed really good and normal in the best way. He even got super drunk a few nights ago with his friends and while coming home he called my mom confessing how much he loves her even if he’s not the best at expressing it and that he still loves her the same as when they first met. Hopefully you see how torn apart I am about the situation now...

I keep thinking about the chance that my dad cheated on my mom but I just can’t see that as a possibility at all from what i grew up seeing. Like, they’re very close and they joke about having “side relationships” or even having a completely other secret family whenever the other parent doesn’t remember something about their past/says a wrong fact about them. People who are actually unfaithful to their partner could never joke about something like that right? If i have 100% faith in my parent’s marriage, should I just ask him? I mean, I’d be incredibly awkward asking about it but I can’t stop thinking about it.

I (26F) and my wife (30F) are both laid off and collecting unemployment right now. I’m high risk so I will not be returning to work right now as we are in a state that’s got high infection rates. 

However, my wife will likely be returning to work after July, depending on benefits and what changes with unemployment. Either way, we’ll be making what we need to survive but not much more than that. We have a couple grand in savings and everything not going to bills this month is going into savings too. 

Here’s my issue. Our phone bill is high and the service sucks. We’ve found another company with better service and lower prices. 

Our current phone bill is $220/mo for three lines (me, wife, and MIL) - the new company is ~$130/mo. 

We can either buy our phones and own them outright or pay up to 18mo of the lease and turn them back in. 
 
M: me, W: wife 

Prices are: 
Buyout: M - $358, W - $458
Pay 18mo: M - $170, W - $208 

I’m trying to figure out if it’s worth it to lose a big chunk of change right now in order to save at or over $100/mo. I know, mathematically, we’d save more over a year than we’d spend getting this all moved over. 

We also have the option of leasing one phone while buying out another - but we’d still owe the 18mo lease on the other. So if we did that with my phone, we’d pay $358 for me and $208 for her. Feels like we may as well own the phones outright and not have to lease them anymore.

75,"Hi! First time user here. It’s a habit of mine to read Reddit posts and never thought I would post here. Grammar may be off but feel free to correct my grammar. I (17F) had recently received an expensive pair of contacts to put on at night, sleep, and take it off following morning. These contacts comes with two cases actually, one to disinfect the contacts for six hours and the other to clean the contacts for dust. I know if any of these objects were to be tampered with, forgotten, or wrongfully used then I could end up blind. I must mention that I have never used contacts before in my life so this was a learning process. I’m squeamish when it comes to touching my eye so I end up taking two to three hours to put the contacts on before sleep. Which really drains my energy and confidence to be able to go on. I kind of temporarily given up because I know I can’t push my self to do it anymore. The reason why I got the contacts is because my mother thought it was a good idea to switch glasses for contacts since I end up losing glasses once every two years. I actually did use my glasses because I can’t see far to see school boards in classroom so it’s needed. I’m forgetful and end up misplacing my glasses until eventually lost. I know my mother took a year plan to pay for these expensive contacts and I don’t want to disappoint her.. but I feel I’m wasting her money both way if I continue to fail putting on the contacts. She knows I freaked out at the teaching process to put on the contacts and feel rather in between. But I haven’t told her I really want glasses because with this quarantine I’m stuck in a warm room with two baby brothers who are known to scavenge everything to play with along with my sister. I’m having these hour long headaches for straining my eyes and I need to make a decision. Any advice?",03Jul2020,1

77,"Hello fellow redditors, a people pleaser here.

For many reasons my current living situation is far from easy, I got into a lot of arguments with my current roommate and am looking forward to moving after this uni semester ends, but it’s currently 3 am where I live, I need to get up in 3 1/2 hours and I haven’t been able to even take a nap due to my roommate inviting his friends over. 

So, in 2 months I want to look for a new apartment but currently I am under immense pressure due to the end of the semester and therefore exams being around the corner. I also work 20 hours so I really do need my sleep to function.

I am extremely noise sensitive and will wake up from literally anything, and as my roommate today asked whether he can invite 3 friends over to watch movies, my stupid brain said “yes ofc”. Mainly because we’ve been fighting so much and I can’t deal with the stress right now. Anyways, now that I have laid awake for 4 hours I am really questioning how I can set this boundary, of him please not inviting friends when I have to get up so early. 

I feel like no matter what I say, it will resolve in fighting and him not listening anyways, but I can’t possibly get through this exam phase with only 2 hours of sleep every second night (him inviting people over during the week has happened more than once but usually I didn’t have to get up as early so it was okay.)  how can I respectfully set this boundary without sounding bitchy or controlling but rather respectful and considerate?",03Jul2020,1

79,"I’ll start this off by saying this is a very ongoing thing and I’ve come here for actual advice. 

I (M17) recently left my old friend group I’ve been apart of for about 4 years.. I left because 2 of the people in the group, one we’ll call Bob (M21) and the other we will call Tim (M20) have been hooking up and doing sexual things with underage girls. I didn’t feel comfortable with it anymore. I never really did to begin with but you have to understand I was apart of their group since I was 14. They desensitized what they were doing and manipulated me. I recently realized all of this and left. They did not take it well. They threatened me online and harassed me. Bob even said he’d kill himself if I exposed what they’d been doing to the world. I asked to be left alone and I had friends/family deal with helping me through it and they eventually stopped texting me for a couple days. Tim even (kind of) apologized. Well, today, one of the people in their groups ex, messaged him saying I had had sex with a girl while she was blackout drunk at a party. Even saying I had to “be physically separated from the girl”. These allegations are 100% false and fake. There’s no truth to them at all. I have no proof however I believe Bob &amp; Tim started this rumor to make me seem less credible. Honestly I don’t know what to do. I’m confused, angry, and scared. I need advice. 

Some things to note:

They know my address

I have collected evidence (text convos etc), incriminating them of getting with these underage girls. 

The group I’m hanging out with now, used to be friends with them as well, so I think they’re scared we will all expose them.

82,"This is kind of a long story.

So basically, about a two years ago I met this girl who i’ll call Alex. She was friend’s with my other friends at the time, and I didn’t really know her. She was new to the school though because she had recently immigrated to our town from Mexico.

I didn’t like her at first, but soon I became her friend. But over time, I began to think of her a bit differently. She would do things that wouldn’t exactly be friend like, such as holding my hand while walking, asking for a kiss on the cheek, cuddling with me, letting me play with her hair, dancing with me, and even traded hoodies with me when I decided to leave the school we went to.

She’s even confessed she loves me (presumably like a friend) and calls me her wife (as a joke). 

I realized I liked her, and I didn’t intend on telling her any time soon. But I care about her deeply, even when she got a boyfriend I swore I would be good to him and her and would be there for her regardless.

Fast forward a year, I started talking with this guy I kinda liked back when I went to the same school as Alex. This guy, who I’ll call Sam, was always a bit strange but we had a lot of the same interests. 

I would imagine myself being with Sam and in my head we were just a normal couple that did normal couple things. When we started talking online again I began to think we could start a relationship. So we did.

And it really has been great lately, he’s sweet, he respects me, we have tons of things in common.

But early on the relationship he said that he ‘loved me’, and I didn’t know how to respond. I ignored this and blammed it on feeling like we were moving too fast, but any time he compliments me or calls me cute or tells me he loves me, I kind of just feel,,,,off.

And recently, I saw Sam in real life, but he’s very awkward when he moves and walks and talks to people. He recently told me he was on the autism spectrum, which is not bad by any means, but it’s just not working with us when we’re in person together. He’s very forward with people he doesn’t even know, he’s very stiff when he interacts with me, and he has this manner of speaking that makes it seem like he’s better than me sometimes. (I don’t think he means to do any of these things, but they’re major turn off for me), And overall I feel like this may have been all in my head.

But then, I think of Alex, and it just feels like she gives me everything I want that Sam can’t give me, a relationship without actually being in one per say. I don’t know if she likes women, and I don’t think I would confess to her, at least not yet. But I feel like, realistically I should move on from her.

Sam gives me everything I want from a normal stable relationship, but our interactions in real life always feel off to me and I never really feel truly attracted to him. But Alex who I feel very attracted to and have even confessed to myself that I love, may not even like women the way I do, despite giving me everything socially and intellectually that I want.

Should I get over my crush on Alex and settle with Sam, or should I dump Sam and pine over Alex as a single girl? Any advice would be fantastic.",03Jul2020,1

85,"My mother has a history of instability, untreated mental illness, physical aggression and volatility and it’s beginning to rub off on my sister and I want her to have a better life than our brother and I.

The instability is deep-rooted. When my brother and I were infants, my mother dropped us off at our grandmother’s house and fled. I am aware the legal term is, “abandonment.” The thing is... I think she gets these qualities from my grandmother who abused her while she was growing up... My grandma abused my brother and I until DCF took us away and from there we lived in foster care until my mother was awarded custody of us when we were tweens... But even so... my mother decided not to work and so we moved around for years... living in shelters... being homeless... living with “friends,” of hers... then shelters again... Until she was given housing. Aside from refusing holding a job—which to me is minor—she is unstable in many other way and always has been.

For one, she does not clean up after herself to a disturbing extent and it has always been that way. In 2019, I visited her on New Years to celebrate with her, my sister and brother and the Thanksgiving leftovers including a moldy turkey was in the fridge with broken eggs... spilled juice... spoiled milk... and other leftovers that were clearly weeks old. It was not the first time the fridge was this bad... but I took pictures without her knowing and have them. 
Not only this but in February I went over again,  she had used pads lying around the house... blood on the toilet... cigarette butts around the house... her dirty undergarments and trash around the house... she had a coffee table that is literally all ashes and trash... real trash... And it is like this often, not just the last time I went to her house. She never appears dirty but her home is dirty and my system wreaks of cigarettes 24/7 because my mother smokes inside on top of all that... and she also does not change the litter box so the home also wreaks of litter and biological waste.

For two, she has an off-the-record history of being physically violent and my sister has told me that my mother has been beating her. My sister also told me that my mother held a knife to herself—like she has in front of my brother and I many times before—and said she was going to kill herself, blaming my sister, saying, “you drive me fucking crazy.” In addition, someone filed a 51A on my mother because they heard my sister say she was going to kill herself and she is 10... I believe she is mimicking our mother.

My mother also gets into various altercations with other adults because she is so volatile and childish about pretty much everything. She is conservative which is 100% fine but she uses racial slurs 24/7, says “blacks in the neighborhood are jealous of me because they look like monkeys,” and a lot of other problematic things and so people hate her and in turn sort of shun my sister. My mother also caught my sister telling me bad things that she has been doing and so... my mom is accusing me of being a Marxist and trying to brainwash my sister... she says I’m not allowed to see her and I haven’t since February.

My sister keeps telling me about physically and emotionally abusive things my mother has been doing over Snapchat and I don’t save the messages because then they save on her side and my mom can see them. My sister has to delete everything she says about my mom. I also asked my system if she would, “tell an adult who can help,” about our mom (DCF) but my sister is so scared. My mom tells her that children who tell on their parents, “go to hell.”

I have pictures of the mess, I have filed a couple 51As myself... and DCF was involved with my mom when my brother and I were in high school due to our teachers being concerned about us.

It seems that whenever I talk to a social worker, there aren’t many options for me to go through with attempting to get custody of my sister. I have NOT showed them photos yet but I am putting things together to do so now.

Another side note, my therapist believes my mother has an undiagnosed me y’all illness like Bipolar l, ll or Borderline but she of course cannot make a diagnoses just by what I say. My mother swings from extremes and will go to extreme lengths to get what she wants. My sister’s dad is a drug addict and my mom told me that if he ever tried to get custody of her I need to lie and say he sexually assaulted me—which I obviously would never do that... and when I told her that, I got kicked out—at 15-years-old... but then she let me back in that same week. It’s hard to talk about this because I feel like my mother’s illness somehow makes me seem ill... and I struggle with sharing these things... but I am ready to save my sister.

I am 23, I have been in a stable relationship for 7 years... I have my own 3-bedroom apartment... I have pets who are well-cared for... I am in college as a Physics Major and I have my own business. My boyfriend and I have extremely stable income, too. We live in the same town as my mother, too and I work I do work on the side for the Town... so I have a pretty good resume and I think I am qualified to care for my sister especially considering my mother’s temperament.

I am Male, 11 years old, and I think I am bisexual

I have had very strong feelings about this for the past few months. I am about to start sixth grade and am lucky enough to have great school counselors. 

So let's start at the beginning. I am a Christian, but nobody in my family is very religious-we go to church twice a year, and I don't think I will be okay with going to it if I come out- and my parents(who I have a very good relationship with) have stated a few times that they are completely fine with LGBTQ+, and my mom has shown some support for the community. My friends are also mostly ok with it I think, but they have made lots of jokes implying that being gay is bad but I don't think they are serious(""dude, that's so gayy"" and stuff like that). A few months ago I think I started undergoing puberty, and I started to realize that I was attracted to girls and boys in my class, particularly one of my best friends. I also have 2 brothers, 19(as of today), and 20. I have a good relationship with the older one, but the 19-year old bullies me a lot.

90,"Obligatory ""I'm on mobile, sorry for any typos.""

Ok, so this is kind of a weird situation and my first time posting, but I've seen people provide helpful advice in other situations/rulings so I figured why not. Again, sorry if this isn't the best place for it.

For context, I was formerly an assistant with a university's T/F program, and worked an entire season with the team. Around October I was just looking for some history on the head coach, because I realized I made the mistake of taking a job without realizing what I was getting myself into. I stumbled upon an old thread from a running forum where several anonymous collegiate coaches had mentioned my boss's name and we're commenting on how he's been lying about his career, both athletic and coaching. 

I started to get a little suspicious, but I couldn't fully confirm their statements were true, so I decided put it to the back of mind and just observe. Now, I obtained my personal training certs (PT, CES, CSCS) and my USATF Level 1 coaching certificate. This by no means makes me a fully experienced coach, but I'm able to identify poor coaching/practice plans when I see them. After I saw that thread of comments, I started to notice when my boss would be lying about things, how his stories about the same thing would change and how his practice plans were starting to cause some issues for our athletes (fatigued beyond a normal training cycle, injuries, burnout, etc.). When meets came around we would essentially run the athletes into the ground and they started to voice concerns about their training, which were warranted complaints in my opinion. I slowly realized that I was duped, but for the sake of the team I stayed quiet, helped the athletes as much as I could in my capacity, and worked with them through the competition season. Shortly after COVID  closed the school and ended the season, in March, I informed my boss I wouldn't be returning for the next season. He wasn't happy to say the least, but all I said was that the position and university wasn't a good fit and kept my composure while he voiced his frustration. 

Fast forward to now, and a few days ago I went down a rabbit hole and began looking into his athletic and coaching career. I found multiple pieces of evidence that confirmed he had lied about nearly everything he used on his resume. There is no record he made it to the Olympic trials, no record he ran at the school he tells people he ran at, no record of his coaching certifications, no record of the accolades he publically boasts about, and his biographies from previous schools are inconsistent when they're compared with one another. Once I had confirmation, I realized that I should probably inform the athletic director he didn't properly vet this guy. However, I know if he is fired (though unlikely) then it puts the current athletes at risk of having no real coach heading into the start of the year. I don't really know if I should say something, but I feel like I have to. Is it sound to anonymously inform the AD knowing full well it could logically be traced back to me? I care about the athletes I coached and I don't want them in a worse situation than what they're currently in. 

TL;DR: Former boss lied about basically everything on his resume. I think he's putting the athletes at risk and I feel like I should say something. Don't know if my actions will ultimately cause more problems for the athletes.",03Jul2020,1

92,"Hey Reddit, I need some help.

This isn’t a post where it’s about solving a problem, it’s moreso about stop getting me worried that there will be a physical problem. So, to cut to the chase, when I was a kid, I was stupid, as most kids are.

I used to sell things linked to emails, and have since given away two emails that used to be mine. Both of them contained personal information, just my date of birth and real name. The person doesn’t seem to care and seemingly doesn’t care about either email anymore.

I realized they never changed the password on one of them and got into it, it’s seemingly been abandoned for a long while. The person doesn’t appear to be active on the internet anymore and seemed to be of similar age to me.

There’s also the fact I revealed my first name on a forum a while back, a forum which I was toxic on, which worries me a lot it will follow me into my social life if anyone finds it and notices any correlation. There is really nothing I can do to cover anything up, I’ve done pretty much everything I can do.

The person with the emails never seemed malicious and like I said, has appeared to have been inactive on the internet for a while now. The people on the forum have since forgiven me since they know I have since changed.

Do I truly have anything to worry about? If I do, is there anything that can be done? If not, what should I do to stop worrying about it?

I desperately need money, but even now I struggle to convince the employers that I’m motivated for the job beyond just needing it, and I’m a terrible actor.

94,"this is quite a nerve wracking post for me to make, so i'm sorry if this sounds quite convoluted. 

my life has been essentially summed up by this constant feeling of being taken from, feeling small, feeling worthless, and feeling like nothing in the eyes of people in my life that i cared about. 

it is a pattern that has followed me in all my relationships, i tend to attract in ""damaged"" people in one way or another, and my very externally calm, open-minded, accepting personality makes me a bit of a magnet to people that are looking to take out their self-anger and hatred on someone else.

either my relationships start off on this foot, or they turn into this overtime. they get away with doing whatever they want to me, i try to speak up, and i always have been shut down. either ""listened to"" but not really taken seriously (so the behaviour goes back to square 1), yelled at to shut up and called derogatory names, or have my feelings being used to fuel someone else's shame instead of growth. 

with this happening in all my relationships, i've learned to rarely fight back. i strongly identify myself with feeling small, powerless, worthless, and like nothing. when i feel like ""something"", like somebody with worth or with individual meaning, i instantly feel horrible, and i want to take myself back to a place where i was being emotionally used and manipulated in.

i feel so much shame whenever i try to move on with myself and my life, because i feel all this guilt about not being able to ""stick it out"" for someone, or not being able to ""help them"". 

but i know this isn't right, and i'm tired of living life like this. my parents, former friendships, and former relationships have all enforced this behaviour in me, and i think i've become a slave mentally to it. i wish i could just break free from it, but it comes back within hours to warp me into a mentality of guilt, shame, and weakness.

I had really short hair and never acted as a typical girl. This girl who was in my grade came up to me and said “why do you look like that, girls aren’t supposed to dress like that”. And as a new kid, all the attention was on me, and it made me feel uneasy. I sort of brushed it off but she kept coming up to me and saying more intrusive things. Asking if I was gay or transgender, what genitals I have, why do I look like a boy, why do I dress like a boy, etc. I was uncomfortable but she didn’t seem to care. She then later called me homophobic and transphobic slurs and shoved me whenever she saw me in the hallways. She also had a habit of playing with my hair and touching me.

103,"Hello. I'm looking for advice on how I can be more original and gets more ideas going on in my head. 

I know this seems like a stupid and rather self explanatory problem, but I honestly find that almost always, in the stories or games I like write, I often take inspiration from other works that inspired me... or atleast thats what I would tell myself.

I often find myself in a cycle of creating something like a story or game based on another work, but mostly using its elements with some of my own changes, to the point where I'm in a constant state of trying to change the story elements to be more original but I keep changing things back. It's difficult to describe so let me give you an IRL example.

I'm writing (in script format) a Superhero TV Animated series story about a future world where a majority of the world's inhabits (called Superhumans) have some type of superpower, ranging from something impractical/arbitrary to extremely powerful. With this Hero's and Villians, just like the ones in the comics, become a real life profession and problem respectively. The story follows a boy named Cole who is born without a power but wishes to become a Hero, but everyone doubts him because he's Human, not a Superhuman. He meets his famous Hero Idol, Mighty Eagle, who, after seeing Cole do some heroic acts, decides to share his power with Cole and train him to how to use his newfound power, as well as enroll him in a Specialized ""Hero Academy"", to help him achieve his dreams.


The might sound familiar, because it's almost a carbon copy My Hero Academia's story. I admit MHA is the main inspiration, along with a few other works like ""The Incredibles"", ""Watchmen"", and various other superhero media. 


I realize I try and tell myself that I'm just ""taking inspiration"" from their works, but I think I know deep down that I'm just imitating them with minimal changes cause I cannot come up with many new ideas that I love and want to use. 


Has anyone else had this problem? I don't want to be derivative wirh my creative endeavors. I don't know if it's that I'm not creative as I think I am, my anxiety disorder, or if my mind just works that way. I just want to ask if anyone else has this problem and what advice they can give me.

Over the course of a few months I have been dealing with GERD and having some ppis for it until i switched to pepcid. In addition, I have noticed over the last months that my body hair has gotten thin and my scalp has bald spots on it. My heart is racing every time i get up and i think i might have cancer.

106,"Hello, My Name is Dalton (20M) and I'm someone who enjoys writing games, aswell as stories for different mediums. I have a problem, I often find myself treading to close works that inspire me.

I'm looking for advice on how I can be more original and gets more ideas going on in my head. 

I know this seems like a stupid and rather self explanatory problem, but I honestly find that almost always, in the stories or games I like write, I often take inspiration from other works that inspired me... or atleast thats what I would tell myself.

I often find myself in a cycle of creating something like a story or game based on another work, but mostly using its elements with some of my own changes, to the point where I'm in a constant state of trying to change the story elements to be more original but I keep changing things back.

108,"I'll refer to my ex best friend as E
And my other friend as J

So this happened a few days ago. I've had feelings for my (now ex) best friend's bf even before they started dating, we had both liked him and we both knew that we both liked him and I had initially suggested neither of us should date him cause it would make the other jealous, well she goes and has s*x with him and they dated for about a month and they broke up during the whole covid thing ( they started dating in march and broke up in april) . Flashforward to a few days ago, we all hung out again and those feelings came back to my mind (I still liked him even throughout their relationship) and I had told E that I still had feelings for him and she never said anything and also made a dumb joke about her not being mature (E being 19 at the time and me being 21) again she never said anything. So, I ask J to maybe say to the guy that I still liked him and was hoping if he wanted to get to know me romantically to which he rejected me. On Sunday I got a message from E that I'm a horrible backstabbing friend because I went behind her back because I was going after him without consulting her first, and because I hit a really low point ( I have severe mental health issues and severe self esteem issues) and wanted to be left alone I was a bad friend because I was ignoring her, to which she told me that I constantly do this and I'm just a sh*t human being I had told her that I was struggling with alot and she makes herself out to be the victim just because I have those feelings.

112,"Throwaway for reasons.

I have a best friend - We've been friends for more than 3 decades total, we've spent most of our lives together. I'm unable to figure out a scenario where he doesn't end up homeless or dead within the next year.

While he was a teenager, he was able to live with his mother in his mother's house, as most kids do. After that, he's been living with girlfriends - He's been the ""house husband"" so to speak. The girls go to work, he takes care of the house. 

Sort of. 

He has crippling clinical depression. Not the *""I feel under the weather today""* kind, the *""I haven't been able to get out of the closet for 4 days and i'm literally starving to death because I don't want to eat""* depression.  As such, he hasn't worked for quite a while. Since he was a teenager. He's physically and mentally incapable of doing it.

As such, his latest girlfriend finally got tired of it and cut the cord - With it, his source of income, and his source of, well, living. 

He has since located very far away, as places are cheaper out that way. Thankfully, he has a bit of money left since his mother has passed on, but spending money without making money is not a winning proposition. Eventually the money will run out and he will be without a place to live. As he's incapable of working, this will simply mean homelessness.

He's a really smart guy, in certain ways. Good chef. Great wilderness lore. Very worldly. Has traveled as much as limited income allows, hitchhiked across the country. The problem is that doesn't translate into any jobs if 2 or 3 times a week he wakes up and physically can't get out of bed.

Things I can't do for him:

- Move in with him. Because of my job and the fact that living with a clinically depressed person would ruin my own mental health, I can't live with him.

- Pay for him. In theory, I *could* help finance him to live in a place but this is **not a long term solution** and would end up with me feeling like a debt collector to someone who can never pay. Not the relationship I want with my friend.

- Convince his family to take him in. His limited close family knows by now there is no fixing his issues short of a mental health hospital long term stay, and frankly, they don't want to deal with the constant issues as well. 

He has also discussed checking into a mental care facility but is horribly concerned that if he goes in, he'll never come back out.  While I understand the concern, I also don't think the way he's living is going to lead him to a good place either.

So Reddit, any advice on what to do? Ever have a situation like this? I figure he's got many 4 months until the money runs out and he eventually heads to the streets, unable to do anything else. From there, it's a bumpy ride at best, and most likely much worse.",03Jul2020,1
113,"So I have this coworker who constantly talks to me about all sorts of heavy topics while we're eating lunch. Christianity (I'm an atheist), BLM and protesting (she criticises the whole thing), political views (definitely different from mine), and today she went off about Pizzagate and how the Democrats are torturing and sacrificing children, in detail, and trapped me into watching an interview video with her volume all the way up blasting this stuff in our lunchroom. 

I am a good listener and a curious person so I usually don't mind hearing people out, but I'm afraid that it's getting excessive and I really just want to eat my lunches in peace. Plus I don't really want someone else to walk in on us talking about that sort of thing.

 You don’t have to reply to this, I just wanted to let you know that I am so sorry about how things ended between us and for how shitty I was to you. I was selfish, inconsiderate, immature, I can’t even list all the adjectives. I was so wrapped up in my bullshit that I let myself become a somehow *shittier* person.  I wasn’t treating you the way that people should treat their friends, and that was really unfair of me. I can’t imagine how that made you feel, and I wish to god I had had some fucking sense. I don’t expect anything from you but, and I know it’s a few years too late, I owe you this apology. I’ve wanted to say for a long time now, but before the last year I couldn’t even look back and say that I wasn’t that same shitty person, and it wouldn’t have meant anything other than an attempt to make myself feel better, and that’s not what I want. I was a bad friend to you and a worse roommate. I’ve realized over the last couple of years that during the time we first moved down there I was a person that I didn’t like and I didn’t want to be. I didn’t know how to deal with that because I couldn’t blame it on my family any longer. I didn’t deal with it, and I took it out on you and that was so fucking awful of me. I really, genuinely hope that you’re getting the good things you deserve from the world now. If you can forgive me, it would mean the world but there is no part of me that thinks you owe that to me because I said I’m sorry.",03Jul2020,1

119,"So I never really had friends before high school. I was anxious, depressed, and was just disgusted by the thing that I was. Then I met 2 people (who ill call, A and B) who I'm still friends with 9 years later. A was always so honest and transparent, sure of who they were. And B was supportive with a shoulder to cry on. Since meeting them, I've done a lot of work on myself. I went to several therapists and social workers, got put on medication, improved my self talk and self image, slowly built my confidence up, and generally became a stronger person. I'm in a great place in my life now and though I put in most of the work, I do think meeting A and B when I did taught me a lot about people that I didn't know and made me want to come out of my shell, unafraid of what people would think. They made me want to be my genuine self and find happiness.

Of course I love them, but its been 6 years since high school and they're still so similar. 

A is so afraid of making mistakes (or rather, it's more like they look down upon people who make mistakes) that they don't do or learn anything new unless they can eliminate all uncertainty and discomfort. Instead of learning from shitty things that happen to them or from mistakes they do inevitably make, the experience goes on to affirm that belief and further shelter themselves. (example. A tried making bacon for the first time when we lived together and burnt it and it was salvaged/thrown out. Instead of trying again, they decided not to cook any kind of meat, despite liking it. Instead, it was an unspoken rule that any meat we ate would be bought and cooked by me. That way, if another mistake was made, it would be made by me). And B, rather than face and own their mental health problems and extreme self loathing, runs from it by overworking themselves, involving themselves in others problems, and ignoring their mental health, all the while blaming every therapist that hasn't instantly solved their problem and themselves for being inherently wrong. B wants people to tell them what to do (example: ""should I go back to school or take a second job? If I don't go to school It will be too late to go and I'll ruin my life, but if I do go to school, there'll be a gap in my employment history and no one will hire me and it will ruin my life. Tell me what to do""). But also, it seems B thinks that external change like a good job and losing weight will fix they're mental health and therefore they can't waste time improving their self image until later, which is why they end up thinking so self destructively. B relies entirely on others to constantly reassure them that theyre not garbage because they can't do it themselves.

In short, I love my friends, but it has become exhausting to be around them. They simply don't want to grow beyond what they are comfortable with. That's they're business but it's difficult to be constantly working towards self improvement and finding the life I truly want when you're surrounded by people who haven't changed in years and see no problem in that. I want to go out and meet new people but am also afraid of distancing myself from the oldest friendships I have. Really, I'm not sure what to do, or if there even is anything to do.",03Jul2020,1

I have really bad signal so I really hope this goes through. Long story short, my family and I spent the day hiking in the woods in Pennsylvania/New York.

It’s a really shady cabin that looks nice in the daytime but at half of the locks on the house don’t work. First sign that this place is sketch but moving on. Once my family and I came home I was way too tired to do anything else and I fell asleep. They woke me up to tell me they were going to go on our boat in the local reservoir. This was around maybe 5 pm possibly earlier. I went back to sleep. When I woke up again it was roughly 9:30 and already pitch black outside. The shades on the window next to my bed broke and that’s horror movie code for I shouldn’t look out the window. But I can’t help it.

Straight to the point- my roommate V has a 2 month old kitten and she’s been all alone in V’s room for over 2 days now (I think V is out of town). She’s been meowing and whining at the door and I just feel so bad for her (it’s locked). I texted V to make sure that she at least had food and water. When she didn’t respond in an hour, I took one of her fancy feast cans, opened it and slid it under her door just in case along with a small cup of water.  Later she responded saying that she does indeed have food and water and that “she’s fine”. 

Admittedly, I don’t know much about cats. However, it just doesn’t seem right to leave a KITTEN without any kind of company for days on end. Even if she has a lifetime’s supply of food and water in there, she’s still just a baby. The fact that she’s been making so much noise is clear proof that she isn’t happy in there.

I went to sleep at around 2 am and woke up at 7 am, then I took 1 more sleep at 4 pm until 9 pm and went to sleep again at 4 am and I just woke up now at 8 am. It's so bizarre that I'm afraid I can't fix this because whenever I tried to fix it, it's just getting worse. At this point, I don't give a single fuck about my classes and I tried to focus on my well-being. During quarantine, I never exercise and I think it could have contributed to it. 

I can't even acknowledge when is my sleeping schedule and it's so random during the day(usually after meal). Should I start exercising now or should I see a doctor? or Should I just tried 1 more time to pull out all nighters and see how it turns out???

137,"Long story short, I’m a 26 year old female who is about to graduate from college. My mom was never a good mother. Always brought drugs and abusive men into our lives as kids. 8 marriages. All divorced. No stability, no security as kids, emotionally neglected. My mother gets stage four cancer given 2-6 months to live. I help her through every step of treatment. The amount of damage I’ve done to my body helping her - long nights, no sleep, the mental emotional anguish. The list goes on. I even lost my good paying job that gave me healthcare because of missing so much work to take care of her. My 4 siblings don’t help. My sister is just like my mom in the emotional abuse department and undiagnosed mental illness leading to drug addiction category  of people. 

My mom lives with me and my boyfriend in our house. However lately my mother isn’t respecting clear communicated boundaries I’ve given her and has said racist remarks about my boyfriend, who I feel will one day be my husband and the father of my children. She has done countless other acts of violence and verbal and emotional abuse towards me since she moved in. 

I don’t want my mother or my sister in my life anymore as I feel they honestly are bad people. However my mom is terminally ill and has had two strokes and two brain surgeries, but she can get around well and even drives. She seems to have all her faculties besides the things I’ve mentioned - which were also prevalent through my childhood. 

What do I do? I don’t know if I could live with myself if I asked her to leave.",03Jul2020,1
138,"IRL, I hang out almost exclusively with peers. Excepting family members, anyone else will only get small talk out of me.

Online is a different story. A large chunk of my casual online buddies are teens. I have the purest of intentions and don't seek them out. We have similar interests and it just happens. I also don't consider them close friends. We play games, share art and memes, discuss theories, that type of shit. 

I'm even of the opinion that careful friendships(?) between teens and young adults should be encouraged because it can help *both* grow, similar to how a 10th grader can gain a better understanding of math by tutoring a 9th grader, but with life. I also want to know your thoughts on that, specifically. Am I right?

Despite all of this, I just can't shake the feeling that I'm doing something wrong being friends with people as young as 14. It's obvious I can't avoid them entirely. There's some people I chat with on a regular basis who's ages I still don't know because it's just never come up.

TLDR is the title. I'm more seeking on how to handle my conflicting emotions here, since, logically, I believe I'm perfectly fine. I'm very strict with boundaries and think segregating teens only makes the transition into adulthood harder, because honestly, who here thinks an 18 year old is any less of a dumbass that a 17 year old.

142,"Please hear me out, I'm torn up about this. I've been friends with a girl who was born in Japan for a solid 2 years now, and we talk for hours every day. As I was going through some old records I found out something about my family that really tore me up. 

When my great grandpa was a welder in the 1940's, along with his weekly work he got a set of blueprints that didn't seem out of the ordinary. The only difference was that the memo line was blank, which was fine. He wasn't entitled to project details because he was a factory floor worker, and even the higher ups didn't know what it was. They were just untitled instructions from company higher ups from company higher ups from company higher ups.  He was only given the small parts to weld and that was that. He finished it in about an hour and didn't think about it. 

A few months later, the bombs that ended WW2 were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. My great grandfather soon got a placard in the mail stating ""Thank you for your service.""

It turned out he had worked on a small part of the dropping mechanism that went inside the plane to drop the bombs. No one was told what the pieces were, or why they were making them, and the pieces were so small and tiny bits of blueprints sent out to so many facilities that no one could put them together in any way to guess what the U.S was doing, as the government didn't want their secret to get out.  He was such a quiet pacifist who didn't even like the idea of war as I'm told, and regretted it deeply and silently until the day he died. 

I can't help but feel bad for the hundreds of thousands of lives that were lost that day, and nothing can make up for that. Yet at the same time, I can't control the family I happened to born into or their actions. I never have and never will condone bombs or war or gruesome murder of civilians purely to win something, but I still feel partially responsible for thw things my bloodline has done despite the fact that it happened many years before my birth and not to their knowledge. My friends is Japanese born, and it feels like a lie to not disclose that sort of thing to her if it would hurt her to know. If I told her, I would definitely fullyapologize for my ancestors actions, but I don't want to burden her with the knowledge of that sort of thing. Please help, do I tell her or not?",03Jul2020,1

158,"Hi everyone, I hope you are all doing well.

I am currently working on a book discussing the philosophy of animals in storytelling, and how they can be excellent tools for representing the film's various themes, motifs, and ideas. I am doing this by publishing papers on my blog. When I get to at least 30 published posts developing around this theme, I will start collecting them together and editing them to fit a book format.

The only problem is, I have been spending a lot of time alone. Until I finish my classes and kick-start my freelance writing career, I will continue to work at my 9-5 job at my local grocery store (Will not disclose the company for privacy purposes).

I'm always thinking about what films I should watch next, and what I want to discuss in my next piece. Sometimes I feel guilty for not watching a movie centered around this theme because I just want to work on this book and maintain frequent posts for my audience. 

My audience is rapidly growing and everyone seems to love my content when it comes out, and it makes me feel so appreciated, and it gives me the motivation to make the next piece even better.

Don't get my wrong, I love writing and I love studying movies. It is in no way compulsive
However, in my free time, unless someone offers to spend time with me, I am either writing, or watching a movie for research purposes. My only other pastimes I have are playing games with my coworkers online, or going swimming in my pool during the day. 

I wake up early in the morning so I can have extra time to work on my project. 

Sometimes, I feel myself distancing from people because I have been spending so much time by myself. I try and plan my days out every day so I can get some work/research done, even if it's just an hour. 

I feel that I should also mention that my father hasn't exactly been someone easy to like. He's not abusive, but he never taught me anything when I was growing up, or spent time with me unless he was smoking (or in present day for that matter), because he's so obsessed with my mother. I won't go too much into it, but basically he has no uniqueness, as the only thing he wants to do is spend time with her, and whenever she goes out he demands that me or my brother go with her. When she goes out with her friends, he gets very upset. They have been together for 2 decades.

This is important because I have lived with this person my whole life (I am 23). My mother essentially had to be a mom and a dad. I had to accept at some point that he is never going to be the father I want him to be. I learned everything I needed to know and became the person I am today because of the movies I love. When he is home, he gives everyone in the house anxiety and I stay cooked up in my room. Until I can start my freelance writing career, I am stuck in the house for financial reasons.

I'm very proud of myself for using movies as a coping mechanism and for teaching myself how to practice self love and be a self sufficient individual. But I fear that, with the combination of my obsession with my book, and my harsh relationship with my father, my writing may has been getting too far.

I may have been overthinking this.

I have always felt like I could wait..but I recently meet a guy and dated for a bit...really thought he might be the one to loose it too, but But he told me he didn’t want a serious relationship more along something causal. But that we could even do causal without sex...And than just recently switched up to wanting to be friends because he is not ready for something that might turn into a relationship. Im not going to fault the guy I believe he is telling the truth and I do think it’s one of those times where he just isn’t ready for a relationship..although obviously I get that I haven’t exactly made him think im the “one”. 

I was originally proud of myself for not letting go of my personal “morals”knowing I want to wait for it to be with someone who is serious about me, but now I’m feeling more regret than anything. I think it’s because  I got pretty close intimately with them and was really ready for it to happen. When it didn’t and it was my choice I now realize I’m more bummed than anything else and ya know... equivalent Of blue balls. 

But I do know that I did like this guy so I’m afraid that I might hurt myself and I would literally be doing it knowingly if I choose to have sex with him and get more attached than I should. But I think I can control my emotions. 
At the same time I realize too that the first time is not always great. But I feel like he had the patience and respect to be able to make it a bit special. He was really nice and understanding of me when we did get close. I also trust this guy and I have a hard time doing that with guys. Super respectful...god I cake stress that enough.

168," I'll  try to put this into as much detail and unbiased as I possibly can. I  met a girl when I was 14 years old (we will call her H)(f22). She was  dating a close friend of mine (we will call him J)(m22) at the time. He   started dating her immediately after we met her, keep in mind J has  always been competitive with me growing up (all the way up  until now  being 22, especially with women for some reason) (J would  often tell   people he could beat me in a fight but was always friendly too my face).   They dated for a few months until they eventually  broke it off    because  supposedly J was talking to other women. We  started chatting    and hit it  off and began dating, although I didn't  feel much of a    connection with  her (she's very quiet and rather shy).  I broke it off   with her after three days because on top of not  having much of a  connection with her, J  would shoulder me in the hall  and act very cold  towards me. I figured a  long term friendship is  more valuable then   this  new girl even though we  had a lot in common  and she was very    beautiful. Fast forward some years  J had never  really forgiven me and    was always rather bitter with me,  telling me  that the girls I liked    wanted to be with him (even when it  wasn't  true) and still  convincing   people he could fight me. After high   school I sort of  closed off that   section of my life and began seeing a   new girl named  S. I didn't have   many friends and although I was  rather  lonely with  S, I was happy. S   was a very traditional woman,  and to be  honest  probably the most   amazing girl I have ever dated  (and you'll   understand my serious   regrets in a moment). While dating  S, H comes  back  to message me at   about age 17 or 18 saying she misses  me. I  think she  was kind of   jealous of what I had with S. This is  where I  screwed up big  time. I   end up leaving S for H only to have H  move  cities and not talk  to me   again. Keep in mind this is where I   started to notice a pattern  that H   had. Even though I would foolishly   fall for her beauty and  remarkable   similarities to me (taste in   shows, music, dreams, etc) I  started   noticing some very dark behavior   in her. She would post on  Twitter   talking about how she thinks she   should be flattered by all of  the   attention she gets from other   girl's boyfriend's etc etc. At this  point   I started to feel I really   messed up. S and I got back together  but I   had to break up because I   knew I wasn't a good enough man for her,  on   top of the guilt of   betraying her for someone from my past. Fast    forward the last 2 or 3   years I've sort of lost myself in depression and    suicidal thoughts,   basically consuming any and all drugs I can get my    hand on. To add   insult to injury, J is still rather cold with me. I    remember talking   to him on Xbox to see if he wanted to play anything  and   him   exclaiming that another one of my exes from high-school was  good in     bed, etc etc (it's worse than that but I won't go into  detail). H had     started communicating with me again just last year  saying that she     believes in me and still has feelings for me etc etc. J  messages me     being rather nice asking if I still like her and if he  should take her     on vacation to his cottage. I said yes I kind of liked  her and he   said   he wouldn't take her. I was like okay cool. She ended  up going   anyways   and posting pictures of herself there with captions  saying   ""finally."" J   then talks to me again bragging in detail about  all of   the sexual stuff   they did together and now H (for some reason)  is   upset that I won't   accept her back into my life. I just feel kind  of   lost at the moment.   Since rejecting H she's been posting sexual    pictures to Instagram and   has called me a ""scrub"" on multiple    occasions because I won't buy a car   to go see her. I just feel kind of    trapped in life I guess, as if   powerless to keep these people away    from me. I know the moment I get   successful, these same people will    come back into my life. I'm just   tired and I really don't know where    to turn. Do I give this girl and my   friend J another chance, or is  it   just one of those toxic relationships   that will go on forever. It    seriously hurts but I feel as if it's my   place to just be crapped  on   by these people. I've tried to separate   myself from these people  but   they get even more upset with me (I think   they're addicted to  this   toxic cycle, but I'm actually the first person   to realize  what's going   on). Do you guys have any tips on going no   contact? I'm  actually at   the point where I can feel myself becoming   violent.  It's as if I've   had everything stolen from me and there's   no-one to  blame because I   simultaneously gave it away. What should I do?

tl;dr:    Girl keeps playing mind games with me and I'm unsure if she genuinely  is interested in me or  she just wants my attention so she can withdraw it all over again. Should I give her a  chance or just move on?",03Jul2020,1
169,"Hello! So after receiving a referral from my friend who works at Taco Bell, I got an interview for tomorrow. My friend has told me that he really only asks when you're available and the interview only lasts 20 minutes. However, I want to impress the manager and really make an outstanding impression. I know it's only for a crew member position at a Taco Bell, but I believe you should do your best in everything you do. So my question is, are there any specifx prompts going to be asked? Like, a question every manager asks? Also, what should I wear? How should I style my hair? (I have shoulder-length, wavy hair). Also, I cut my nails real short and painted with a clear coat. I will, of course, wear my mask. I think I will wear black, nice jeans and a black shirt with probably a few nice buttons or something. Also, I will wear some black Sam Edelman flats.

I’m wondering if I should get a letter of recommendation from him for when I move on from the job I just got. I intend to keep it long enough to get an associates then move into that career.

173,"Before i start i don't think my english is perfect, please don't too rude.

It's been 1 year and 6 month i have i gf, before we have this relation ship, she tried to commit a sucide and she tell me what she done. I try to save her, i ask to my parents if she can live with us to start a new life and they agree. 9 month later, she rent a apartment and i live with her. My friends tried to *protect* me and says she can give me his depression because she was too unstable of his mental state. They started to blame me because i spent more times for her than my friends. I saw him 2 3 times per week instead 5 6 times. I lose my best friend that way and its more complicate, this friendship was good during 10 years and now its finish.

My gf lose her job there is 2 weeks and she started to become depressed again. One time she had a nervous breakdown and start to says in front of me, she want to die. When i hear that, i was shock and i cried because i do my best for her, its hard when u love someone say ""i don't want to be alive"". she continues to have nervous crises for crappy reasons, and she apologizes because she can't control her emotions. She has already seen a psychiatrist but she feels uncomfortable.

I don't know what i can do, I begin to be insomniac, I see that I change but I still have hope for it to be cured. But I know I won't be able to resist much longer, it's really hard and I'm starting to ask myself a lot of questions. I never saw the depression before and i have the I'm starting to think it's contagious.

174,"I am 21, almost 22, and my boyfriend is 24 years old. We both still live with our parents and have been driving back and forth from each other’s houses that are an hour apart for 6 years. I am currently a junior in college and he has a full time job. Our plan was to move in, me get a better paying job, and continue to go to school. The university I am attending is implementing the option of attending class in person, or attending class from home via computer. They are installing microphones and cameras to give students that want to stay home the “in the classroom” experience. I am hoping they continue this option of learning. We are both very ready to move in and even found a potential place. I also already applied for a job down where we won’t to move and am just waiting to hear back. I just was curious on when you know that you’re ready to move out of your parents house. I get that everyone is different, much like the circumstance, but I like insight from others. I’m kinda nervous but excited at the same time.

176,"This may be a weird one and sound like a no brainer, but hear me out. I can't figure out if I'm in my own head or overthinking this too much.

So I've been married for close to three years now and things had been pretty good up until about the beginning of last year. In saying that, we are complete opposites when it comes to personality and have always had our share of bickering. She can be more hot headed and firm about things while I'm usually calm and collected. She's someone who wants to get things done as soon as she thinks of them, while I'm more laid back and wait on some things for example. Not saying my way is always the best, but that has led to a lot of our bickering lately.

The reason that has led to so much bickering is mainly because we just bought a new house together. You're probably asking why I did that if I'm so confused about everything? Well, the short answer is, everything kind of started to hit me at once when we were moving in. She had honestly been treating me like crap the last couple of months, and part of it is definitely from her job and getting everything situated for the house, but at what point am I making too many excuses for her? Again, not saying I was perfect in any of this and I'm sure I could have helped a little more, but I did do a fair share as well. 

I know from knowing her for so long she says a lot of things that she doesnt mean when angry, but part of my confusion comes from ""do I want to put up with that happening anytime she's stressed for the rest of my life?"" It's just so confusing because I really do love her but I have really started to question whether I want to be with her for the rest of my life. We have no romance in our relationship anymore and I know that can be worked on but I sometimes wonder if it's too far gone. 

The last thing I'll say that adds to my confusion is the more that I look at her personality, the more unattractive it becomes and I really start to see that she has almost none of the traits I look for in a woman. I dont mean like physically, more emotional like she's not really touchy feely for example. Again, I do love her and I married her because I do but I'm starting to think I settled because we dated for so long and it was comfortable, but idk. 

I just dont know if I'm jumping to conclusions too fast thinking I want a divorce or if I have an argument to think that. Sorry this was so long, and I may sound like a piece of shit for thinking this way, but any advice from you guys would really help me out. Thanks",03Jul2020,1
177,"My husband’s family had been pressuring us since April to travel to see them, even during the height of lockdown when no planes were in the air, there were complaints. This past month in particular they have been pressuring us to return for a big family event they are planning, the thought of so many people together makes our skin crawl. So irresponsible. However when we politely explained we didn’t think it was a good idea and that we didn’t want to fly anywhere until we felt it was safe, they keep saying we are exaggerating, “pushing our luck” or implying we have ulterior motives. The last particularly confused us cause.... there’s a bloody pandemic! I should also note that both my husband and I have health problems, particularly my husband, which makes travelling tricky anyway, so that’s why we are even more reluctant.

My husband told his family flat out that we made a decision, they didn’t have to agree with us but they did have to accept it and that we would let them know when we feel it is safe to travel. Unfortunately he’s barely heard from his family in the past 2 weeks since saying that.... I can see it bothers him and it just makes us feel even more guilty about our choice but we have to do what we think is right and what we feel safe doing.

179,"So over quarantine my friend has gotten more and more anxiety ridden, as was I for about a month until 2 weeks ago (if that makes sense). I go to a therapist and I told her about it and she helped me through it a lot. I was sleeping for most of the day, only eating dinner and staying up all night watching my favorite streamers/youtubers. I would only wake up to watch streams like MCC. In the meantime I didnt really reach out to my friends for a whole month other than sending them funny clips. So over that time my friend was pretty much like me I assume (we've known each other for 7 years and are pretty similar). During that time I found a different genre of music that I love and brought out my father's guitar to learn it and that made me motivated to actually wake up, eat, and even do my hair and pick out outfits for the day. I also was invited to activities with my friends and a chance to go on vacation. This gave me something to look forward to and made me happy. My friend had a different story. Her parents were very adamant about quarantine. My friend basically just played video games all day and listened to Hamilton. My other friend made fun of her for it occasionally but I told her afterwards that she didn't seem like playfully teasing and more like being rude. My other friend got mad at me and said that it was my friends job to talk to her. We kind of had a falling out but we've all been friends since grade 1 so it was hard for us all to not talk to each other and we all apologized. 

So if this is still making sense, my friend was what i assume to be getting more anxious about her future and hopeless, as did I about a month ago. She still is and I noticed something was off when she suddenly didnt text me back once I sent her a funny video or I sent her some Hamilton things (I personally am not interested in it but its the thought that counts right?).  After her not replying and the last I heard of her was a week ago (we usually talk everyday) i asked my mom to ask her mum if she was doing alright. Her mom said she was just anxious lately and hanging out with her brother more. I was really worried for her at that point because a couple weeks before my friend asked her mom if she could go to a different school (her school was my old private school that i moved from last year, the students were mostly bratty and stuck up pricks and that was even worse when me and my other friends, which were her two best friends moved to different schools. There ended up being only 6 people in the grade including my friend and her twin brother and she was uncomfortable with a couple of the teachers there. The workload was a lot too with a project from each class about once every month or two and lots of homework.) Her mom from what I could hear on the phone call with the phone upstairs ended up yelling at her and then the call ended abruptly. My friend later told me her mom said that if she moved to a new she would make no friends, fail all her grades, and be miserable.

Shortly after my mother asked her mother about how she was feeling my friend blocked basically her only two friends (me and the other friend from old school) and only sent my other friend an explanation being that she blocked us because she thought she needed more time to herself. I try to contact her everyday and try to explain to her that I am trying to be there for her and I even told her some things that I can help her with and can relate with. She has yet to open anything.

 If there is anything I could do other than wait for her mind to clear in any way I would love some advice. I would also like to hear your perspective on what may be happening because I know there are a lot of people on the internet that have gone through the same thing. I wont be able to reply immediately but even anything I could say to her as reassurance would help. Thanks for reading this sentence and for waking up today! &lt;3


Again sorry if this doesnt make sense I am really bad at explaining emotions, something my favorite musical artists help me with a lot! &lt;3",03Jul2020,1
180,"Will delete soon. 

I had a terrible semester at college. Long story short, because of my family (I told them I didn’t want to go back to school for a year and they freaked out) I tried to kill my self. I ended up in the ward for a week and decided I’m not gonna go back to school until I am ready.

Everything was going well. I’ve been more happy. Getting things done. And just overall been having a good time.

Fast forward to now, my mom just told me that she may be deported soon and is urging I go back to school and finish it. But the problem is that we don’t even know when she would be deported. Could happen now, could happen in six months, in a year or so on. 

She’s saying I need to grow up and be an adult even though I am. I’ve applied for a job to start making my own money. I’m trying to move forward with my life and things keep on pushing me back. I don’t even know what I want to do in college.

Should I go to college because my mom may be deported?",03Jul2020,1

189,"I’ve never vented on reddit about anything, so here it goes i guess:

In high school my junior year i met this girl who i literally fell in love with after the first time we hung out. We hung out once and every day after that we were inseparable. I had feelings and im sure she did too by the way we used to talk to eachother, but i never took my shot because i felt like she was out of my league. I was a little overweight and had no self confidence, but around her it didnt feel like that. I could talk for hours, we used to do stupid shit like sing “Since U’ve Been Gone” at the top of our lungs driving around wherever. My memories with her are absolutely the best i’ve ever had, even with my boys those memories top it all. After about a year of us hanging out and talking she began dating my boy, he was my other best friend. It weighed on me a bit, but I was more happy that she was happy. The only issue is, my boy never knew what to text her when she was depressed or anything like that, so I helped him out and would type literal books to her, as him, with how I felt. And that was a big mistake i’ll admit. But after about 6 months they were done with, but we were still all best friends. Things got awkward so at some points it would only be me and my boy or me and her hanging out. 

At this point its been a year and a half just about since I met her, and still, she’s the only one on my mind. I hadn’t dated or even texted a girl since I met her because i was infatuated. I put her being happy over my feelings for her because in all honesty, i just wanted to see her happy. Her smile meant everything to me, whether it was from me or my boy, i loved seeing her happy. I still didnt take my shot because it was so soon after her and my boy broke up. Fast forward to about the 2 and a half year point where i’m about to graduate in senior year and she’s a sophmore. I got a job at a coffee place and i was in much better shape and place mentally and physically, and there was a few girls attracted to me at this job. For a while i disregarded them, but one was persistent, so i decided to give it a try because i felt like if I took my shot with J (Thats what i’ll dub her for now) i’d be shot down, and shit wouldn’t have been the same. So i started dating this other girl, fucking blindly, like an idiot. And when i started dating her, i’d bring her over and obviously invite J to come because we’ve literally hung out every single day for the past 2 and a half years, no exaggeration. And J started to be all over me, sitting on my lap, i’d chase her around and do stupid shit like tickle her, or give her a hug, and the girl I was dating got jealous. I made it clear J wasn’t going anywhere because she’s pretty much my second half. 

Fast forward another 6 months to the 3 year point, post HS grad going into college. J had a job at this place that caters parties, probably for about a year now. Around this point she started talking to her bosses son, and i didnt think much of it. Until she stopped hanging out with me abruptly. Literally 3 years of hanging out everyday, the past half year hanging out with my current girlfriend and J, i’d still take J out to dinners and hang out with her one on one. But once she began talking to her bosses son, everything changed. Yeah we still talked everyday, but we started hanging out less and less, until it turned to J starting to take longer and longer to respond to my calls or texts.

I kinda felt like it was done at this point, our friendship, and any shot I had, it was all gone. I was in college for 2 semesters, and i dumped my girlfriend and dropped out because I just felt awful. I started working full time and ignoring everybody trying to get in the right head space, and eventually after about a year i felt normal again, I was able to be happy. But I still had the recurring thought through the relationship I was in that I still wanted J, she was the one I should’ve been with. But mentally, i was stable, pretty happy with where I was at in life and at my job, it didn’t make me depressed to think about J, but it brought up feelings constantly. 

I started trying to talk to her again because we havent talked in at least a year. I hit her up on Instagram, just to say i miss the friendship we had and i hated how we didnt talk anymore. She responded right away and agreed she missed it all too, but she couldnt text me when her boyfriend was around. I decided to tell her to just ignore me then because i didnt want to step on her boyfriends toes. She seemed distraught over it but i knew I couldnt give it a second thought or else everything would come flooding back. This is about 3 years at this point. A few months after i messaged her and we exchanged what we did, i moved back in with my parents because i didnt want to live so far away from everyone i knew.

I began dating another girl a few months after i moved back, and we were dating from the. Up until about a month ago. We have a kid together but she wasn’t happy with what we had, so we split ways. And even through the 3 years I was with her, every fight we had, everytime i even had sex with her, the thought was always “I miss J.” 

Fast forward to a week ago. I added her on facebook because her boyfriend blocked me on her instagram, he told J she isnt allowed to talk to guys. She’s got a full blown business  at this point, she’s travelled part of the world with this guy, and she’s extremely happy. Fuck, to this day I still see her smile and just love the fact that she’s happy and doing what she loves to do. We always used to talk about the life she has now, and now, she has it. But nonetheless, on with the story. She accepted my friend request and i’ve been so afraid to say anything to her. I want to message her and tell her how I felt, but she’s been with this guy for 5 years now. I’d seem crazy, and probably be blocked again.

I really do love this girl to the ends of the earth. 6 years later, she gets on my mind no matter what, whether im right swiping on tinder, or hanging out with another girl, I always just wish it was her. I wish 6 years ago i wasnt such a pussy and took my shot.

I guess r/Advice, i’m asking, should I tell her how i’ve felt over the past 6 years i’ve known her, or just continue keeping quiet? Because at this point I’m clueless, and even if i cant be with her, i still want to be able to talk to her because we’ve had so many memories together.",03Jul2020,1

I'm not mad, I'm just a little hurt.

Little extra hurt this time because like last week or so, we had a catch up phone call where she double-checked when my birthday was and wrote it down so that she wouldn't forget again. And then she forgot. Earlier today she sent me some artwork and this animatic she's been working on for the past three days. I love her art, but there's this little part of me that's thinking, ""She can do all this for three days but she can't call me for five minutes on a day she wrote down so she wouldn't forget?"" 

I know I should be understanding because her depression is really bad sometimes, and it messes with her head in ways I can't always understand. I've already blown up at her once before and it made her cry and I hated myself for it ever since, because it's kind of shitty to be mad at someone for something they can't control.

At the beginning of the week a coworker announced he has tested positive for COVID-19.  I had a masked “interaction” with him after the point in time he believes he contracted it.  After he spoke with our company nurse about our interaction, the nurse decided I did not need to quarantine or get tested.  I elected to get tested the next day to play it safe.  I have not yet received test results.

So the dilemma is whether I need to quarantine.  I have been quarantined since testing, but there is a catch-22 at play (kinda).  Had I followed the direction of the company nurse, I would continue with life as normal, going to the grocery store as needed, and occasionally picking up takeout.  However, since I got tested, I am now supposed to quarantine.  Should my choice to get tested change how a medical professional more familiar with my circumstances has evaluated my situation?

I (25 M in USA) have been more or less trying to leave the large city I am in since I reluctantly stayed for college due to good financial aid. I've lived here my whole life aside from 1 year at a uni an hour away that I transferred out of, 4 months with a partner in another city during my college years, a semester long disappointing study abroad experience, and a little less than a year of working in two other cities post grad. I told myself years ago that I would just do my university here and leave but I had various groups of friends here (they left) and got involved in a few projects that i'm happy I stuck around for and built a great professional reputation and as mentioned above I did leave the city a few times. I like my job well enough but it felt so right to think that this fall was the fall that I was going to finally leave. Now I’m not so sure. my school options are both not perfect and while I do have an offer from a dream school in the UK the program is also not ideal (its almost entirely research methods focused rather than about broadening my general knowledge of the field like some of the other programs I looked at).

We have been disconnected for a while, but I never thought a line would be drawn because I just thought we were each others people.

209,"Hello, I am using a throwaway that I use when I need to use it, but basically I need help for two parts. 

Firstly, I am in grad school online (I live in FL at the moment and my graduate school is in NY), and I honestly hate it so much and I want to leave, but I have enormous debt from my undergraduate, about USD45000, and I am taking on another USD35000 or so to complete my graduate degree, which doing online dramatically diminishes the quality of. Leaving seems nice, but I just feel like I'm in too deep to quit and I should just finish. However, if I leave grad school, I would have exactly six months to find a full-time job, pay for relocation costs, move, and fully financially separate myself from my parents (other than health insurance and cell plan, of which I pay for the latter). 

Secondly, I am seeing this guy that I really like (and who likes me as well) but I really do not enjoy liking him because he has a girlfriend. This, combined with my religious upbringing, has done a number on my already tortured sexuality and my perception of my relationships. I want to keep seeing him, but I don't want to feel disgusting and guilty for doing so. However, if I date him, my mother would no longer provide any financial support for school, of which she provides about $1,000 a semester, because she believes him to be a loser with no ambition and I would be asked to move in with him or move to NY with him. However, I have talked with his parents (who he lives with) about us without him knowing and his parents like me a helluva lot more than they like his current girlfriend, but they would only encourage him to date me if I stayed in Florida with him.

The two parts are related in the fact that it is important that I be close to my graduate school in the fall semester, even if it is online, due to certain research requirements and the place-based education that my school and program emphasize, but I am staying here, so that I can be close to this guy. If we were to date (necessitating him breaking up with his girlfriend, who would be homeless as she cannot afford housing with her current job and has no relatives or friends currently in a stable housing situation, real fucked up shit), unless I wanted to put the work in convincing his parents that he would be better off in NY, I would likely stay in FL for the time being, diminishing the quality of my education. 

I'm trying to live one day at a time, but it is becoming exhausting trying to manage all of these things every day and I would just like some help in just resolving the situation once and for all. It's far too complicated, and I would just like to have a good night sleep without thinking about this for once. What should I do, both about the relationship situation and the school situation?",03Jul2020,1

211,"Hey guys! Q&amp;A time. 
Had a talk with my mother in regards to the Fourth, which has resulted in my ruined mood. 

I live in a 5.5 person household—myself, my mother, father, baby sister, and older sister **(in addition to her baby—he’ll be making the .5 because he’s less than a year old)**. 

Apparently we’ll be having 10-15 people over on the Fourth, which I was unaware of. Originally, my mother has been up in arms about staying Covid-conscious, where I practically had to beg her to let me go to work. With that being said, I found this change of heart to be a bit alarming on such short notice. All of the guests will be family, but I don’t think the virus takes breaks in respect to relatives hoping to spend time together. 

With that being said, I asked her if I could perhaps stay inside the house for part of the get together. She immediately went off on me, and called me a hypocrite. She says that because I visit my partner, I shouldn’t mind a family get together. Keep in mind that I only hang out with my partner one-on-one, and when he mentions that he’ll be going to visit a group of friends/family, I’ll wait two weeks until we hang out again. 

I have spent time with family members upon occasion since the lockdown, but it has always been a group of 3 (myself included) MAX. And we are always masked, 6 feet apart. My problem is not with my family members—it’s with the number of them. With that many people squished into a backyard on a hot day full of charcoal and firecrackers, it’s almost impossible to guarantee safety. 

None of these people are 100% sure they don’t have Covid, and if one brings it, there’s no doubt in my mind that we’ll all catch it. And if that be the case, how do we trace it? We don’t, and no one is going to admit to being patient zero. With that many people present, the rate of literally transmission skyrockets!

Her argument is that my partner lives in a household where he shares the space with an essential worker (his mother is a cop). *I* am an essential worker. *I* am only hanging out with my partner, and if I were to be infected, I’d know it was him. This Fourth of July celebration practically coughs at how little my interaction is in comparison to the fiasco to come. Masks *will* come off, and particles *will* fly. She got mad at me for pointing this out, said I was making assumptions and didn’t want to spend time with my family. Apparently, I’m very selfish for wanting to stay out of the vicinity. In my mind, I’m making perfect sense. Thus, I ask, where is the disconnect, and what is her problem? How do I proceed without being punished?",03Jul2020,1

I told my dad and he really liked the idea but other than that I've only told one other person...  
So this idea is really big... and I know you wont believe me but I'm talking Facebook/Amazon big... Maybe even bigger.......... I wasn't going to tell this person but he was the only person I knew that could tell me anything about coding. He kind of pressured me into it to be honest which I have proof of as well.. I did have him agree to a short non disclosure agreement which stated that if he told anyone about it, he'd owe me 100 million dollars, and if he created a counter product or created a company based around my idea I would have full legal rights to it and the company would be 100% handed over to me, no ifs and's or buts.

215,"Hi reddit

I really need you advice on the situation my friend is in. (Sorry for my bad english)

So yesterday my friend and i found out that on a particular website there a porn of her put there by her ex to black mail her for money if she don't send him the money he will put this online on more platform. We also found out that this is not the first time this guy did this becuase on his profile there is also a video of his old ex before my friend who have no clue about the video. Which have been put there for over a year having a view combine together of 1milion.( The video of my friend are record with out her knowing)

Luckly for my friend the video have been post only 4 days and we take it down in time but the poor girl have it worst that her video have been put there for 1 year and on multiple website by the guy. Both the girls are trying to get a legal action against the guys but becuase they live in different country it very difficult to do this but we still try to do it.

I try confront the guy but he act like a child saying i have to fly to his own country to fight him like a 5 years old which by the way he is 25 , an addict to alcohol like to assault girls and do this kind of shit. He also kick my friend down a stair once when they are still dating and hit my friend the head in public but still get away with this. She broke up with him for 6 month but he still torture her in anyways he can. 

During my confrontation with him he send me a video of him showing a whatapp pretending to be my friend talking to other people pretending to be a prostitute. he also boost to me that he is fucking rich and no one can touch him becuase he have his people and his grandmom is a german politicians. (He also mention somthing red/white which i have no clue what the fuck he is talking about )

Personally i am not at all a judging person because i prefer to chill and smoke but this situation make me sick to my stomach. what i dont understand is that my friend have been nothing but a caring girlfriend to the guy, take care of him during his addiction with alcohol no matter how much trouble he is in or do to her ,she still help him as much as she can and the ways they break up is that she ask him to stop drinking in rehabilitation for like 1000 time and he still do it which cause huge problem involving police that why they broke up.

I really need you advice on what should we do becuase in my opinion this guys is the worst pieces of shit i ever laid my eye on and he getting what he want which is unfair and childish,destorying people life as he find joy in it. I dont think he will stop ether he will just do this then find a new girl and repeat the same stuff again.

216,"So a few minutes ago I stumbled upon this girls article on masks and different types you can use to stay stylish. Now I’ve been seeing a lot of talk about racism of course and also culture appropriation. I’d like to think there are some things that really aren’t that big of a deal. For example I’m Puerto Rican and I loveeeee when any other race wear their hair like us or wear the big hoop earrings and like to dress in our style because I find it flatting and makes me feel like they appreciate and love my culture, but I do feel a lot of things go too far such as suddenly changing the way you speak and your accent suddenly changes from a normal American accent to a boogie chola or if you use it as a trend and just throw it away later. 

Anyway sorry back to my point, 2 of the mask options them being the “Half Niqab” and the “Veils” seem a little strange to me and even the way she says it’s trendy just didn’t sit right with me, but let me know your opinion in the comments so I can’t truly be educated on cultural appropriation. I’m not sure if they would let me link it or show any pictures of what I mean but I could always show you what I mean through a message where I can send the link or picture but if someone knows if it’s for sure ok to do it here I’ll put it on here, my last post got deleted for not  following the rules of the group such as asking advice lol so I want to make sure I can before I do it.

217,"Sorry it’s a bit long to read and please excuse my grammar since I’m quickly typing this on my phone!!!

So I've been best friends with this girl since like 2nd grade and we've always been together 

Then up till like sophomore year and so on she started hanging out this this new girl more since they had more classes together and i did feel jealous but I didn't say anything since I don't want to be a bad friend 

Now we're in college but we go to different local colleges but my bff and her friend go to the same school and literally have the same degree and same classes 

And whenever we hung out all three together I was always the odd one out and one time her friend called me poor as a joke but I didn't say anything and my bff said "" that's ok you can take it "" and tried to make the joke not seem as bad. 

I’ve also noticed the few times we 3 hung out together her friend always seemed a little possessive of her and always made sure to always be next to her. And one time I asked how much my bff made at her job (we work in the same field and I needed a rough estimate to see how much I could get paid while working during school) and she told me “don’t tell *her friend* but I make xxx...” and that struck me as odd since they seemed so close.

And now that they go to the same school together and I can definitely see us drifting apart

But I'm not sure if I want to stop it or just let our friendship dissipate in the long run

I know she has more fun with her friend and she always smiles the most when she’s with her and I feel that she just puts up with me because of how long we've known each other 

I have another best friend but we're long distance so I haven't seen her irl and I don't have any friends where I live besides my childhood bff

I know it’s partly my fault for letting it get this bad but I feel so hurt since I’m always the second choice. 

She’s never once checked up on me or told me that she loves me (platonically) and the times that I’ve asked if she wanted to hang out she was always busy. And the few times she asked if I wanted to hang out it was always with her and her bff and I was her second choice.

I feel so sad since I’m starting to feel that I can’t trust her as much with my secrets as I used to and I feel that she tells some of them to her new bff. For example I haven’t came out to her as bisexual and I’ve never told her about my self harm cuts

But I’m not sure if I can even come talk to her about this since she seems so blissfully ignorant and that she doesn’t even notice our friendship disappearing.

Idk if I’m whining or making this a big deal but I don’t know what to do. I feel more strongly to let the friendship dissolve but I don’t want to let this get even worse? Any advice?",03Jul2020,1
218,"Straight to the point, my friend has started to harm themselves after four months of being clean (for reasons I will not say). I like to think of myself as someone who my friends can depend on, and I enjoy helping my friends, so it hurts me to see them in pain. I have told them that if they need to talk, I'm here to listen, and that they matter so much to me and to every one of their friends, although I feel like that isn't enough because that's what everyone would say.

219,"I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub for this sort of thing, but the ED subs make me uncomfortable and I don't know where else to turn. 

(I'm currently 18). When I was 15-16 I had anorexia. My BMI was 16. Several teachers complimented my weight, saying things like ''you look so slim and trim'' etc, only one seemed worried and said ''you need to eat girl''. This made me feel good about myself and soon even the negative comments became good to me, because no matter what words were used I only heard ''you look thin,''. I was never fat before or even chubby, I just suddenly began obsessing over my weight. I still obsess, I think about it at least 5 times a day still. Then when I turned 17, there was a period were the negative comments stopped, and nobody said anything, so I wasnt encouraged by the comments and gained some weight back. Then people started saying ''I'm glad you're normal again'' and I hate it, I know it's wrong but I hate those comments. Food makes me feel sick, my body makes me feel sick, but I know that not eating is worse in the longrun than feeling fat... and yet I simply cant stop myself, it's like an addiction if that makes sense. It's like someone else is controlling me and making decisions. I want to be like I was when I was a kid again, normal weight, and not waste a second thinking about it. I didnt care and I want to not care again but I cant, its like intrusive thoughts. I sense another spiral into starvation and I feel so defeated and ashamed of myself. I dont know what to do. 

I live with my mum and she just gets angry at me- when I was at my worst I was willing to eat when we were in the city on a day trip, but I didnt want to eat outside with people watching, I told her I'd eat if we could find a place with indoor seating and she made a massive scene and yelled for the entire street to hear. She gets angry and nasty about the whole thing. I've told my 'friends' and they dont care- one of the few I even talk to anymore doesnt care unless its about her. No one cares, I'm to embarassed to get help by myself (plus I dont drive and live in the middle of nowhere to find help) and no on will help me get help. I hate it and I hate myself. I need help but I dont know where to turn.",03Jul2020,1
220,"I work for a small business where I run our small showroom. Two weeks ago a very elderly couple (90's) came in and was interested in some of our products. I helped them out and gave them brochures. We also got to talking and they seemed really nice. Last week the man called our showroom and asked if I could help them find someone's phone number online, because they don't have internet or a computer and don't know how. I assumed they called because I was nice with them and young (so they probably assumed I knew about computers). I found the number for him and he offered to pay me $15 if I would help them find information online from time to time.

Now this is where the advice comes in. They are coming to the showroom tomorrow to give me $15. I feel uncomfortable taking money from them. It literally took me 2 minutes and that is more than I make in an hour. I wouldn't mind helping them out in the future but I was also thinking of maybe offering to help them learn how to use the internet for basic research. And not charge them. 

Is this a good idea? I feel like if I can help someone I should but maybe its not a good idea? Mainly I have doubts because I don't actually personally know them. Maybe I shouldn't get involved.",03Jul2020,1

I recently got out of an on and off again relationship of these four years for good. In times like these I would assume the sleep overs and girl parties to break up these long endearing feelings. But because of corona and all my friends being old enough and getting jobs as well as having a job and online class myself haven’t had a chance to do any of these things.

Like when I was under ten years old/pre-puberty. I remember my dad outright calling me fat. Which resulted in me crying and asking for an apology. To which he said I won’t apologize for being honest. Another time when I was still little, I was getting food and he told me to stop because I wasn’t as skinny as my older sister. He literally said she could eat that because she’s skinny, but you cannot. 

The weird thing is my dad has always overfeed me and my siblings. He has this weird complex where he thinks fast food=luxury. Like that eating at home is for poor people. (Which obviously isn’t true.) And to this day he still overfeeds me. He always gives me huge portions of food, buys fast food frequently, etc. He stopped making comments as I got older. Partly because I got thinner and because he knows I will get pissed if he says anything. Really reddit all i’m just asking is wtf is up with my dad.

228,"So I (21F) am currently in an awkward living situation. I dont have a home since I left my last because of uncomfortable situations. So Im mostly just here or there when I can be. 

I work and have a steady income. However, renting on my own where I live is too expensive. I decided i’d buy a home since I have okay credit and its a lot cheaper. 

I found a lending company and the first officer I had put me on the back burner for two weeks. Our phone calls and emails consisted of her saying things like “i’ll start your application tomorrow” or “i’ll get to you soon” or “your next on my list.” So after two weeks of that, I decided I would try another loan officer within the same lender

I didn’t let the new officer know that I’d switched within the same lender because the initial person never even took a look at my application so I didn’t think it was necessary and I didn’t want to say anything negative about the initial lady.

I began the preapproval process with the new officer on the 4th of June. Its almost a month and I believe she’s just checked my credit today. I notice that I will ONLY get a response from her when I call or email first. For example, after i’d asked how my verifications were going she let me know she’d be out of the office from 5/19-5/24 and she’d let me know about my job verifications when she returned. 

I didn’t hear from her until 5/29 (through email) and that was because I called and left a message the morning of 5/26. 

Her email to me on 5/29 stated that she got my verifications on 5/24 and she would have an update for me on 5/30. 

Its now the 2nd of July and I still haven’t received anything, except I can see that I now have a hard inquiry on my credit. 

I want to go through another lending company at this point, but im worried i’ll keep having this problem. Im also worried that it will take even longer and impact my credit because the other company will also need to check. 

Is this normal? Am I impatient because of my situation? Im not sure what to do or say or if I should just wait...

231,"Your TL;DR is right there in the title, but if you want to sit along for the details and family nonsense stay tuned.

So I (17 F) from a young age have struggled with school and making plans for the future (For some context I suffered from depression early in childhood and lost my father.) up until freshman year of highschool I had been undiagnosed with MDD (Major depressive disorder), insomnia, agoraphobia, and anxiety. I also had multiple suicide attempts from age 10-15 So it made sense that for a long time throughout childhood my plan was “kill yourself before or after high school ends.”

Anyways, my mother had very strict expectations on me in school (All A’s, no procrastination at all, nothing lower than a 90, go to University immediately after high school.) of course I’m human, and due to my mental illnesses I missed school quite a bit. Though I’m proud of what I accomplished and I did well in my opinion, I failed only one class ever, and even got honour roll a couple times, one of them being my Senior year that just came and went. 

Except, ever since I was about 8 my mother kept saying that I had to go to Uni as she had  money “saved away,” and  said money was expressly for our education beyond highschool, but within the last few years this education only fund has been drained by:

- Getting my brother (25) out of debt. (Drugs, cigarettes, drinks, and buying cars he didn’t need put him into debt.)
- Buying my brother equipment for work.
- Buying my brother a brand new truck.
- Buying my brother a gaming computer “for school.” (He only ever uses it to play video games)
- Getting my sister (19) into University. (Fair, it was used like it should have been)
- Paying for my sisters gas
- Paying for when my sister crashed the family car into a pole and caused substantial damage as my sister complained saying “It wasn’t her car, why should she pay for the damage?”
- My mothers life style (She likes to live as if she were the 1% and travels often, goes out to bars, fancy parties, etc.)

While this isn’t everything this money was used on, as you can expect in only a couple years the fund was completely drained. Being the youngest in the family and never having a chance to use this money for anything that could of helped me in my future, tuition, textbooks, material needed for university classes, stressed me out, and I’ve tried to handle my emotions and not grow resentful because of it but it still irks me. Of course I’m thankful for what I have but...

Now that I’m about to head into university, even though for almost 10 year’s I’ve been told “We’ll help you through it.” All that has gone down the drain and I have to make up all the money myself, even though I could of been trying to make money in highschool (due to my moms strict expectations, and the promise of help I was to get in University, I wasn’t supposed to get a job. Instead just focus on classes) I just got my first job, which i’m starting soon, so I’m trying to budget and make a plan for tuition and hopefully avoid getting student loans/debt.

But my question is: Should I even approach my family for help financially? Would it be better to just move on and try and get as much money as I can before the first tuition payment? Should I call out my mother for pressuring me into Uni when she used up the University fund?

I do have a job, but it’s the average “waste your life in an office space while opportunity avoids you” kind of thing. I basically just come home, practice music hoping that by slim chance it actually becomes useful one day, and maybe play video games for an hour or two.

The past few days I’ve literally had to close my eyes and tell myself what day it was and what I wanted to do with it, only to end up coming back to reality and realizing I’m capable of none of it. I’ve started taking notes about memories that I still have so that I don’t forget them. 

I miss having high aspirations for what I could do, but now that I’m out here I see that life is nothing more than waking up, going through the motions, waiting for the weekend so that you can finally have time to yourself to sit down and do nothing. I have dreams but it doesn’t work like that.

Growing up he was emotionally abusive, blamed me as a teen for his drinking and marriage to wife #2 falling apart.

We live 10 hours away so I only see her once every 2 years when I go to visit the rest or our family. I normally would ignore it; I’ve never confronted her about the things she’s said because it honestly didn’t bother me, she’s always been jealous (about my weight VS hers, a long time ago she said she hates her body and wants to be my size, but then afterwards said I’m too skinny and need to eat burgers because guys don’t like skinny girls), and insecure.

255,"For the sake of background (and in case anyone may be able to find an answer within): I've always known that I have anger issues, especially when I was younger. From as far back as 6 years old I remember throwing tantrums because I lost at video games. This was at its worst when I was a preteen, culminating in me smashing controllers and beating my friends whenever I lost. It's been well over a decade since that and until now it's been a part of me that I'm happy to leave in my past. 

I'm in my early 20's now, and since I started college, everyone has known me to be very laid back and relaxed about everything. I maintained a solid carefree attitude and reminded myself constantly that most things aren't worth getting riled up about. That's changed recently. 

I'm lucky enough to be living with the parents over the summer before my last year of college starts, and I've been able to relax without my normal job (used to work as a video editor intern but without new projects there's no reason to have me around). Since quarantine started I've spent most of my time playing video games and taking remote freelance gigs where I can find them. I'm in the best relationship of my life, but we're long distance until either quarantine ends or we can save up enough to finally move in together. I never go outside because I'm concerned about spreading COVID. I haven't seen any of my friends in person since March. 

On to the issue: I've noticed my anger and sense of entitlement are making a comeback. Like I said before, I usually spend my free time playing video games. Mostly competitive multiplayer stuff. I'd say I'm slightly above average skilled and don't usually have an issue being the top player by the end of matches. But when I lose... I've not been the best about it. I broke a controller for the first time in years the other day. I rage quit in the middle of sessions with my friends without warning at least twice a week. Understandably, this upsets them, and I find myself apologizing for my behavior a lot. 

The worst thing though is that lately I've been posting my issues and complaints to various game subreddits, calling out bad game design and how toxic the communities are. Some of this has merit, but as I look back on these posts I realize I'm whining a lot, and that most of my complaints are just born from a bad match or a bad day that I'm twisting into being the community's fault. What makes me really angry are people's responses, because I take them all to heart and, well, it's the internet.... I've said a lot of regrettable things to strangers on Reddit these last few weeks just because they called me out on my bs.

It's starting to expand beyond games, too. The other day I was waiting on a package and was notified at the exact time it was supposed to be delivered that it would be delayed to the next day. I became furious and ranted at customer service reps for the first time in my life. I've always been chill to customer service and known not to yell at them because they have nothing to do with my issue, and I even knew that in the back of my mind while I was doing it, but I was so livid over this one package that I was seriously considering driving over to the facility and demanding my package in person. I only realized after I finally got the package that I was being a complete Karen about it.... something that my parents do often that I criticize them for.

I don't want to be the guy that gets mad about everything. As recently as a few months ago I remember enjoying playing online games with my friends, win or lose, because the fun was in the sport of it. I can't seem to find that anymore and I'm not sure what to do about it.",03Jul2020,1
256,"My mom is narcissistic.

My mom doesn’t like my friends parents. They do everything for me. For no other reason but because I am best friends with their daughter, and they like doing nice things. My mother on the other hand, takes it in a bad way. She thinks they think we’re are poor(or she just comes up with any excuse really). She despises them. But I still want to be able to hang out with my friend. Recently my mom will only bring up my friends family. And start talking bad about  them. My mom has clearly stated that she hates them, even though they go through great efforts to try and get her to like them. 

Anyways, today, my friend dropped off lunch to my house. Two teas (my brother and her are also ig friends), and a sandwich. My mom quickly went to go and try the tea(which I didn’t mind), so I gave it to her. Later in the day. I start eating my sandwich, but I forgot to offer some to everyone(not a big sandwich). 

She started saying how I was a terrible daughter and how I have no excuse on being terrible because she had a bad childhood? She went on to explain how terrible her childhood was. And I just sat there quietly. She was yelling for hours. 

She then said, “I will kick you out for 2 weeks, and guess what? You can go with your friend and their family.” (Keep in mind I’m 15)

This all started because my friend gave me a sandwich •_•

257,"So me (f23) and my bf (m23) of 2 years are wanting to start the mortgage process for our first home really soon (like in the next week or so) - we've saved a lot for the deposit, are eligible for additional govt help, and we are able to prove with our combined income and expenses that we will be comfortably able to make the mortgage repayments - so financially we feel we've got this covered.  


Current working situation is where it gets muddied: he's on a salary working in IT as a systems admin (still gets horrendously underpaid but at least his job is stable and has held it for 2 years). I, on the other hand, am on a casual contract due to the company I'm working for being notoriously ridiculous when it comes to HR stuff. Despite being casual, I work a consistent 40+ hrs/week, am on a higher rate than my bf, and there is little to no danger of me becoming redundant in my position. Legally, there is no way I should be a casual employee with my working hours, but either my boss or the company just for some reason won't change it to a better suited one.

I always keep bringing up with my boss to move onto a permanent contract - the work I'm doing redeveloping the company intranet would create a new role within the business to administrate that intranet as well as doing more general information management tasks across all business areas. After months and months of ambiguity, I told him that we were looking at getting our first home and a casual position would hurt our mortgage approval chances. He said he needed to talk to the other general managers in the company and basically get their ok for the new position he kept saying would be needed - and things were looking up.  
Except now, he's come back to me and basically said the CEO doesn't think that a role like that would be of any value now and some other stuff about my job being able to be done if split between 10 other people.  
 Annnnyway, I've been offered an 11-month fixed term contract instead of a permanent, and that's all my boss is able to offer me.  


A fixed-term is better than casual, but still could really hinder the mortgage chances - and getting a new job entirely and being on the 90-day probationary period would also look negative in the eyes of the lenders. The company I'm at has a reputation for being bad with staff, and I've always taken issue with a lot of their policies, and their culture in general. I love the work I do, learning O365 SharePoint and information management principles has been amazing and something I feel I have a passion for. The company though haven't instilled any confidence in me that they really care about the work I've been doing or even think that a fully redesigned and redeveloped intranet requires any amount of hard work to keep going. At this stage I'm seriously considering finding somewhere else to work, but I know that in my town/region, finding another job with similar types of work is limited if not non-existent. But at least a 90-day probation is less time than 11-months.

And the question would be asked why we have to buy a house now, why can't it wait another year or so? While that is true, our living situation now isn't horrible but is definitely causing a strain on our mental health and so far our renting experiences have been awful. We're ready to buy, and also give an opportunity to not have to cram two people's belongings into cramped bedrooms (we can't even afford to buy new work clothes since there's literally no space to put them).  


Should we put off the mortgage for another year and I stick it out with the job I've got, put it off until the 90-day probationary in another job is over, try and negotiate for a different contract with my boss, or something else entirely??? Any help or advice appreciated!

259,"We are living in difficult times right now, but that added with being stuck at home and unable to reach friends has put me under a whole new kind of stress. This is the first time in my life that I have genuinely been suicidal and it has been very scary to recognize it, but I’ve been trying to be a lot more proactive with dealing with my mental health. I have talked to my doctor and my prescription ready to go, but I am hesitant to begin it. I’m starting to question if my emotional distress is due to true internal issues or if it is external stressors such as being home and the world making me feel hopeless. I was recently able to spend a week away from home with a friend and I had mental peace for the first time in a while, but I also literally spent the week being high and relaxing. 

My parents and I have already talked about talking medication and have an understanding of one another, but they are particularly fearful of the side effects and if when I go back to school I will just be better. It has made me second guess myself, because I do attribute my problems to my home situation. I have noticed that my emotions bounce from feeling good and bad at times, and I just don’t know if I’m making things a bigger deal than they really are. I’m already planning on finding a councilor to get more professional advice, but until I am able I wanted to see if anyone with more personal experience might have some tips for my situation.

I also am concerned about using lexapro while also using weed. I am a very infrequent smoker, but I enjoy it as a social thing with my pals. It has actually helped me with my anxiety and helps me sleep. I am careful not to use weed as a coping mechanism or a medical substitute, but I still enjoy it in moderation. If anyone happens to know of any concrete information about the effects of weed with lexapro I’d appreciate it.

I feel kinda stupid asking all of these questions, but I just hope that maybe someone with more personal experience can shed some light on this. In the end I know this is up to me to decide, but any advice would really help. Thank you!",03Jul2020,1

261,"My dad, yesterday, told me he was afraid of losing his dad. His dad beat cancer twice, but had caught pneumonia and was in the hospital. 
When I was napping today (2pm) unknowingly in my sleep my grandad passed. My dad is a former marine, and doesnt cry much if at all. I wasnt aware his dad passed, so when I woke up I was excited to show him a possible dog for him to adopt (he really wants a blue heeler). He doesnt smile a lot, only when hes down he smiles like he was. He blurts out grandad passed and started smiling and laughing about how great his dad was. 
I'd brag about grandad, but then you guys would know who he was since he did some pretty big stuff in his life.
But, my dad always called grandad batman, cause dad was his robin. 

All day dad has been making calls and making funeral plans. He flies out tomorrow to make sure that everything goes to plan, and to see his dads funeral ofc. 
I wanna cheer him up, and I do pretty good sometimes. But anybody know how to warm up a big marine whose shell is tough to break?
 I wrote a note reminding him his favorite treat (nutty butter bars) were in the freezer with 2 polaroids I have of him. Which, almost made him cry but he gave me a hug.

Anything I can do? I'm sure my mom would be on board.

263,"I rent out rooms in my apartment suite and recently I had a couple (m/f) move in at the beginning of May. I would say once a week, they get into a loud dispute where you can hear physical outbursts happening. Walls being smacked, or things thrown. I got home last night and heard the most explosive one yet, and when I tried to signal that I was home so they would chill a bit, the yelling and noises got louder. So, other roommates and I intervened. We were concerned for the safety of everyone in the apartment at this point and made it clear that this was why we were knocking on their door and requesting them to come out. 

One of them was cooperative, but the other one completely lashed out and verbally attacked all of us. A lot of things that they said were hurtful and clearly personal, coming from a genuine place. It was uncalled for. 

Other behaviours during this outburst we noticed were really problematic and emotionally abusive to pretty much everyone in the apartment. I had to eventually step in and assert that they needed to leave and calm down and then come back when they could be respectful. 

They eventually did, and things calmed down. Belligerent person apologized. However, things are tense in the apartment and boundaries for sure have been overstepped. I plan on speaking with everyone individually about this, but I don’t know what would be fair for a solution. It’s not my job to play couples therapist, but I do have a good rapport with them before this and I do care. However the rest of us have a right to a safe environment. I’m considering setting the boundary that if this becomes a pattern and if outbursts like that happen again, it would be best for them to find a new place - but I guess I need an unbiased third party to tell me what they think.

264,"This usually works for people diagnosed with depression and/or disassociation. As someone who struggles with both I thought id share what helps me when I'm going through a rough patch.

Sad
1. Ask if the person is okay
 1a. If they say yes, ask if they're sure, and offer love and affection. Ex, ""Okay, just remember ily and you can chat with me whenever💛""
 1b. If they say no, make sure they know that youre okay to sit and listen for a while. Make sure they feel safe to rant, as it usually helps. 

2. Give body language to show you're supportive
 2a. If the person is hugging themselves or holding their hands close to their chest, offer a hug or hold hands. Physical contact works wonders, especially letting people cry into you. If the person isn't for contact, try to keep eye contact consistent with how much theyre looking at you. If they're not looking at you at all, just a hand on the shoulder and concerned look should do the trick.
 2b. Try keeping your hands close to your body, and your legs uncrossed. Don't display any signs of being overbearing or you being the boss, like putting your hands down and leaning forward. It doesnt make people feel like theyre in a safe place to express themselves and their feelings.

3. Responses Vary
 3a. Sometimes you may have nothing to say, and sometimes there is nothing the person will want to hear. Its okay to not have a response, as long as the person knows you were listening.
 3b. NEVER compare their situation to your own. This is about them, and you drawing the attention away from them makes them feel insignificant. The furthest you can bring it to yourself is ""I've never been there, and I have no idea whats going through your mind right now, but I know it must be difficult, and I'm here for you, always."" or ""I've been there, and it's not easy. You're your own person, but I need you to know I'm always here to fight alongside you"".


Disassociation
 1. When I am disassociating, I tend to not want to talk. I want to be alone. Stay in the general area but don't touch the person, or talk to them. Try to get the person to do something that requires them being present, like eating, or texting. It usually brings back attention.

2. It's important to not make any sudden moves or loud noises. It's best if you ease the person out of disassociating, scaring/startling them will make them super stressed, and sometimes even angry.",03Jul2020,1
265,"My best friend is a great person outside of this, she has a lot of mental health problems and based on a lot of things I suspect she has borderline.

She says horrible things I know she doesn’t mean and is being genuinely so unfair to him. I’ve tried helping in the sense of checking on her and trying to calm her but she turns that into another reason to say she hates him and that he has no right to go to me (his close friend) for advice. The last time this happened she ended up getting really depressed and apologizing to him and I but so far in this situation she seems to really be pushing that he’s the bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom is dying, I am unemployed due to Covid19. I did work 2 jobs, 60 hours a week before it started. One full one part time. Lost both of them. I decided to not seek new employment partially because the money was decent on UE, and partially because my mom has been sick for along time so I figured trying to find a new place of work would do more harm than good as she is immunocompromised, and I didn't want me or her to get it.  


Well she went into the hospital again last week and her kidneys are shutting down and she does not qualify for dialysis. I can't see her in person due to Covid 19, hospital is not letting in visitors. She is VERY hard to understand on the phone. Mind you, her speaking level and verbal audio was normal/perfect until this past week.  


Only thing I have is she wants to be buried with/near my dad who passed away 5 years ago. She took care of all those affairs, and they shared the same house.   


So I have no idea what to do. Bill wise, selling the house, making sure all legal affairs are in order, such as vehicles, house, property, bank accounts, safety deposit boxes, her pet dog, etc. you name it. Seeing how quickly my dads health went down and how quickly he died, I know I do not have much time with her left. 

 I do not have a lot of money, as up until my unemployment, I was in debt. Good news is, I paid it off! Bad news is, I do not have much saved.

A disabled friend called the superintendent for help bc they wanted to park in the handicapped spot to pick up their child from school. They have a condition that makes them pass out in the heat. They laughed at her and stated she should be last in line. They claim they are only trying to help her not have to wait as long. She didn’t want to put her child on the hot bus because the child is also disabled.
Anyway, 
She now homeschools.
She saw that same superintendent post on his school board Facebook that they care about the kids and will return to school with safety precautions with the virus. She tried to help parents that were asking their options by sending them the link to apply for homeschool “not seeking state approval.”
He removed her comment and banned her from commenting. This may be stupid or funny but can he even do that?

When college campuses began kicking students out around March my younger sibling decided to come visit for a while. I didn't mind this at all and honestly I wanted them here to keep an eye on them and make sure they stay out of trouble. We'll call them Dallas.

After two months Dallas told me she really liked it here and that she was planning to stay.

I met this girl online, she’s about my age (we are both under 18) and I think lives in a different state than me. Long story short, I send two nudes, one frontal and one of the back (it was a joke lol) and she screenshot the second one.

Of course I’m like yo what and she’s laughing, to which I tell her to delete it. She sends a video of her deleting it from her Recently Deleted folder and assuring me that it’s gone. Which, of course, could be a lie and she could still have it.

But I care and love for him too much, I can’t leave. I feel so selfish, and everyday every single time I talk or see him. I get a sense of sadness, he’s hiding a part of him from me.

I googled it because I thought it was weird and I wanted to know what everyone else was talking about and I came across something called Aphantasia.

A certain family member I’ll call Pam has 3kids. The kids ages are 12F, 9B, 4F. The 4yo girl and 9yo boy get a little too friendly with each other almost all the time when we see them. The boy offers to take the younger girl to the rest room and offers to help change her when there are willing females around to do it including the older sister. I say this because he has shoved older sister out of the way to help dress little sister. The two are always sitting very close to each other, the boy asks her to sit on his lap. They wrestle a lot (rolling around on top of each other). It is striking many of the family as very concerning and could be leading to what could be some kind of sexual abuse once the oldest sibling is working or out of the house more often (she’s the baby sitter, parents are gone all day nearly) and the younger two are left alone.

This has been going on for almost two years from what I’ve learned. It’s a very distinct pattern of behavior.

I fear if this isn’t addressed soon and properly it will get out of hand.

My concern is how do I talk to their mom without sounding judgmental on her parenting, but still convey the level of concern. I don’t think either parent is aware or even think the behavior is weird. As someone who has personally experienced sexual assault by a family member I’m hyper aware of these kinds of situations and don’t want anyone else to go through what I did. 

Please help me find the right way to approach this with parents.

FYI, Pam can be very hot headed, and we’re not as close as I would like, so it’s hard to have a conversation about something so serious without worrying about her thinking I’m just judging and not concerned",03Jul2020,1
290,"Rundown on my mental health-

Before I start i’d like to clarify my rapist is my uncle (cliche I know). Its been five years since I took him to court, he got sentenced only 6 months. My entire life up till 4th grade has been assault by this man. Coming out of it I was depressed, scarred, i had therapy. It didnt help. I had anger issues. I attempted to take my own life in fifth grade (thats my secret though). I dealt with physical flashbacks, ptsd and major suicidal thoughts. I’m currently going into tenth grade. In 7th grade, I had gotten better. I was starting to be ok with guy touch (hugs even or just shoulder taps). I was happy. I had managed to pull myself out of this state. I thought i’d gotten over it in going into 8th grade summer. I didnt, I had numbed myself from those emotions. I was happy though! I’ve been happy. My freshman year i had a mental breakdown telling my comm class about my book. It all came back. My ptsd, anxiety I didnt even remember I had. I started getting anxiety attacks (completely new atm I forgot I even had them in 4th grade as a result). 

The reasoning for it all/family mental abuse- 

I live with my dad, brother and my grandpa. The entire 5 years, none of them ever asked if I was okay. They took time to help my rapist get back on track though. My dad vacations with him. They invite him into my home when im at my moms. My dad has even told me before that he is not a bad person. By dealing with all this, its the reason I cant move on. I deal with them talking about him like nothing happened all the time. I got into therapy after the comm incident. It turned into weeks of me preparing to confront them and tell them how they’ve mentally hurt me. I’ve talked to my grandpa as my therapist suggested, because hes the best one with this. Hes careful around me. He is my rapists father, so I empathize with him. I got a lot less stress after that. I stopped having attacks. I’m preparing to tell my family sunday, and i’m stressed. I cut, it wasnt sad though. It was to feel like I had control over myself and my life. I dont want to keep doing that. If somebody could please help me with finding something to take my mind off it let me know. I skate to feel safe and have fun. I don’t know what I need to hear. I guess I just want support, I need reassurance that it’ll be okay. I know they love me, its just that they love him just as much. I’m sorry this is messy, its more so a rant.",03Jul2020,1

37 male-no kids-single- unemployed. BFA 2007.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, nothing has been working out 

I bumbled around as a visual and digital artist after the 2008 crash and did the starving artist thing but somehow I got lucky and landed/built a job equivalent to an event planner that payed unreasonably well. It was a lucky break and I live an asectic, just a habit from being an artist,  plus I don't like ""things"", so I hired a stock broker and just dumped everything into the stock market and stopped thinking about it. My luck compounded a little so great, at least for the time being.

Well, things seemed peachy until the city I lived rioted and then soon after everything fell apart. My job evaporated, which was sad but I didn't deserve that kind of success anyway but at least I have money for retirement   since I know I'm probably not going to duplicate that success again in my life, I got lucky and slid into a little bubble that I may have been uniquely suited for. 

Anyway, my girl friend was pretty low and stressed out by the riots and all the insanity and after 2.5 years or being clean she went back to opioids, ODed and hurt herself really bad. When I got home from work that night I thought she was asleep so I left her alone, I fiddled around on my computer chatted with my roommate and passed out the couch. I didn't notice until around noon the next day. When we got her to the hospital she had been out for a long time, like 18-20 hours. She got brain damage, nerve damage in her arm and hand along with some kidney and liver damage. She had insurance through her parents otherwise- I don't want to think about it. Yet, I still had to make some cold hard calculus and left her with her parents, part in panic and emotional fraying and in part because I'm a horrible person. God I hate myself so much but every time I went to see her she just started crying and she couldn't talk and It was just this maelstrom of emotion that I ejected myself from but I just can't figure it out, I revisit those moments over and over and over and if I had just touched her, or looked at her more closely what-if.

I stayed with my parents for about a year because at that time in my life  I couldn't stand to be alone and I find it very difficult to make close friends being able to start conversation with anyone, with almost everyone, I use to love chatting about the whimsy of life. 

I feel into a real dark hole. I drank myself stupid for nearly a year but I managed to back away from that precipice and now I'm back to my usual routine and I have my health and my mind back,great, good for me. Then I moved across the country to reconnect with my brother who had just gotten out of the army.

I rented a super small studio apartment (I like tiny spaces) and began to look for some shit jobs to meet some people and start connecting with people . Have a lot of experience in restaurants, breweries, distilleries and vineyards, it how I managed to get so lucky, it turned out that I'm also really good at organizing and throwing parties, which is funny because I'm a major introvert, yet I know that fundamentally everyone likes the right kind of attention and everyone loves a spectacle and I love to deliver ,or at least I use to,  I use to really enjoy waiting tables, bar tending, cooking, mixology and watching all the funny crazy shit people do, and I still do, but just not as much as I did I figured I gracefully slip back into some minimum wage jobs  and go back to school for something new. I was fundamentally changed, I wonder about all the people who got hurt, or drove drunk or were otherwise compromised by the events I helped to build. I am fundamentally changed.

Nothing was really clicking at first, worked a few months here, and few months there but I just couldn't find the right fit. So me being the fool that I am, I just sat back and decided to take it easy for a month or two and wait for the hiring season to go full tilt and I would slip into one of the hotter restaurants in town. If there is one thing I know about restaurants its that managers are just waiting for a good worker to walk in so they can fire the idiot on board. Then covid-19, well fuck. Looks like silly dreams are put on hold.

I never wanted a conventional life anyway, I like new experiences, practicing emergent creativity and most of all just listening to people talk about their experiences, views and lives. People are throwing out so much information in their gestures, micro-gestures, clothing, hair-style, speech patterns, mannerism and foot wear that I can't help but drink it all in- they're so amazing, special, interesting, wonderful and horrible all at once I simply can't get over it. 

Anyhow, I guess I'm feeling what most of the country is feeling right now. and at the rate I'm spending money on just rent and food is unsustainable, I'll be broke in another 5 years and that is only if nothing bad happens, like a medical scare or an accident, its only a matter of probability. Life, to me, about is about patience, breath and vision.

So here is my question: 

I'm seriously considering buying an RV and living in that and just working in different parts of the country at ""whatever"" jobs, any shitty job I can find. It seems like it would, potentially,be much cheaper than renting an apartment and being stuck somewhere for a year and if someone asks to much of me or tries to squeeze me for extra labor or time I can just split. I could bounce around and talk to all the weird amazing people out there and do all the minimum wage jobs and see what I like. 

If I went back to school now it would be for green-energy or waste-management but I'd have to figure out someway to bay back the debt and be honest, those 2 fields are undervalued and I wouldn't be able to pay back the loans. 

but really, I'm up for anything as long as I got food and a bed. I could be a farm hand, or a day laborer at a construction site, a maybe work at a meat packing plant or a security guard or really anything that doesn't require a 4 year degree, I just want to check it all out. I know it sounds insane, am I insane? The economy is dead, colleges are dead, politics are dead  It's all gig work now and  this stationary way of living is at complete odds with the new american reality. demands and its been driving me insane for my entire life. I figure I have another 20 years left in me, which maybe is 10 years longer than the planet has, right?  

Besides, I can't imagine I'll ever fall in love again.  It was kind of a weird fluke that that girl stole my heart. It kinda figures that the only kind of person I could love wasn't meant for this world. She was a singer, a poet and philosopher and she captivated me in a way that no one else ever will. It's a shame that I wasn't able to do the same for her, at least not when it mattered.

296,"So I graduated with a degree in Graphic Design in December. I have applied for almost every job opening since then in the nearest large city to me (2 hours away). I have made it to three in-person interviews but didn’t get the job. 

And since Corona started, I have gotten absolutely no responses. Plus there’s obviously not that many companies hiring right now to begin with. 

So here’s the catch and why I’m impatient... I’m 25 and have spent most of the last 6 years or so dealing with periods of intense depression and anxiety, not to mention I’m still living with my parents and never have lived outside of my hometown. 

I feel like my life experience is extremely stunted and honestly, I feel like progressing in my life is almost more important than a career right now. Also, it’s extremely important to me to start dating again since I basically put that on hold for a little while trying to finish school. Although I know right now isn’t the absolute ideal time and it’s not going to be easy to gain normal life experiences right now. I just know that I can’t even start trying to make connections here romantically or friendship wise if I’m planning on leaving. 

I actually have a few years of experience as an office assistant/office manager so I think I could possibly manage getting that kind of job for a little bit and maybe getting a roommate. Or even just a random serving/retail job if I had to. I have a little over $6,000.00 saved up and no debt. But I don’t want to get into a dead end job and give up on getting a job in my field either. 

Especially since Corona lockdown, it’s super apparent that at 25 years old, it’s probably not healthy to live in a small house with my parents. I’m doing terribly socially and I hate living in a smaller city to begin with. What should I do?

Tldr; Struggling to get a job in my field and desperately wanting to move to the city. Should I take any job I can get and go ahead and move out or hold out until I can get a job in my field?

Going to college in the middle of the city, I'm used to drunk guys coming up and telling me how pretty I am. I just laugh it off and move on. I've been blessed/cursed with the ability to just not care. One guy, late 50s, even gave me a hug while I waited for the bus, and went on about how pretty and polite I was. Then he stood behind me with his friends waiting for the bus, still going on about how happy he was he got a hug. I didn't really care, it was pretty strange, but it gave me a weird story to tell.

The guy at work, I'll call him Bob, is about 70 years old. He's married, has kids he doesn't talk to anymore, and loves to talk. When I first met Bob I was on my 15 minute break in the break room, playing on my phone. We struck up a conversation and all was fine. I don't mind talking to strangers. He said I was a pretty young girl, great smile, and had a good personality. I thanked him and we went on talking about cars and whatnot.

Well after that, he started getting really close to me before talking. He would get so close he'd touch my arm. He'd also try and hold my hand or give me hugs. It was just strange in a work environment. He would also comment a lot on my physical appearance, like ""Oh wow, looking good today! *wink*"" or ""You're looking pretty good in those shorts! If only I was 50 years younger!"" or ""Everything that USED to work really well, just isn't working the same anymore. What a pity for us, huh (he was talking about his weiner)"". I haven't seen him do this to other girls, but that doesn't mean it isn't happening.

The only reason I'm concerned now is because I found out he was fired from his last job for s**xual harassment. A lightbulb went off in my head saying ""Maybe something isn't right here"". I told my Mom what's been happening and what I found out and she said ""We don't know the full story. I wouldn't worry too much about it. Just avoid him"". I told my manager in training about how I might be getting harassed, and he (23M) said ""Oh... I don't really know what to do? I.. well.. I can talk to the Supervisor?"" I told him not to worry about it.

If I tell the Supervisor, Bob risks losing his job and his income. His wife will suffer the consequences of her husband's actions. Am I overreacting and just avoid him or should I speak up?",03Jul2020,1
301,"I’ve had two relationships in my life so far. I’m really insecure when I talk about them. Even if it’s just a slight reference to them. I don’t care about them anymore nor do I want them back in my life. I realized we weren’t good for each other and I’m happy they’ve moved on. However I feel very judged for them, I feel like people still think I care about them or miss them. I’m still hurt and I miss what we had but not them. It’s at a point where I actively try avoiding any conversation that they could possibly be brought up in. I have a lot of people who I feel have said some very mean things about my relationships. Such as “I always thought you’re girlfriends were ugly” or “the only reason they dated you is cause they were desperate” or even saying I had no place dating them in the first place. I don’t bitch about my past relationships anymore nor do I drone on about missing them and asking why. But say if I happen to tell a funny story that had them involved a typical response I’ll get is “it’s been over a year you need to get over it.” Or “you talk about them way too much.” The people saying these things just keep adding to the hurt I already feel from those relationships. Is any of this right? Should I feel judged by these people? Am I doing something wrong? Should I not even recall the happy memories I had with past relationships as to avoid talking about them and not being judged? Do I even have a right to feel hurt still? I’m not usually this emotional about my past relationships but recently a lot of people have been putting their very unwanted two cents in. I also feel I should mention people will give their opinion on this subject even when I’m not talking about it. I’m not the sole one bringing up my past relationships. I’ve had friends who will say something out of the blue like “y’know those first three months after your breakup you would just not stop talking about them dude.

302,"It’s really hard to explain. She doesn’t hate people purely because they are men. She also has male friends. 

I am very quiet and I don’t talk around people very often. My brother is the opposite, very loud and energetic. Sometimes she will say things like “This is the difference between a male child and a female child.” if my brother isn’t doing what she wants in public. Instead of realizing that there are different reasons for people to act differently, she just assumes that my brother doesn’t stay quiet and pay attention because he’s a boy.

She also argues with our father a lot and I think that is part of the problem. She associates anything that she doesn’t like about my dad as “male things.” She likes making passive aggressive comments about things like that.

The other night we were watching Maleficent. During the first part of the movie she kept telling my brother that Maleficent was nice in the beginning until a man came and messed it up, emphasizing the fact that it was a mans fault. When Maleficent put the spell on the baby, my dad said “Wow that wasn’t very nice.” Then my mom says “Really I thought she had a lot of restraint.”

Once my brother had asked “Why is there so many little kids playing fighting games like the ones I play?” My mom told him that it’s because their dads let them play those types of games without their mothers permission (she knew about the games we play btw she just didn’t pay attention or something). She said that they are irresponsible and only do it so that they can also play video games. I said “Well what if is their moms let them play?” and my dad said that there are a lot of girls who like video games. Her response was “Those girls are 12 year olds.” She also started saying that she hasn’t met very many responsible dads.

She always feels the need to tell my brother that if he doesn’t do enough to help out, he will be useless in the future. The only thing she says to me is “Never get married.”

308,"All my friend has done is talk about the new school that he is in from the moment he had enrolled and got accepted, to his new classmates and so on. We congratulated him on the matter but now it is getting a bit annoying as it seems that it is the only thing he talks about. I think it is the fifth consecutive day that he has done this I understand that he is happy and we continue to encourage him but how do I deal with this? Of course we will never know his true intentions of whether he just wants to inform us or if he is humble bragging or maybe a sneaky mix of both, but for my sake what can I do? Must I say congratulations for the fifth time this week and continue to give him the praise he desires so much? I don’t want to ghost them whenever they talk about the school I always want to keep some kind of presence as to avoid any drama or concern. 

Thanks in advance guys! I have asked myself numerous times if I am just envious but how could you not be right? In every situation, we all can definitely feel it lingering at times but I am sure that I am content and I do not truly resent him in any way just annoyed at his recent actions. He will  still be my brother nevertheless even if he continues to do this.",03Jul2020,1
309,"Context, I (21M) took lessons at the beginning of high school but my instructor wasn't very good at teaching and I also not knowing any better bought a terrible guitar which has now basically disintegrated. 

Due to the current situation around COVID-19, I am looking to start learning the guitar by myself essentially from scratch. I am primarily looking for structured lessons I can find online or some service I can subscribe to as I don't mind paying a little as it will probably cost less than what a tutor would. Or if you even have any other opinion on how I should approach this then please don't hesitate to let me know.

Also, I would appreciate some recommendations for good beginner's acoustic guitars along with any tips when starting to learn.

So the time has come for me to move out and to try to be self sustaining.
Yesterday it finally happened.I packed all my stuff and moved to the apartment(Its like 2 blocks further that where I used to live with parents)
Everything went well until my mom called to ask me how am I doing,am I managing,the usual stuff...
And right at the end of the call out of nowhere she told me my dad cried when he entered my empty room that was full with stuff and etc just a couple of hours prior.I instantly felt bad and couldn’t stop thinking about how I’m hurting my father...
It got worse today when I went home early in the morning and when he saw me he just bursted into tears which ruined me since I never saw my dad cry...
So what should I do?

It wasn’t huge, but it had a the whole town there and the show was supposed to be a long one. About ten minutes into the show, I start shaking and I can’t breathe. The person I’m with notices and decided that we should leave to the car so I can calm down. I’ve had no history with issues with loud noises. Since then I’ve avoided any huge firework gathering and such as 4 of July and New Years. Now 4 of July is this weekend and I’ve started hearing random fireworks go off.

314,"Currently having second thoughts after finishing my first year at university. I chose to go to a school that is Top 1-5 in the nation for my major, but my major is a creative one so academic prestige doesn’t matter as much (many days). My college is big, but it doesn’t have a very active Greek scene, school spirit, etc, and my major is very taxing. 

The school I almost chose has amazing Greek life, sports, and is in my home city. I didn’t choose it because you are admitted to the college, and then you have to fight freshman year for a spot in the major &lt;20% acceptance rate, where as a got a direct spot into my major at the college I go to. 

The school I go to is out of state, and the party school is in state, so I would have saved A TON of money if I went there instead. Considering Covid is making things all online again, I am starting to feel like I should have chosen the party school, bc I would be saving so much money, and they have a ton of social stuff to offer. At this point, I’m not even getting the experience that made me chose the college I go to now, due to everything being online. BTW the party school is a top public university, just not too in my major. 

Am I being a dumb teenager for regretting my decision? Did I make the wrong decision? Help... I think I’m going a little crazy being quarantined still lol.",03Jul2020,1

317,"My son was born on the 15th of may, at this point, I had a job where I was the sole breadwinner of the family, my wife works but not now due to covid.

My son contracted meningitis and was taken from Wyoming to Colorado on an ambulance. My employer was fine with this and gave me the time I needed. When I brought my son in, he had a fever of 102 and they needed to test my wife for covid before they knew it was meningitis, this is the beginning of her anxiety. The tests came back in 24 hours and she was negative, but she now was very worried about being sick.

This is when she began getting chest pain and fevers. She got tested again and was negative so she thought it was just allergies and a cold and pain from child birth. Her condition worsened and it turned out she had a pulmonary embolism. We were a mess at this point, we were stuck in Wyoming and our baby was in the NICU in Denver. Luckily he was getting better though. Over the next few days, my wife's condition got worse and it turned out she caught pneumonia. Keep in mind that we do not go out in public like the other people in this horrendous state and if we have to we keep our distance, make it quick and wear our masks.

We were once again stuck in Wyoming waiting for her to recover as we would not be allowed in the hospital while she had a fever. Once she finally felt a little bit better and didn't have a fever we were able to  go to the hospital and finally be with our child for the last few days he was there. 

When we returned home, my wife's condition once again worsened. It turns out she had about 200 mL of fluid in her lungs. 

This happened about two weeks ago and she still hasn't felt necessarily better since, not to mention the emotional distress she's under. Now this is where the problem comes in, at my job I'm responsible for shifts anywhere from 12 to 24 to 30 hours long. She is not well enough to be with both of our children for that amount of time she needs to spend a lot of time recovering. The meds she has been prescribed also make her very tired, she was advised to take them no matter what though or else she may have another pulmonary embolism.

Now what I am looking for advice on here is what should I do now?

I have spent the last year learning web development and an ready for a job but can probably not be hired, especially not in Wyoming as that's not really what they do here. It's hard to get hired anywhere with out a lot of experience so that's kind of off the table, I also can not get a job at a restaurant or grocery store as no one here practices any social distancing or safety measures whatsoever and my wife is immunocompromised. There are very few remote jobs available here as most large companies that offer that don't staff in Wyoming because there's really no point. I have been hired by a few companies only to be told they don't hire in Wyoming.

I guess I'm just lost and hopeless and need literally any advice.",03Jul2020,1

319,"My boyfriend (M17) was the one who found his brother (M14) and had to do CPR and call the police. This happened 2 weeks ago, on father’s day. His brother had been struggling with mental illness for a long time and had many previous suicide attempts beforehand. 
My boyfriend struggled with anxiety attacks during the first week, but now his old personality is coming back. he is able to be goofy again and make jokes around me, although at times I can see in his eyes that he is still hurting. His brother and him were very close, as his family moved around a ton growing up so they always had eachother. 

me and my boyfriend have been dating for a year and a half. a few days ago his parents had a memorial for his brother by lighting a few fireworks and gathering family and friends. they had a poster of a picture of my boyfriend, his brother, and me. this was in front of the house, in a way to honour his brother. i thought it was sweet that they chose a picture with me in it, although i was a bit intimidated. today, my boyfriend showed me that his parents ordered photo books of his brother for everyone in his family. i am also included in the photo book, as there is a nice picture of my boyfriend, his brother, and I. it’s a very nice gesture from his family but it also scares me. what if we break up in the future and his family and my boyfriend have to have my picture with their dead brother/son?

i love my boyfriend a lot. this has been very difficult and i’m trying my best to support him. i’m trying to not be selfish around him, because lately he’s been acting “normal” again and i’ve been giving that as an excuse to make petty arguments again, or choose my needs over his (if he calls i won’t pick up on the first ring if i’m busy and it mildly inconveniences me, etc). i’ve been feeling down lately, i’ve just been overwhelmed with work/family and friends. but i don’t want to complain to him because he’s going through something much worse. sometimes we’ll be calling or talking in person and i know the things i’m saying aren’t getting through to him, because he’s thinking of his brother. (is i’m telling a story about my day etc) I know this is normal and i’m being selfish. I just can’t stop from being jealous. and it’s awful to say that i’m jealous of his dead brother. but i know things are never going to be “normal” or the way they were between my boyfriend and I. at times i think it will be, my boyfriend will act like his normal self, and then later on when i ask him to rate his day /10 (i’ve been doing that lately just to check on his mood) it’ll be a low score despite me genuinely thinking he was happy. i’ll even think to myself “he’s back to his old self again” and i’ll be happy about it because i’ll think it’s normal again. i don’t know what i’m asking. i just need advice for this. i love my boyfriend so much. he is the kindest person ever and this whole situation isn’t fair to him.",03Jul2020,1
320,"As a preface, I am not excusing the things my girlfriend has done to make my father dislike her, I just don’t know how to ‘fix’ the situation. 

My girlfriend was staying over at mine for 3 weeks and over that period of time she has been around my family quite a bit. My girlfriend would be a lot more forward and outspoken than the average person. This means there have been ‘passionate’ conversations at the table during dinner or any other time we would all be together. A sibling of mine let it slip that my father thought my gf was ‘childish’ and ‘spoiled’. 

The reasons for why he thinks this are unimportant as I will plainly say that he is correct in the sense of how she acted sometimes during her stay. She would say the odd thing that my father would hear with annoyance. I know my girlfriend however and even though she was wrong at those times with some things she said or how she said them, she is a great person. She has a good character and has good humor and is generally kind hearted. I won’t go on, believe me, she’s awesome.

I guess the issue is is that my dad has only picked up on her ‘bad moments’ and hasn’t really seen a lot of her ‘good side’ as he just wasn’t around at a different time. He has seen her ‘flaws’ a disproportionate amount.

Really I just want some advice on what I can do to try and help this bad situation. It’s important to me that my family and girlfriend get along at the very least because if there’s one thing I hate it’s family drama, something I really hope to avoid.",03Jul2020,1

322,"My mom was the only person I talked to when I needed help, i’m depressed with no friends I have no one to talk to.

I feel like all the issues at home is because of me and the stupid way I act, I cry a lot. I try to hold it in, but I can’t I always cry. People in my family hate that and will bash me for it. But I can’t help it. I cry over anything. 

I always listen to my mom. I always take her side, even when she was cheating I had her back and tried to understand her. I was 13, young, and scarred. However I’m not close with my dad so I decided to act like I forgot about it and that I was fine. 

I have no friends. I got bullied at school since I was 8 for being Asian. I was made fun of for looking a certain way. I’m an easy target because i’m quiet and have no friends. The only friend I had ditched me for new people. Now I really have no friends.

As weird as it might sound, I also have IBS. Stress triggers it even more and when you dread going to school every morning the pains get sharper. So that contributes to all the issues I have.

Today, I had a fight with my sister. It was stupid, she was yelling at me for no reason so I fought back. My dad came and told us to stop. So i did. All of a sudden he tells me to hug her. I told him no, because why would I? It’s ridiculous. 

Then all of a sudden he started telling me to be like that, to live like this forever, and that I have no reason to be “hoping” to be respected by my sister. 

I find that so ridiculous. 

I started crying and went to my room and texted my mom and told her i can’t hold it in anymore and I really want to disappear.
I thought she’d help me, and tell me everything is ok. Actually she just told me to never talk to her again. 

For someone who has been trying to understand her and her stupid actions since I was young, iI felt like I was the only one that truly cared for her. I felt like she didn’t appreciate me or any of my efforts when she needed me. 

Now I actually don’t know what to do. I really feel alone now. I have no one to talk to.  No friends to rant to, no family that understands me.",03Jul2020,1
323,"I literally made a Reddit account just for advice for this problem. Please don't fail me Reddit.

I met one of my best friends just before my 13th birthday over Vine. We spoke nearly every day over Kik for many years and in 2017 I even travelled from Canada to Portugal to meet her for the first time! It was honestly one of the best weeks of my entire life. In the past year or so the messaging has slowed down due to school and work and as of recently have both just finished high school  and are moving onto University soon. My friend, lets call her M, has always made really bad choices when it comes to relationships which is fine, young and dumb, I get it. A couple months ago she started talking online with this guy from Nigeria who is honest to god one of the shittest people I have ever encountered and I haven't even spoken to him. He's homophobic, controlling, abusive and just overwhelmingly bad. At first he wanted to talk to her at every moment of every day to the point where she had to move some of reschedule meetings with her teachers and such because he wanted to talk to her then. Then he had the information to all of her accounts, email, social meeting, that stuff. Soon they'd start fighting and he would scream at her and say that he just punch a hole in his wall and it's all her fault and she's contacting me because she knows this is wrong, that he's to clingy and it's getting bad. My advice is obvious, dump him. Block him. Not like you actually have ever met him, he's not going to fly from Nigeria to Portugal and if he did just call the police. This is where things get sticky, it then turns into oh I can't do that, I'm afraid of being alone and I get it. She doesn't have a lot of friends close to her or even in her country and there aren't a lot of people that she can talk to 24/7, even me, I have a job that I need to pay for upcoming school in September. If she didn't want to break up with him that's not really fine but I guess it'll have to be. My only advice was that she needed to set boundaries which she said she's done and I told her that I believe in her and that if she needs me to fucking get on a call with him and tell him he's an abusive tool I'll do it. They seem to work things out and everything goes back to normal until a couple days when she messages me over discord to say that she has to end our friendship because her boyfriend is getting jealous and that she won't be able to read any response I send. Now me, a clingy bitch, was not going to let this happen. I have tried to message her throughout everything, including:

\-Kik

\-Discords

\-Skype

\-Whatsapp

\-Gmail

\-Instagram

\-Twitter

\-Snapchat

\-Text Message

\-I even posted on her Wattpad account last used in 2016

My only other point of contact has been her mother who truthfully speaks limited English and although she's said she's also worried about M, has only gotten back to me with slower and slower replies. I've also spent around 30 dollars CAD sending random shit to her what I think is her apartment (I got the address from breaking into her Aliexpress and taking the dress from there) so assuming that's right she should have a dingding (google it), a book of pictures from our first and only meeting and a bunch of Canada merchandise coming in the mail. If that's not her address then I wasted a bunch of money and I hope someone enjoys the gifts. I'm at the point where I can't really afford to be spending all this money contacting her mom with overage fees and sending all this shit in the mail which won't probably get to her for like another month or two if that's even her address. I know we are in a global pandemic and that I'm kind of short on money but I am considering flying out to Portugal to confront her (of course depending on what her mom says about that). What do you guys think? I can't keep leaving over 50 missed Skype/instagram/Whatsapp calls on her phone every single day I just don't have the time. Giving up isn't an option, I am willing to do anything for her especially when she so clearly needs help. How do I get her to get in contact with me?

327,"There is so much backstory to what I need help with. I truly have to come here for new ideas at this point because nothing is working. 

tl:dr - please read it so you can read how crazy my brother is and help me. Otherwise just scroll on, cus it's too fucked up to shorten. 

My mom is at her wits end with my older brother. He and I have different dads, and my mom had to raise all of us as a single mother so he never had a father figure of any sort. My mom's bf of 20 years still won't live with her because of him, and refuses to interact with him as well. 

He is a 14 year old trapped in a 29 year old's body plagued with mental disabilities and problems that no one can help (that we know of). I need advice on how to help my mom get him out of her house for good.  

He is diagnosed autistic, depressed, schitzoaffective disorder, paranoid, defiant authority disorder, sleep disorder, and the cherry on top is that he was raised by my now-dead grandma that spoiled him and brainwashed him into being a conspiracy theorist, among many other things (like not trusting my mom, or doctors, medicine, pretty much anything.) 

He dropped out of high school at 16 because teachers failed to implement his IEP, and at the time my mom didn't know this was something to dispute and report. He has always had such a hard time learning, and has been fired from every job he ever had because of his incapability to follow structure and rules. He got his GED a few years back and tried to find work continually for years at a time: cart guy, janitor, construction, car wash. All fired him for defying general rules, or lashing out on asshole customers that ""had it coming"". He just isn't the type to shut up when someone is in the wrong. The customer is not right to him. 

Anyway, the grandma mentioned earlier died about 4 years ago and things have gotten excessively worse. Especially because she always tried to turn him against my mom and undermine anything she tried to set up for him to succeed in life. He was coddled and handed a lot by her, causing a ton of tension between our mom, and his favorite person. My mom and my grandma (her mom) were always battling it out for what was best for him. So, grandma died, and my mom wanted me to tell him the news. It was a very hard situation for her. Although there was a ton she hated about her mom, she loved her obviously, but it wasn't something she could bring herself to do. Telling my brother about her death was traumatizing...he thought I was joking. He started laughing, calling me a bitch and liar. Then finally realizing I'm not that fucked up. He went scary mad. I can't explain it. 

He was convinced our grandma was murdered, because God spoke to him earlier that week claiming that ""grandma was getting better."" He believes free masons, Illuminati, someone following him did this to hurt him and get back at him. For..???

He is a strange guy, and there are some characteristics that stand out about him that I will leave out. However, when he goes out, he insists on wearing protection to hide who he is, along with large knives or blades, or sometimes even an ax or hammer. At one point, he was jogging around the neighborhood with weights and his protection in a backpack, and someone called the cops on him, which progressed into a detainment, his resist to the detainment, and finally, his commitment to a mental hospital against his will to check if he was a danger to society. My mom and I didn't know this at the time, so when he went missing, we got extremely worried and knew something was up, because on top of everything else, he is paranoid and doesn't leave the house for anything except exercise. After searching for him, breaking into his room with fear of suicide and finding many jugs of his own piss in his room, she finally called the cops and found out they sent him to a mental institution to be evaluated. This is just the tip. There, they kept him for about a week, giving him meds that he pretended to take, and questioned him. He believes the sergeant that took him away had been following him and was after him for some time (for what, idk). He was finally cleared to go, with a court order to take meds and diagnosed schitzoaffective, paranoid, DAD, etc. He was pretty traumatized from the situation because it took about 10 cops to take him away that day. 

Fast forward about 6 months. This was three years ago now (he was 26 if it matters). My brother wasn't letting my mom take her cat to get spayed for whatever reason and locked himself and the cat in the bathroom. She lost money on the appointment because he refused to come out. He is obsessed with cats- always has been. He cares for them more than himself, and has 3 shared with my mom currently. So, since he refused to let her take the cat, she was pissed. They got into an extremely escalated fight to the point he said he would slit her throat while waving his knife around in her face. She called the cops on him while he locked himself back in the bathroom and they committed him once again, having to drag him away kicking and screaming. They committed him this time. He lived there for almost a year. They moved him around hospitals, group homes, assisted living, and he's explained it as his ""crucible year"". His assigned roommates have done horrible things to him and in front of him: masturbate in front of him, meth and other drugs, molestation, sex trafficking. He still hasn't forgiven my mom for sending him away.  Around Christmas time two Christmases ago, he begged and pleaded and insisted he would do every single thing my mom requested just to come back home, see the cats, and live with her. Although disabled, he was a professional manipulator because she let him come home with her. He cried and kissed the floor when he was released. 

Things were fine for a minute. But here I am, begging strangers for help and ideas on how I can remove him from her house. 

It starts with little things: didn't clean the litter box, leaves food out of the fridge, wakes my mom by being too noisy when she needs to work, sleeping all day and up all night, talking about how fucked the world is and how he is better off dead, saying the church she goes to is corrupted, picking fights with assholes that he definitely won't win against and almost getting shot, jogging at strange times of night, standing on park benches to stretch and yell and then confronting the women that called the cops on him, watching conspiracy videos all day on YouTube, not trying to do anything to make his own life better, merely existing day to day and bringing nothing but anguish to my mom, poking my mom until she explodes and then calls her insane. 

My mom instilled rules where he couldn't wear masks (pre-covid-19) and backpacks full of weapons, curfews, and he needed to take his meds. None of this happened. He just ignored all of it. Even with the court order, he refused. She has signed him up for disability relief checks, and that has started coming in for her and finally started helping my mom pay for some of his expenses he's accumulated over the years. 

He has threatened so many things at this point I can't even list it. Is anyone still reading? He said if my mom ever calls the cops on him again, he will die before being committed again. 

Suggestions not to offer:

1. He said he will not use the disability to live in his own government funded living- there are druggies and idiots he doesn't want to associate with. He said he would rather be homeless...
2. He is extremely OCD and insists he could live on the streets, but this would send him closer to what he wants to avoid in #1. 
3. How would he live with his cats on the streets? 
4. We have no family in other states that could help. 
5. I cannot and will not take him in. I have a 9 month old daughter and husband very allergic to cats and bullshit.
6. My mom will not just kick him out even though she hates him at this point. She would feel tremendous guilt when/if something happens to him. She is too forgiving. Too nice. 
7. He can't work. 
8. He refuses to go back to mental facilities. 
9. He is disabled enough to receive funding, but smart enough to manipulate the system and be cleared to leave the mental hospital. 
10. Therapy, meds, drs, none of it means dick to him. 
11. I don't want my mom to off herself to avoid this situation, and I am terrified at this point that this is her last resort. 
12. I've suggested mediating a move-out situation with restraining orders in place, but she evades the idea because it's confrontational and would end traumatically. 

HOW THE FUCK DOES THIS SITUATION END IN A GOOD WAY?

328,I’m 23 years old. I have a beautiful daughter who I love more than anything in the world. Since the corona virus started my ex hasn’t let me see her in just about 4 months and it tears me apart.

336,"***Context(who I am):*** I'm a 19F, barely an adult however just enough of an adult to know what stupid, horrible things I did in my school years. I did so many of those things that when I came to and realized I had a panic attack and now fear everyone close in my life doesn't have a positive view of me and the rest hate me and are ready to talk bad about me and destroy my life... fun, I know. I'm trying hard to break that part of me, but it's still there

***Context Setting***: Writing and books have always been a part of me. I began on Wattpad because I looked up 'book apps' and got that (not what I thought it was but I went with it). I stayed on the app for a long time until I realized, ""Hey I like writing, maybe I should pursue that as a career!"" So I changed my name, deleted any books I didn't like or didn't think was professional and changed my attitude completely. I'm still on Wattpad because even though I know their reputation is horrid, old habits die hard and I'm afraid to step out of my comfort zone. I decided to not use my name, photos, or anything because even if I become a big name, I won't be making big bucks so I want to have another job and allow myself some freedom. 

***Problem:*** As of now, it feels like everyone and their mother are being canceled, Dominos, Home Depot, Jenna Marbles, Shane Dawson, Joe Rogan, Wendys. I get news every day on who the new cancelee is, and I get this thought that says, *""We did so many bad things. What if we're next? You're a horrible person. Your comeuppance is gonna happen.""* I'm wondering what I should do. I NEVER want to talk about who I was. It feels like if I bring it up I'll have to reface everything with eyes on me and hit rock bottom. I know I'm going to get hate if I make it, but canceling looks like everyone wants to bury you and no matter what you do, you're irredeemable.

341,"So this is my(21M) first time posting anywhere, but let's cut to the chase. I have nothing crazy in my life, but the extreme hate I have for myself and the people around me. Let's just say I'm at the point where I'm slowly tilting off a cliff, and I'm ready to accept the fall. I care too much about the people around me, and how they think. I'm what you call ""sonder"" meaning I understand that everyone is going through something, they have their own life, and what that does to me is keep everything to myself because I don't want to disturb others with my problems. When they have a completely different problem of their own. I'm hesitant to post this, let alone to take some person's time of day. I have no one I can go to that I can feel that understands me. Not my family, not my friends, no one. All the times I went to anyone, I already knew what they were going to say and the ""solution"" they would give but even if I knew. I never lived by my own words, or took the first step to do anything. I lack motive to do anything in life. I can't be happy with myself with people struggling everywhere. I can't just live my own life without having some outside perspective make me feel like shit because I chose to do something for myself. ""Everyone wants the best for me"" but no one ever makes me feel like they want the best for me until I break my silence. I can really go on, and on but I feel like I want to stat some of my own history now. My mom divorced my dad when I was 5 because he would physically abuse me, and my mom. Breaking your own sons arm isn't funny dad. I also had a little brother who was just born not too long ago when they split. We ended up in a different state, moving apartment to apartment, school to school. With virtually nothing. Me and my brother grew up with nothing but laying around on the floor as my mom worked two jobs to get us by. (FYI I really love my mom and respect her for all her hardship to keep a roof over our head. I have nothing but love towards her) We would try to go out and play but sadly moving place to place leaves you numb to the fact that you will lose your friends, and you have to make new ones. Although, making friends were hard so I gave up making any friends before I was even in middle school. My job was to take care of my brother, and even I failed at that. Let's just say he's not a fully functional person because of the lack of attention he's gotten. Being older now I really regret it, and try my best to help him understand things. Idk why I chose to say this now, but that was in the past. Everything else is just a blur because everyday was nothing. I was a kid everyone thought was mute. I'm sensitive, I tell myself everyday don't give a fuck about what anyone but you says. But now all I say is I'm a piece of garbage, and I can't do anything. I'm posting this now because I never went to a therapist or went to the doctors to get myself checked for anything in my life. I was looking to go to the therapist, but the money just isn't there. I have nothing traumatic that has happened to me, and yet I'm here being selfish doing nothing for myself or for the people around me. I never thought about suicide because I 'm fully aware of the impact that could take place with the people around me, but I can't help but think of how easy it would be to disappear off the face of the earth if those people weren't around me. Now a days I forget how to feel happy besides putting up a facade for the people around me. Why can't I just help myself, why can't I do anything, why can't I just take a step forward in life? If you made it this far, I can just be happy for you listening to my story. This was a lot, and I couldn't thank the people around me enough.",03Jul2020,1

\-----------------------

tl/dr: I would consider myself a pretty responsible and level-headed person. I pay for my own car, insurance, and clothes. I work a steady job in healthcare that I have been in for almost a year. I moved home at the start of the pandemic when everything was hectic after losing school housing and not finding a place to live and my parents are treating me like I am 16 again. I would leave but something is holding me back, even if my three younger siblings, after seeing the way my parents have treated me, have given me their permission to leave. IDK. I'm so lost. 

\---------------------- (now, for the super long story, pick a paragraph and give feedback?)------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

My parents treat me like a fucking child. Now, this isn't the typical stuff I've researched online. I'm a 19-year-old woman majoring in business entrepreneurship at a local college that I genuinely love. The reason behind me choosing this school, though, was because of my parents. I'm the middle child of 7 children and the eldest girl ( 3 older brothers, 2 younger brothers, and a baby sister). I work in healthcare making decent money and, since moving home at the start of the pandemic, have been depositing the majority of my paycheck in a savings account and only allowing myself to spend a majority of $25 monthly (excluding gas payment/car payment) since I am no longer paying rent. I have a 3.8 GPA in college despite switching my major to business entrepreneurship just 3 weeks ago (previously I was majoring in Mechatronics Engineering as I have built robots all throughout high school, shout out FIRST Robotics, lol), and I'm. So. Lost.

&amp;#x200B;

(THEIR PROBLEM WITH MY JOB)

Since moving back into my parent's place after being kicked out of school housing at the beginning of the pandemic, I've been treated like I'm 16 again and I don't know how to take it. I moved out to avoid the anger and tension with my parents but I do love them with all of my heart. I originally was NOT planning on moving home, but both my parents are immunocompromised and were too afraid to go out and shop (plus, they threatened that if I do not move back home and help, they would ban me from seeing my younger siblings who I work so hard for) so I reclaimed my old room in the basement of my parent's house. At first, I was ecstatic, I can finally see my sister and brothers every morning. I have a set schedule throughout my day before the pandemic - I am a morning person. On M-F, I would wake up at 5 AM, shower, cook breakfast for me and my roommates, and take the train to work every morning since I had the 8 AM shift. I would work until 2 PM and take the train to my classes which ran from 3 PM - 7 PM and eat my prepped lunch on the train or snacks that I would pack for myself in between walking to classes. I would then reach my dorm room, where one of my roommates would have already cooked dinner, and sit in the common area with friends and study from 7:30 PM - 10 PM, and would typically be knocked out before 11 PM that night. Once the pandemic started, however, work became more demanding as our staff began testing positive and we began getting overwhelmed with patients and classes moved online and everything became so confusing yet I still managed to save my grades and do good in finals and so forth but it was rough. I had emailed my professors and told them about my job and they responded with the support that I needed. I was stressed when I had moved back into my parent's house and the first thing I had asked them was if I could use my mom's car to drive to work every day since they live 35 minutes out of the city. They said no, so I ubered with my money and they tried to stop me from ""getting rides from strangers"" and nagged at how immature that was yet still won't allow me to drive to work. I began working  8 AM until 7 PM Monday through Saturday. On one particular night, I had worked until 10 PM and came back right before 11 PM as a male coworker had dropped me off. My parents were livid. Saying I should quit my job if it was so demanding, that I wasn't focusing on school, and that it was humiliating that I would ever be seen in a car with a man who is not in my immediate family. I nodded, agreed with them as I was just so tired, and went into my room and cried myself to sleep.

(THEIR PROBLEM WITH MY INTERACTION WITH MY SIBLINGS)

As soon as I finished finals, my job started hiring more employees, and I was able to get a stable work schedule for the summer, I decided that I was going to give myself two weeks to rest, and asked for two weeks off, in which my work granted. This was my break, I was overworked and tired and, on the first day, I slept until 3 PM and woke up well-rested for the first time in a while. When I walked upstairs I was greeted with disgust, told I was lazy for sleeping in so late, and making my mom do all the work in the house. I tried to compensate immediately. I went back into the basement and cleaned the bathroom, my room, and vacuumed the entire living area upstairs and then played soccer with all three of my siblings, then had them come inside and help me make lasagna and cake for dinner (supper? since it was past 10 PM when we ate) and got reprimanded because I was ""keeping the kids up too late."" The next day I made dinner and had them eat at 6 and told them lights out at 10 PM. I got told that I was ""babying the kids, don't tell the kids when they can and can't sleep."" I stopped telling them what to do all together and began doing my own thing in which my parents retaliated that I ""wasn't involved with the kids at all."" Truth is, my parents truly cannot control my siblings, they consistently disrespect my parents and have expressed gratitude in me being home again. They listen to me and I consistently tell them that they should listen to my parents too because, hey, it's their parents. In the end, I decided to ignore my parents, it's not my job to parent my siblings, but I will help when I see necessary.

  
(THEIR PROBLEM WITH MY INDEPENDENCE)

In my two weeks, I almost completed 3 major goals I set for myself. 

Number 1: build the kitchen in the basement. We had an unfinished kitchen in the basement and I decided that it would be pretty damn sick if I could get it done. I began getting together the sink, tabletops, and cabinets/drawers for this kitchenette I also bought a mini-fridge to put in the corner. If this was going to be my home for a while might as well make it cozy. I filled the fridge and the newly put in drawers with snacks and drinks, no real food as that was already upstairs and my parents asked why I was separating myself from the family. Why I keep running away, so I scrapped that project. 

Number 2: buy a car. I went to the dealership and fell in love with a 2018 Nissan Versa. I asked the salesman the price and he told me that it would be a $20,000... Now, I may know nothing about cars but I'm not stupid. I went home in frustration and my dad saw my anger and I had told him what had happened and he demanded that we go back. After a couple of arguments and me being completely ignored by both the salesman and my dad, my dad and I cosigned on the car and had an insane price drop with what I was told a pretty decent interest rate for being a first-time buyer which was because of cosigning with my dad who has near-perfect credit. I complied, I think it was a smart move and way better than spending a crap-ton of money on uber. When I got home, my mom tried to argue that I must turn in my car-keys every night at 7 PM. I got angry, saying that it is my car in which my dad retaliated that it is HIS car since HIS name came first and HE had better credit and that I wouldn't have gotten in it at the great deal I did without him. I agreed with him, and my father and I ended up compromising, I do not need to turn my keys in, but my curfew is 9 pm and if I were to stay late then I should leave my car at home and find somewhere to sleep and not to return until the very next day or not at all. I was shocked but he didn't budge so I complied. 9 pm curfew.

I don't know what kind of advice I'm asking for, but right now I am unsure what's worse. Living in this constant hell where I cry hard every night before I sleep without fail and face continuous micro-aggressions at home or abandon my siblings and have them possibly go through what I am without any help and without anyone for support that understands their situation. My siblings aren't stupid thankfully and have given me their permission in private to leave, but I truly can't. were taught the meaning of consent, where the school finance director gave financial advice and his email to all students, cooking classes on fast meals, and even meditation class and ways to build a good schedule. I asked my parents shortly afterward about opening a credit card and they told me that I didn't need it. I shouldn't bother, they were supporting me. I complied, as usual. Fast forward to now, I realized that it was incredibly stupid that I complied. I went ahead and ordered a credit card and when they saw that in the mail they lost their shit. Why do I need a better credit score? What could I possibly be buying? Am I trying to run away from them soon? How much spending credit do I have? I mentioned I would be using the credit card for gas and car payment, that's all. That was my plan, but when they grabbed scissors and tried to cut up my credit card, I raised my voice at them for the very first time in my 19 years of living. They were so shocked that I was able to grab my card, head back into my room, and activate it. I didn't head upstairs for the rest of the day and one of my brothers came downstairs to tell me that I had made my mom cry and that my dad said I should be ashamed of the bad kid that I was becoming. I ignored it.

&amp;#x200B;

(OVERALL)

I don't know what I am doing that makes them think I am a child. There are things that I openly and obviously ignore because I've tried to reason or level or compromise and they do not listen so I do what I want anyway (like wear ripped jeans, my mom is super pressed about it. She hates that I show my knees, so, in the dead of summer, I wear thin white leggings underneath them so my knees are covered but I still wear my jeans) and it has worked but I can tell that it's tense. My brother that's closest to me (bless his 14 year old soul) has told me that I should just run-away, or move out, and I had mentioned this to my parents but my dad has rights to take my car away from me (and I've already invested enough money into it that I refuse to lose it just yet) and my mom said that I will be disbanded from the family and I would never see my siblings again and they would block any contact that I would ever have with them. Before you ask, yes. They will do that, they did it to my 3 older brothers which is why I do not know how to contact them or where to even find them but I did catch wind of my parents talking about one of them working a government job in DC, I hope that's true and I hope he's healthy and well. Truth is, I want to be there for my younger siblings when they hit 18 and help them navigate through life because I know my parents wouldn't.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what kind of advice I'm asking for, but right now I am unsure what's worse. Living in this constant hell where I cry hard every night before I sleep without fail and face continuous micro-aggressions at home or abandon my siblings and have them possibly go through what I am without any help and without anyone for support that understands their situation. My siblings aren't stupid thankfully and have given me their permission in private to leave, but I truly can't get myself to. I try my best to come off as strong for my siblings and put on a brave face, but I don't know how many breakdowns I can have every night without it messing with my head.

Today they've been going through a pretty bad depressive episode which I've been able to help with, but for a while they've been talking about how nothing exists or matters. I've been trying to reassure them that everything they're experiencing is real, that I'm real, but they're continuing to spiral and I really don't know what to do. As I'm writing this they said we shouldn't talk anymore, which I assume means they want to leave me because I don't exist. I'm really worried for them and I want to help but I just have no idea how.

Her: I’ve lost weight
Me: Nice!
Her: But have I though?

Also whenever I’m on the phone with Mum she’ll be in the background asking if she looks fat and stuff. AND if I tell her to stop worrying about her figure she usually replies with “Are you saying I’m fat?”.

360,"  

I am at a point where if I go any further in my career choice I will be in too deep to turn back. I’m currently an electrical apprentice who enjoys the work, but I’m completely uninterested in the material assigned for class. (I doubt anyone really is, but for transparency and criticism its important to note). I really can’t see myself doing this the rest of my life. (Then quit duh), but the alternative as always isnt the most pleasant when you are unsure if you can maintain the proper habits, nor the ability to control your willpower to attain the life you want. Who is certain when they are about to take a giant leap towards the unknown, not many. Plus with this economic confusion complicating my family situation (I’m single but I live at home. M21), It feels like it’s my responsibility to have a stable standing while things are tough. In my current day to day life I work 8-10 hours a day at work, then come home and do more work around the house, without laying too many excuses, yes I could find time in my day to learn about the subjects I enjoy, which I still do throughout the day via pod casts, audio books, and what not. The issue is the work load currently on my shoulders. It’s difficult to manage, the stress of having all the home work and finding time to do what I enjoy really conflict with each other, when I care very little. Then the other side hits, where at times in your life you will have to do things you don’t want to nor enjoy, and is this one of those times. If I go the other way will I still do the things I really don’t want to because the end goal is worth my time, when currently I don’t see it that way. I also have this looming in the back of my head that doesn’t help. An issue that goes something like this. It’s unfair for me to choose this path because I’m sure others feel the same way I do. Like who really enjoys doing trade work, perhaps a few, but if everyone would turn to do what they wanted or at least give it a try (many fail and then are left behind), it would leave society broken I believe, when in reality it will never happen this why and I’m not really sure why I’m clinging to that kind of thinking. The idea of the matter is that a philosophy should be able to be applied to all and still function no matter what you pick. This was kind of a mind dump would like to hear some thoughts if any of this was coherent. Thanks",03Jul2020,1

363,So me and this girl were talking for awhile we would ft every night for about 4-5 hours and we hung out like once twice a week I really liked her a lot like she meant a ton to me then one day out of nowhere she decided we would be better off as just friends I tried to roll with it then we started talking again and then she did the same thing again so I just got really really fucking upset and decided just to remove her off Snapchat and it’s been about a month now I recently might have added her back just because I can’t see her not in my life we were literally best friends for the time we talked and she made me so happy but now I feel sad all the time like I cry most nights when I go to bed so does anyone have any ideas on how to get over her?

364,I have a friend I have known for about 5 years and she is an amazing person but she has always dated guys who treat her really bad. she has a history of going for guys who just use her in order to build themselves up and one boyfriend she had would always threat suicide when she would say no to him and I stood up for her and got into many arguments with him and it strained our relationship until they broke up. we kind of fell off after i left school and we just recently reconnected and i found out about her boyfriend who shes been dating for a while and he seemed really great and i was so happy she finally found someone who treats her right but i have recently noticed some red flags and i am not sure what to do. he pressures her into things she doesn't wanna do like having a threesome and she has told him she was uncomfortable with it and he kept bringing it up and making her feel guilty for not giving him what he wants. she is a naturally insecure and protective over her significant others but i've noticed that he kind of persuades her into doing things she would never do on her own. like for instance he asked her to ask me if i would be interested in a threesome with them and when i said no because i knew how my friend felt about it he asked if i would send him nude pictures of myself to him and for some reason she acted like she was cool with it and i was incredibly uncomfortable. when i declined this as well he offered me money for each picture and then got mad at my friend saying he was joking and he got angry she told me about it. He makes me so uncomfortable that I only see her when he is out of town or gone for the night because i am genuinely scared of him and what he might do. He constantly blames things on her and she is always the one apologizing for things that he does. I was confused as to why he wouldn't just break up with her because he clearly is not happy with her until i found out why. he hates staying with his family because they don't get along and so my friend allows him to stay with her at her parents house. when i found this out it was clear that he is only in a relationship with her for a place to stay and i am repulsed. My instinct is to tell her how i feel and advise her to get away from him but i have been honest about things hes done in the past that i did not like and she makes excuses for him every time so i am afraid she wont listen to me. should i just stay quiet on my feelings about this to save my relationship with her or should i say something?,03Jul2020,1

My back ground

37 male,no kids,single,unemployed. BFA 2007.

Recently, nothing has been working out its a sentiment that I share with many people I'm sure.

I bumbled around as a visual/ digital artist after the 2008 crash(its not like I was gonna do anything anyway) and did the starving artist thing but somehow I got lucky and landed/built a job equivalent to an event planner that payed unreasonably well. It was a lucky break. I'm also not much of a materialist and I live an asectic lifestyle(more stoic, less Taoist), just a habit from being an artist, plus I don't like things I much prefer to study, meditate or day dream but let me assure you I am not super disciplined in my approach, internet and video games truly are my hubris. So, anyway I'm not spending a whole lot of money.

Well, things seemed peachy until the city I lived in decided to riot and then soon after everything fell apart. My job evaporated admits all the hate and racial violence, which was sad but I didn't deserve that kind of success anyway but at least I have money for retirement since I know I'm probably not going to duplicate that success again in my life, I got lucky and slid into a little bubble that I may have been uniquely suited for.

Anyway, my girl friend was pretty low and stressed out by the riots and all the insanity and after 2.5 years or being clean she went back to opioids, ODed and hurt herself really bad. That night, when I got home from work it was pretty late and I thought she was asleep so I left her alone, I fiddled around on my computer chatted with my roommate and unwittingly passed out on the couch. I didn't notice that she hadn't gotten out of bed until around noon the next day. When we got her to the hospital she had been out for a long time, like 18-20 hours. It took them several days to bring her back and not all of her did come back, she has some brain damage, nerve damage in her arm and hand along with some kidney and liver damage. She had insurance through her parents otherwise- I don't want to think about it. Yet, I still had to make some cold hard calculus and left her behind with her parents, part in panic and emotional fraying and in part because I'm a horrible person. I hate myself so much for making those decisions but every time I went to see her she just started crying and she couldn't talk and she was so ashamed and hurt - it was just this maelstrom of emotion that I ejected myself from. I revisit those moments over and over and over and if I had just touched her, or looked at her more closely, or been there when she needed me she wouldn't have touched that shit. Nothing but what-ifs.

I stayed with my parents for about a year because at that time in my life I couldn't stand to be alone and I find it very difficult to make close friends despite being a pretty amiable guy, most people enjoy my company and I use to love chatting about the whimsy of life. 

I feel into a real dark hole. I drank myself stupid for nearly a year but I managed climb out of that place and now I'm back to my usual routine, more or less. I have my health and my mind and considering the times, I'm very grateful for that. 

Afterwards, I moved across the country to reconnect with my brother who had just gotten out of the army. I rented a super small studio apartment (I like tiny spaces I'm like a cat) and began to look for some shit jobs to meet with and start connecting with the locals . I have a lot of experience in restaurants, breweries, distilleries and vineyards and I do my best to elevate small talk to an art form. I'm also really good at organizing and throwing parties, which is funny because I'm a major introvert, I know that fundamentally everyone is similar to a plant in that they're looking for new ways to grow and bloom and attention is like sun shine. Everyone also loves a spectacle and I love to deliver  ,or at least I use to, I use to really enjoy waiting tables, bar tending, cooking, mixology and watching all the funny crazy shit people do, and I still do, but just not as much as I use to. I figured I gracefully slip into some minimum wage job and go back to school for something or another. 

Nothing was really clicking at first, worked a few months here, and few months there but I just couldn't find the right fit. So me being the fool that I am, decided to take a few months off so I could avoid working through Christmas and the new year. (The worst time to work in restaurants is memorial day, the only people out at a restaurant are the people who were not invited to the family barbecue)  I figured I wait for the beginning of hiring season in late February and I would slip into one of the hotter restaurants in town. If there is one thing I know about restaurants its that managers are just waiting for a good worker to walk in so they can fire the idiot on board. Then covid-19 happened, well fuck. Looks like silly ideas are put on hold.

I never wanted a conventional life anyway, I like new experiences, practicing emergent creativity and most of all just listening to people talk about their experiences, views and lives. People are throwing out so much information in their gestures, micro-gestures, clothing, hair-style, speech patterns, mannerism and foot wear that I can't help but drink it all in- humans are all so amazing, special, interesting, wonderful and horrible all at once and I simply can't get over it.

Anyhow, I guess I'm feeling what most everyone in the country is feeling and at the rate I'm spending money on just rent and food is unsustainable, I'll be broke in a few years I with the jobs I'll be working they're may be no room to save for retirement - and that is only if nothing bad happens, like a medical scare or an accident, its only a matter of probability. Life, to me, about is about patience, breath and vision.

So here is my question:

I'm seriously considering buying an RV and living in that and just working in different parts of the country at ""whatever"" jobs, any shitty job I can find. It seems like it would, potentially,be much cheaper than renting an apartment and being stuck somewhere for a year and if someone asks to much of me or tries to squeeze me for extra labor or time I can just split. I could bounce around and talk to all the weird amazing people out there and do all the minimum wage jobs and see what I like.

Conversely, if I went back to school now it would be for green-energy or waste-management but I'd have to figure out someway to pay back the debt and honestly, those two fields are undervalued  and I probably wouldn't be able to pay back the loans even if I did land a job in the field. Which is really funny to me.

But really, I'm up for anything as long as I have food and a bed, I'd love to have decent health insurance but that's not an option. I miss the days when health insurance premiums were $100. Obama care helped a lot of people and that's great but it ass-fucked me and I'm normally a really healthy guy. All I want is a physical twice a year a flu-shot and occasionally antibiotics for the nasty little beasties in the world.  Bad nutrition and hygiene take an enormous toll on my mental acuity so try to stay healthy just so I can keep calm and think straight. I get to eat ice cream every once in a while, mmm, mint chocolate chip is my fav.

Just think of it,  I could be a farm hand, or a day laborer at a construction site, maybe work at a meat packing plant(its on my bucket list) or a security guard or really anything that doesn't require a 4 year degree, I just want to do a little bit of everything I want to check it all out. I know it sounds insane, am I insane? It would be cool to be in academia and study biology or chemistry, but then I would have to do something with it and work for one of those evil Mega-Corporations or worse, work at a university, which have become the very epitome of evil. Why do we make it so hard to live? 

The economy is dead, colleges are dead, politics are dead It's all gig work now and this stationary way of living is at complete odds with the new american reality. and its been driving me insane for my entire life. I figure I have another 20-30 effective years left in me, which maybe is 10-20 years longer than the planet has, right? If our worst fears come to manifest then it'll be really interesting to watch it go down the drain. I've been practicing with some fasting and starving to death may not be to bad, dyeing of thirst on the other hand would be pretty lame(I get really bad headaches when I'm dehydrated) so I hope there will be plenty of fresh water during the apocalypse. Or perhaps I'll sufficate to death on Hydrogen sulfide, like the Permian-Triassic extinction, I read that high exposure kills your brain really quick, I bet its really trippy. Could be fun, whatever.

 I can't imagine I'll ever fall in love again. It was kind of a weird fluke that that girl stole my heart. It kinda figures that the only kind of person I could love wasn't meant for this world. She was a singer, a poet and philosopher and she captivated me in a way that no one else ever will. It's a shame that I wasn't able to do the same for her, at least not when it mattered.

I wonder... why are humans so enigmatic and contradictory, whatever. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.

First I will start with some backstory. I am in High school and I have someone who hasn't been kind to me, I will call him Bull. He has hit me, punched, and kicked me, not in a playful way, but not hard. He has also hit food out of my hands making it go all over the room. Bull does this most of the time while no one is looking, or they think it is in a playful way. Now to the incident.

Bull and I got invited to a social event. It was at a pavilion near a beach As time went on the group moved down to a beach. At that point Bull started throwing seaweed at me. Several times I asked him to politely stop. When he went to throw another one at me I picked him up and set him in a inch of water and left the beach to go to the pavilion. Time moves on again and I am in the middle of a conversation when he dumped soda on me, and I snapped.

The following event may not be accurately portrayed. In a blink of an eye I had him in a head lock, and took him to the ground. While on the ground he punched me several times. I just held him there for a few seconds. Then I got up and called my parents to pick me up.

I just want advice for how I should deal with him in the future and at school. Also I would like to know your thoughts on what happened. I didn't want to do it but he pushed me one to many times.",03Jul2020,1
383,"I’m on mobile, english is not my first language and i just got out of a screaming fight with my dad so sorry for any mistakes.

This is the fist time i tell this to anyone. TLDR at the end, maybe i just needed to get this out of my chest so its okay if no one reads.

I (21F) grew up in a small apartment with both my parents. We’re a pretty normal family and we never had any problems with eachother (other than small day-to-day parents and daughter things). Once i turned 17 i got into a university that’s in another state and i moved to an apartment there, since i cant work because of my course, my parents still cover all my costs. I came back to stay with them during quarantine.

I always admired my dad (58M) when i was a child, he was always the one who took the time to play with me and take me to his job and just doing fun stuff in general. My problems began when i started growing up and noticing some of his flaws, and i guess that kinda broke that perfect image i had of him.

He never really says his feelings out loud, i cant remember ONE serious conversation we had about my problems that required a more emotional approach, i never felt confortable talking to him about my personal issues. That made me realise that even if we are close, our relationship is really shallow because he doesn’t knows whats going on in my life.

Whenever i try to talk to him about something that doesnt relate to him, he just wont care, and he wont even try to pretend, he just looks away or changes the subject about something that happened to one of his friends or to him in the past. He always ALWAYS wants to be the lead of the conversation, never really asking questions about me but if i ask him about something he will talk nonstop. He even cuts me off sometimes during dinner when im talking, or just straight up ignore me.  I also noticed that sometimes he makes “roast” like jokes on me or my mom and when we say something back its suddenly not funny anymore. Hes also thay guy that HAS to one up everything we say/do. That just made me see him as a realy narcissistic and selfish person.

He’s really childish, if he doesn’t gets what he wants he just pouts and makes the rooms “vibe” really heavy by being in an INSTANT bad mood (example: not watching this thing he wanted to watch, he CHANGES the chanel on the TV when im watching something by myself without even asking). He likes this specific type of music that he knows me and my mom HATE and he sometimes plays it very loudly and gets mad if we say something about it, for example. Also i feel like my mom acts like his mom sometimes (like packing his bags for him) and i think thats weird.

And one of the main problems is his stubbornness and anger management(like getting in stupid fights in traffic). He doesn’t admits when someone criticizes him in ANY way, he won’t listen and will start things that i did in my face to avoid discussing something he did wrong.  Hes the person that has to WIN the argument and never tried to apologize or make up for what he did.

Just now we had a SCREAMING match because he just barged in my room (it was 1:00 am) to put the printer back in its place and turned the lights on (something he already did SO MANY TIMES) and i said “why do you always do that??” a bit annoyed, he then got mad and dropped the printer he was carrying to put back in my room, KICKED IT, and started screaming at me because i said that, claiming “THERES NOTHING WRONG WITH WHAT I DID. I CANT PUT THE PRINTER AWAY NOW????” acting like i was being unreasonable and REALLY REALLY ANGRY, his face was red and everything. Then when i tried to argue with him he just kept raising his voice and totally ignored everything i said, totally tried to gaslight me into thinking i was being ridiculous for being annoyed by what happened and said that i sometimes make noises in the night and that it also disturbs his sleep and started listing things i do that he doesnt likes and never adressed or apologized for screaming or turning the lights (which i said would be fine if he knocked and asked to come in before, which he never does) he also blamed me for making him break the printer. It lasted for 20 minutes of him screaming “I JUST WANTED TO PUT THE PRINTER BACK AND SHES MAKING THIS WHOLE SCENE” and i just tried to say that my point was him losing his shit over a  comment i made, and that no, THE PRINTER WASNT THE FUCKING PROBLEM but the way he treated me. When he left i had a really bad anxiety attack (because of the screaming, its realy triggering for me, dont even know how i managed to not breakdown in the middle of the fight). I felt completely disrespected (because he didnt even listen to what i had to say, didnt care if something bothered me and SCREAMED at my face like it was nothing). I am so hurt, i feel like i could NEVER scream at someone i love, so that made me feel like he doesnt loves me that much.

The thing is, i know this will be thrown under the rug and he will pretend nothing happened tomorrow (ignoring me), and this bitter feeling will just  keep growing inside of me.  Why cant he fucking acknowledge something and take responsibility for once?????

I need advice, i want to be able to have a truly nice relationship with my father, and not feel this resentment in the back of my mind everything we interact.  Does anyone else has that problem? Why do some many dads his age are so emotionally unavailable? 

 I want to be able to feel proud of my dad again and have a  healthy relationship with him.


TLDR: Started getting really annoyed/hurt by the way my dad deals with things (being stubborn, childish, narcissistic, emotionally unavailable, irrefutable) and realised i can’t look at him without seeing those things anymore.


(And if you’re wondering my mom has taken my side and said he can be unreasonable but “thats just his way” and that nobody is perfect. Those things dont seem to bother her that much and they have a good relationship even after all those years. I think his problem is with me because i say when something bothers me and my mom, bless her heart, just wants everyone to get along)",03Jul2020,1
384,"Hi,

longtime lurker here, now made an account because I'm at my wits' end.

I'll apologize beforehand for any layout or grammar mistakes, I don't really know how to do this and English isn't my first language.

I'm not sure how to start this off well so I'm just going to jump into it :                                                                    I've recently come back from a year abroad and am now living with my mother, whose relationship with me is strained, and her new boyfriend, whom I'd never met before.During that year I ghosted almost all of my family and friends,it wasn't really an active decision and I'm not proud of it, and it also means I have absolutelely no one to talk to. I'm really depressed, have been for a long time but it's gotten to a point where it's ruining my life.And instead of support, all I get is scrutiny and contempt, or disappoinment at the least.                                                                                                                                    
I've been out of work for almost 5 months now because of Covid and it's also the reason why I've had to cut my trip short.Going back home was really difficult for me because of my familial situation and the way that affects my mental health; I felt like I was going to regress being back in that old environment.And sadly I was right.I have to start going to college this fall, I really don't know what else I would do and it's also the only way I can see to get out of this situation.However, I haven't applied anywhere, because I want to avoid talking to my dad, who has documents I need.The application process is a bit different where I live,it's not as hard and long as i.e in the US,so I'd still have a chance if I started now.                                                                                                                             Me not wanting to talk to my dad is rooted in me always feeling like a disappointment whenever we do, he's really angry with me for not keeping in contact and always puts me under a lot of pressure concerning my future.I haven't seen him since I got back and I'm about to cancel a trip with him and his girlfriend to my grandma's for the second time.I don't blame my dad for being angry with me, he has every right to be, but I'm so so scared of his judgement and he just can't seem to understand that.                                                                                                                         Living with my mom is very bad for me though,and I need to get out of this house.I'ts not like she abuses me or anything,I can only remember one smack on the butt when I was young.She's just not a good mom.I have memories from when I was a lot younger of things that you just shouldn't do to a kid, or invole one in, ever.I'm not a doctor but from what I've read she display narcissistic traits.Her treatment of me has really messed with me;when I'm with her I almost don't feel like a person because she doesn't treat me as one.I get no respect,she invades my privacy and patronizes me constantly.It makes me feel like a kid again, and not in the good way. But it also makes me very passive, which is dangerous because I can't afford that.I don't talk to her about my problems because she genuinely doesn't get it or doesn't care to.                                                                                                       
I feel like what I need, before I do or worry about anything else, is psychiatric help.I feel like I can't do it alone though.I asked my parents for help a couple years back, I went to my PCP and got a referral to a psychologist, all that was needed to do was to call and set up an appointment. I asked my mom to please do it, since the day was very exhausting for me and I get anxious about making phone calls.When I asked about it later, she said she did call and that they only had free appointments in a couple of months and I'd have to talk to my dad anyway because it would be impossible for her to drive me.At the time I didn't really think much of it, but as it turned out later she never made an appoinment. I was naive and sat on my ass for months so relieved to finally get help and ended up looking like an idiot.To be fair, my mom didn't willfully deceive me, I just misunderstood.Still an asshole move to not even make the appoinment.My dad never even asked about it.                                                                    Now I'm dependent on them again, just like back then and I need help but I hope you can see why I feel like it would be a bad idea to rely on them.Both of them just expect me to act like an adult and get my shit together.I just don't think I can take asking for help and landing on my ass again.Yes,I could go out on my own and just get an appoinment, but it would take months and my parents would be involved in some way, since I don't have money or a car and I live with my mom.If anyone has gone through something similar and they found a solution, do share because I'm very desperate at this point.

Tl;dr : I'm depressed,it's ruining my life and I need help but have no support.What do I do?",03Jul2020,1
385,So I’m 21 this month. I’m about to complete my associates degree but it won’t get me any better jobs. None of the jobs here pay enough for me to rent a place stress free. I live with my dad who makes sure to remind me I’m a dramatic bitch and my mental health just keeps getting worse. I don’t even really care about the degree I’m getting. I want to sing for a living but it’s not practical. Life seems kinda meaningless I can only afford monthly therapy to repair 14 years and counting of abuse. What to do?,03Jul2020,1
386,"Long story short, friend hardly ever communicates. We’ve been talking for 2 years, shared a lot of personal details, been dating for a year and ended back in January. Still good friends.

However that might not be the case now? X hardly ever texts back. I let X know they can come to me for support, and X says the same but wasn’t around when I was grieving badly last month. I lost 2 close people last year and it struck a chord again but X couldn’t return a text.

We share birthdays except they’re a day apart. X didn’t say anything on mine however I did and I spent a weekend making X a poem. Hasn’t texted back in over 16 days.

Additional context: X suffers from depression and prefers time alone. Both of us are introverted.

Am I wrong to get upset?",03Jul2020,1
387,"Me (f17) and my boyfriend (m21) have been talking for a pretty long time (the age of consent is 16 here), i really love him and he really loves me, but the age gap does worry me a bit at times. He says he’s in love and never wants to be with anyone else. He has also supported the choice of us not having sex for at least another year. we do sext regularly, but i've never sent him nudes and have made it very clear that i never will. whenever i tell him i’m not comfortable with something he immediately respects that and apologies. It also never seemed like he was looking for a younger girl, or has a history of mostly dating girls a lot younger than him. Do you think there’s still a way he’s grooming me or does he sound like he could be a genuinely good guy?",03Jul2020,1
388,"So. Back story - I am 37. I met this best friend when I was around 18 or 19. We worked together and almost immediately became inseparable. We lived together several times. We were like two bats outta hell. Naturally, we became really close. I told her everything. She can be kind of abrasive and i loved that because she never bullshit me. She would tell me if I was being a complete idiot. She has always been there for me. I have always been there for her. I even sold her my car for $150. Over the years we have both grown up. I have two children and a husband and she has always traveled. She is such an interesting person and I loved hearing her crazy stories. She would drive a long time just to come to my house and play cards, watch movies or just hang out (usually her driving because I have two kids and a husband who works a lot). Until about a year and a half ago....

We were supposed to meet up around Xmas. She told me she was working a lot and would try. It never happened and I just attributed it to her having to work. It has never been unusual for us to go a couple months without catching up and then just one of us out of the blue would be like ""Hey! I miss you."" I messaged her. No answer. Then I called. No answer. I let it go a few months thinking she was just busy. Call her. Leave message. Nothing. After about six months, I jokingly message her that I'm going to put out a missing persons. Still nothing. Over the last year and a half, I have reached out numerous times. My mind started to go wild. I start to search online for her worried that maybe she traveled somewhere and something happened. Social media - deleted. No trace online. I know she has two brothers. Surprisingly, even though she and I are super close, I have only met them once or twice, but they know who I am. I messaged the one with an active facebook and told him that I haven't heard from her in over a year and am concerned. He wrote back ""Who is \_\_\_\_\_\_?"" Another confusing dead end. I message a mutual friend of ours (to whom she was really close). She hasn't heard from her either.

One night, I end up having a few drinks with my husband and balling like a baby that I think my best friend is dead. He (who is a high functioning autistic) simply can't understand why I am worried. He said maybe she just doesn't want to talk to me anymore but that just doesn't make sense. We didn't fight. Our last interaction was friendly and she has always been the type to tell me how it is. If she decided she hated me for whatever reason, she would tell me (with vivid detail). He asks me if I want him to look (he is practically a savant with computers). I tell him no. I don't want to be a psycho.

Fast forward to yesterday. The only social media she has (that I know of) is a reddit account. She posts an article in a thread from a town 30 minutes away. I reply. ""-her name-!!"" I was so excited!! Oh my god! She's alive! A couple hours later, I go to see if she wrote anything back and the post has been deleted. So now, I am completely confused. I have known her for SO LONG. She is not the type to be so blatantly cruel. My anxious mind (I have been watching a lot of true crime during the quarantine) goes to - what if someone killed her and is trying to make it look like she is alive. I know that is absolutely silly but none of this makes any sense, so my mind is going crazy.

I don't know what to do. Do I hunt her down? (if I were missing, I would want someone to care enough to find me). Do I accept that everything I know about her is completely wrong and she just decided one day that I mean absolutely nothing to her any more? I don't know whether to be heartbroken or pissed off. Thoughts anyone?",03Jul2020,1

391,"I (27F) have been married to my husband (35M) for 2 years. He has two sisters, Ashley (40F) and Sarah (38F). Both of our families live across the country from us, and we don’t get to see them very often. I’d say on average we get to see them once per year if we are lucky due to finances, vacation availability, and matching up with their holiday plans (where they have to make time to see their SO families). They live within driving distance of one another and my husbands parents go visit and stay with them multiple weekends a month. 

What are the best ways to get to know your significant others family when they live across the country? I’ve found it extra difficult since they are so much older than me - and they are in a very different life stage where they are actively having babies. Ashley has 2 and has a 3rd due on August, and Sarah just had her firsts at October but is planning for at least 3 more.",03Jul2020,1
392,"ok so my boyfriend and I have been dating for 2 years now and we live together. he's always been a really great guy to me and he's everything I've ever dreamt of. we have a cat, she's 4 years old. we have always loved her so much and he's always very playful with her. but yesterday l walked in on him doing something really bad... to go back in time... this probably should've been my first red flag. when the Shane Dawson cat drama was happening, he said that it wasn't a big deal and people shouldn't be so mad. he was very quick to defend him on that even though he's never watched Shane. I didn't think that much of it I just said ok whatever. and just a few weeks ago were playing with our cat, and he pretended to make out with her. it made me kinda uncomfy but still... I just told myself he was being playful and nothing more. so back to what happened yesterday... I was in the living room and I could hear my cat purring and meowing really loudly that it sounding like a toddler crying... so I go to the bedroom and see my boyfriend. he had the cat on the bed and his dick was out he was holding the cat and almost choking her, trying to insert himself into her... I'm honestly feeling so nauseous typing this guys. so i obviously SCREAMED for what felt like ages...  ""HOW COULD YOU DO THIS... WHY?? YOU SICK TWISTED FUCK!!"" he just stood there and he was almost tearing up... i told him i was leaving and taking her and he just started to cry. he was bawling his eyes out and begging me to stay... I was so bewildered. I took the cat and took an uber to my parent's house immediately. my mom asked me what happened and I was just so embarrassed I couldn't tell her. I don't know what to do now or how to face him after all this",03Jul2020,1
393,"Me and My best friend met on school but we didn’t really notice each other until my other friend introduced him to me. We both love to play video game so we just started hanging out from there we realized that we both had fucked up childhoods and bad parents. But he had grandparents that really loved him but I never had grandparents that love me. 

Since then we would play video games all the time together he would defend me if some guy would flirt with me online or would say mean stuff me and I thought that was really nice of him to do but I didn’t think he would develop feelings for me. 


Today around maybe 2 am he texted me saying his great grandma died. He told me he was crying and he was scared. I told him that it’s okay Ik it’s hurts and me saying it’s okay is not gonna work but before I could finish my sentence he told me I was a user and that i was a bad best friend and that I’m just a sad sack loser..

That hurt me really bad it reminded me when I used to be with my parents they would hurt me a lot. I got really upset but I made it that I was fine about it. He was just call me out of how bad of a friend I was. I felt really bad. I was in the shower all day hearing the neighborhood Bc that helps me try to calm down. 

Later on the day his other grandparents texted me on the phone saying that my best friend was on the hospital Bc he was really stressed out and he tried to get water and that he tripped and fell on his head. I was going crazy my mind was everywhere. I was stuck on the shower for at least half the day. I was scared and stressed out.

He texted me saying that he’s out of the hospital and that he’s sorry for what he said. I told him that it’s all fine but In reality I was still sad about it I asked him if he’s okay from his head since he fell and he said yea. After like idk maybe 3 hours later he said that he had developed feelings for me but since his grandma died his feelings went away. Tbh I’m not ready to be in a relationship yet I still have feelings for my ex but I had to brake up with him for personal reason and my best friend already knew that.. but I’m not even sure how I’m feeling with this. I’m not sure if I have feelings for him I feel empty.

My mind always takes these things to heart and even farther, so I have been feeling like a piece of shit who cant help my family.

I don't think of him less and if he was alive he wouldn't need to tell me this but I still feel so confused. I can't talk about this weird find to any family members, friends, or my boyfriend so I don't know what to do.

Recently I became friends with a girl on sc and she was a little weird at first saying things like “what’s sleep? I never sleep” and “I like Hitler” and a few other emo-like things (can’t remember off the top of my head) and our friendship grew over time and I genuinely thought this was person was an emo who just joked around a lot.
One day she tells me she takes hard drugs and I was shocked but no judgemental. Overtime her demeanour changed and she became a little bit passive aggressive by telling me to fuck off for no reason and every time I tried to help her it got thrown back at me. One day she tells me she’s going to kill herself and I try to stop her as much as I can. It turns out she was just piss drunk or high on a field with friends messing about. I took offence because I have a history with things like suicide and it hurt a bit. I also had two people who had a 0 snap score add me username and I never my username out. These two people were equally as weird and blunt as my friend and it realised a red flag. This is because my friend is a little bit “stalkerish” I say that lightly because she doesn’t stalk me but she’s somewhat obsessive with her ex’s. I ask her if they know my friend and one of them replies with no and when I ask my friend she says she knows them and they’re her friends. I press on and ask questions like “how’d they get my Snapchat?” and “How comes they’ve said they don’t know you but you know them?” She answers by saying they hacked into her account and added you. I didn’t buy this at all and thought she did this to just mess with me so I unadded them and moved on. Eventually, my friend disappears for a bit, I was a little concerned but she usually did stuff like this for a few days and one day she just tells me straight to fuck off.

I have three careers to choose from right now. I have done well enough with the [military industrial complex] that I can jump on other temporary orders after this COVID19 mission ends. Realistically I could do that year to year until I retire. 

 Alternatively I could go back to my civilian job that pays just as well but I dont enjoy. Deeply. I'm good at it and it pays well, but I hate life every time I drive in.

Third, I could say screw it, sell my house and most of my belongings, and  keep equity, move out to a country in SE Asia with potential jobs and a good expat community. 

The first two offer essentially the same. But they're safe. They  have all the benefits and retirement. I don't suck yet so I could see doing another 10 to 20 years to get a retirement in concrete.

But the third option is super appealing. I've been there and know friends who live there or have come back. I'd just need to end two careers for it. The expat community is solid and the adventure is what I'd like. If I moved there after borders opened I'd be good for at least 20 months without being completely broke (on savings, retirement accounts after a last effort).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",03Jul2020,1

410,"Hi folks of Reddit,

My partner who has a pretty bad chronic pain condition and doesn't live around the greatest parts of town is struggling with mobility in general, some days worse than others.

He's just moved and lives in an urban area relatively near the beach with everything being within a 5 mile radius to get to. It would also make commutes to work easier.

With e-bikes being a bit too clunky and ill affordable (being 30 and for the same reasons as the e-bike, a motability cart is just way too much) and he is looking at e-scooters to commute short distances (probably about 2 miles each way, would be using it as a mix of walking and riding).

Medically he is unable to drive and with Covid and public transport being godawful here even before the pandemic, its looking like more and more sense to him to get an e-scooter now before the market for them soars and not after they will probably be made legal.

What are people's thoughts on this being a good investment now over later, especially given the medical reasons above? It would improve quality of life quite considerably.

Thankyou!",03Jul2020,1
411,"So, I've been crushing in this guy for a few months, gave him all the signs and chances (i'm pretty sure he noticed), and he turned me down in a casual conversation without calling me out on my feelings, telling me that he's not ready for a relationship right now. Then quarantine happened, and in the midst of all the online conversations (i stayed at home), one of my friends evolved into a boyfriend. He's a really nice and kind person, and pretty much ticks all the boxes of what I want. We've got matching interests, worldview, future plans, everything is great. Before quarantine I told the former crush that I'm interested in someone else, just let him know that we 're cool and can probably be friends and all. But then self-quarantine ended for me, i met former crush again, and suddely he seems to be out to seduce me (he knows that i've got a bf, but seemed to think that its not serious). He's been giving all the signs, physical and verbal. After me dropping lots phrases about my bf, he seems to have chilled out and given up, but suddenly this made me feel lonely.

Or is it just that i felt validated an precious that someone is suddenly going for me, and now i feel bad about losing that attention? I just have a hard time figuring out my feelings.

417,"Hey people of Reddit.

Recently over the years as I've gained confidence and spoken up more, stepping out of my shell I tend to not filter what I say.

I'm a really open person. I live in a household that everyone is quite open to eachother. To the point my siblings buy sex toys for eachother, and have offered to wax intimate parts of our body.

I used to be really shy and quiet and still am; But I'm really open. I'm open about majority of things, except relationships and anything sexual with whomever I am with or do things with - I barely tell my friends or family tell a long time after it's happened, And even then barely.

Anyways, I'm very personal and like it to be between us and not posting about my relationships.
However, if someone asks me a question or makes a comment about my body I tend to be quite open and honest.

Sometimes, I think without saying.
Just today I ran into a old friend of mine and we were catching up, they were mentioning how they are a part of this friend group and I let it slip without thinking that I did not know that and that (insert other friend, friend in said friend group) didn't say they were. 

They didn't make a comment about it and we kept talking so I don't think they were really bothered or paid much attention. I asked how long and they said roughly a year, exc. 

I didn't realize what I said until I got in the truck and was on my way home and recounting the exchange. I have since messaged them and apologized for having no filter and I told them I wasn't and don't really think when I say things so I didn't mean for them to take offense. I didn't mention the scenario exactly, I just genuinely mentioned in what I said today.

As well, There has been times when I drink I get worse and am even more open. I recall another time I told this guy, despite him being taken that I wanted to discuss about us talking to eachoter and the fact he got a girlfriend during the time, the year prior. He said sure, But not when he's under the influence. We messaged that night and he asked why I wanted to talk about it, before I realized and stopped.

This same guy had recounted to my siblinh that I had no filter and should watch what I say, and since then I've been worried and over thinking about it so I'm not sure if it's just me getting in my head or what.

This is the same guy however who recounted to me and his friends whom were unaware, saying he knew what I had done previously sexual with an ex, And that my ex told him immediately after. He was laughing and making a deal out of it and bugging me about it. He didn't say it aloud what I had all done at the time, which I really respected.

I've also offered condoms to a female associate, one whom despite me not being close with I went out drinking with. She smiled and said thanks and the others around laughed and said I just offered them condoms despite me just talking to her and them overhearing. I said ya, better safe then sorry. I was offering some females I knew and was comfortable with in the first place because I wanted them to be safe incase the time came, and if they didn't have any options to ensure they knew they could come to me. 

Another time this person was talking to these group of people and I mentioned in a group chat that they all were flirting and had gained some numbers or whatever, And one person was quick to deny and say they have a S/O. I expressed that I did not mean them, And meant the others.

That gives you a insight on how open I am.
I quite often make and give away baked goods as well, to many of the above listed people and more so if has not been a first time thing of me a) giving or offering things. I quite often take on the mother role within friend groups and always come prepared with water and snacks to events and money for anyone who forgets.

Other times I have called out a friend for being a hypocrite well drinking, as they went back on their word and did the exact thing they said they would beat someone up for doing by asking for it. 

Anyways, I just feel like I can be a bit much and too open or a lot to handle at times and need to learn to filter more. My sibling said I was a open person today too, And when I get drinking I am more. 

I know they mean no harm by mentioning it but it made me really realize and think about it. 
Don't get me wrong, I know to only say things as if I was being recorded, but I can't help but feel bad because there's times when I make a innocent comment like today that I don't think is bad tell after.

 I also realize it isn't such a big deal to others and that in that thinking, But I fear being open is one of the worst qualities in me and want to work on having more of a filter and not being as open. I'm quite honest with people when I first meet and interact and tell them that I'm an open person and they know said things about me.


So:

419,"Hi. Just need an advice from y'all. I am male (gay), and I fell in love with my male bestfriend. It all started when I was in college years back (I'm currently 25) and I had a friend during my first year. It's rare for me to have a male friend (my friends ratio is 70:30 female:male). He was courting one of my friends and I used to be his wingman in their relationship. To be honest, I still don't have any romantic feelings for him and I think it only started after several months of being friends with him. We are always texting each other non stop like from morning til night then vice versa. I've never done that before. There are times that I will go to his house early in the morning so we can go to our morning class together. Sometimes his girlfriend is also there making me a thirdwheel in their relationship. And even after class I will be at his home until nighttime and he will walk me home after. His family is already used on having me in their house too often.

I know this is normal to some but for me it was special. I also realized back then that I've done a lot of ""first times"" with him. I also did things that I don't normally do. 

One scenario that I will never forget is when we were walking at the mall and I saw a shawarma stall, I blabbed to myself that I've never eaten anything like that before. Then the next time we passed on that stall, he stopped to buy 2 orders of shawarma which are for us to share. It's a total turn on for me maybe because I'm not used to be treated by anyone. 

Our friendship lasts for a few years until this turning point. He asked me to accompany him early in the morning as he needs to run an errand before going to class. When we were in the vehicle, we were seating right beside each other when for whatsoever reason I felt the urge of wrapping my arm around his waist while putting my chin on his shoulders. It was very awkward but that time I was just happy to be with him. He did not react to what I did in any way. Everything seems to be normal on that day. 

However the next day, he started to avoid me totally. He even sent me a message asking me to change my facebook password (we know each other's passwords). He customized his messenger making it seem that he will always be offline on my end but he did not block nor unfriend me. 

I was able to find a way to access one of his friends' facebook account and there I found out that he was really disgusted to what I did. I totally understand him on that. That's why I kept on messaging him asking to talk to me about the issue. I wanted to say sorry to him but he didn't budge. He even replied to me once saying to give him time and that's what I did. Our school lives continued without talking to each other for more than a year.

During our last year in college, I felt the need to resolve our issue once more at least before we graduate. I tried to message him several times until he replied to me to stop being overly dramatic. He told me that we are ""men"" and we need to act like one. He said that he does not want any drama so I need to stop bugging him. I no longer know what to do on that point. I thought if I give him the time that he needed, he will surely talk to me about the issue but I was wrong. I really wanted to save our friendship but I think that he does not feel the same way. So I gave up. We both graduated and went on our separate ways without talking about that issue. 

Years after, he finally allowed me to see him online in facebook. He even chatted to me casually. Of course I was happy because I can finally talk with him like we were doing before. But it no longer feels the same way as before. I don't know if it's just me but he seems to be like a different person. He's no longer the ""nice guy"" I used to know. He became someone like a womanizer of some sort. But then again, I think that we are no longer friends. We are just acquaintances or former classmates to be exact. I know this is actually better than being an enemy or a total stranger but if given the chance, I want to be friends with him again. The same as we were before. 

So my questions are: 
Is it right for me to rekindle our friendship? 
I actually still want to talk to him about what I did that caused our friendship to break. It feels like an issue that got hidden under the carpet. I need to know what I need to do to repent on my sins. 

Is it too late for us?

Sorry for the long post. Need your honest advice.

Thank you in advance.",03Jul2020,1
420,I will try and keep this short but basically growing up I lost my father to drugs at a young age and for the last 11 years (I’m 20) I’ve had a verbally abusive step father. The death of my father caused my to have anxiety and the verbal abuse of my step father always calling me retarded and worthless has completely taken away any confidence I ever had. I was an extrovert as a child and then around middle school I became known as a quiet guy and it sucks because I feel like I was born to be someone who is outgoing and not afraid to speak my mind. Recently I have been having really bad panic attacks anytime I’m by myself which is often. I spend pretty much all of my time playing video games and as soon as I get off of them I start feeling really anxious. I started working out a few years ago to try and boost my confidence and I fell in love with the gym but it caused me to develop body dysmorphia which almost makes me even less confident. I always say when I gain x amount of weight I’ll be happy or when I reach x percent of body fat I’ll be happy but the truth is I don’t think I’ll ever be happy with my body. I even take steroids to try and look good and to the average person I do look like a muscular in shape guy and I get a good amount of compliments from people but I still never feel confident and am always anxious in social situations. My parents want me to get a job but I am so afraid that I’ll get a job and not know what to do and look like an idiot. I suffered from pretty bad acne and went on accutane and even now that my skin is clear I still don’t feel any more confident. I just hate being in this cycle of “once I do this I’ll be confident” and then when I do it it changes nothing. I guess all I’m asking for is some advice for how I could maybe boost my confidence or suppress my anxiety without the use of drugs because I feel like I’m headed down a path of a life not worth living.,03Jul2020,1

i dont remember how intense things were; but i definitely remember jumping (not sure; dont remember) out of bed, and just standing, and calling my mom that there was something wrong;

again, not sure how loud i was, i hope not too bad. well, my mom always wakes up tbh when stuff like this happens; and she def didn't this time, so maybe i wasn't being too dramatic;

basically, yea, i went to sleep normal;

what causes it? does it signify anything more serious? am i mentally okay?

i mean my parents do always tell me to cut the phone use, especially before sleep, cause it arouses my nervous system or something, so basically it doesnt help. not sure if its ture tho;

and tbh, in general, rn, im going thru much stress too, exams and stuff; well, i have issues apart from exams too....

but, how can i stop this shit once and for all?

i honestly dont want to embarrass myself in front of others; i mean, i will have to sleep in someone's home too at some point in my life; friends or whatever;

He eventually went away, but my friends were still upset with me bc the guy they liked wouldnt leave me alone. fast forward, i was drinking/smoking/meeting people trying to make the best of the night (i couldnt leave bc i wasnt good to drive), everyone started falling asleep in different areas of the house. i followed my friends upstairs and asked if i could sleep in the same room as them, to which they replied that there was “no room for me” and basically slammed the door in my face, leaving me in a house full of people i didnt know, drunk and high. (they were fully aware that i didnt know anyone, and that i didnt know what was going on) i found a place to sleep, nd this guy who i thought i had befriended throughout the night asked to sleep in the same room and i said sure. but as the night went on he kept pressuring me and pressuring me and asking to have sex over and over and eventually i just gave in because i was tired and drunk and wanted him to stop asking. i bled everywhere, it was my first time having sex, i was crying and asking him to stop and he wouldnt, eventually i dissociated and i dont remember the rest. when i realized what had happened the next morning i left and got a rape kit done, but never used it because i was embarrassed and thought it was my fault. meanwhile, those ‘friends’ called me, and were asking about the night, acting like they werent complete assholes to me the whole time. they were asking me about this guy saying shit like “so i heard u got with ...” and im just sitting here crying because it was the worst night of my life. they didnt believe me when i said it wasnt consensual.


fast forward two years. i meet this girl (current best friend) nd we become fast friends. i was introduced to her through one of the girls that was my ‘friend from the party’. we were all in a friend group for a bit, but my new friend was slowly starting to realize that my old friend was not a good person. i eventually opened up to her and told her about what happened, to which she replied and talked to me about how fucked up it was &amp; how much it has fucked me up/i started going to therapy/all of my mental repercussions. yet my current best friend stays friend with my old friend even knowing that she played a part in the worst night of my life. 

i dont know if im being selfish. i dont want to control who she’s friends with, but it hurts my feelings that she just acts like this didnt happen. i asked her one day how she could be friends with my old friend, and hangout with her, and not think about the terrible things that happened/how she treated me/whatever else. and she simply responded “i just honestly don’t think about u when im with her.” 

idk. i dont expect her to think of me. i just know if the situation was reversed and i know someone had a part in why my friend was raped their first time having sex &amp; i knew how badly it affected them- i would not want anything to do with this person. u hurt my friend u hurt me.

Should I report this to the police? I don’t want to waste their time, but I also don’t want to just sit here while somebody could be hurt.",03Jul2020,1

433,"So I've been seeing a guy for the past couple months. Innocent texting, video calling and a few cute dates. He's really sweet, always makes me laugh and an overall great person. He's a chubby guy and has a ""nerd"" look but this has never bothered me. He has a pretty awkward way of going through life but I think its cute. 

I'm new to dating, I'm more of a casual sex girl, so I wasn't sure when we could start being sexual together. I tried to kiss him and he rejected me ( that shit hurt) but he said its because he doesn't think its real, that I was being paid to be with him ( apparently his family pays people to be his friends and girls to date him). Then he started telling me he's an incel and that he's ugly, a virgin, nobody wants to be his friend- just a whole lot of self pitying. He then said because ""I'm pretty"" and not a virgin, I can't really be interested in him. 

I don't know what to do. He thinks i'm being paid by his family ( I'm not- although they did offer me money to thank me, I didn't take it) and he has major self-esteem issues but I don't want to leave him thinking like that. It's not my responsibility to make him confident but if I care about him.",03Jul2020,1
434,"I need some sort of help. (Mobile btw so I’m sorry for the weird formatting) My mom has major mood swings and they’ve resulted in: slurs on her end (even after she promised not to say them), threats, arguments, physical attacks, and some more. Threats vary from leaving me where I used to live with my dad who can’t afford to take care of me and is in a shitty country that keeps getting worse and worse, to hitting me in the head with an iron object for every slightly wet piece of clothing she found. But then she can go to an overly happy mood which I can’t really describe it so I made a graph. She has negative moods once every 1-3 months and it lasts for at least 3 days and at most 2 weeks. I don’t think it’s her period because of some other shit. I’m writing this because recently she was paranoid when I asked her a simple question and said I was a manipulator and trying to do something I did as a kid not realizing or understanding shit. She also added in a few threats. I think part of it is trauma since she was born in a group that- although not considered by many, fits the definition of a cult and her mom and dad neglected and abused her. I don’t think that’s an excuse though as she could afford therapy for a good period of time and didn’t do it and is about to be able to pay for it too. I’m going to keep adding just in case you think she has something so: she always thinks she’s right even though there are clear flaws in her memory. If she says something she expects everyone to believe it since she knows so many facts and things that she wins multiple arguments but her memory of events is much more faint and I always get put down when I say she doesn’t remember it right which has lead to physical altercations. She’s very defensive but refuses to admit it. Recently I was talking about not having a good variety of clothes while she did and she immediately took is as me saying it’s her fault and yelled at me??? She used to apologize for her bullshit but now has completely stopped. If anyone can help, please do.",03Jul2020,1
435,"I know that there are probably many other posts like this, but I find myself feeling better when I describe my feelings like this. 

I feel like I’ve always been the weird kid at school, the one that never knew how to fit into the “cool” kid group. My friends have never been the most popular, and I feel like I creep out a lot of other people. I feel like I’m a massive pushover too. I need my parents to tell me what to say when I am faced with a conflict, and I honestly just find myself self deprecating and sacrificing some of my own to help others, without ever knowing if it was the right move. 

When it comes to conflict, I don’t know how to respond. If someone is being a massive dick then I just go out of my way to evade them at all costs. I wish I could learn to confront people and stand up for something, but I never know what to say. I think this is why I think I’m a pushover—I just do what people ask to avoid conflict.

I don’t mean to wallow in self-pity, but the only people who have ever “liked” me are girls much like myself, who are so insecure and bullied that they fall in love with the first person who shows them kindness. And I recognize this because it is exactly me. I don’t even know if I have had a real crush on someone before, or if I’m just making a ploy for attention or for some meaning in my life. People tell me I’m attractive, but they have only consisted of my family and close friends, which I think doesn’t count. 

All of this festering over the years has left me with diagnosed depression and anxiety, and even still I think I use that as a crutch in social situations. I just don’t even know how to do the simplest things and always think I look like an idiot when I do them. I mean just today I was on a group call with three others and I had no idea how to leave. “Do I say goodbye? Do I say peace? When should I say it? Okay, he finished he sentence, now would be a— wait no”.

I have never really felt anything other than awkwardness and discomfort around others. I constantly compare myself to tight-knit groups of friends and people with oozing confidence. And I don’t even know if it’s someone to like me that I want, or if it’s just that I want validation that I’m good enough to be loved. I am just so unsure.

Sorry for the wall of text, but like I said it helps when I pour my feelings out like this. Any advice or even just an ear to listen would be appreciated. Thanks guys!",03Jul2020,1
436,"Idk which other subreddit to go to and I just wanted some quick input. 

Storytime: I was going to go brush my teeth. As I was washing my face I saw what I thought was a gray dust floating around. I thought it was floating kindof funny so I just kept watching it and let it rest on my hand. THE DUST STARTED MOVING. Upon looking closer I found it was a baby spider. &amp; I kid you not, thanks to reading Charlotte's Web, when JUST ONE is floating like that, there's probably a hundred more.

439,"I currently work part-time at Amazon, ~20 hours per week. 2 days, double shift, 3am-1:30pm. 

Yes, only 2 days and here I am complaining of feeling miserable. It feels like 4 separate days. I have to drag myself out of bed and lately I’ve been using my UPT (free off hours) + sick time to just skip my early morning shift. I’m not motivated to work. 

I feel like it’s taking a toll on me mentally and physically. I am so amazed with people who can do it. I get anxiety the day and night before work wondering if I got enough rest that I got to the point where I end up skipping my first shift if I don’t sleep early enough. 

A day of work consists being out into trailers to unload (because of pandemic we are in there alone, required to wear masks) and it’s so hot and hard to breathe. Outside the trailer we are required to still do a lot of heavy lifting. The managers rush us, they send us around. I’m disappointed with myself that I missed the opportunity to apply for another position that would get me out of this. My mistake was putting all my eggs into this summer school internship opportunity thinking I would be able to quit amazon. However, I found out I was rejected yesterday. 

I love doing physical activities. I’m a female, 5’1, 120lbs. so idk if his has to do with affecting the workload I do at work. A lot of people have it way more, but I think I’m very stressed on top of being in college for so long. I’m longing for a a break before school resumes again. This is my first ever summer vacation without school. Doing the physical activities apart from work is my outlet from stress but because work does put a toll on me physically and mentally, I feel I’m unable to do these things because I have to be extra careful. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m thinking of what jobs I can apply to that’s currently hiring. But honestly I feel lost with that too as places are closing down due to the incoming lockdown. 

Maybe this is more of a rant but truly, I’m in need of help, advice, anything.

443,"To start: I have a great relationship with my mom. We are practically best friends. And that’s why I think this problem of mine is so weird. For some odd reason, I avoid going out with friends because she makes me feel guilty. 

I first wrote this post thinking maybe I was just lazy or would get anxious going out with friends, but I then realized that my mom would always convince me that I should just “stay home and be with her instead.”

She completely trusts me, but I think this has more to do with the fact that my mom, herself, is extremely lonely; she’s separated, has no friends, and stays home most of the time. And since we pretty much do everything together when she does go out, I feel guilty when I’m leaving her at home all sad and lonely- while I’m out having a blast. 

I know it’s not my obligation to spend time with her 24/7, but I just feel like a “bad daughter” because I’d be “neglecting” my life giver lol. She’s even said that she’d let me live with her forever- which I definitely do not plan on doing.

We live together, nobody else. But now, I often hear him talking in his room. Sounds like he is having a conversation. Every time I have walked in, he has not been on his phone. If I ask who he is talking to he will either say nobody or that he has been talking to Jake. I am Jake.

&amp;#x200B;

I called him from work the other day to ask how he was. He told he was at home talking with Jake. I pointed out that I am Jake. He seemed to acknowledge his mistake and laughed sheepishly like he was embarrassed.

Tonight, he said he had been talking to 'the other Jake' but now could not find him and said that he must have gone home. I again pointed out that there is no other Jake, only me. He said in that case who is the other Jake who 'sits with him, talks to him and keeps him company during the day' when I am working. Later, after we had eaten, he suddenly said the other Jake had not had dinner yet and that he was going to go next door and buy a burger for ‘him’.   
I again told him that the only ones here in the house were him and me,  I pointed out that he only had one son, (me, an only child) which he acknowledged, but he still looked troubled and confused. I gently suggested that he might be having hallucinations. He simply said “No, I’m definitely not hallucinating”.

  
Later I went into his room to check on him and he was standing in front of the mirror on his closet door, he looked troubled and I asked him what was wrong, he pointed at the mirror and said he wanted to get it fixed, because he “can’t talk to anybody through it” He pointed to his reflection and asked who it was, I told him it was his reflection. He asked where the other Jake was and I again told him there is no other Jake. He opened the closet door and said ""Jake, are you there"".  
Of course, there was no one in there, I again told him we were the only here and there is only one of me. His facial expression showed me he was extremely worried and confused but he tried to play it casual. he just he was going to bed and we would ""sort it out tomorrow""

So basically, about 18 months my brother's depression worsened immensely. I don't know when the eating started, but I know he's gained probably 100 lbs since. Any effort from myself or my parents to suggest healthier eating or exercise is at best ignored. At worst he says we're all attacking him.

I know that his weight gain has made his depression worse, and I'm worried that he is caught in a downward spiral that is going to lead in an early death.

457,"I left a job 7 months ago that left me feeling anxious, depressed and chronically stressed out. I regularly didn't sleep well and would feel sick most mornings before starting work. It got to the point where I resigned because I just needed to get out. This role lasted over 3 years. 

Throughout the role I had been a high performer - I had good appraisals and good client feedback, but I just found the whole experience of it and pressure of it far too intense. I'd raised it several times with management but they ignored it as the results were still coming through, and despite me raising my concerns the workload just kept piling up which greatly exacerbated the issue. 

During this period I'd also been on anti-depressants and been to therapy to see if there was an underlying issue making it worse, and it turns out there wasn't. I was in therapy for six months and on medication for over a year. 

I decided to take 3 months out between leaving the last job and starting the current one to give myself some time to recover. The new job is the same role but in a different organisation, one that's a lot more supportive and definitely less intense. I've got two good managers who are easy to talk to and have my back.

Even though the work environment and the people around me are much healthier now, I feel as though I've got some sort of anxiety ""hangover"" from the last job, as though it's a learned response. I can still feel myself reacting the same way now as I did in my last job - even though I've moved on, even though the people and the environment are different.  I can still feel the anxiety bubbling up each morning before I log on, even though I know I logically don't have the same things to fear. I essentially feel as though my reactions to events in the current role aren't proportionate and are still being influenced by the last one. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Is this typical of recovering from burnout? 

My hope is that maybe the anxiety will just subside over time, but I would be really interested to hear from other people about their experience and what it was like for them.",03Jul2020,1

So, a little backstory on my sexual childhood, when i was around age 8 my sister (she was 10 at the time)and I started playing a game where we would go on the playset and make out/ talk ""sexy"" to each other. She would watch my penis grow into a boner and tell me how she loved me and whatever and how im sexy. Well, I have this one memory of her and I under her bed completely naked and I have no memory of what happened after that, it's completely blank. I don't know if we had sex but it would honestly make since given all my fucking problems now. Fast forward to age 11 and I started watching porn. I got really into porn and was consuming it a lot. When i turned 13 i met a man online who said he was a manager and would help me get followers on Instagram. I wanted to be a model so I believed him. He told me to send him pictures of me in different poses with my clothes off and he said they were ""modeling pictures"". When i told him ""that's illegal though"" he said ""you have to be comfortable with your body if you want to be a model"". So, i sent this man a lot of pictures of me doing naked model poses and i also sent him some videos of me grinding while naked at his request. I think a lot about how those pictures are probably on a pedophile website somewhere being wanked to.  I genuinely didn't even realize what I was sending him was wrong until last year (age 15).  Now that the backstory is done im going to tell you the horrible thing I did to my brother. I had just turned 13  and was watching porn/ talking to the ""manager"" guy and I saw a girl give a man a blowjob in the porn and was curious as to what it would be like to suck a dick. So, I went over to my 9 year old little brother who was asleep next to me and I pulled down his pants. I molested him because I put my mouth on his penis. He was asleep during all of this to my knowledge but I can't help but think he was secretly awake. I did this to him 2 times and he was asleep both times. After those 2 times I never touched him sexually or thought of him sexually again. I don't know why I came back a second time because I'm not even attracted to boys let alone my little brother. I didn't get any real sexual gratification out of doing it. I just really hate myself for doing this and I'm scared of myself I feel like a monster. I'm so scared my little brother will someday tell me that he was secretly awake and he knows I did that to him. i cant talk to a therapist about this because I just can't I cannot say this out loud it's hard enough to type it. If you're going to comment and tell me to kill myself please don't because I'm really considering it already. thanks for reading it all if you did, I know its sick.",03Jul2020,1
465,"My sister (F12) has always loved my father. They're always together. That was, until 1-2 years ago.

My father was going on a business trip for 3 months, and when he return, he turned into a completely different person, at least to my sister. He started to jokingly kick, punch, pinch my sister in near sensitive spots. At first my sister play along but not long after she starts to feel annoyed. She told me that she's a girl, and such, she needs private space. Heck, she didn't need to tell me that because even I, a M17 will tell him to stop. Sadly that's not how it goes.

The first outbreak is 2 months ago. I don't remember what happened exactly but she cried after our dad leave the house. I tried to comfort her and confront our mother about the situation. It didn't work as well as we expected. Instead of telling him to stop, she just lectured us about what our father did to the family. Which leads us to yesterday, the second outbreak. My sis is texting with her friends then my dad just decide to walk by and pull her legs, so that she falls off the mattress. Normally she would play along and fake smile, but her right leg is injured recently so she screamed in pain. My father checked on her and ask her what happened (He just came back from a trip and doesn't know about her leg condition). Me and my mom explained the situation to him, and guess what, he laughs and pinch her right at the injured spot, and laugh like a maniac. Again she is hurted and yelled. I was out of control and I told him ""that injury is real, she's not joking"" in a paranoid-demanding voice. My mom did the same. Then he just walk out, brush his teeth, come back and tell the family that he's just making a small joke, and everyone told him to stop. What a showstopper.

It's not a little joke. My sister is feared, traumatized and is a mess right now. She fake her smile every single time our dad come into view, she takes long breaths after he's out of view and she doesn't want to see him. He's just shooting himself at his legs at this point. Don't misunderstand. I love my father, he is a hard-working man and without him our family would've starved during COVID. However, this is borderline pervert-ish and I care about my sister, I just can't stand there and do nothing at this point.

What should I do?",03Jul2020,1
466,"This is my first post, and I don't really know how to do this, but I've seen enough videos to know generally how this works. I have a mother and a stepfather, my mother is the breadwinner of the family and my stepfather is a stay at home dad. We've lived with my stepfather for about 8 years now and the whole time I've never been more depressed and have had less self worth, so have my mother and sisters.  My older sister is out of the house and I'm leaving next year to be with my amazing boyfriend, my younger sister would only have 3 years left under their rule.  My stepfather is very abusive and he degrades and manipulates us, one time even hitting me in my face when my sister and I were fighting in my 7th grade year.  Since the incident, I have been terrified of my stepfather and have never received even an apology for that, or for anything else.  He is apparently never ever wrong about anything amd when he is, he never apologizes despite being very very hurtful to us.  My mother is also very different now, she used to be a very loving and caring mother, and throughout the 8 years she has changed from a very social, loving and involved mother into something different. Her eyes look dead now, she's an alcoholic and she allows the abuse (verbal,mental, and emotional) from my stepfather and never defends us, her two children, anymore.  She is still supportive of my activites and school, but my stepfather hates to go to anything, and berates my mother when she ""stays too long"" or he needs her to do something else.  My stepfather is alienating my mother from my younger sister and I by constantly taking her attention from us, or pouting when she talks to us instead of him.  And my mother does not cope well with the stress of her situation.  One time she got so drunk she guilted me into going into a sauna and stay in the heat (I hate heat) and being dehydrated from day drinking...I felt sick and lightheaded and on the egde of crying the whole time, as I hate seeing my mother drunk like that.  But I hate leaving her alone like that because it's just so sad to me, I cry constantly for her.  On top of forced daughter-drunk mother time, she also constantly, in a very nice way, calls me fat and lazy.  She says I'm useless when I can't do something she wants, and is surprised when my therapist even said I was super depressed and anxious and should be taking steps to calm my mind in doing things like coloring and stepping away from situations (she won't let me walk away from and argument to cool, and she thinks coloring is childish), it's not a diagnosis diagnosis from a doctor, but I know my therapist is qualified to tell me that.  My mother doesn't believe that children can be depressed because they don't know the ""real world"" and teenagers just do it for attention and to be cool.  My stepfather and mother constantly degrade me, and I try to protect my little sister from all that's going on. All of this is very stressful for me and really sad, and it feels like only my boyfriend truly has my back. I do get called a problem a lot by my parents, and I do argue back and get loud and hurtful when it comes to defending myself and my sister.  I do feel like most of the stuff that goes on is my fault since I refuse to let my stepfather walk all over us.

Sorry for the rambling, but I can post more specific stories if y'all want? I just need to know I'm not crazy and if I'm really being abused. Sorry if this isn't the right place for it",03Jul2020,1

468,"He lost his twin brother at birth. Apparently his mother tried to cover up his twin brother’s death, and he’s mad at her over it.

Along with that he also lost his half-brother about couple years ago. His car got hit by a fast moving train, and he didn’t survive his injuries.

He’s been so depressed about it and non-stop talks about it. He suffers with mild autism, is depressed and introverted.

The thing with me is that I’ve never actually experienced losing a close family member. The only family member I can think of I lost was my paternal great-grandmother who was like 102 years old and I unfortunately didn’t really have a connection with her. I know that my mom lost her parents around I believe before or after I was born (1995), but I didn’t know them and was too young to understand.

470,"Temporary profile and i'm not going to reveal any major personal info for obvious reasons.

I believe I sexually assaulted someone who was like family to me when we were growing up. I was a year older and initiated it. 

It started near the beginning of middle school and ended at the end of middle school. There were times that it was reciprocated, enjoyed by both parties, and times where it was definitely not wanted but I pushed anyways. And it happened frequently, almost every time I knew I had the chance at night. I was a terrible kid, and i'm a young adult now. The both of us are. It's terrible, the fact that I pushed it on them at such a young age. I've grown an immense amount, and realized how fucked up it all was. A lot of self hatred has stemmed from that, but honestly, that's irrelevant. I'm worried on how it's affected them, and I want to apologize, maybe make amends. 

Thing is, i'm not really sure how to go about doing such a thing? The last time it was acknowledged between us was years ago, when I last tried to do it. I stopped as they told me they were in a relationship, and I felt bad at the time due to that.
Since then, radio silence and just mulling over the fact that it happened for the past few years.

The guilt, compounded with the #metoo thing going on has really brought it to a boil for me mentally. Am I asking this to save my own ass? I'm definitely fearful of that, and i'd be lying if I said I wasn't afraid of them telling their family. Moreso, it's me realizing what I did as a child and feeling immense guilt as an adult. The trauma I probably instilled within them will most likely never go away.

How do I go about handling this? I can't change the past, as much as I wish I could. But I want to try to make things better. I'm too afraid to figure out how to approach it without advice.",03Jul2020,1

I've been dating a girl I'll call T for 3 years now, T and I have been long distance but she comes to see me so we make it work, She plans to visit me soon but she made an offer this time, she'd like to take me back home with her, At first I thought she was joking but she was serious. T's family know and adore me so they're on board with it and they don't even ask anything of me really. They're well off financially and just expect me to work or pursue some form of education, I 10000% wanna jump at this opportunity as they live up north while I live in Texas on the outskirts of everything with no friends, little opportunity, and nothing going for me so I have no real options here aside from fast food and minimum wage odd jobs. The issue is my parents, I know they'd never allow this or understand me wanting to go off on my own to try and make a life of my own, This is a huge opportunity for me, I don't want to cause a gigantic rift or fight with me leaving, but I feel my only realistic course of leaving is to pack a suitcase, stay with her in a hotel when she comes to visit like I always do, and then just slip out with all my identification and clothes on her last day here. I'd contact them the day after we're gone since I know they'd act so extremely to the idea of it in general. Is there a better way I can do this? I know if I bring it up to them beforehand it wouldn't go well at all and they'd do everything in their power to keep me here.

I think my life is pretty ok and I'm happy with my situation, however I've dealt with (social) anxiety for more than half of my life. And over the past two years after I've moved out it slowly got worse and some other stuff kept adding up - like trouble sleeping, some OCDish behaviours (hand washing, tapping, double-checking if I turned to stove off/set my alarm for the morning), and heart racing/fluttering. Now I decided I want to do something about it but I don't know where to start and I have some questions.

My little mind thought we’re gonna get married one day because she was about the only friend i had that was a girl at the time. When I was about 5 she was over at my house and I did something bad.

I didn't realize how creepy her dad was until I got to her house and he started commenting on my body and how I got fat. Throughout the day, her dad continued to make negative, tone-deaf comments about my looks, intelligence, and life in general. I was getting fed up and started pushing them to go home. Also, my friend never stepped in and told her dad to shut up.  She was normalizing his behavior by saying stuff like, ""That's just how he is."" On the ride home, he kept pushing me to sleep over at their place, which I was uncomfortable with doing so I said no. At one point, we stopped to get food and while my friend was inside going to the washroom, her dad asked me if I wanted to have sex, to which I said a stern no. I was incredibly disgusted and uncomfortable. The only thing on my mind at that point was to get home, away from these people. During the last bit of the ride home, he called me a ""shy, depressed girl"". To which I said, ""I don't appreciate these comments as they are rude and are making me uncomfortable. My friend started making excuses for her dad's behavior by once again saying that it's the way that he is. And I told her that it doesn't make what he is doing okay.

I never texted her when I got home and deleted her number immediately. I have never been so disgusted in my life, where it is to a point that I had nightmares about it.

481,"About three months ago my Dad went through a mid-life crisis of sorts. He split up with my Mom (haven't divorced yet) and unceremoniously announced he would be leaving for his home country.

Three months later and neither my sister, my mother or I have received so much as a text from him. And, in a turn of events that seems far from coincidental, I was approached by someone claiming to be my half-sister... born from an extramarital relationship my father had with another woman while married to my Mom.

My half-sister said she had known who I was for 20 years but only now had the courage to approach me. It appears she has severe abandonment issues and is wanting to reconnect with her real father - who just so happens to be my father too.

The whole thing is surreal. I'm equal parts worried and angry at my father. I'm terribly sad for my half-sister. All I want to do is talk to him and straighten things out... figure out the person he truly is and what else he might have hidden from me, both for my sister and I's benefit and my half-sister's benefit.

488,"I (25f) left my graphic design job in March after saving money to go travelling to places for possibly 6 months. It was mainly to get a break because I felt my anxiety shoot up and the self saboteur in me was just at me everyday, amongst other personal things too. I know travelling isn’t the answer to issues with life but I just wanted to go to different environments and experience more to get out of my headspace.

The day before I was meant to get on a flight to the USA (first trip of many that was for 3 weeks including driving around) travel restrictions were put in place. At first I was disappointed but I realised it worked out for the best because it would have meant panicking trying to get a flight back home.

The past few months might not have followed my original plan of a break but it’s still a break. I’ve been trying to get back into my creative zone and it’s working. I’m no longer feeling crap about my artwork because it’s mine.

My issue now is that time has passed and it’s time to look for a job. I know I won’t land a job instantly but hopefully in due time I’ll find something. My other cancelled trips have mostly been refunded to me so I’ve got some of my money back so financially ok. But my cancelled flights to the USA have been put as credits to be used by next year. I enquired about getting a refund but nothing is getting back to me and I had flights with Delta and they seem like they won’t refund me my credits.

What should I do? Wait for all this to blow over (which is unpredictable and doesn’t seem like anytime soon) or lose out on money? I only say the latter because I want to make a good impression if I get a new job and taking a 3 week holiday within the first year is a bit of a stretch, right??

I know this seems like a petty issue and people would kill have these opportunities/experiences but atm I have no clue what to do and where to go.


TL;DR: left job to go travelling but the world went tits up and I can’t get a refund back from airlines for a 3 week trip and feel like it’s time to get a job. Do I wait for all this to blow over and go on a dream trip or start looking for a job?",03Jul2020,1

It subjected me to a lot of bullying. My curly hair getting made fun of constantly. My skin being made fun of. The fact that my parents were separated being made fun of. My body. My smile, everything was the target of this bullying. So I started skipping school a lot. It was just hard to be in such a place. I didn’t have many friends and the friends I did have were horrible to me. And people
would point that out. People would make fun of the fact that I “had two friends and even they barely liked me”. It was hard. I couldn’t do it. So I left and refused to go back.

492,"CW - self harm and relationship abuse
Hi, sorry for this long winded post and I wasn’t sure which community suits this best.
I [22F] got out of an abusive relationship, (mentally physically and emotionally) about two years ago. The relationship involved me being told I would never find anyone when he was drunk, or being accused of cheating on nights out, having to message every 15 minutes and be back by the time I said I would be. Once I was back half an hour later and was ignored for the whole evening. I was told what was ok to wear and had to block Male friends.
 Ever since then I’ve noticed I struggle to trust anyone. I struggle with jealousy when my partner see female friends and have a tendency to as if my partner is cheating. However, I am determined to work on it, organising therapy for after lockdown, buying some self help books and anxiety colouring books. Unfortunately though I’ve found it ruining every relationship I’ve had since then, with the person who I would be seeing leaving, saying it wasnt my fault.
The first guy I dated I was in a horrible position and he had a lot of health problems so I accept this was my fault, with me being insecure and him spending a lot of time in hospital.
I went on a few dates with some people but they always called it off saying they weren’t ready after I disclosed to them my abuse.
Finally, I was seeing someone [24M] I really liked and believed it could work. I was determined to work on my issues so hard. He kept me in an exclusive but not official position for three months before breaking it off and telling me it wouldn’t work.
All of this has led me to believe it’s my fault, I need to do better and I’ll never find someone who will support me and accept my flaws. I guess I just want advice on how to not be jealous after an abusive relationship?",03Jul2020,1

I feel as if they have no respect for me, and I sense that in the way they often nitpick at anything I say and try to contradict me (even small statements like ""lol that doesn't sound right,"" ""huh???"", ""yeah your thought process makes no sense to us""), BUT they never seem to do so to one another. Even just comments like ""haha yeah I trust A more than you."" And how they always feel the need to give constructive criticism (not a bad thing, but 24/7 is just too much for me..). I know for a fact that they think of me as a friend, but it doesn't feel like they see me as an equal. I'm just the butt of the joke and the easy punching bag. I feel like part of the issue is that I've shared a handful of my vulnerabilities and negative points with them because they're my friends, but instead of reinforcing our friendship they seem to just look down on me. 

I'm 100% part of the problem because I'm too much of a people pleaser and try too hard to be the ""nice"" friend and I've been making efforts to change. But what frustrates me is that I feel so crappy about myself when I try to stand my ground. I just feel like I'm being too sensitive and making it so that my friends have to tip toe on egg shells around me now. Whenever they ask me to do something for them I've been trying to refuse but they retaliate in ways that just make me feel like I'm a terrible friend. I WANT to be nice, and it makes me happy to do things for my friends, but I hate being stepped all over. 

It just sucks. Everything sucks. I don't want to give up on this friendship but I've honestly cried once or twice over how frustrated, confused, and mistreated I felt. I just don't get why we can't all be nice to one another. Why do I have to get looked down on for being the nice friend??? I'm just so sick of being nice but I feel equally worse when I try NOT to be.

TLDR; How do I approach this situation of feeling mistreated by my friends and improve our relationship? How do I find the middleground between being a nice friend but not a pushover?",03Jul2020,1
496,"For some context, if anyone’s unfamiliar with my circumstances, I’m a 20 year old trans man living in England and I need to earn some money so I can escape from my abusive parents and get a small house made of shipping containers. Just somewhere I can stay so I don’t have to go back to their house after I graduate from university, Due to physical disabilities, mental health issues and a learning disability, I’m unable to get a conventional job, hence why I’m turning to the internet for a source of income.

I’m trying to find different ways of earning money over the internet and I was wondering if there’s a platform that allows you to earn money from writing original fiction. I know that people in the online art community can take commissions and I wondered if that’s possible for writing as well. I’m currently taking a degree in screenwriting. I also write song lyrics and practice some digital art in my spare time. One thing I was also considering was making money through Twitch streams, although I haven’t worked out the finer details of that yet, so some advice on that would also be greatly appreciated. 

If anyone knows what options would be best for me, please let me know. I need to find a way of earning the money I need, while still putting my creative efforts at the forefront. Thanks in advance!",03Jul2020,1
498,"So me and my mom have some rocky history, we are not really all that close and we fall out a lot but I always end up forgiving her. This time I’m not sure if I want to, recently she has been struggling and me (20F)and my younger sister(19F) have been helping her. We don’t have the best jobs rn but we work fucking hard but she dips in to both of us and has probably racked around 2000 from both of us. I’ve been trying to help her less cause  trying to save up to get an apartment, so every bit counts. But that means she’s taking from my sister more... it’s been bothering both of us, especially me because Ik what she’s doing with it. My mom has a long history with drug abuse, all my life since the day I was born it had been a problem. I do not believe that after 20 years.. she was able to quit her habit cold turkey. My aunt revealed to me that she was still getting high, and with how frequently she asks us for money I believe it. She may be able to fool my sister who just chooses to ignore it or act gullible but she does not fool me. I’ve confronted her many times but she always say she doesn’t do it anymore. 

The reason why I cut her off is this time , she calls me while I’m at work and says my aunt is gonna send me 20 bucks for her, I told her I was busy at work and it will have to wait, she insists that I do it now and she’s on her way. When she arrives I tell her to just take me card and take the money out and I’ll worry about getting it from my aunt later. She drinks the card back but it wasn’t till later that I discover that she took more than what she was supposed to. She normally asks for 20 bucks but she took 40 instead, I was livid and pissed off, I texted her and I went off on her. It’s only 40 bucks but it was my money and who knows what o could have needed it for, I moved money from my savings to be able to help her out. I may be overreacting but to me it’s a trust things, I give me card and you run off with it and you take more money from me than you said you would. I’ve already given her 140 just this month alone. 

She’s supposed to be getting a good amount of money in a couple days and she said she would give me a little bit out of it and my sister, a lousy ass bit compared to what she’s receiving. I never believed this, my mom doesn’t just give money away. I told her to keep her money and that I would no longer be helping her, and I blocked her. I have no intentions to talk to her for a while, she’s very toxic and I just can’t deal with her anymore. Am I wrong?",03Jul2020,1

504,"I work remotely for a small agency that has 0 management or any semblance of hierarchy. There are less than 10 of us and the owner refuses to set any kind of example, employ any type of process and only occasionally makes the eldest person at the company do the boss-like dirty work like delivering bad news or rule-enforcing when things get dire enough. To give you a sense of the type of person we're dealing with, the boss receives a copy of all of the incoming emails to each employee so they can monitor our communication and then micromanage our tasks. 

Because she doesn't receive a copy of outgoing emails, understandably she isn't always up to date on the latest client correspondence. But the kicker is even if she HAS been cc'd she rarely reads these emails that are MEANT to keep her in the loop. She admitted to me once that she immediately puts them in a folder bc she ""is too busy and gets too many."" This is incredibly annoying and frustrating because it sends the message to the team that not only does she not trust anybody to do their jobs, but there's no process or ownership of tasks between employees because she'd rather micromanage than make anyone accountable. 

I feel like I waste SO Much damn time repeating myself it's exhausting. This was annoying but doable when I only worked for this company, but now I'm working remotely for another company making almost 3 times as much my hourly wage and I'm reaching a breaking point.

She wanted to use him for his money, but my dad didn't know. When he came back, my mom found out and they started arguing. He said he was sorry and that he didn't know what came over him.

I don't know what to do. Should I confront him or something? Sometimes, he threatens to hurt us, but he never does. I'm still scared though. I hate him.

509,"So I don't know where to start but I'll try my best.

I'm an 18 year old Asian male.  
Growing up I was bullied which caused me to recede in to myself. I never really had a lot of self-esteem. I used to stick to my books but internally I've always longed for friendship. Later on I did depart from my inner prison. I've been able to play a role as a public speaker, and I'm debate captain at my school. Despite all this I continue to feel empty. I have had friends who I've been very close to over the years and then I continue to feel a sense of longing.  
For the past few years my family has had to battle financial issues. This caused us to constantly move around. Frequently I have had to witness my parents fight. For someone who is often considered to be quite 'emotional for a man', this has been really stressful.  
I'm too afraid about the fact that I'm not capable of being loved even though my parents have given me love. Added to this, recently I've had to endure a traumatic incident that left my feet severely burnt. As a result my anxiety and stress has only increased and I've come to realize that I had been neglecting my condition for so long. Today, I feel different things make me really anxious like loud sounds.  
Last year I applied to a broad range of colleges, and got into none of the places I wanted to be at. Its only further added to my dejection.  
I really like to speak and write. My friends often say that I'm the most confident and talkative person they know but deep inside I feel like nothing but an empty shell. At times, girls come up to me and tell me that they think I'm cute but I can never be honest with them or take it anywhere because I'm too afraid in my mind. I'm too afraid about my conservative household and I'm also too afraid that I'm too poor. I feel I have nothing more to live for except maybe to be able to help the thousands of others trapped in this situation or to support my parents. I try not to think about all of this because its extremely difficult. I don't shed tears because I know if I started I wouldn't be able to stop.  
Now though I don't really know where I am in life. Everything feels like I live a life that isn't mine. These past few years have felt like a constant downward spiral despite the personal successes I have had. Each day I find myself wondering what other pain is going to strike next. I want nothing more than to be able to work hard and improve the lives of people but right now I can't even help myself or find the will to rejuvenate my mind. Honestly, I feel like I can't relate to anyone in my age group on an emotional level. Sometimes I feel I might as well accept that I'm a failure. The only refuge I have found all of these years is in my occasional writings, which I pour the entirety of my depressive feelings into.

I'm sorry if all this has been written disjointly. There are so many things I want to write but I really don't want to start crying as I type this. So seldom have I have felt my happiness in me and even then it comes accompanied with the pangs of sadness.

A few years ago, I was able to go abroad with for a school field trip to Sri Lanka. I will never forget the moment I saw their stunning botanical gardens. I just wanted to sit there and weep because of the sensations that began to consume me and how beautiful it was against the golden sunset.

The truth is I don't know my value anymore. I just genuinely want to be happy in life, I just want to go out for once and be able to feel I don't have a worry in the world. I just want to be able to tell someone I like them, to hold someone's hand and feel its warmth, or walk about unafraid without thinking of all the fire hazards around me. I just want to be myself and be proud of the person I am. I just want to step out and not feel insecure about every joint in my body. I just want to feel at peace and WHOLE for once in my life.",03Jul2020,1

511,"TL;DR I have anxiety, imposter syndrome, focusing and memory problems. It makes me suck at work. + one shitty co-worker made me question my knowledge and experience.

First of all, apologies for long post and English is not my first language.

&amp;#x200B;

I work in a highly competitive environment and living in another country. We are working from home almost 4 months now.

I have several issues and don't know where to start fixing and it makes me panic day by day.

1) I forget my emails. For example, I read a company announcement in the morning. At lunch when someone asks me about the topic, I am completely blank unless they remind me the email or if it clicks to me while they speak. I feel extremely stupid as this happened several times with my manager.

2) I am having problems at staying focused while working and procrastinate until last minute. 

3) When I go to bed, I always think about work and worry a lot about my outcome. I want to stop thinking but can't accomplish this. Even though I always think about work, while in working hours, i can't bring myself to work effectively. The most I can focus is 30 mins and then I get distracted by other things and I certainly can create distraction if there is none around me. 

4) I always thought that I am a fast learner and result oriented and was really successful in my career so far. It seems I make things work but I always feeling like I accomplish my successes by mistake or because there was no one else that's why I was chosen etc. 

5) I have a co-worker who started to work after me. He is extremely competitive.  He has 10 years more experience than me and he was in this industry and knows it all. Whereas I worked in same industry but in different roles and I am still learning my way around.

The things I was spending time to learn, he already knew and some co-workers favors him over me and this makes me quite upset. Now I always comparing myself to him, trying to be at same level or better but fail because clearly I can't beat his 10+ years experience. 

In meetings when I start asking a questions to someone else or start talking, he cuts my word and answers me and I feel that he doesn't like me at all. I feel like he sees me quite inferior and maybe thinks I don't know shit. To be honest, I don't like him a bit too. A lot of other small things happened but if I try to type it down, this will be like a novella.

I don't work closely with this person anymore however it left some scars and I don't have the confidence I used to have. I suspect my knowledge, and always hesitate to answer someone asks something to me, because he can correct me or he can do it better.

I am not sure where to start and feel like I'm being crushed under all these factors.",03Jul2020,1

I wasn't able to break free from my family until I was 26 (28 now) and I've been trying to scrape together a life for myself and now I'm in a position to finally get that shit out of there. 

The problem is they always claimed they didn't want any payment for storing it, but go behind backs and say shit about us for doing it making it out like some huge sacrifice even thought they don't even use their barn anymore cause they're old except to store shit they haven't used for 20 years. They're the type of people to say to other family how ungrateful I am for never paying them and on one hand I want to give as much as I can and be done with it just so they can't say I never did but on the other hand I just want to say fuck you and not give a cent because they don't deserve any of my fucking money.

Since the transactions are months old my grandma doesn't think the bank can do anything and she doesn't want to send her to jail for the rest of her life with a newborn baby which I respect but in my opinion they can't just let someone get away with robbing them for months while she was working and after she left.

518,"I started back at my customer service job this week after months off on furlough and it is hell on earth. My managers constantly belittle me, contradict each other and then berate me if I follow a different manager’s orders that went against theirs. They are always picking favourites and pick on the people they dislike over trivial things. I’ve had a manager tell me I’m worthless for studying an arts degree and will never amount to anything so you can see that the bullying isn’t just tied to work-related things.

To cut a long story short I’ll get to the major event of the day that led to this post. I noticed I was being treated especially harsh by everyone. I had already had to fight back tears during the shift before the new manager then takes me aside to give me a list of jobs to do. She tells me that all she knows about me is what the other managers say when they bitch about me behind my back, so I can prove my worth to her by completing the list. I fought back tears again for the remainder of my shift and cried when I got home. It was heartbreaking to know that I’m unliked in the workplace and that no matter how hard I try and how hard I work when I’m in pain; nothing I do is ever good enough for them. As someone with social anxiety it was a massive blow to have my worst fears confirmed. 

I’ve never quit a job before and don’t really understand how to go about it. I keep having second thoughts about quitting because I know how difficult it’ll be to get another job in this climate, especially since it took me 3 years of applying to even get my first job (without a pandemic making it more difficult). If I stay I’ll be severely sacrificing my mental health. It feels like high school all over again and I don’t know if I can cope with working there another day. I’m unable to even enjoy my day off just now, thinking of having to face the same shit all over again tomorrow. 

I don’t feel comfortable enough to speak to the boss about this as I know that he’s aware of the bitching and actively participates in it. The only solution I can see is to quit, but I’m scared to even bring that up to my boss and have to explain why. I fear the repercussions I would face if I were able to complain to some higher ups, which I have no idea how to do anyway. Whilst this is just a minimum wage job they have a very long notice period in place so my fear is that I’d be treated even worse if I were to go ahead and quit or report anyone. I’ve even thought about walking out on the job since I’m not likely to get a good reference anyway. 

[NB] I’m a few months shy of being here for a year so I’m not sure if I should just stick it out longer to have better chances of getting a new job (since I don’t have the 1 year experience just yet). 

I’m using a throwaway account to write this just in case they stumble on this post and somehow link it to me. There’s so much more to this but I don’t want to make myself too identifiable.

520,"Hello everyone, I work at a supermarket in vegtables section.
When I turned 15 i wanted to get a job and I mainly had 2 options, i could bring around newspapers or I could work in a supermarket.
I chose for the supermarket because I have high functioning autism and I wanted to improve my social skills.
So after working there for 2 years and 9 months i did everthing that was required for a promotion and at this time i should've got it but i didn't know that yet.
So a few weeks ago i got curious and wanted to know when you get a promotion/raise and i found out that i already should have gotten a promotion/raise 8 months ago.
With that information i finally got the courage to ask for a raise witch i did thursday(yesterday). So all night i was busy with what to say and how, after a few hours i finally knew what arguments to make why i should get a raise.
So thursday morning i have my break and me and my boss are along and i say: sir can i ask a question about my position here.
He said: yes.
I said: when i got hired i got a different (lower) function than on witch i applied and now i am doing the work for an even higher function.
And before i could make any arguments why i should get a raise he replied: so you want a raise? And i said: yes and the first thing he did was to put my raise in the computer so i was very very happy.
But after awhile i wasn't happy anymore but rather grumpy because it felt really like he knew that i should have gotten a raise 8 months sooner but didn't give it to me because he probably thought that i wouldn't notice and wouldn't ask for it. 
So after a few hours i go back to him and ask in a polite way: sir why didn't i get this sooner did i got underpaid for the last 8 months(i know this is maybe not so polite but i didn't how the type it differantly because i am not english). 
But the first thing he did was laugh and after that he went like: so now you are acting like this. 
He just acted like i got a raise and now i want more money because i saw a change or something but i should've got a promotion 8 months ago and i am pretty sure the 4 bosses all new that but knew that it would take a long time for me ask for it so they didn't give it to me because then i would be more expensive. 

What should i do?

521,"Hey everyone! I try to keep this as short as possible but I really could need some advice!

&amp;#x200B;

A little information about me: 20yo, male, trans ftm, and a ton of mental and physical problems. I live in germany, so sorry for any misspelling!

&amp;#x200B;

So a little Background: I quit a school for media design after getting the offer to either get kicked out or take a year of and come back fully healthy. I mean I took the years off offer but just didn't go back.

  
I have repeatedly been in psychiatric hospitals since I'm 14 nearly every year because yeah... Shit's real. My parents are kind of supportive now, but not really helpfull? It's complicated.  
Anyway I spend the last two years in 2 psychiatric hospitals and a 1-year-long-Rehab for mentally ill ppl. Moved out of my parents home nearly a year ago now with a friend.

Ever since I moved out I really started to realise just how much my parents try to control me, but at the same time are unwilling to actually help with things I struggle with.

I got accepted at an academic high school for health stuff (I think that is the german equivalent not sure tho) which is a really short notice, since it starts next month but I got lucky and moved up the waiting list apprently because someone else dipped. Yay, but also I'm really scared :')

The problem is, that I don't want my parents to know shit about my school life, my grades, well really anything at all. They always made everything just so much harder than it already was, and I want to do this without even more pressure. They always had something bad to say about my grades (Nearly only As and Bs) never said anything good or acknowledged my really good grades. Side Notes: both work low paying jobs/jobs that don't need high education.

Why not just tell them?

Well that's the problem, really. My father used to be really fucking aggressive, and still is sometimes. My sister and I gave up trying to make him understand how much that scares and hurts us after trying everything we could. He screams a lot, even after my therapist told him that I have PTSD and screaming will send me into a panic attack. He swore he will never do it again. Worked for like 6 months, then he said I have to learn how to deal with it, thats how the real world is bla bla bla  
Oh and he dropped ""I never screamed a lot at you or your sister growing up."" at some point.

When she was unhappy with something we did or whatever she would, instead of talking to me or my sister, just complain to my father untill he cracked and screamed at us for hours and sometimes even hit us.

I just know that when I tell them: ""Hey I don't want you two to ask or know anything about my school life because you stress me out and make it harder for me!"" it's gonna go really bad. 

My parents believe we have a good relationship, which we kinda do on the surface? I mean if you make it impossible for your child to tell you anything they dont like about what you did, you can pretent everything fine?

Before you ask, no I am not ready to confront my parents about more than I absolutly need to and even then even that really, really scares me. And I kinda don't want to lose them even with all the shit they did?

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I would like some advice on how to handle this or what to say? I'm really struggling with this, anything at this point is really appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: How do I tell my controlling parents what I don't want them to ask/know anything of my school life please and thank you?",03Jul2020,1
522,"About a week ago someone knocked at my door asking for a man by name who does not live here and who has never lived here (the house was newly built when we moved in). Since then we have received multiple packages and letters addressed to this person every day. 

We wrote 'Unknown, return to sender' or 'not at this address' or something on the letters and parcels and put them back in the postbox (we are in the UK and as far as I know this is the correct thing to do). 

Today we received a parcel and a letter addressed to him again. There was no return address on the envelopes so we opened them to find it so we could write it on the envelopes (I'm not interested in hearing about whether this was wrong or right btw). The reason I'm worried now is that the contents were strange, and I'm concerned someone is messing with us. The letter was a printed email from PayPal about £0.99 being put into an account (I'm an idiot and forgot to check for an email address I could have used to contact this person), and the parcel was a single yellow sharpie, with no delivery note. Both of these just seem really weird to me.

I messaged someone through Facebook with the same name who lives in the area to see if it was them, and they responded that it was not. A member of the household is going to ask the post office about it, and I thought I would ask you guys.

Does anyone know if this is something to be concerned about?  Many thanks for your help!",03Jul2020,1

I let people tell only what they want to share. My problem is that my friends and my parents know eachother quite well and I am slightly conflicted about whether I should vaguely mention these things to my parents. I am always there to support my friends but maybe my parents would be able to offer advice. I get concerned that they might one day find out and start asking me why I didn't tell them. I love my parents but I already don't even tell them about my own mental health and personal struggles. Do people usually share what is going in their friends lives to their parents? Should I?

531,"Tw: non-consentual

posting this again because im still confused. I was blackout drunk and hooked up with 3 different guys. One of them should have realized that I was drunk because his friends did, the second one had no idea i was drunk, and the third one fingered me and when i said please don’t go there because I’m hairy(that was my excuse), he said that he liked it that way and I don’t think he stopped.
This happened like a year ago, and I just recently stopped blaming myself. I don’t blame them either, I don’t think they realized that I was unconcious and I’ve hooked up with the 2 of them before, so maybe they thought I’d be willing to do that again.The problem is that I’m still close with those people (not that close but were still friends), and I never confronted them.

Where I am from the restrictions are being eased but I told my boyfriend if he is still wanting to be around me he need to be careful as a precaution etc however he has went to work in his friend's car, he has gone to his friend's house for a party and when I confronted him about that he told me that he may as well stay away from me until all of this is over and then also told me that if I got sick he will look after me and I told him that wasn't good enough and how he was putting my life at risk.

The thing is is that I have been staying in to protect my family and have no life whatsoever however my boyfriend is the only visitor I get to my house and during this whole thing he has been going to work and seeing friends ,going to people's houses and them going to his house and during all of this he is also playing Dungeons and Dragons and I feel like I am on a schedule with him the same way I was when he went to college about two years ago where he was making time for his college friends that he saw everyday and was making time to see them to go out drinking and also to go and see his work friends and go to work and everything so I wasn't really seeing him and I get that there is a lot going on at the minute but I'm back on that schedule.

Literally he is working most days and on Saturday it's movie night with his family and on Mondays it is Dungeons and Dragons night which this week was cancelled without him telling me me and when I tried to get in touch with him yesterday I was told that they were playing Dungeons and Dragons. I don't know why but I feel really left behind from everything and I feel so much anger towards him right now I'm afraid with this type of behaviour will continue after this is all over and I won't be able to put up with it.",03Jul2020,1

534,"Around three months ago, I met someone in a game we both obsess over. Ever since, we've gotten very close and have brought each other many good laughs... My friend is very closed off, but they conceal that feature of theirs by taking the attention elsewhere with good jokes. At first, I didn't really notice they were this way, until they randomly messaged me that their mother was drunk.. Which wouldn't be the last time I heard that from them. I may be exaggerating the whole situation a bit, but I've had terrible experiences with alcohol and parental figures so I can't help but jump to conclusions. As far as I know, their mother doesn't interact much with them while under influence but I can imagine they don't feel great about it, especially if they open up to someone about it despite their very reserved and closed off personality. Even though I have had experience with a similar situation, I still don't know what to say to them. It's such a strange thing to fuss over, but I want to be there for them and I want them to know they're not alone. I'm scared of saying anything remotely inappropriate that'll trigger them since it's such a touchy subject... What on earth do I say to them to make them feel better?

It keeps making excuses to eat something ‘bad’, for example: when I have a hard day or when I had a busy day it will tell me that I deserve to eat unhealthy today and that I will feel better when I eat junkfood’. And maybe that bit is sort of true, because while I’m eating the food i’m all happy and stuff but once I swallowed the last bite I immediatley feel bad and regret it. 

Don’t get me wrong, I do eat ‘normal’ healthier stuff. But I just simply CANNOT commit to eating healthy for more than 2 days in a row and I just don’t understand why... I try so hard but then I get all sad because I can’t eat junkfood.

539,"I (23,f) live in an appartment building. My direct neighbor (around 40ish,m) and I never talked much, mostly because he is an immigrant and not that good with the language, but we have a healthy relationship. If one of us needs something we try to help each other out, we take care not to annoy each other too much with loud music etc. We have a basic neighbor-relationship, but are definitely not friends.
Like two months ago he knocked on my door and gave me a bag full of food that he got from the city. (We have a system that if you can't afford food they provide the things super markets couldn't sell.) I thought it was nice of him and thanked him a bunch, but like 90% of it was waste and I had to throw it away (rotten apples, very stale bread, and stuff like that. You would surely be happy about it if you were starving, but I am not starving in the slightest). I have enough money to provide food for me and my dog.
I didn't think much of it, thought it would be a one time thing, but since then he has been knocking on my door at least once a week, often times even every two or three days. I always feel bad because I have to throw most of it away, but I try to use the food as good as possible, so there is as little waste as possible.
I know it's a weird thing to be annoyed by someone just trying to be nice, he wants to help me out and I am not confident enough to just say ""I don't need it"" and I don't even know someone who could maybe need it so that I could give it to someone else.

Then, about 4 months ago I sat her down because she acted weird after beeing away for a few days and we talked and she told me that she is unsure and scared of growing up and commiting. She also told me that she felt attracted to a guy in the near past and that she overanalized that fact on and on and felt ashamed and guilty. She doesnt want to be with this guy or something but it set her off because she usually doesnt notice other guys in that way. I told her that i was hurt but not mad and that it is normal to have doubts sometimes but that i cant help her when she is having this irrational thoughts. I was her best friend, always there for her but I don't want to be therapist. I think that me beeing more like a father figure more often lately than a lover (still lots of sex though) made her lose attraction, could that be true? 
She then told me that she is afraid of growing up and commiting to one person, she doesnt know what she wants and that she would wish that I could read her mind to unterstand what is going on with her. She fears making a permanent mistake because she loves me but doesnt know what to do. She loves the way we treat eachother, the fun, how I look and so on. 
I was hurt and shocked and decided that we should end  things, she didnt really resist. Sometimes I think I should have just supported her instead of leaving. She also told me that if we didnt have this conversation we would probably be still together. Then I think that she has to figure out things on her own, since we had a great relationship, she always said how lucky and happy she is and if that is not enough for her I don't know what is. I recently finished Uni and started making money and we were looking for our own appartment. 

The things is, she was always overthinking everything and had kind of crazy thoughts from time to time, e.g:

- always thinks she has some kind of disease 
- worries that she maybe cant pregnant (for no reason) 
- worries that her future child would not love her
- is it going to workout with us in 10 or 15 years. Maybe we are to different, what if it doesnt work out if kids are involved.

Now, I miss her and she reached out to me causally about a month ago and wanted me to reach out if I want but she unterstands if i dont want to. Do you think I should leave it for good? She was the only girl i ever loved and our relationship was full of love and kindness. I also still have kind of a ""protective instinct"" towards her.

This is one of my bigger insecurities, it something that I simply can't control. I've had my whole life just about. No don't drink alot of alcohol to sweat this much (I've been asked too many times 🙄). I hate being asked ""why are you sweating?, its not hot"". As if I can turn it on an off 😰 (an ohhh if I could). An for some reason I have to explain the human body sweats to cool itself down. Which is just annoying. I'm very warm bodied. Its to the point I bring a personal towel and feel naked if I don't have it, cause I sweat so much.

Trying to talk to a woman I find attractive bam, walking down the street bam, playing pool bam. At work installing the most simplest thing, that takes little to no effort. Now I will say when I smoke weed, I don't sweat as much as normal (always found that interesting 🤔). I hate heat, its my worst enemy. My favorite time of year is fall an winter, I do sweat then, but its no where near as much.

So women, is this a big turnoff? Would this prevent you from taking someone with this problem out, an know that on the date he could wipe his head 30x 😅. Any advice for a guy like me? Would love to know, could use a confidence boost lol

Here looking for advice because I'm not sure who in my friend group I could even ask at this point without it potentially making it back to the person i'm asking in regards to.

She's asked for space to ""work through things on her own"" but at the same time it seems like she's only getting worse.

555,"For the past week my brother has been telling me that a package with be arriving at the door and he needs me to bring it inside for him. The info he has told me:

- He will not be home to pick it up abd our parents will see it.
- It is under a fake first name, but not last name.
- I need to put it under his mattress.
- I do not know the contents.

Besides that, it is definitely drug related or something bad considering my brother's history. He is 21, but I doubt it is legal regardless. My best guess is that it is potentially a fake product with something illegal hidden inside or a ""research chemical.""

I am 100% uncomfortable and I haven't committed to the idea verbally. I shouldn't touch this right? I should let my parents see it and play dumb when they open it. If it is drug related then my brother is instantly guilty considering his past and me being against taking even a sip of alcohol.

My plan is to ignore the package or at the very least take a peak of what is inside. I feel a tad bit paranoid about what could be inside. What are your thoughts? Do as he says, ignore him, do some investigating?",03Jul2020,1

557,"my dad died this may because of COVID-19. he was brilliant and kind, strong and set an example of amazing work ethic. at the same time he was the main source of my families income. he finished college and my mom dropped out after two years. we were homeless for about a year and a half when my dad lost his job. now that’s he’s gone it’s as if it’s going to happen all over again. this next year i’m transferring to a Community college so I can be with my family support my mom and my brother. Obviously I’m going to continue my education while working, but my mom and I have always had a broken relationship. everything I do she’s always skeptical questioning me and my friends. She has my location/tracker on everything and wherever I go. I don’t mind it because at least it puts her mind somewhat at ease but lately she’s become overwhelmingly frustrating. For instance, she always asked to look at my bank statements questions every little purchase I make questions my Venmo and cash app transactions why people are paying me why I’m paying others. She disapproves of my tattoos and piercings, when my piercings are just on my ear and my tattoos can be covered with clothes. The job I have now is not good enough for her she wants me to work as a front desk at a dentistry and get paid less because it seems more professional. When I am currently working and getting paid more at my current job with a raise and bonus coming at the end of this month. she questions why I work meanwhile I can’t remember the last thing she paid for me. I bought my own car, pay for my insurance, phone, bills, or even anything I want. I once asked her for five bucks because I forgot my wallet so I can buy coconut oil and she refused because she needs to save money which is understandable. thus my job now, she doesn’t understand why I work so much and why I need money in my bank account when I just want to save money for myself. she believes im using an overload of drugs and it’s messing with my head. i do smoke when everyone is asleep in my car. she even admits she doesn’t know where i do it, when i do it or how often. but she builds these scenarios in her head like i’m a druggie. meanwhile i’m a biochem major, on the deans list with one of the highest gpa’s.

558,"Hi, I'm a 19 y/o college student and the coronavirus has trapped me at home with my family. I used to be able to take the subway on campus and study in the library when I needed quiet and even though things are starting to open up slowly, I don't feel comfortable going out because my baby sister (8) is high risk for the coronavirus. However, my family is so toxic towards me and I can't take it anymore. I always feel constant pressure in various aspects of my life because i'm the oldest and the first to go to college and i'm supposed to be this role model, but I feel so unappreciated and taken advantage of by my younger siblings and my mom. I know how reddit feels about freeloaders like me complaining about their family, but I promise this isn't it.

I have 3 younger siblings, a baby sister (8), a little sister (15) , and a little brother (9). I share a room with my little sister and I have the top bunk, but I sleep on the couch in the family room because my little sister shuts all the windows and turns off the fan at night in order to sweat me out of the room. I used to wake up and turn the fan on and we would just have a war over it all night and it started to impact my sleep and learning so I just let her keep the room to herself. She also physically fights and threatens me all the time. She's much bigger than me and has given me concussions before so I don't want to fight her, but I can't just go to my mom about it because everyone is afraid of my little sister, even my mom. 

My baby sister is a kleptomaniac. I've come to this conclusion because we had a family meeting like a month ago and I told my baby sister that if she wanted anything she just had to ask for it instead of stealing it, but even this hasn't stopped her. She's graduated from stealing pencils, to makeup, to pocket change, to now big boy bucks. I'm talking taking my card and spending money on roblox type of stealing money. If I say that she stole from me she lies and tries to fight me (she's the type to hit people for saying words). I have scratches on my neck and arms from her being physical with me. I tried talking to my mom about it, but my mom is so passive in these situations I'd rather not talk to her. 

My little brother makes rape jokes about me and makes fun of me for being flat chested and my other sisters will laugh. The reason why this bothers me is because my mom and little sister would always body shame me growing up because I was petite and not ""thick"". He purposefully breaks my things because he knows he can (he's said those words before), I try to talk to my mom about it but she just tells me not to let a 9 y/o get the better of me.

I feel like my mom enables my siblings to react like this towards me. My mom and her boyfriend expect so much from me and they shame me if I don't do things. For example my mom will wash the dishes in the morning, leave for work, and not come back until the late evening. If the house isn't the exact same way she left it I take full responsibility for it because i'm the oldest, but no one else is expected to do anything. I say to her ""It's hard having to clean up after three people and myself, am I supposed to track behind them and watch every move they make?"" And she says yes. If I defend myself when my younger siblings hit me she threatens me by saying ""if you hurt them, you can be taken out of here in handcuffs"". I'm not saying i'm an angel, I mess up and I say things, but I feel like the consequences are much harsh when I do than the other kids in the family. Whenever my mom gets mad at me she says all I ever do is play video games and lay around, and that hurts because she really doesn't see that I deal with a lot on a daily basis. I feel like I've been resorted to a baby sitter and a maid and a punching bag. There are rumors that when the fall comes in we will still be social distancing and I will have class online still and that makes me very sad. Online classes have already negatively impacted my learning experience and my family makes it no better. What are some things that I can do to deal with toxic people or at least some things I can do to deal with the stress and sadness of dealing with them? I am open to all ideas, even going out, but I don't have money or friends. I live in a big city for context.

559,"I'm in a little bit of a predicament and need some advice. I had a room mate for a long time. About 7 years. We got along great and he is still one of my best friends. Well he moved out because he got a girl pregnant and he went to live with her to help her out when the baby came. They were sort of a couple for a while but it turns out that she was cheating on him. So  a couple months ago he said that he's gonna need a place to live in November since he still is gonna stick around to help her a bit but doesn't want to live with her anymore. I said that I'd have no problem with him moving back in. Here's the thing though. That conversation was real brief and we didn't really flesh out the details of our arraingment or his arraingment with this girl. In the meantime, I have another friend who I said could move in who is in a real tough spot with his current landlord. My other friend is planning to move in September 1st which is really helpful to me since he's gonna have rent which I desperately need because I'm not working right now.  Plus my first friend now has a baby who, if he moved back in, would be over at my house all the time. I like kids but that doesn't really fit my lifestyle right now.

I was very overwhelmed one day and asked my sister if I could vent, which is not something I usually do. The conversation eventually took a turn when it went to her religious views on how I should raise my child and it basically just turned into her venting feelings she's had pent up about me, my husband, my relationship with God, etc. 
She crossed several lines, insulted me, my husband, etc. I kept my cool and ended the conversation. We have not spoken in 6 months and I'm okay with it seeing as I shouldn't deal with toxicity while pregnant. 

Now, I get a text from her 3 weeks before my due date apologizing for the way she acted, the way she's treated me in the past, the things she said, she's ashamed etc. I'm obviously thankful for the closure...but it's 6 months late. I've already moved on and accepted everything. I forgive her and I'm glad she's realized why she can't treat family this way but I don't exactly think I should allow her back into my life.

565,"Hello all,

I (20m) feel so lonely and unwanted. What do you do when you feel this lonely? Nobody ever wants to spend time with me outside of work, let alone text or call me. At work, I have been called amazing, sweet, ""too kind,"" and any other compliment you can think of. I, and a few other people, all have a great time working together, but the second we clock out and go home I never receive any texts or calls from anyone. Yesterday really hurt, because as we were all going home, I said ""bye all, I hope you guys have a great rest of your day!"" Naturally, everyone said, ""you too!"" and that was the end of it. But a couple of seconds after I was walking away another coworker said bye to everyone and everyone else said that they should each hangout and start a group message together. I have never been invited to a group message before. What am I doing wrong? Why does no one want to spend time with me outside of work? I am always the one that has to initiate every conversation, and quite frankly I get sad every time I want to talk to my so-called friends.

566,"We recently made reservations for a trip to Miami when the states started opening back up, we made the reservations on June 20. We booked our trip the last week of July. My state just released a regulation last night (July 2) that anyone traveling to Florida or other listed states IS REQUIRED to self quarantine 14 days after returning. Having jobs to go to, this was not doable or probable, and the fine is large if you break the self quarantine. 

I contacted Airbnb for a refund, but our travel dates are not within their listed covid cancel policy, even though we’d be unable to travel at the end of july because of the restrictions coming back. 

Is there a way to get a refund? I’ve contacted them but still waiting to hear back to see if they can actually do anything else. I’ve read hundreds of cases of Airbnb not issuing refunds, so i’m nervous to see how this plays out. We were only refunded the tax ($60) so if we can’t receive the refund we’ll be out $650. 

Also, I purchased the reservation on a credit card. Would I be able to dispute it here or would airbnb just deny the dispute?",03Jul2020,1
569,"I hate my job at the moment, and it feels like I can't talk to anyone about it anymore, if I speak to my parents they'll worry about me being unemployed again and I don't want my Nan to have that stress
I can't speak to my gf because she needs some form of stability and me leaving a job to try find something I don't hate isn't stable.

I don't know if I'd be able to find a new job anyway because of Corona, so I might be stuck where I am.

I feel like every time I've had a choice in my life I've gone the wrong way, I missed out on a cool weapons job when they re offered me the job after initially saying no, I missed out on civil engineering because my college was rubbish and I didn't want to stick in a classroom so I went for a property job instead of an apprenticeship, I missed out on carpentry because I thought my current career would work and no one said anything positive about carpentry.

Now I don't have the savings to stop work and go back to college, I don't have the qualifications to go to uni, and I don't have the qualifications to do a job I'd get paid enough to not enjoy at all.

I don't have a clue what I'd want to do as a career, I thought my current career would be it, but clearly not, and the few hobbies I have I can't think of any way to profit from, so I can't use those as a career.

My Nan is dying and nothing can fix it, I feel guilty seeing her incase I make her ill, and seeing her clearly dying scares me, and I feel guilty not seeing her because she wants to see me and I know she hasn't got long left. Plus the last time we went to see my family, it just cause problems between me and my gf because I don't enjoy some of the things she does so she doesn't want to do them with me and has no one else to go with.

I'm scared my gf would leave me because I can't get any of this in order, and I don't know how to fix any of my problems, so she won't share hers with me, and then I get upset that she doesn't want to tell me what's up.

At work when I mentioned my mental health, no one in a position that can help has tried to help besides saying they'll do a referral, which I haven't heard anything about yet, and now I'm stuck in an office,  which makes me hate work even more, and being told to really question if it's the right career for me, and I don't think it is anymore, but I don't have any choice about staying or going because I need a paycheck and I don't have any other backups.

I don't know what to do with my life at this point, I have no idea what to do for a career, I have no idea how to persue a new career, and I have no money to fund a career change.

Work stresses me out, and then I don't feel at all sexual, and then that upsets my gf so then im worried about my gf and stress about her not liking me any more, and then I feel even less sexual than before. 

I feel like a failure that can't do any job well, and just disappoints and upsets people close to me and then drives them away.

I've been living in a new apartment for two weeks now. Everything was going great, until yesterday morning.
My partner and I have been together for 3 years and got 2 pet rabbits after around 8 months. After dealing with abusive neighbours for almost 2 of those years we decided to move. Nowhere would take us after hearing we had rabbits. 
Eventually my mum offered to help us by taking in our bunnies.

I cried even thinking about it. When it came down to it, our choices felt like give the bunnies away or keep living somewhere horrible that was seriously affecting us mentally. 

So we gave them away, it felt awful. That was 3 weeks ago. My mum has since gotten very sick, (she has an illness related to her lungs) and can't cope. We took the rabbits back this morning. I have had zero sleep between my mum and the possibility of having to give away beloved pets to strangers. 

Pets are not to be kept unless previously approved in writing. I honestly want to ask if I could keep them and agree to pay for any damages or pay a sort of pet deposit. If I had know this would happen I would not have wasted anyones time.

576,"Some background, my mom got a green cheeked conure about 2 years ago and she was told the bird was a male. It wasn’t until recently, about a month ago, that my mom mentioned the bird had been hiding under her bed and he would only come out to eat and drink water and then go right back under the bed. I live out of town and I hadn’t visited my mom, but I had to come down to visit for work purposes &amp; decided to check in on the bird situation. I started asking my mom questions about the birds behavior because I thought it was very strange for the bird to not come out at all unless it was for food or water. 

She told me the bird started going under her bed about a month ago or so. &amp; that he would sleep down there and spend his entire day under the bed. I freak out very easily and I worried that there might be something wrong with the bird. We just recently lost our family dog of 13 years and I know that if my mom were to loose her bird it would be too hard for her. So obviously I started panicking thinking the bird might be sick or something is wrong with him. 

My moms bed is made out of wood so it is extremely heavy for her to move it herself. So she hadn’t been able to check on the bird even though she wanted many times. I started thinking that maybe the bird was just picking the wood and that’s why he liked being under the bed so much. But something just wasn’t sitting right with me about it. I started researching online and I found out that female birds can actually lay eggs without a male. &amp; that most of the time, birds look for dark closed spaces to nest. I then read about egg binding and I started panicking even more (you’re probably wondering why I didn’t call a vet, well that’s because it was 10 p.m. no vet is available). 

I told my mom we were going to move her bed carefully to see what the bird had been doing under there, and to our surprise we found 5 EGGS!!!!! We decided to leave them under the bed so the bird can feel comfortable and not threaten. I started doing more research and I read that although female birds lay eggs without a male, those eggs are not fertile; therefore they will not hatch. 

So my question is, what do we do with the eggs?",03Jul2020,1

582,"Hi, I have seen this subreddit recently and I felt like this is a good place to ask for an advice for a problem I'm having. So here's my story.


I, at a small ages, didn't have a good social communication skill. At that time, people would joke around and said things like: ""Lol are you having autism or what?"" since I didn't talk to many people and I also didn't have many friends at the time. I was like a weirdo or something like that. 

Fast forward to middle and high school (right now). No, my social communication skill didn't improve. I still didn't have a lot of friends, still acted weirdly according to people around me. The situation improved a little bit compare to when I was smaller. But things started get going downhill again. I had to learn in a new class for personal reasons. Right now I'm learning in that new class. Being with new people is the worst. I'm acting weirder, my skill is worse. After that, I discovered that most people in my class hate me. That's reasonable to be honest. Due to my bad communication skill, my weird self...I often fell lonely. I kind of hate most people around me now because of that. So, my question is ""How to make myself less linely and being loved more?""

My issue is that he's slowly going down the crazy rabbit hole. I didn't notice at first, but looking back to 2 years ago he was pretty reasonable (though still way more conservative than me) and only watched fox news, and nowadays he thinks Michelle Obama is a man (plus other weird stuff like that) watches weird youtube channels for his news (x22 report being his main news source) and he's trying to make me watch them too and agree with them.

 It makes me really uncomfortable to watch him go down this rabbit hole, and it especially makes me uncomfortable when he tries to make me agree with it.

I am an orphan, 19, living in a studio apartment in the UK. Rent is paid for till September, which is when I move to uni (shared room there so won’t be lonely)

I’ve somehow made it to July, cycling and playing guitar, no human contact, but it is killing me. 

I was rejected by someone I liked based on race the same friday lockdown began, my confidence and self esteem have finally returned. (I won’t let a racist person ruin my self image)

I have £1000 to spare. I like travelling, playing guitar and film. I would like to keep socialising too so my social skills don’t degrade.

588,"So, I'm a 35 year old woman. Two days ago, my doctor prescribed me Zoloft for my anxiety and emotional trauma based PTSD. Medication has been a conversation for years, but I always refused because I didn't think my anxiety was severe enough and I thought I could push through. Well, everything finally came to a head, and I conceded.  She asked me my concerns about taking medication, and honestly I'm just scared. I told her that I don't know what it is like not to feel like an anxious mess or the way I have daily for 13 years. 

I'm taking 4 days of 25 mg and then increasing to 50 mg daily. 

My hopes are  high that one day I wake up and my chest and head aren't physically heavy, that I don't feel tired and overwhelmed right away, and that I can feel happy again. Is this possible?

Let me add, I'm not relying solely on Zoloft. I'm starting a workout program, nutrition program, and drinking tons of water. I'm making a lifestyle change.

I feel so profoundly lost in life right now. 

I want to get rid of all my social media and ghost all my friends. I feel so stagnant right now, and I realized me trying to impress other people is whats stopping me from reaching my true potential. I've been thinking about this for a few days now, but I'm still on this dilemma. Is it worth losing human connection? I want to start over, and in order to do that I need to make a drastic decision. I feel like this is the drastic decision I need to take in order to live a fulfilled life.

My friends done nothing wrong. Its just I realized that I'm not satisfied with the person I am. I want to change. I've been living in a way where my first thought that comes to mind is ""how do I impress this person."" I've come to realize this is the wrong way to live. I've come to realize I'm not satisfied with myself. I've come to realize I need to change.

592,"So to give a bit of context, I have a very loving person who picked me up at my worst. She was there and saved me from an abusive mother. I will always be grateful to her and her two daughters until the day I die.

That being said...

She's taken to being a Trump supporter and following ridiculous conspiracy stories. This worries me because she never used to be like this. When I was a teen and convinced the Illuminati existed, she explained it was complete bullshit. Now, all she talks about is how said celebrity is a pedophile, or that the Lunar Landing never happened, Trump is doing good, she's convinced that New York's Central Park had a tunnel underneath with over, and I quote this, ""500,000 malnourished children that were in cages"", or about the supposed vampires that are torturing these children for Adrenochrome. She says Elon Musk is a psychopath that wants to control the world with NeuralLink. I can't say much about that last one haha

I think of these stories as ""fake news"". They are ridiculous, stupid, and absolutely stupid. But she believes in them and that scares me. In the last year (I swear, she's a complete different person), she's become an anti-vaxx, believes Covid-19 is a sham but still wears a mask when needed. She still hasn't anwsered me on if she believes the Earth is flat but she sends jokes my way which are leading me to think that she does.

We've gotten into arguments aggressively about all of this. I'm scared for her well being, maybe it's the age that's factoring in on her mind but she's only 46. My sister (her younger daughter) has asked me to just play along and not give my opinion. I thought to do this but since I'm the only US citizen in this household (we don't live in the US), she now tells me that I must vote for Trump or she'll be pissed at me. And you know what? I said no. Fuck that, I don't even want to vote. But at the same time, I feel that if it's her health that is being compromised and that's the reason behind her sudden change in beliefs and behavior, then maybe I can just go along with it.

597,"It wasn’t my dog, but my boyfriends sweet chihuahua. We had our ups and downs over the last two years but I loved that little dog. I wasn’t supposed to be in the room but last minute my boyfriend decided he wanted me there. I saw the dog die and I feel like I’m re-experiencing trauma and I don’t know how to cope with it. I can’t get the images of the dog dying out of my mind. 

The trauma I think I must be re-experiencing is that of my brother dying. When I was 15, I almost found him. Luckily, I did not see him but I was the one who knocked on his door with no answer and I heard the panic of my parents when they found him. I’m now 24 but it’s still so traumatic. I had nightmares for years in which he would be dead but reanimated; like a horrible horror film. I couldn’t watch zombie movies because of those nightmares. And now seeing this animal die, I keep feeling the old panic. 

I have no idea how to cope with this. I feel like I can’t tell my boyfriend the full extent because he lost his dog of 13 years. It’s much more emotional and I feel guilty bringing it up.

He wouldn’t stop telling me he wants to be friends he said it over and over again which made me so confused. I think he wants me in his life but no at the same time. But I’m not sure why he wants me to be his friend after he deleted me so many times and was a boring jerk. So fast forward to now I asked him if he could do me a favor. I wanted him to sure. So I can say “okay go to the door and come back with a better attitude” but it didn’t go so well since he didn’t want to do it. And the favor could’ve been something else but he didn’t even wanna do that. And I sent him a message saying thank you and I said text back when you can. All I said was that he didn’t even say yw he just read it and gave me one word. I don’t know what’s going on but he definitely changed again. 

And now he hasn’t replied to my snaps In 3 days. I was getting annoyed and was about to delete him. He told me that his snap got hacked. So we are texting on another app now. He never texts me first. And it’s very annoying  cuz we can go 2 weeks if I stop texting he will never text first. I’m not worrying about him as much since I met new people. And he is probably doing the same but he never stepped up his game at all. When he didn’t text me those 3 days I said to him I thought we werent friends anymore he didn’t wanna text me and he said “lol nah” I don’t believe that.

601,"So I can better illustrate what I'm talking about, I will tell some of the latest happenings. About two months ago, stil during quarantine, my sister, whose initial is E, wanted to move out. Yes, during quarantine. She found an online apartment ad that was profitable, but middle crisis specially, you would never want to move out from a three bedrooms, 100 square meters house and where our mother works to a clustered apartment during quarantine. Well, on that week, she invited me to run errands. Before we went out, she praised for the first time one of the drawings I posted (the worse one btw). 

You know how manipulative people can be eloquent and likeable, and on our way downtown, I had the impression things were fine and that I was having fun. Just chilling. I was happy at how our family was getting along, because turbulent times between me and E and E and my mom always happen, periodically. Then we walked down a street by the end of the course, and that was when she began to manipulate me (and despite being hard to recognize you are being manipulated, I remember how sure I was the day it happened).

Basically she began to go off about how we should move out. She talked about how our mom spends too many money on reforming our house (which she does not), how she's ""emotionally attached to it"" and it would do good for her to move out, how our mom doesn't know how to manage her money because, according to E, she could afford an apartment that's worth 6,5k dolars in the USA if she stopped spending on the house (except she doesn't, she spends money on bills lol). She also said our neighbours harm our honour, embarass us and my mom lets it. I didn't say anything. I didn't want to fight, I was happy to get along. Then she told me to take a position in a way that I remember as being cynical, as if I was too lenient about life and I could never stand up to our mother or something. But that's just my pov, I guess. So I explained we can't move out now, nor we should. Althought, yes, I was almost divided between thinking we should, and at some point I even said ""I know it'd be good, but we can't"". Then the mood dropped, I became of course tense, and she knew that, because she kept reformulating her points using emotional links like how our mom is emotionally attached to our house because of childhood trauma, that it wasn't her fault but we should do something about it, move on (she was talking about the fact my mother's parent died years ago, and that recently, other loved person died tragically). No, she isn't attached. We just can't move out.

I kept explaining that we can't. She said again that our mom doesn't know how to manage money. We got home. That day I told my mom about my sister thinking she can't manage her money. E has already said that directly to my mom (passive-agressively). I don't think this of mine attitude (""snitching"") was actually wrong, and I'll talk about that. 

My mom then argued with her about money management, so later E texted me very agressively, swearing at me for snitching, said she was venting to me (I think she wasn't venting, but manipulating me into agreeing with her so we convinced our mom), that I didn't have the right to do that, that she would never do anything for me again. I was fucking unsettled. Everything was good, she didn't have to bring that up in the first place and make me disagree with her. I hate to argue through text, and even if I was wrong for ""snitching"", she didn't have to right to swear at me and disrespect me because I didn't do that to her. Well, we argued. I said I wouldn't talk to her if she kept disrespecting me because it was stressful. She was driving me mad like it was nothing. I blocked her. She went to a family group and kept urging me to argue, and when I answered to tell her to stop, she was like ""but it's you who keeps answering"". That's just to illustrate how she uses my insecurities (she called me immature for ex) to get me to be mad and make me think I'm wrong for being mad. I remember feeling terrible and that's not the first time it happened. That happens periodically, but I never recognized as emotional manipulation because I always thought I was to blame. Reading this, it may seem like so, idk, but if you went through emotional manipulation, you will understand it. My mom has gone through the same thing with our father and her own sister. She agrees with me that E is manipulative, but in a mom kinda way.

605,"I already posted this elsewhere, because it might be more suited to a philosophical space, but I deemed that it’d also be pretty effective to place it here, considering it regards ethics, and there seems to be a lot of people who are well-studied on the subject here, or at least passionate enough about the subject of ethics to form a more solid opinion than me. 

It almost feels too discussion based and hypothetical, but idk where else to go with this one, so... get ready for a long and complex one.

This is a bit of a scary one, and not one that I can agree with, but also one that I cannot challenge. It is the idea of human supremacy Vs. Hedonism/Compassion.
So, let me preface it by saying that I think that Hedonism, as it originally was conceived, prioritized maximizing happiness for both yourself and those around you. This could mean sacrificing short term pleasure for long term pleasure or sacrificing your own pleasure for the greater good. 

This is just my interpretation and it could very well be flawed, so feel free to correct me! I’m new to the concept and I may be describing an entirely different philosophy or making up my own for all I know. Now, here’s where this gets tricky and complex. I am of the belief that compassion, at least from my point of view, should be consistently applied to all living things, not just humans. However, if we apply this line of reasoning in real life, it actually creates many logical inconsistencies that no sane human being would agree with. For example, my family eats meat. Let’s say I convert to veganism so that I prevent the formation of new animals, therefore preventing their suffering. My family is still eating meat. For the sake of argument, my position would encourage the elimination of my family for eating meat, no? 

They experience some pleasure, but the amount of pain they introduce seems to outweigh that pleasure. However, if we use deductive reasoning and instead work backwards, saying that every human being’s life, at least in a moderate society, is worth preserving, than my family takes precedence here. In turn, animals would have to be seen as inherently less valuable than humans for this to work. I might mot be explaining my logic very well and I may have a number of fallacies, but it seems like to me, in order for me to justify the reason for siding with my family, I’d have to either accept individual freedom as an insanely high value that allows for evil, even if that evil (suffering/harm) is in excess or outweighs the good, or I would have to simply value human life over animal life. I think it’s fair to say that anyone would agree a human life in and of itself does not necessarily equal or exceed an animal life. But a human life that is “good” or compassionate should not be exchanged, under most circumstances, for an animal that is also relatively harmless. This has led me to the conclusion that human life is inherently more valuable in terms of experience, much in the same way a library outweighs a sentence or a letter in terms of knowledge. 
Ergo, we allow ourselves to kill an insect because killing an insect is the same as erasing a letter or word, but killing a human would be like burning an entire memoir from history. But, that being said, if we prioritize the alleviation of suffering, then it almost seems to promote extinction on a large scale. How can we quantify suffering and pleasure in such a way that allows my family to live whilst also allowing them to eat meat? We could say probability means that their individual influence is to weak to raise demand, so letting them continue is harmless, but the chances seem a bit too high that they won’t at least produce one animal that will embody a life of suffering. Should we then quantify it, saying that the temporary nature of the animal’s existence is equal to, say, 2 months worth of suffering, and as such, the human life pf pleasure is still worth too much to exchange? Or, could we again use probability to further state that the animal’s life may be filled with a lot of pain occasionally, but not every single animal farmed automatically has a “worthless” life. Ergo, their lives still have enough value to them to be considered precious or worthwhile, at least occasionally. For instance, some chickens or cows produced by the industry are suffering, but not every single one. And, even the ones that are have an overall “content” life. Therefore, yes we should be providing them a more ideal life, but their lives still add more good experience than bad. Perhaps their lives are of a poor condition but not a condition that leads to a negative value. All these things seemed like fascinating and horrific possibilities to consider and they really challenged my concept of compassion. 

We need to fulfill certain desires such as freedom to maximize happiness, and we need to extend our compassion to both ourselves and our surroundings. We also need to prioritize short terms suffering in exchange for more rewarding happiness later down the road. If it were up to me, I would simply illegalize these types of farming methods so that humans that needed the meat (assuming that some still do) could eat from it while animals continue to thrive with some freedom exchanged for security on both sides. But, due to my limitations, my potential only seems to go far enough to encompass myself. The people that surround me are effectively out of my jurisdiction if I can’t successfully persuade them. Would this make them a necessary evil under my logic or something that deserves to be erased? It is a tough question for me to answer.

On a purely emotional basis, my gut instinct says my family’s life takes precedence over an animal’s suffering. Even just one of their entire lives is highly valuable over an animal that suffers temporarily. But, there does seem to be some inconsistency here. I mean, the animal lives for 2 whole months and then dies. It’s entire life could be filled with suffering. That makes it seem as though my family is a group of straight up Hitlers that have each caused countless Hellscapes for other living beings, to put it in a very dramatic way. Should I rest my case on simple probability winning this one? Am I looking for depth where there is none? Did I possibly overthink things and miss some important or significant components?
Please, any interesting or informative takes are appreciated, the floor is open.",03Jul2020,0
606,"After everything came out in the open, my father left my aunt and my parents got married. Needless to say this caused a big riff in the family. My mother's side of the family cut her off completely and haven't spoken to her since, 23 years ago. I was appalled, devastated, furious, you name it. When I confronted my parents about it, they tried in vain to justify their behavior. I kept hearing things like they were in love and they couldn't control their feelings. I got into a heated argument with my mother, calling her a homewrecker, among other things. I did the same with my father. I haven't spoken to them in nearly 4 months. I tried reaching out to my mother's family to no avail. I also tried reaching out to my mother's sister, but she cursed me out and told me to leave her alone and I'm probably just like my mother. I also found out that my mother's sister is terminally ill and has less that 6 months to live. Looking back at my life a lot of things now make sense. Why we never spent time with my mother's family was always something that my parents wouldn't discuss (I thought mom had no family). I sometimes saw my mother crying on during the holidays and on Mother's Day. But that doesn't excuse what was done. I can't look at my parents. I don't know if I'll ever get past these feelings of hurt, confusion, anger, and betrayal that I have. I also am heartbroken that my aunts last few months are going to be spent bitter and angry.

607,"I’m having a small get together in 5 days and i initially had invited this friend, but he recently went on a week long trip to Massachusetts with some other friends and just got back yesterday. He rode public transport and visited other public places and stayed in a family members beach house, and in his pictures he wasn’t wearing a mask. All of my other guests and myself have been in isolation for 1- 2 weeks or more prior to the date, except for this guest. If he were to have Covid, I would put my family at risk (and I’m living with my grandma and 2 month old cousin who are especially at risk), as well as my guests and their families. Also, this friend is also throwing a small pool party in 2 days (with the same guests as mine) and I feel unsafe going to his party because of this. 

Out of concern for my family and guests, I was thinking of uninviting him to my party and not going to his party. I feel bad doing this though since he is one of my closest friends and some of the other guests don’t think that going to this party would be unsafe. Also, I don’t think he would have gone on this trip unless his parents (both of who are doctors) were sure that it was safe as he also lives with someone who is immunocompromised, and I don’t think he would want to put them in danger. As far as I know, he hasn’t gotten tested for COVID (I am unsure of this though). What should I do?

608,"Cut my mom off last night but I may have overreacted!!

So me and my mom have some rocky history, we are not really all that close and we fall out a lot but I always end up forgiving her. This time I’m not sure if I want to, recently she has been struggling and me (20F)and my younger sister(19F) have been helping her. We don’t have the best jobs rn but we work fucking hard but she dips in to both of us and has probably racked around 2000 from both of us. I’ve been trying to help her less cause  trying to save up to get an apartment, so every bit counts. But that means she’s taking from my sister more... it’s been bothering both of us, especially me because Ik what she’s doing with it. My mom has a long history with drug abuse, all my life since the day I was born it had been a problem. I do not believe that after 20 years.. she was able to quit her habit cold turkey. My aunt revealed to me that she was still getting high, and with how frequently she asks us for money I believe it. She may be able to fool my sister who just chooses to ignore it or act gullible but she does not fool me. I’ve confronted her many times but she always say she doesn’t do it anymore. 

The reason why I cut her off is this time , she calls me while I’m at work and says my aunt is gonna send me 20 bucks for her, I told her I was busy at work and it will have to wait, she insists that I do it now and she’s on her way. When she arrives I tell her to just take me card and take the money out and I’ll worry about getting it from my aunt later. She drinks the card back but it wasn’t till later that I discover that she took more than what she was supposed to. She normally asks for 20 bucks but she took 40 instead, I was livid and pissed off, I texted her and I went off on her. It’s only 40 bucks but it was my money and who knows what o could have needed it for, I moved money from my savings to be able to help her out. I may be overreacting but to me it’s a trust things, I give me card and you run off with it and you take more money from me than you said you would. I’ve already given her 140 just this month alone. 

She’s supposed to be getting a good amount of money in a couple days and she said she would give me a little bit out of it and my sister, a lousy ass bit compared to what she’s receiving. I never believed this, my mom doesn’t just give money away. I told her to keep her money and that I would no longer be helping her, and I blocked her.

I realized that I do this because it gives me release and pleasure. I started eating too much fast food when my parents started beating me. How can I lose weight and keep like that? Like a long term?

F asked M if they could speak in person and M said no but F showed up to his home anyway. F was talking to M through a cracked door since he did not want her to come in and F decided to continue to try to come in. F was pushed to the ground as she continued to enter and got a scrape on her knee. She told me this happened as I was at my work shift and I had nothing to say but that was extremely sad but I really had to go to work and let me know if anything was needed after. Months go by and I talk to neither until F needs a place to stay and I allow her to no issue doesn’t bother me at all. As she’s staying there she sees an old photo of me and M that I reposted on Instagram because it has a bunch of old friends and I was home sick. She then begins to yell at me, ultimately leaving my home and blocking me on everything because I had this photo with him despite what happened between the two. At the time I didn’t think it involved me at all and it was petty drama especially for adults. After educating myself I see how wrong I was for turning that eye. I tried to reach out and was given no response. The guilt still eats away at me what should I do?

Ok so I’m 16 and I really have no problem talking to guys/friends. But I seem to find it hard to make girl friends. Like I just don’t ever initiate a conversation with a girl whereas if its a guy I’m pretty chill about it and it is very easy to make guy friends. But when it’s a girl I just fall flat. Except when they initiate I am very open and it flows naturally. I want to clarify that I don’t want to do this for a relationship I just want to be a better person and more confident.

The only thing that your family looka while arranging ypur marriage is the financial stability of the guy. I can't do this. I can't marry someone with whom I don't even have a connection. How do they expect me to be intimate with him? And furthermore i don't want to get married right now. But people around me are telling me that if i don't get married soon then I will be too old and will not find suitable prospects. I really like the western take on relationships and marriage. I am jusy expected to marry a random guy and life after marriage in Pakistan sucks. The hisband and wife share no special bond. They don't have a relationship.

We were at a Party and when we were talking there was just this feeling I had with her that I haven’t had with anyone in a very long time.

I know I am going to get a lot of hate for this, but I am in a relationship with a separate girl, and we’ve been together for 2 years now. It sucks because I do want to love my girlfriend but it’s so hard because she doesn’t make me feel appreciated and puts other men above me.

She didn’t want to go to far because someone else was in the room as well. I don’t know what to do anymore. It just sucks because I really like this new girl and have a great feeling about her.

627,"I've never admitted it out loud but I really think I have depression. It got worse now that we're in a lockdown. My line of work involves being in a hospital laboratory and collecting swab samples for the covid test by going to each patient's room.

Most of my closest friends that I work with are now quitting because of the low pay, long hours and heavy workload. Anyway, all the people that's left working with me are the people who don't really put in much at work. Since collecting samples is of course scary and very tiring, my other coworkers, who I don't interact much, do not do it and expect me and two others to do all the work while they stay comfortably inside the laboratory.  

I've been very unhappy these past couple of months and have many anxiety attacks prior to working, knowing that I will be together with these group of people almost everyday. They don't talk to me much. I have felt many times that they brush me off, and they are always on their phones watching netflix.

What bothers me the most is change. My closest coworkers leaving really changed my working environment and it's making me dread going to work everyday.  I don't talk that much at work now because they don't initiate conversation and I'm tired of trying. I don't feel like myself. I feel caged in and depressed, it got so bad for me that I locked myself in the restroom many times just so I could calm myself down.

630,"I work for a large European IT company as an IT specialist. At my specific office we are a couple of hundred employees, most of them working in house with different administrative tasks. Of course I count them as my colleagues, but in this case this matter is only about my department and my closest colleagues.

In my department we are about 20 IT specialists working with the company's core business regarding various IT services towards business customers (B2B). Not always, but often we work directly with the customer's CIO, IT-board or other executive and strategic roles.

My problem is that I find that the majority of my co-workers dress very poorly, both when in office, but also when meeting customers. Of course, the IT world is not like the bank world where you always have to where a full suit and tie, but there are some kind of expected standard after all.

My company has a very vague dress code. In fact the only thing written down officially is that you have to look clean and appropriate. And that shorts, hats/caps and team jerseys are not allowed. Maybe I should just accept it and move on then? Actually, I think not. I mean, I think that out of respect for our customers, and to keep our perceived role as trusted advisors, we have to at least have some sort of standard regarding how we look.

Often some of my co-workers when being in the office are wearing shorts, a washed out T-shirt and sometimes even Crocs. You may think that this isn't a problem. Well yes it is. It is not uncommon that customers visit us, and because of the reasons stated in the paragraph above I find this problematic. A worse example from not too long ago is when I had planned a meeting with a relatively new customer's IT boss to evaluate new business possibilities. For this I invited a colleague of mine who has a specific competence we needed for the meeting. He shows up at the customers HQ in ill-fitting jeans and wait for it... a blue T-shirt with Nyan cat on it. This whilst me and the IT boss were wearing business casual clothing (buttoned shirt, dress trousers/pants and smart shoes). Embarrassing to say the least.

I respect that people have different standards but sometimes that does not matter. I somewhere read from a business etiquette expert that one should not wear what personally feels comfortable or nice, but what is expected by others. I find this to be a good rule of thumb. I wouldn't even care about this if we were working for say a software development company where it is common to dress in whatever suits whoever, but we are not.

*The question:* How do I tackle this? I like my colleagues very much, except this very problem, and I don't want to hurt their feelings and seem like a know-it-all or even a bully. I don't feel like talking to my boss, who by the way dresses very well, is the right way to go either.

I get that many of you by now think that I am being ridiculous, and should mind my own business, but please try to understand my view of this. What would you do?

TL;DR: My co-workers dress very poorly and it makes me/us look like fools. How do I change this?",03Jul2020,1
631,"Some background for starters: Last month I started a new job as an administrative assistant at a small business. It's been my first steady, stable job after a long time alternating between temping, going to school, and being unemployed, and I'm really proud of it. I work directly under one of three partners who run the company. He's a nice person, but I have several complaints.

* First of all, I don't like his management style at all-- often when I'm taking care of paperwork for him he won't give me all the information I need, then leave for a meeting or to see a client or take care of some other business, and I will have to wait until he's available and ask him to fill me in.

* Second of all he's not a very good communicator. When I do get more explicit instructions it tends to be in the form of a lengthy lecture in which he has a tendency to get off-topic and during which he never pauses for long enough for me to ask follow-up questions.

* Thirdly his politics make me... a little uncomfortable. By the standards of my country I'm pretty far to the left of most people, and I accept that I'm not likely to find a boss who matches all my tendencies, but my boss is, from what I can tell from his opinions, which he tends to expound on at great length in the aforementioned rambling lectures, some sort of moderate conservative or libertarian, and the nature of our work means that I am alternating between helping causes I support very strongly (disability rights, for instance) and causes that make me... uncomfortable, at best (we've attempted to sue a local government official over their response to COVID-19 being too heavy-handed for his liking.)

* Lastly, and this is the big one, as of today I'm a week behind on getting paid. Now I do believe there are a few extenuating circumstances here and I'm okay weathering that as long as I get paid soon and regularly afterwards, but as you can imagine, it's made the start of the month a little scarier than it should be. When I spoke to him last he said he was headed to the bank to attempt to get it taken care of, but as of this morning I haven't seen a paystub or any new money in my bank account.

Despite all these misgivings I've done my very best to be respectful and professional, at least to his face, and he seems to like me very much.

Now, onto the actual situation. As I mentioned before the company I work for has seen a lot of shakeups. In the time since I started working, we've hired and fired several people, our CFO nearly left the company, and we've had no less than two clients that have had to be sued for non-payment. My boss, who as I mentioned is one of three partners in the company, seems to have borne much of the blame from the other two, as on Wednesday they approached him with a hostile takeover. He accepted the buyout in return for being allowed to take full control of another business, a nonprofit, that the three of them also ran.

Yesterday morning he called me with this news and gave me an offer to come with him and be his assistant there instead. If I do so I would receive a substantial raise (we're talking from about $28,000 USD a year to about $40,000) and a little bit busier of a job. He says he offered this in part because he thinks that the other partners may fire me if they're feeling vindictive towards him.

Should I take the offer? Can I trust him? Or, on Monday, should I go to my new bosses, come clean about my frustrations with him, and hope that it'll get them on my side? I really don't want to hurt my boss's feelings but I think it's most important that I do what's best for me.",03Jul2020,1

A lot of the leading AI companies are based in the US. I'm interested in places like NYC &amp; California, there's just so much to discover!  

Of course I'm going to finish my undergrad here and I'm still thinking of where to go for my master's, *if* I do it. 

It's not about money. It's about opening as many doors as I can to ensure my future is secure and I am happy. I don't dear the unknown, it sort of excites me -- I love learning and improving. 

But I'm not stupid. I know many people have this pipe dream and think America is heaven for those who want to be 'successful'. I know that's not true for every.  America is scary and very different to the UK (with healthcare, housing, education, work life). 

I know there's a lot going on in the US right now. But I'm thinking about 4-5 years in the future.

639,"I (20m) have been dating my girlfriend (19f) for about 5 weeks now. We have been spending a lot of nights with each other and we have already started saying ""I love you"" to each other. 

The only problem is, I have recently come to realize my girlfriend is a child, and I mean that in the most respectful way possible.

When I first got to meet her I realized she suffers from anxiety and depression, same as me and most of the people I know. No big deal. However, I have recently come up with a theory that she also suffers from PTSD. All her life she was verbally and physically abused by her shitty parents who are now dead, and I believe that has lead to her becoming an adult child. 

Most of the time she talks like a little kid (the same way adults talk when they see a baby or a puppy) and the smallest things make her cry. She also has trouble facing adult problems on her own (problems with her roommates, her work, etc..)

I really love her, but I don't know if I can take basically being her parent. I also don't know if I'm just being paranoid or what, as I already know I have a past with commitment issues.

She is supposed to start seeing a therapist in about a month so I'm hopeful that things can start getting better from there. I don't know how long it's going to take though. I know that it took me a while to start getting better, and my problems were not half as big as hers. I just don't want to be staying and getting closer to her if I should be leaving or leave a person I love, break both of our hearts and regret it later.

641,"Hi all - so as you read this please keep in mind that my rational mind knows I am overreacting but I please need to hear from other people to help calm me down. I have written down my reasons for being able to remain calm, like I usually do when I’m stuck in an anxiety loop, but reading the list has not helped.

So I have taken our current coronavirus situation pretty hard... have been in lockdown since mid-March, get everything delivered and do grocery pick ups. I live alone and thankfully have been able to work from home so isolation has been easy. Paranoia is fairly common for me, harder to talk down when a rampant virus is real and not a figment of my imagination.

I usually take out the trash and grab mail from outside in a mask then wash my hands before mask removal. I don’t know why I didn’t do that this morning but I took out the trash maybe at 5 am without a mask, didn’t expect to see anybody. I tried to go in a different door but realized I left it locked so walked around to go in the back. 

As I’m coming out our little area, I see a woman about 10 feet away (give or take, I have spatial issues but I know it was at very minimum 6 ft) walking her dog without a mask. She’s to the left of me so I didn’t have to pass her I just turned right and headed to my back yard/door. She kept walking my way but still remained 6 ft away minimum at all times.

I KNOW risk is super super low but I can’t stop thinking about it. PLEASE HELP - is this the right sub for this?

EDIT: I should add I’m in a state with insanely high positive rates currently which is fueling my paranoia. I like to act like everyone has it, which has helped me take precautions but hurts me when something like this happens or when I can’t leave a package outside for 24 hours or whatever. I am working on this since I know it’s a bigger thing related to my anxiety but just need a little calm confidence boost right now.....

Backstory: So me and this girl, lets call her A, were classmate in grade 7 and 8. The peak of our friendship were grade 8 when we both got our own crushes. We will always talk and all. Her crush was a friend of mine and my crush was a friend of her.

In grade 9 we even barely talk and when we pass each other in hallways we will just kinda smile and wave at each other.

I never had intercourse, just making out &amp; oral sex performed on them. 3 of them occurred in my dorm room setting. 4 of them occurred in a dark vehicle. As of now, I have asked 5/7 of the boys, if they recorded me; they said NO but they could COMPLETELY be lying.. (I know their full names so I can always sue them if they try to expose me). I am not in any contact with 2 guys in the vehicle, but it was extremely dark when everything happened. 

When I was in high school, I used to send nude butt pictures (pretty dark still) with my face covered. I talked to the guys I sent them to, and they said they do not have them nor distributed them (BUT THEY COULD BE LYING.) I am a transgender female, so in high school, my hair was shorter than it is now, which might a reason why someone would not be able to identify me. 

Truthfully, I've thought of ending my life over this the past week or so, because if something gets out there, I will forever be scared &amp; depressed. I regret hooking up like crazy in my first year. I have become EXTREMELY paranoid that the men I hooked up with DID record me (even in the dark, what if there was a hidden camera that had night vision in the car somewhere installed in the back seat)! 

I'm praying to GOD that the boys I've contacted are telling me the truth about them not recording me. I'm very glad that I wasn't naked in them, but still. I feel extremely guilty &amp; disgusting for doing what I did. 

Summary of my situation:

\- scared of these men recording me, even though 5/7 said they did not ( I wasn't naked in any of my hookups, but still I'm scared )

646,"I have a friend, a very very close friend. Her and I met in middle school, and why she stayed friends with me I honestly don’t know. I was insane and loud and just overall obnoxious. After middle school she moved states and of course I was bummed. She did visit where I was a couple times but that was about it. Her and I talked every day for hours on end. She was always there for me and vise versa. We shared about everything with each other, feelings about things, likes and dislikes of stuff. Complained and venting to one another and she gave good advice. She is very smart, and when we were sophomores (at different schools of course) she was half in college and half in high school. I admired her so much, I still really don’t understand why she ever wanted to stay friends. I just got done with my Junior year, and it was rough. So were the previous years, but rough nonetheless. We still talked of course. Also keep in mind we would say things like “i love you” and more things like that multiple times a day. Of course I knew it was as friends. But, that’s where the problem is for me. I’m very happy to have had her as a friend, I cared about her and I supported her. I was not going to just let go of a friendship like that. It was 4 years of a strong relationship. 

What the problem is, and I know what most people say, since I’m young I don’t really experience “real love” and it’s just crushes and stuff. I can tell you that if course I’ve had crushes. This was not the same. End of 7th grade we met and became friends. 8th grade came by and we talked a lot with the rest of the friend group. Summer comes and we still text. 9th grade/freshmen year, I start thinking about her, and how I miss her and seeing her at lunch. Near the end of 9th grade it hits me that I had feelings for her. Like a genuine love for her. It was nothing cheeky, or anything like that, but it also was not just a sisterly love. I was /in love/ with her. Summer comes by again and it was alright, hung out with some people. Still thought of her. Then again came school, 10th/sophomore year. We won’t go into that whole year, a ton of other things happened that broke me to bits. I didn’t think too much about her, only because I was distracting myself with a boy. When I realized I was in love with this girl I started denying it. ‘You’re not gay, you don’t like girls!’ I said those things to myself. But I knew i was lying to myself. I was extremely confused on my sexual orientation and I felt uncomfortable talking about it with anyone. Except for, you guessed it, her, and one other person. I always joked about not liking guys and how pretty girls are to people, including this girl. She would joke as well, expressing how she did not like guys. I took nothing personal of it, of course. I didn’t expect her to get my ‘hints’, because half the time I wasn’t trying to throw them out, and they usually just slipped out of my mouth. My feeling never faded, even when I dated this boy, I was thinking of her. I eventually had to end that relationship. 

Her and I continue talking every day, about little things, usually. But even though the subjects were minor things, everything she said meant a lot to me. And I am aware that this sounds creepy, and possibly even obsessive, but I can honestly tell you it isn’t. I kept my space. I waited until she talked to me most of the time, I never double texted, and whenever I stepped out of line she would tell me and I’d apologize and we’d go back to the conversation. It was a perfectly mutual friendship, where we both got along and supported each other. I never brought up her person life or anything rude like that. Neither did she. 

I wanted to tell her I loved her. I loved her so damn much and I wanted nothing more than to tell her how I truly felt. I didn’t want to loser her, though, so I’ve never said anything and it kills me.

So I guess that brings me to where I am now. Summer after 11th/junior year. Around early May, it was like every other day. We were texting each other and after I texted her back about whatever we were talking about, she never responded. And that’s that. I haven’t spoken to her since. Not my choice by any means, I loved talking to her. I just don’t know what I did or didn’t do. She was never someone to do something like this, so I knew something was wrong. Of course I’ve googled different things, but nothing gives me the answer I need, since of course there’s no really specific thing I can google about the situation. Trust me, I’ve tried everything. And I can honestly say I have nobody to go to. My parents are homophobic. Not blatantly, but they clearly aren’t too happy about anyone who isn’t straight. That goes for the rest of my relatives as well, except for my sister, but I really don’t want to talk about it with her. I have a few close friends who I talk with every day with and I love them both very much. But none of them would know this girl, as we were not is the same friend group in middle school. I can’t express how much it hurts me. It stupid and I’m aware of that. It’s only been about two months but I know I had to have done something wrong, or she must have gotton hurt or something. 

I know most of this didn’t make sense and was a bit of a ramble but I’m just grasping for any answers at this point as to why this happened, and why does it hurt me so much. If anyone has anything to say or advice or anything else please let me know. I’m sorry.",03Jul2020,1
647,"Is it normal that if your father moves to Belgium with your half brothers (who I only saw maybe 5 times) after a long time away abroad that you don't feel like any connection to them anymore?

My father (divorced my mother and married his secretary) moved away when I was maybe six, before that he wasn't even in my country all year, only maybe 3 months per year.

After that I went on vacation in Ethiopia maybe three times, I stayed in his house, the last time I met his sons (my half brothers), he would also come to my country every year (for a few days, for his job), but sometimes we would meet and sometimes not.

Now he is moving his family behind my street corner, his Job in Ethiopia stopped, so he needs to find a new job here, to support his wife and children.

I don't know how to feel, i'm an adult (woman) now, live by myself, and they want to be all familiar with me.

Am I arrogant and should I be thankful for them moving to Belgium after all this time?

&amp;#x200B;

One of my friends has been dealing with depression for 2 years or more now and I've been trying to help him the whole time. I gave him advice on how to get over his feelings for the girl that left him, helped him with his CV, listened to him talking about his problems every time he would need to talk...

&amp;#x200B;

But now I'm just lost.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago he had problems over his car insurance, he told me that his bank was blocking the payment even though he had the funds. I spoke with his father about it and he told me that it's extremely unlikely that he had the funds to pay...So now he doesn't have car insurance, is unemployed, every other friend he had left him because he kept lying over and over again over everything and now the more time passes the more he's at risk of becoming homeless. Another friend and I are beginning to doubt about everything he tells us. That other friend is considering leaving him...But I don't...I just can't.

&amp;#x200B;

I suffered from loneliness pretty much my whole life so I just can't let a friend down.

We're going to see him in August, and right now I feel like my only option is to just to beat him on the ground to make him come back to Earth...I know it's not really a good idea, but good or bad it's the only option I can think of. I just want him to realize that he's running his life to the ground, below it in fact...

651,"I'm a 20yo male. Last night I decided to visit the dregs of the internet for the first time in a long while; Omegle. Met a girl who requested we continue our convo on Google hangouts. Like an idiot, I used my actual Google account. Things got sexual but I got uncomfortable cuz she seemed off, so I ended the call. I made up some excuse about my phone not working. immediately afterwards she tells me that our conversation was recorded and that she would send the video to all of my facebook friends if I didn't pay 400 dollars. They followed this y sending the video and a screenshot of my facebook profile. I panicked and decided to pay the money. of course then more money was demanded. I decided to call the police and managed to stall paying again until I met with an officer on the street outside my house. I ended up paying another 300 for the video to be deleted from the perpetrator's computer, and then they demanded more for it to be deleted from a flash drive. I told them I had sent all of my money already (which was true, I have 9 bucks in my bank account now). In the end the officer told me there was not much he could do, as I had figured out that the perpetrators were based in the Philippines. I figured that would be the case. By about 3:30 am (this had started at midnight) the perpetrator just told me to f\*ck off. So far none of my family has contacted me about receiving a video, it's 9 am now.

NY, New York— My company asked me to return to work after being furloughed for the last two months. When they talked to me over the phone, they said my salary would be reduce and the HR guy would email me. 


He never sent me an email. My manager messaged me this morning confirming that I will be there on Monday...

Shouldn’t I have gotten a letter with the new terms? And have the option to negotiate? 

I was waiting for the letter because I don’t even know if I survive on a reduced salary. I’m also signed up for a class and was going to see if I could work part time.

so for context my aunt (well call her n) has always had a dislike for me. it’s just always been there, never didn’t anything to her she’s just always had a grudge against me (my mom thinks that’s it’s because n didn’t have a girl like she wanted and instead got 2 boys). 

my mom goes back and forth, one day she’ll be saying “well n doesn’t that with everyone” and other days she’ll be like “yea n doesn’t treat you a bit different.” it’s honestly so fucking frustrating. 

so when i was 14 (after a visit we had) i said to her on our way back (n and my 2 cousins live about a 12 hr drive from us) that i want gonna go there for a while, and so she said okay, keep in mind i perfused my distaste from the way n was treating me. 

so then she comes TO OUR HOUSE for a whole 2 fucking weeks with my younger cousin (m10) my other cousins (m22) stayed home.  it was all fine and good but i has told her before that i didn’t want to see them but they came anyways. she says what i’m being difficult for not going, but i still thing i being totally god dam reasonable. 


then, (this summer) my mom said that we should go to my aunts house this summer i say no and she starting going off at me on how i never want to see family, well i’m sorry but again, i don’t wanna see her if she’s gonna be like that to me. 

so then they make an arrangement when my mom is gonna fly to n’s house. so all fine and good, but then my mom tells me that n said that maybe i should “get tested for autism” because apparently according to my mom “i never leave the house” which is just untrue. i don’t have a lot of friends but that’s because i’m switching schools and kinda had a big drama happen at my old school that made me loose my friend group that i don’t wanna get into as it does not relate to the story.

I’m starting to notice some weird residue on the shower walls after he’s done in there (or maybe I’m crazy)?? I don’t know if it’s sexual? Do you think his “joke” is just to gauge my reaction in order to decide if he wants to be honest with me about this strange possible fetish? How do I even approach him about this?

Other hints are I always hear the shower when he going to 'use the bathroom' and whenever I'm cleaning the shower floor there are nasty vapors coming from the drainage.

675,"I'm a F, 25, so is my friend.


She used to be the awesome, independent chick. Really fun, confident, positive. Her only negative trait was she was judgey... She was very quick to accuse women who were looking for boyfriends (not desperately, just being on dating apps etc.) as desperate and pathetic. She accused me of ""not being able to be alone"" when I went from one relationship to another quite quickly. This wasn't the case at all. She overall had a very lowly opinion of wanting romance. 

I used to be quite a mess and she was there for me. She really did a lot, she listened to me, gave me advice, taught me some coping mechanisms her therapist taught her. She was truly an amazing friend at the time. 

Unless when it came to men, all I got from her when I broke up with an ex was a ""I told you he was an idiot"". She said it was ""tough love"" but it really wasn't. It was pretty shitty of her.

Then she got a boyfriend herself. The guy had a very public history of bad relationships. Yet she ignored that despite warnings. They broke up several months ago and she was absolutely devastated which is understandable. 

I stood by her, I talked to her on phone (couldn't do it in person because of strict quarantine), texted her constantly, tried to do anything to make her feel better. Nothing helped, she shut every idea down, even yelled at me because nothing I said was ok... If I was positive, I was overly optimistic. If I was sad, I depressed her even more. If I was quiet, I was useless. 

It's been a downwards spiral since then. She became everything she made fun of before... Desperate, she straight up refuses to move on, she drinks way too much, she's incredibly negative to be around and she can't stand to be alone for a minute. She's hanging out with and sucking up to people she talked shit about before just so she isn't alone. Pretty much everyone is tired if her, she brings everyone down. She also refuses to deal with her breakup still. It's good to have distractions but you still have to go over and face whatever is troubling you. 

Now don't get me wrong, I know what it's like to be depressed. I know what it's like to go through a horrific breakup. I know what it's like to be at the lowest of the lows. I do, I was there. But I have never ever seen anyone act like her, nor have I done it myself. 

She's trying so hard to turn anything positive into negative. Dismissing everyone as if we're all idiots, she never does anything wrong, always victimizes herself. And the latest - humiliating people. To put it shortly - a group of friends had a couple of drinks together last week and she totally humiliated me and another friend that stood by her the most. That pushed me over the edge and I don't know what to do anymore. I didn't say anything (which might have been a mistake) because I didn't want drama + hoped I would calm down and forgive her in the next couple of days, but I didn't. 

I also saw a text she sent to my friend where she was talking shit about us. She told her friend she was horrible for not putting her on first place (and that friend did so so much for her and she's also one of my best friends and an absolutely amazing person!) and also said how I'm a horrible person for not having time for her while I have time to go on dates and post IG pics of the city she lives in but I don't invite her out... While I do in a way understand her, IMO she just has unrealistic friendship expectations. We tried to be there for her but she keeps pushing people away with her attitude. She's just... Toxic. And I don't use that word lightly. She wants constant attention and we are all fed up with it but noone said anything yet. There's a huge difference between needing friends at times (we all do!) and expecting people to be available for you 24/7,. That's unrealistic and obsessive. 

She also mentioned something very unfortunate that happened to me in that text and made it seem like she's happy it happened, like she's happy we are all miserable. That did it for me, I will not try to fix this, she has just become a completely different person, in the worst way possible. 

I don't want to really try to talk things out because I have zero faith she would take any criticism. She'd just say we are all shitty friends. And I now know what she really thinks of us. Might soune harsh, but I don't want such people in my life. 

How do I proceed? I can't directly tell her I know what she's been saying because she'd know the other friend showed me the text. 

I just want to distance myself from her, I don't want drama nor to prolong this. I don't wish her anything bad, I just can't stand her attitude any longer. 

I'm sorry if this is written is a slighty confusing way. There's just so much info it's hard to filter through it all.

The phone thing is the straw that broke the camels back for me. I really really want to help her, however i can’t think of any possible way to do so... I know what village she lives in and it’s only about 3-4 hours away from me but I can’t just turn up there.
Do you have an idea how i could help her?
Or do you think I’m overreacting?

Please help me...

682,"So I’m a 22(f) university students. My whole life I have been raised by my mother. My father since I was young was abusive physically and verbally to my mother, brother and I. He has never played a big role in my life but when he does call me he’s always yelling at me or telling me how I’m an awful daughter and how terrible of a mother I’ll be when I have children. He would also deny that he has said any of this because he says he doesn’t feel guilty. I have put up with all this abuse just to help my mother out since we didn’t have the best living situation and my dad is kind enough to sometimes give my brother and I money when needed. My father feels like my brother and I owe him time but when we do everytime he just shit talks my mother and pretty much makes us feel like shit. Two days ago he called me and started saying these awful things and that I’m disrespectful because I didn’t answer his call that day. He then said I have to chose to cut him off for good or continue having him in my life. He than threatened me and said to make sure I make the right decision and that I don’t know how he truly is. The only thing he does is pay my phone bill besides that I do everything myself. I have a job to help with my expenses and school and my mother being a saint that she is always helps me and we are doing much better now. I definitely feel bad if I do cut him off but the abuse is not worth it anymore and I’m tired of being yelled at, threatened and just told how much of a shit human being i’am.

685,"     Hi guys. So I go about my day, pretty relaxed. But sometimes my siblings bring their partners home. I hear them giggling and having a great time, this makes me sad and want a partner for myself. 
      However, I was doing just fine earlier in the day. When I’m not around them I don’t think of wanting a partner, but when they’re around it’s all I can think about. 
      The same situation goes for when my friends talk about doing pre-med. I feel fine with my route at school, but once my friends start talking about pre-med prerequisites, I start panicking and doubting the field I’m going into.

689,"Hey there, hope I'm posting to the right subreddit, r/AmItheAsshole sent me here. Apologies as English is not my first language.

Basically  I (30f) am struggling with my corporate job and have had bad anxiety,  barely getting out of bed, not been able to work, logging in on zoom  meetings only when high on antianxiolytics. I have a story of mental  health issues: burnout, low energy level and motivation, anxiety,  depression, psychotic thoughts. Earlier this year I was put on a  2-months sick leave and had to take a neuroleptic on top of the  antidepressant I've been taking for 3 years now. I have covered up my  failures at work the best I could and been upfront about feeling  overwhelmed (while staying vague about the cause) with my boss who is  actually happy with my performance and wants me to stay and grow in the  company.

However, I feel like this  situation will only get worse as I don't see how I can continue  performing in this job with such crippling thoughts, every day is a  uphill battle and I feel like Sisyphus. I feel like one day I will lash  out or disappear. I figured if I could just quit my job I would have the  mental space to work on bettering myself and figuring out what I want  to do with myself/who I want to be as a person.

Now  this decision does not just involve me. I have a husband (36m) that has  been struggling to find a job for a year so our whole household rely on  my income. He was working when we met 5 years ago but then 3 years ago I  had to move and he followed me in a new country, went back to school to  get such country diploma and learn the language. Given the current  economic situation, it could be anything from a month to a year before  he finds a new job that matches his skills.

So  if I quit, we will both be living solely on the state financial aid and  thus will need to sell our furnitures and move again, probably to a  small town in a rural area, which will make it harder for him to get a  job and put us both in a precarious situation.

I  am wrecked with guilt no matter which solution I lean toward. Neither  my therapist and psychiatrist want to weigh in. My mom thinks I should  go back on heavier medication so I can put up with my job (as the  neuroleptic makes me artificially more passive and accepting) and my  husband is supporting whichever decision I will take.

So I am turning to you, reddit. Thank you :)",03Jul2020,2
690,"So, I was gonna have a job interview a couple days ago, but I had a runny nose for several months. I talked to a doctor a couple months ago, and said it was just allergies. I wanted to confirm it was just allergies before I went to the interview, so I told the employer that, and they told me to just give them a call when I feel better. I called ergent Care to get tested, but they said they wont test me without an order from my dr. I called my dr, and talked to the receptionist, and they said they wont give an order just for a runny nose, but I have an appointment scheduled on zoom with my dr next Tuesday. I didnt want to wait that long, so I called another dr for an in office visit, but then i realized its probably best that i DO talk to them ove the phone or zoom before i came in. In that case then I might as wee just do that with my primary dr. So I call, and cancel with the other dr. I rhough the appointment with my primary care dr was today, but its not until next Tuesday. I already canceled with the other dr though. Should I call, and try in make an appointment with him, so I can figure this out sooner, or wait until next Tuesday to talk to my primary care dr.

692,"I’m concerned about the future of my relationship between myself (27M) and my wife (25F).

So, just adding some backstory for context, I’ve been married since 2016 and throughout the entirety of the marriage things have been great, with only very minor issues that have been resolved as quickly as they arose.

Recently though, I’m finding it hard to even have a conversation with her. Less so about our intimacy or lack of. 

We’ve been struggling with intimacy for a little while now, and the problem is only growing rather than hoping steady. This is in part due to our differences in how we value intimacy, our difference in sex drives and largely due to her past bad experiences.

This has made our sex life a struggle, and as supportive and comforting as I am, and always try to be. She is yet to seek any sort of professional help with the issues she has. Even though she says she “looks into it” any time it’s brought up. Bear in mind the first mention of it was almost 2 years ago.

She’s said multiple times (in excess of 10) that this is something she is wanting to do and she is ready to, however I have not witnessed her taking any steps toward seeking that help, although she assured me she has. I’ve tried multiple ways to help her feel comfortable and also tried helping her make those next steps to no avail.

Coupled with this is the increasing “drama” - issues experienced with her immediate family. I’ve always felt like an outsider in their company and as if there’s a consensus that I’m an opinionated elitist who thinks he’s better than them all, which is absolutely untrue. I may challenge them on some things, which I find normal in any family interaction I’ve had, however they all seem to be in agreement with each other on all things. This dynamic has always made me a bit uncomfortable.

There has also been a history of psychological, emotional, physical and financial abuse from my father-in-law towards my mother-in-law and their 3 daughters (wife included). This has been another challenge for the both of us, and increasingly so as it is always presented as a “nothing is wrong” situation after any blow up when we get together. This is to the point where I would rather not interact with the family at all in a group setting, and not at all individually unless required.

I’m in the uncomfortable position where it’s nigh on impossible to share my thoughts without my wife taking offence on behalf of her family, as I am uncomfortable at these family gatherings or conversing with them due to the complicated relationship and “mob mentality” I seem to be faced with.

Recently I have been considering quite seriously if the positives of this relationship outweigh the negatives and I am scared to think more on it, for fear I may realise after almost 4 years of marriage that I am being challenged, in the wrong kind of ways on a consistent basis.

My feelings toward my wife have not changed. I love her and believe regardless of what is next that a part of me always will. But I can’t seem to come to terms with the things I’m not having provided in the relationship that for myself are absolute cornerstones of any healthy relationship. 

I’m genuinely petrified of the idea of potentially divorcing her, especially as we have a life together, we share no children but even my dog, the prospect of potentially losing him fills me with a great deal of sadness and fear.

I am at a massive fork in the road here and currently struggling with which way to go. If anyone else has any advice or experience, any help is greatly appreciated.

I was left on read and didn't receive the transfer... and if the situation was different I would just let it be but the thing is I really need the help, right now I'm between paying the internet, having food for me or having food for my dogs and there is no nice way I could write them to ask for the money since I feel its kinda rude???

696,"Like the title says. We have been together for 5 years, got engaged less than a year ago, and have been living together for more than half of our relationship.

I recognize that this problem is mostly my fault, because I do not think that he feels this way about our relationship, or has any idea that I am feeling this way. He shows me that he loves me all the time, and is very affectionate. I am not an affectionate person, and touch is not my “love language,” but it’s definitely his. 

Lately (for the past few months), when we have sex, I don’t feel anything resembling closeness or intimacy, and I hate myself for it. I feel detached and like I’m not even there mentally, I’m just going through the motions. And it’s not as if I have a low sexual desire, because I still get horny, but I just don’t feel it when we have sex..

I can’t pinpoint when I started feeling this way.. and I can’t figure out whether it’s cold feet because we’re getting married.. or maybe I’m just trying to self-sabotage when everything is going well.. or maybe there is actually some truth behind what I’m feeling, and I should just rip off the bandaid instead of dragging it out, and making a breakup even more difficult than it already would be.

I know I’m a horrible person for feeling like this, because he is a genuinely good guy and he has never treated me badly. We have so much history and we have built a life together. I have no reason whatsoever to feel the way I do, but I can’t seem to shake these thoughts. I don’t want to talk to him about it until I have it figured out for myself, because I don’t feel right putting him through that conversation when he has done nothing wrong.

Someone please give me some guidance. If you have ever been in this position, what did you do? Do you regret the choice you made?

699,"I(20) feel like I will be left behind by the world.

Even before COVID, I've always been a person who barely goes out of his comfort zone. COVID lockdown has only worsened my tendency to stay in and not do anything, save for reading pointless things online, reading and being sad over current events, and sleeping in. I never DO anything, I just read whatever happens to be slightly interesting and/or educational to ""be productive by learning"". I would describe myself as a person who stands and watches while everyone else does.

As of recently however, I've seen a lot of my peers in the same age group on social media trying to start businesses, tending to their hobbies and interests, etc,. It's hard not to feel bad when almost everyone is doing SOMETHING. I feel like I've been stuck in the same spot while they continue going forward. Even if I know comparing myself to others is bad for me, I only feel bad because I KNOW I haven't done anything for myself these past few months (but I have started exercising lightly 2 days ago), and nothing I read helps as its all pointless info. As my peers improve, I feel like I become less and less valuable to society and I'll eventually end up being the kind of person no one would miss when I disappear. How do I help myself out of this self-made problem?

Tl;dr: I have no hobbies, nothing special going on in my life, and staying indoors worsens my self deprecating and reclusive tendencies, while my peers continue to improve themselves. How do I start doing something to change my situation, and where do I start?",03Jul2020,2
700,"Long story short, I have an employee under me who is constantly missing deadlines even though I usually give him two to three times the amount of time necessary to meet deadline (given he has work-history of being unproductive) and sometimes fails to do very simple tasks even with multiple reminders.

From my perception and trying to track is work without micromanaging, it seems like he usually waits until 1-2 days before deadlines to even start working on a project (e.g. I will tell him a project to work on Monday morning with a Friday deadline that takes 2 days of work and it seems like he will make no progress until Thursday and then miss the Friday deadline). I currently do not micromanage tasks given I know it does not make me more productive.  We are both also currently WFH from perspective.


Separately, either the employee is openly insubordinate or incredibly unorganized. There are multiple examples of me giving him 24 hours to do a 15 minute task, and me having to remind him 3-4 times to get him to actually do this basic task (after the initial 24 hours). I am unsure whether he is just trying to be insubordinate or he is just very poor at time management such that he cannot manage around completing these very simple tasks.

The other thing to note is that this employee is generally very polite and says he will get tasks done on time and does not ask for more time or let me know of any setbacks he is facing, but just has a long history of failing to do this.

TLDR: Unproductive employee who misses deadlines when given 2-3x the amount of time necessary and fails to complete simple tasks without multiple reminders. Employee and I both WFH. How to deal with?",03Jul2020,1

Now my mom is pressuring me big time to find a rich older boyfriend and is driving me to a rich area in my city with huge mansions by the beach for me to jog or bike ride so I can hopefully meet one.

We are a five person household (well, sorta, I'm a college student). I'm a 19F who luckily has a full scholarship to college (besides housing), so I'm very relieved I do not need to take out a loan or anything because my parents have like literally no college savings for me. But when it comes time for my younger siblings to go to college there will be no college savings for them. On top of that, my family has no savings in general. Like no money for their own retirement and no money for spending. My dad took out like a 100,000 dollar loan with the highest interest rate and can't pay it off so it is just adding up. We are in deep, deep shit. I say ""we"" because even though I'm 19 now, I'm still very much intertwined in this problem and my mother has basically made it my responsibility to fix everything.

She says I am young and beautiful and that I need to find a rich boyfriend in the meantime while I'm studying so I can get a good high paying job in the future. While I am home from college, she has started driving me to this really rich area in my city right by the beach with ginormous mansions and is telling me to jog and bike ride so I can meet an older rich guy. She doesn't want me to go on dating apps because she thinks that is being too desperate and doesn't want to make it obvious I only want the guy for his money. She subtly insults me all the time and says it's abnormal for a pretty girl like me to have not had a boyfriend yet and she says that I am basically being useless. She is also practically placing all the responsibility on me to fix my family's financial problems and says she will live with me when I am older and she wants me to have a really good high paying job so I can just ""fix"" everything.

I don't really know what I'm supposed to do. I've never had a boyfriend, and while I want one, I don't think getting myself a rich boyfriend on purpose is the best idea.

Ever since I was little I wasn't a good person I was mean and not very nice to others. This put a strain on the relationship between me and my parents. Even since I was little I have always felt off. I remember being 6 or 7 and telling myself I wanted to hurt myself (is worse but I won't say it for reddit sake) I never had anybody to go to to talk about my feels. I rember trying to talk to my mother but she always said I was feeling sorry for myself and never really seem to cared.

Eventually I told the teachers at school how I was feeling and they got CPS involved, this destroyed the relationship I had with my farther and I have only a few months ago managed to get it back (this was 3 years ago) I remember my parents telling me to shut up and not tell CPS anything else as ""I would be taken away"" and ""Never see them again"".

I have felt very down ever since. Its not a persistent feeling down just every few days I have brakedowns that nobody loves me and nobody cares for me. Its hard to put into words.

I don't feel like I can go to my mother to talk about things because she always turns the conversation on me because ""You did this wrong"" and ""It was your fault because"" she also doesn't understand and brings up all the excuses such as ""When I was younger I did have this"" or ""My parents put a roof under my head and fed me"". As well as this my mother doesn't understand depression I remember she was at Mcdonalds and walked out angrily because she saw the person that served her had scars up her arms. She argued that the woman had a good job and has a good house. She doesn't understand. 

I don't feel like I can go to my farther because he isn't a very welcoming person. He kind of dose the same thing as my mother and he is also a drunk and a heavy smoker. Not abusesive or anything but most of the time he's drunk. 

My parents fight all the time. It's often my mom shouting at my dad for hiding beer and for getting drunk when she's not home. He often smells like poo and doesn't sme very nice.

My friends are not being grate at the moment either. Since lock down my friends have all been hanging out with each other and posting pictures of them all hanging out on on our group chat but guess what I wasn't invited. I'm not asking for an invite but it feels not very good when your entire friendship group hangs out without inviting you or your best friend. FYI it was my entire friendship group except me and my besite that hung out.

The only person I can go to is my boyfriend. He's amazing supportive and down righ awesome. He understands me embraces me and exepts me. He is the only person I can go to without feeling judged or feeling stupid he let's me talk and makes me feel happy about myself and most importantly I know that he loves me without a doubt.

But recently we broke up due to some personal reasons we still talk flirt and do everything we normally do but we just aren't together. Iv been feeling very very down and I guess am not anymore but just feeling very very emotionless. I have done many many depression tests online (not offecial) and all came out saying that I had mieled to sever depression.

 I want to go to a doctor to mabye get a diagnosis and possibly even talk to somebody but I can't. I'm afraid of what my mom would think and I'm afriend to tell anybody how I feel because of what happened 3+ years ago. I'm afraid nobody will understand me and most importantly I don't understand how I feel. I feel nothing whilst writing this and feel some small tingles of sadness.

I have no one to defend me and no one to tell me what exactly is going on. Even my neighbor looks at me like he is disgusted with me, even though his granddaughter molested me when I was a child. They try to intimidate me and make it seem that I am the one who should be ashamed, but I know that I never did anything wrong. I try to ignore it, but it can be hard when everybody is rude to you and you don't have anybody to lean on. I am still learning English so I apologize for any mistakes.",03Jul2020,2
718,"My ex who i was with 8 months or more ago pretty dumped me after 1 week , then kept teasing me because i was a part of his friend group , he knew me because one of his friends had hit on me , but he ended up being the one i was really attracted to. we went out everyday , then one day he said things aren't working out , i tried asking for an explication he had said that it bothers him that i answer late , don't talk a lot and that is because i'm shy and because i didn't say i love you back after literally 5 days after knowing him. then one day a few months later he calls me up saying he wants to talk meaning he wanted to get back together and even this time he brought his friend with him we had gone out alone only 1 time and i was awkward because i don't do well in big groups of people. he came over it was great then the next day he had blocked me everywhere. then at like the start of quarantine or a little later he had begged one of my ex fiends to tell me to unblock him after a few hours i did and he kept asking me to go out get back together etc.. video calling me , so this kept going on until wednesday 1 july when i finally gave him , we had met up with his friends again and two of them kept trying to hit on me and it was obvious he didn't like it anyway we ended up talking , and after his friends left we were just walking around with a 'friend' of mine who obviously likes him and tries too hard , he ends up putting his head on my shoulder when we were sitting on a bench and hugged me for a bit of time when i get home he tells me he had a great time he appreciated me coming and that i made him happy. the day after that we ended up going to the pool and while talking he made this promise to me (i'm on vacation in italy) that he will wait for me and not get a girlfriend until i come back so i said fuck it , i'm leaving anyway so i said ok , i was leaving that same day so he was just walking around the pool with me wrapped around him , kissed my neck not much then when i had to go home he joined me helped get my suitcase from my apartment to my car , he came with me till the border from romania to hungary saying it's ok if he had to wait more because he was happy to see me before i leave. because from there i was alone , he kept checking up on me etc but he started being too sweet and said i love you again and that threw me off again so i just said i got here safe he said to take care and that he loves me a lot haven't talked to him since i'm really wondering if it's worth it like we're technically not even back together and he's already telling people he has a girlfriend, gave me his accounts before i left. but at the same time he was telling me he only wants me he was also hitting up other girls (this being before i agreed to go out) i know it's stupid i just can't resist him and i don't wanna be played again. what should i do? also promised that he's not the same and that he's changed wants a serious relationship etc , all said before.",03Jul2020,1

720,"I have always somehow made friends with really academically smart people. They have continued to win awards, become school leaders and graduated to go on to local and internationally acclaimed universities. Meanwhile, I was above average but never smart enough to get these opportunities. In the times, I went for them, I would lose because my friends would be better candidates. Years later when I went to university, I naturally made friends with intelligent people. Some would not even try yet get a higher GPA than me and naturally the benefits which come with it. I like having them as friends because in a way they keep me motivated and challenge me to do better, but i sometimes end up feeling so down and inferior to them. It makes me feel like that no matter how much I try, it never would be enough. I know people would say to go at my pace, but seriously we are all the same age and in the same setting, so that is not reassuring at all. How else can I actually start achieving these high goals so I can feel good about myself? Most of these goals end up mattering after 5 years, so it isn't something short term either.",03Jul2020,1

Trigger Warning : Self Harm, Suicidal Thoughts/Ideation, Assault, Depression, Disordered Eating. 

**Please do not read beyond this line if any of the above topics are painful or triggering for you.** 

History: I had a major depressive episode at 14, with suicidal ideation and heavy self harm. I was assaulted at 17, and again at 23. I am conventionally thin and reasonably attractive, and yet, when my life feels too out of control, I occasionally starve myself because the semblance of control feels good. I don’t count calories, I do it more to get my body to focus on a task at hand, and use food as leverage. I wasn't aware that this somewhat comes under the bracket of eating disorders until very recently

The start of 2020 was terrible for me; I was depressed and barely eating a meal a day. I quit my job in July 2019, of my own volition, due in part to the sudden death of my boss and dear friend, and my other boss &amp; dear friend suffering a heart attack in 2018, and undergoing bypass surgery in 2019. 

I don't actively want to kill myself; I'm just tired. Nothing is amiss in my life, I am privileged beyond my years, and yet I just want to sleep and not wake up. 

I landed a new job in January 2020, and went into my first therapy session because I knew I couldn’t go into my first day of work suicidal and depressed. My first appointment was a mess, all I did was cry, and I got no words out. My therapist sent me home with a ten day prescription of Lexapro &amp; Risperidone. I took the damn pills but like an idiot, thought I was cured when I stopped crying and didn't bother going for the followup appointment. 

Cut to a few weeks later, I'm back at her office in terrible shape, just like the last time. I get a longer prescription and an appointment for a MCMI 3 test in a couple weeks, when I'm more stable. My therapist wasn’t surprised to find that the highest elevation on my test were Major depression, somatoform, PTSD, dysthymia, and anxiety.

After a month of medication, I wasn’t really getting any better, I wasnt crying all the time because I spent a significant chunk of my time at work, and I was eating (so that my co-workers wouldn’t think I was starving myself). My therapist increased my dosage of meds (Lexapro &amp; Risperidone). A week later, I felt great. Like, **really great**, so I stopped the medication because I thought, again, that I was cured. Sunday evening, I woke up from a long nap, jumped into the shower, and then went straight to a hairdresser to get rid of my hip length hair. That work week, I spent USD 500 on clothes, I went to two music events on the weekend, and I jumped into bed with someone I really, really shouldn’t have. The repercussions of this week were immediate and devastating, and pushed me headfirst into a negative spiral of shame, guilt and self-hatred, furthered by the shelter in place order, that meant I didn’t have to pretend to be okay in front of coworkers. The pandemic’s effects meant that I couldn’t reach my therapist until a month later, and despite a prescription, couldn’t access medication until two months later. 

It is July now, and I’m only now feeling stable enough to talk about this, and I’ve just begun trying to understand what happened. I’m not a prude, but I’m also very picky about who I date, because I am afraid of men. One therapist has told me my past assaults have led to my developing maladaptive thought patterns where men are concerned, which makes me view them as one dimensional beings, as an explanation for my one night stand. But this past trauma doesn’t explain my impulsive spending, or my sudden extroverted energy that led me to attend two full night concerts within a 3 day window. 

I feel like I’m losing my mind. There is no version of me that would sleep with someone my friend had been involved with, or so carelessly spend money on things I do not need after being unemployed for ***months,*** or let go of my social anxiety and fear of men long enough to go to out by myself and ***enjoy*** a music concert.

I don’t know what’s wrong, and I’m not really getting an answer that explains my behavior from the therapists I’ve seen so far. 

Please help me make sense of this.",03Jul2020,1

723,"Hello Redditors, so first a little of a back story: I’m an 18 yo male, who lives in a little country in Central America. I’ve always liked math, science, tech, video games and history. So the time came somewhere in the past year for me to choose my career and because my family owns a relatively decent hardware store I decided to study Business Administration and I had two options for my college: A) the best one in my country for economics (as said before it’s a little country so I won’t even bother with the name because I doubt you heard of it) or B) go to Mexico to a really good college for somewhat the same price and education but with better exchange options. In the end, I decided to go B. 

Now being here I gained some perspective and realized something: I’m not sure I want to study this, I’m not even sure if I want to be part of the family business (I have realized it’s more of a mess than what I had previously thought) or that I will ever have a chance of being in charge of anything. And I have been thinking about changing career to either A) Industrial Engineering or B) IT Engineering (which the program is very rounded so I thinks it’s something more like computer science but I might be wrong)

Now with the big problems 

With IT engineering my fear is that here in Latin America isn’t well paid and how can my title form here could compete in first world countries against one of their own universities. 

And with both: I’m afraid to make the same mistake I made with Business administration and it isn’t what I really like, like in theory, I may like it; but the practice isn’t the same. Or am I rushing into this? Should I wait another semester to see? And is it that risky to go for IT engineering in Latin America? Or could it be that I’m seeing everything with a black filter because I’ve been away from my family and my plans have gone pretty bad? And also sometimes I feel so sure about what I want but then I fall into a horrible doubt. I could really use some help, and thanks.

TL;DR: I wanted to study Business Administration, got a chance to get out of my country, gained perspective, not sure I want that anymore. I like Industrial engineering or IT Engineering. I live in Latin America, IT engineering not well paid in my country, afraid to end up with more problems. Don’t know how to choose, afraid of going the wrong way, maybe I’m seeing everything in a bad light because of the quarantine? Doubting a lot about everything, sometimes sure of what I want but then don’t. I could really use some help, and thanks.",03Jul2020,1

725,"I'll try to keep it short, because my head hurts and I still have gotten checked out for a brain tumor.

But long story short, my family is basically demanding me to go out and catch Corona because it should be easier to find work. While demanding this, they also expect me to stay at whatever level of work I find long enough to retire with JUST ENOUGH money. I even mentioned moving out and they will literally speak over me and only mention stupid fucking 401k's

727,"Hey reddit, 

Throwaway cause this is a super personal story. For context, I am 24F. 

My mom was extremely close with her best friend (let's call her ""Louise"") since they were around six. They did so many things in life together and were ALWAYS at each others houses. This continued into adulthood and Louise was more like an aunt than just a family friend. As a kid, she would come to some of my performances and stuff like that. Her son and my little sisters were also super close in age and were always playing together. 

My mom battled cervical cancer in around 2007ish and it came back again in 2012. Now, my family is one of those families that just does not talk about the hard stuff. Me and my sisters were legitimately some of the last to know about her cancer diagnoses... in 2012, we ended up taking this huge family vacation to a place my mom had said several times that she's always wanted to visit, and shortly after people started bringing us meals. I guess I don't blame my parents, as it's an incredibly difficult conversation to have with three kids, but regardless, it shows just how hard it is to have tough conversations in this family. 

So since my mom got sick, Louise had really taken on an additional mothering role to me and my sisters. She was over at our house pretty much every day. Of course this was a wonderful thing to do for our family and it was great for my mom having her best friend there with her towards the end. Unfortunately things were not all rosy, as Louise's husband was a bit of a jerk, and it turns out she was also coming over to avoid him. I can't quite remember the exact timeline, but they separated around the time my mom was really sick. 

Mom passed away in 2014, and Louise continued to play a huge role in the lives of my sisters and myself. Where my mom couldn't be there, she would. It was so normal for her to be over at the house that at first it didn't occur to me that my dad and her had something going on, but as we've gotten older, it's become more obvious. She would be the one to pick out birthday or Father's day gifts for my dad. She'd come over for dinner like every other evening. Her and my dad are now going for walks together to lose weight. 

I have no idea for how long this has been going on, but their relationship has definitely turned sexual. I know this for a fact because my little sister was once using my dad's ipad for school and it was hooked up to iCloud, so she actually saw some texts coming in (barf!). As I said before, my family does NOT talk about difficult stuff. Dating is included in this. It was actually a long time before I told my dad I was dating my now husband, just because I knew it would be difficult to talk about. So there is almost no chance of him flat out telling us that him and Louise are together. But my sisters and I have discussed this and we all know that they are not-so-secretly dating. 

As much as my sisters and I love Louise, she has way overstepped her role as a close family friend. She has insisted on coming to several of my psychiatrist appointments, which I didn't want her to be at since they obviously extremely sensitive and personal. She has also really pushed boundaries when I planned my wedding, trying to take control from the smallest details to the biggest questions like ""do you REALLY want to get married? most marriages end in divorce..."" (all the while she was dealing with her divorce). As a step-mom, this would be annoying but with my best interest, but as a family-friend, this was WAY overstepping. 

This has been going on for years and years, and my dad and Louise are still presenting as ""friends"", and Louise is presenting herself as a family friend to my sisters and I. It gets so complicated whenever people ask what is going on, and I never have the right answer. I've actually referred to her as ""my stepmom"" when telling anecdotes about her to people that don't know the situation, and it seemed more natural than saying ""my late mom's best friend"". 

So what should I do? Should I sit out and keep letting them have this charade of being ""friends""? I feel weird about this relationship since I've known Louise since the day I was born, but I also want for my dad to be happy. Do I bite the bullet and ask them what's going on?

Previously yesterday I contacted every person I could to see if they would want to accompany me. I was ignored by two and denied by two more. I asked my significant other and he said no. 

So naturally I just packed up and went alone. Well although it was relaxing it was one of the more sad hikes I’ve had. I hiked for around an hour found a nice clearing meadow and cried. Smoked a joint and cried some more. Meditated and cried and begged the skies for friends. 
I feel so incredibly pathetic because I’m trying to be happy and I love myself and my alone time but I’m really spending a lot of time these days by myself. I live with someone and I’m still doing everything alone. 
I know I’m a good friend, I care, I listen and I truly try to provide non biased feedback when asked. However it seems nobody sticks around or seems to keep interest. 


I’m so frustrated and absolutely lonely. The most interaction I get is my animal crossing. Digital animal characters are the closest things I have to real friends.

Okay so I met my boyfriend online and we had a long distance relationship for almost a year until finally meeting in September of 2019. In November of 2019 on our one year anniversary I get this message from his ex girlfriend who had been honestly stalking and fucking with me online essentially telling me to tell my boyfriend to stop messaging her because apparently a week earlier he had messaged her to find out if his cousin was “talking to her”. Anyways she ends up telling me that In July 2019 they met up and had sex. She came all the way from Canada to New York to see my boyfriend and according to her they had sex. I immediately call him to ask him if it’s true and he just denies it and then hangs up when I keep pressing. I had to literally keep messaging this girl to find out what happened because he refused to tell me. Mind you this whole time he’s blowing up her phone telling her to stop messaging me. She tells me one story and finally after I block him on everything he starts to tell me that the only reason he met with her is because he thought she was pregnant because they had hooked up in October of 2018 😐 he said she got on top of him and tried to force him inside of her and that he told her to stop and then proceeded to eat pizza with her and left a little later. He says the reason he went to meet her is because he wasn’t sure I would be attracted to him in person he’s a little chubby irl and very photogenic so he didn’t think we would even work out because of his looks. I don’t think he would’ve ever told me on his own and I don’t know if I should believe his side:T also would like to add that he had contacted for a week her after we met in person and talked to her on the phone for hours (she showed me screenshots) and he claims he only reached out to find out if his cousin was dating her. what are your thoughts ?",03Jul2020,1

736,"So the 2 parties in question are the 4th of July where my in-laws want to come over, and then a bigger party in a few days where about 15 family members (with their children) will have a party and will invite their neighbors to come over, too.

We have been quarantining since the beginning with some limited interactions here and there with close friends and family, so I can't say we've been 100% cut off from the world since February, but we have been *extremely* careful and clean with any interaction we have with the general public (shopping, deliveries, etc). In fact, we've seen these family members in-person at one get together about a month ago and it was a normal party, no masks, no social distancing. We brought our masks and were ready to social-distance, but no one else was so it would've been weird if we did (Yay! Peer pressure!). Not to mention my kids loved seeing the other kids for the first time in a while so they ran around and played like normal kids do. The way everyone was interacting you would've never known we were in a pandemic.

With sparse interactions like this happening during the pandemic, we, just like a lot of people, started to feel a little safer, the fear factor starting to wear off. So the thought started to sink in that we were open to seeing a few more close friends at small get-togethers here and there....but then the re-openings started happening and the cases started spiking. Now that fear is settling in again for some...but not my family.

With cases becoming more wide spread, we are starting to actually know people first-hand that have had the virus and recovered, and even friends' family who have died from the virus. BUT there is so much unknown about the virus that it's hard to know who to trust for information.

*The main concern here* is my wife and one of our young kids are high risk (respiratory and heart issues) that we know this virus will greatly affect. Not to mention the fear of unknown long-term effects this virus is having on people (kids included).

**TL;DR**: family wants to get together and pretend we're not in a pandemic. My wife and kid are high risk if they get sick. Should I or should I not make a big deal about this?

**So my question is do I:**

A) convince everyone they shouldn't be getting together for their safety

B) Just tell them we're not going and why

C) or am I overreacting and we should be fine",03Jul2020,2

WARNING: LONG POST!

Hi reddit! Although I have been a long-time lurker, I have just recently created this account and, honestly, it was purely because I needed advice from you. I hope this does not break any rules. If so, please mods feel free to remove the post.  Also, english is not my first language, so if you see any mistakes, you know the reason!

Now, onto the issue:

My partner and I inmigrated to UK a few years ago and since then we have been working our asses off  and saving to be able to afford a downpayment for a house, in order to start a family and, you know, have the kind of future that our own country could not offer us. Last year we got engaged and we planned a very small-budget wedding (like, ""courthouse ceremony and drinks in a pub afterwards with family and closest friends"" small) and a nice honeymoon trip for this year (which we are not sure we are going to be able to enjoy due to coronavirus). In total, our savings are enough for a downpayment for a modest flat, and the wedding, we think.

And this is relevant because...

Very recently, we  were told that our 3-year old cat has injection site sarcoma. It is a very malignant cancer with a high chance of recurring, specially because it is located between the shoulder blades and it is difficult to operate there.  The biopsy has been quite expensive, and we already are arranging a CT scan, sugery and (most probably) several rounds of radioteraphy.  All of this is gonna cost several thousands of pounds, but she is our cat, she is part of our family, we love her and we are gonna do everything possible to help her. 

I know that many people start crowfunding campaigns to help with pet-related expenses and the thought has crossed our minds. However, we are reluctant because we have the money to pay for her treatment. True, it will take a pretty big chunk out of our savings and probably set us back a year or so for the flat, but she is our pet, our responsability and no one else's. And if we need to pay for more surgery or chemo (which is a real possibility, according to our vet), we can leave the honeymoon for another year. I even started freelacing on top of my full-time job to be able to help with the expenses without having to resort to charity, although is not going very well. 

However, most of our friends and family have offered to help economically and have urged us to start a campaign, even tho they know we are planning to have a wedding and the honeymoon. They say that we shouldn't sacrifice our plans for the future because we refuse help from strangers. My partner is starting to agree with them, but I still feel bad: how can I ask other people to help pay for something that I have the money for? Isn't that hypocritical?

Reddit, what would think is people in our situation started a crowfunding campaign?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.: For those wondering about the honeymoon with the cat situation, by that date, if everything goes well, the treatment will be more than over and our ex-roomate and friend, who knows her since she was a kitten and has cat-sitted everytime that we have needed it, has offered to take care of her while we are away. That would be, of course, if the vet confirms that everything is okay. If she were still being treated of if were advised to stay with her, we would stay. She is our priority.",03Jul2020,0
739,"I’ve been stripping for six years. After covid, I started doing phone sex. I’ve been deeply burnt out of sex work for two years and have been wanting to stop. 

Yesterday, I got a accepted for a customer service job. It’s been a surprise. I convinced myself I could never get a job anywhere. It’s not much and I know it’s going to be hard work, but I’m grateful for it. I‘m ready to practice different life skills than the ones I learned from sick men.

Today, I told the phone sex company that I was quitting after the weekend. I felt bad because I didn’t give two weeks’ notice. So I let them talk me into doing it part-time instead, on my days off from the customer service job. 

My plan is to try doing that and then tell them I can’t do it. But I don’t want to do phone sex for one more moment. I don’t mind the work, but I have this strong feeling that it’s not healthy for me at all. 

Should I wait until two weeks or quit after the weekend? 

I could even quit right now. I’d lose nine dollars because I just got paid and they don’t send out checks less than $50. 

I’m not worried about the $9 if it means I don’t have to do phone sex anymore. But I don’t feel like changing my mind is fair to them after I said I’d stay.

I’m not familiar with job etiquette and would appreciate some perspective on this.

740,"So, I (23) am a very passionate person in lots of topics that I consider affect me directly. For example feminism, lgbt rights, etc

In the last couple of days I have been finding out a lot of stuff that I don't really agree with about the people that surround me. My male friend (24) that says women should be more careful with the clothes they are wearing and lots of homophobic comments coming from his religion (Christian) and also he doesn't support blm (he is black) , my bisexual female black best friend (22) agreeing on the fact that women should be more careful with the clothes that they use if they don't want to get raped and staying friends with our male friend even though he is blatantly homophobic even if is because of his religion . And then my boyfriend (31) who claims being gay is a choice but that he doesn't hate people who are gay, he just doesn't support the community but if he had a gay son he would totally support him (wich I found hypocritical) and he also uses his religion as an excuse. 

Every time I enter on twitter I get this tweets all over my tl saying ""you should dump your x friend"" ""you should dump your x boyfriend"" and that shit is driving me nuts

All this new information about my loved ones have come to light in the last... What? 7 days? I started to think again about how much I disagree in lots of topics with my family but as they are family I let it go. Should I really dump all of them? Even if I love them dearly? Should we really push away people that don't agree with us or just try to have a respectful conversation? I wonder because every time we speak about those topics they are calm and collected and I am just very emotional...

The first thing they asked ‘who weights the least?’  and I answer my sister (it’s obvious what the answer would be). They paint themselves as ‘nice guy’ types so I didn’t think any ill intent maybe they were just curious and didn’t realise that’s weird to ask a girl imo. When playing league they constantly ‘meme’ that I’m trash but to my sister they praise every tiny thing. They said I’m not as ‘cool’ as her, idk what that means really. Saying I’m not funny, and she is. We both enjoy singing as a hobby, they said ‘you’re not as good as her though’. Saying she is ‘pretty nice’ and I , and I quote ‘stink’ ?! 

My reaction when they say that type of stuff is to just tell them to shut up and I say something like no I’m cool I’m not trash etc etc (sounds so dumb typing this out lol). They laugh it off etc but I’m actually hurt by it. 


But they are always wanting me to join their games even when I’m alone and generally talk to me more (other than the one that is currently dating my sis) since we share the hobby. So I’m really confused, since I know some guys like to poke fun in a friendly banter way. But isn’t this a bit too far? I want to say something but I’m worried they would say I’m being too sensitive etc. 

Weirdly find myself wanting validation from them while them also being the ones making me question my worth. I’m worried I’m over reacting and it’s just my own insecurities etc Ugh

Also sorry to keep saying ‘my sister’, ‘her’ etc just don’t wanna say names. Also me and my sister are really close and we talk about it but honesty I know she enjoys. She started dating of of them who would constantly do the comparing, now I realise it was just a way to lift her up to pursue her etc. So I don’t wanna talk to her about it anymore, but we get a lot really well other than just this. 

Some advice would be useful! Sorry to anyone that has read my ramblings.",03Jul2020,3
744,"A little background about my father: 
He is a legal immigrant from Colombia has lived here in FL since he was 12 and is now 45. He has had history of drug abuse, cheating, domestic violence, and emotional manipulation. He was a coke head and sold drugs in his youth, met my mom when he was 18 and she was 16 and they had me then 4 years later had my sister but their entire marriage was extremely abusive and he’s laid hands on me and put me in closets before when I was a child, I remember things like him throwing plates at my mother and hitting her and hiding her keys so she couldn’t leave. 

They divorced and he found “god” and got married and had twins but then cheating on that woman while she was pregnant with twins (my brothers now 13). 

He ended up leaving that woman after she had my brothers and moved in with the woman he cheated on (was like 10 years younger than him she was like 21 and he was 32 or something similar) 

He left the church he was in because obviously he couldn’t stay there after they found out what he did. 

So he moved to another church with this new woman. Both these women were great and genuine. 

He soon cheated on her after and they divorced after also telling her he didn’t want anymore children 

He then got divorced and moved into an apartment with THE NEXT WOMEN he cheated with and then got her pregnant (she is 25 and I am 23 now) their daughter is now 2 I believe. 

My father and I had always issues but recently he has been using my brothers as pawn in this. 

I message my brothers often but never anything bad as I am not stupid and am aware that their custodial parent (their mom) has access to their phone and my father had already threatened to stop letting me see them before so I talk very appropriately to them. 

He recently sent me a message essentially threatening me saying the way I was speaking with my brothers was disgusting and punishable by court of law but I know that he was pulling that out of his ass because I posted the entire conversation on a private account (a finsta, if you will) and people could not believe that he was even saying what he was saying. 

Anyway he exchanged words after he messaged me through my brothers WhatsApp account 

But my brothers had been planning to come visit the area I live in with their mother and I was going to dog sit but after that conversation, all of a sudden I’m not dog sitting and they said I can’t see them anymore and that “we shouldn’t talk about it” but they are 13 and don’t talk like that so I know my dad coached them through what to say 

Essentially I’m asking: I’m about to just flame his ass with facts and truth as professionally as possible but I just wanted to see if there was any other things I could do before I decide to message him and his wife? 
(Btw this wife he has now essentially hates me and my sister but still claims us as her step kids even though we only met her like four times and she made my dad stop speaking Spanish at food places bc she can’t understand)",03Jul2020,2

I know we haven’t known each other for very long, but I want to make him a little going away gift for him to remember me.  He’s gonna be 2 months without contact and hopefully afterward we will meet again.

I was going to write a card, but I wanted to know if there were any little easy craft I could make for him. something small he could take w him, something personal.

749,"So im trying to get a degree in industrial maintenance technology and am actually almost done with it, at first it was all good i had a job that was 3 days a week, it was 3 12s a week, saturday, sunday and monday, and id go to school all week and was actually learning how to be a maintenance technician, than the next semester it was all good until, my job told me i had to switch to a different shift, that the weekend shift was going to be gotten rid of, this made me really sad, but i also live with my family cause i was in prison for a while and got out and it was my parole address, 

Now, my family is crazy, they are obsessed with working and get mad any time i dont work a 12 hour shift. They are only happy when im 100% exhausted and tired, they are toxic as fuck, all my off days i was using to go to school and study theyd go ""So... not working again!? lazy sack of shit!"" i tell them its cause im pursuing an education to better my life, and theyd get mad, ""who needs an education when you can go to one of these factories and work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week?"" they are anti-education and hate the idea of me pursuing a degree, they hate the idea of me taking days off to ""study"" in quotes cause thats what they say, my studying is considered useless free time to them, they literally get mad at me, and will call other members of the family and so on and tell them how im ""skipping work to study for a useless degree."" the other family say im a burden and that working on a degree is useless. 

I think ive proved them wrong, because I just got a high paying job (behind their backs) and its directly related to me having an education, as a felon, this is a huge achievement, I love my new job, and finishing my degree can literally lead me to being promoted and getting a job that pays over 100k a year. My new job works me less, and pays me more. Im making more as a 23 year old felon who hasnt even finished his degree than any of my family are, im hiding my new job, and trying to explain my schedule away as this and that and so on. They are getting mad that im not working.... my new job has paid holidays off and they are wondering why im not working overtime, it really makes me sad that they dont care at all for me trying so hard to be successful. All they talk about is work this and work that ""i worked 16 hours at my job today!"" ""Oh yeah i pulled a double shift and only got 3 hours of sleep! im harder worker than yoU!!!!!!"" 

its fucking insanity. 

Enough about them, the problem at hand is my new job although it applys to my degree is a first shift job, and it pays to good and gives me to much experience to pass up, I get to use tools all day and wire electrical circuits, its so awesome, I read blueprints and use measurement tools, i cant believe i finally got a job i actually like, my family would be so pissed if they found out. The hours are typical of first shift, 6am to 2pm type of schedule, which makes most classes obsolete, ive been looking at night classes but i think im to late or something for the fall semester, cause the only one i could find is at 10pm and that means i dont get any sleep.... which is another problem. 

When all this shift changing and shit started happening i got to the point i was going to class on like 4 hours of sleep than working after that, never ever sleeping and learning absolutely nothing. I started barely passing my classes, to the point i was going from As and Bs when i first started to Cs and Ds, just getting by on no sleep and learning nothing like i said. 

It makes me so sad, cause i have to work full time to appease my family but i also have to get this degree, I love learning and im not going to let them stop me, Ive been saving up to move out tbh, and maybe taking a break from in person classes over the fall and winter to save up more and more money to move out by next year, 

than next year i can just sign up for classes that fit my schedule better like, at 4pm after work and so on, so that way i get my full 8 hours of sleep. 

Should i just rush to finish my degree and say fuck the sleep? or should i just say fuck it and go ahead and let it take a little longer to have a nice schedule and actually learn something without my family freaking out? Ive been slowly blocking members of my family one by one based on how often i see them, and when i move out i plan to cut them all off besides my mom who knows my plan already.",03Jul2020,1
750,"So I've had a rough 10 months. Lost my job, got the virus, lost all my money, lost my home for a bit, have to box to make ends meet etc. I have a lot of acquaintances but 5-6 close friends. 3 of them moved in together and became very cliquish and neglectful of our friendship (not even asking me how I was doing once during the entire affair) I eventually asked for some time away from them and, after a period reflecting, extended a hand to restore the friendship on the conditions they treat me better. 

They rejected to various degrees of politeness and ended the friendship wholesale. It's been a month or two and I'm trying to move on with my life (still haven't found a job so not out of the shit yet) but sometimes I find myself so angry and sad that people I like and who treated me like shit get to keep living their great lives while I continue sifting through the shambles of mine.

751,"TW: assault, rape mention
~
TLDR; My college-age brother was accused of sexual harassment and assault, including rape, by a group of young women from my hometown this week. I found out via a thread on social media, which has since gotten hundreds of likes and reposts with additional various threats and accusations made against him. He told me he didn’t do it, and I believe him.

I am completely torn and heartbroken. I grew up very close to my brother, and have always known him as very gentle and kind, and very focused on social justice and doing the “right” thing. He was pretty awkward and shy in middle school and had plenty of eccentric (some would say “nerdy”), although harmless, interests. as soon as he got to freshman year of high school, he became a bit of  douche bag and very focused on gaining clout and popularity—spending lots of money on clothes and sneakers (my parents couldn’t necessarily just *give* us these things), throwing huge parties while my parents were out of town, smoking, drinking, and hanging out with who my mother referred to as a bad crowd—mostly wealthy and slightly ignorant popular kids. He of course seemed to have grown out of this phase by his senior year and had a small but kind group of friends and his own interests, a very well adjusted if not occasionally depressed kid. The women who accused him, all friends in the same circle, I only heard of through him and a couple others as very manipulative, mean girls who always picked on him in high school.  They used to be in his circle of friends and fell off after several instances in which he claimed he was taken advantage of by them, either monetarily or trying to pressure him into sexual favors in exchange for other things. He also said, several years ago that the woman who initially accused him of rape had touched him inappropriately and made him feel very uncomfortable, and that he had to kick her out of a party he had thrown.  I never knew any of these girls, never met them, never spoke to them in real life. As soon as news broke, he texted me promising up and down that he didn’t do it, he would never do something like that, begging me to believe him. He posted a very messy and rushed statement online hours after the news dropped saying that the original accuser only made her accusations to protect herself from the things she did to him. He’s since been banned from all of his clubs and extra curriculars including his frat, is ostracized by all of his friends, and is in a deep state of isolation and anger. He is supposedly taking legal action with the help of my parents.

That being said, the women who accused him had plenty of examples of times he made them uncomfortable or tried to pressure them into sexual activity, the posts have a LOT of backup from other kids in the form of likes and reposts, and a few accounts of him as a younger teenager pressuring other young women into having sex with him or sending him nudes. I also am an assault victim and a woman, and instinctively believe women when they say they were hurt.  I also don’t doubt, as a once very insecure young man in a position of power (being popular, throwing huge parties, having a car and popular friends), that he probably has made women uncomfortable before. Every man I know has, to a certain degree, and I think it’s wrong of him to choose not to address his own inherent misogyny—to the extent I’m familiar, rudeness and pettiness, but then again I’m only his sister— that has almost definitely affected his relationships at a young age. but at the same, these girls and my brother have complete opposite stories. The only thing these stories had in common was that they used to be friends, and used to hang out, and that he had exchanged nudes with one of them. And I believe my brother. I just do. 

I am angry and struggling. I have extremely high levels of anxiety and can barely sleep, and I feel as if my brother’s life is ruined. To be honest, I haven’t even prepared myself for the chance that could he could be completely lying, and have instead prepared myself to just never know. I haven’t been back to my hometown in almost 7 months due to living far away and covid and I am scared to go back. I feel like a horrible person and horrible feminist for believing my brother when he says he didn’t do it, and at the same time I am angry with him for somehow getting into this and angry with the girls for possibly lying (or not). 

how on earth do I cope with these events happening? My parents are impossible to speak to in times of stress and my mother snapped at me when I told her I needed more support through this, and it seems the rest of my extended family just doesn’t know. I feel so alone and resentful of everyone involved. Has anyone been through a similar experience, and if so, what has gotten them through it?",03Jul2020,1
752,"Thanks to the actions of a former emotionally manipulative ex-boyfriend and an ex best friend, I am always cautious about getting rides and being apart of errands with friends. Bare with me I know it sounds weird, but basically, I always like to know the details of a plan and specifically - trusting my friends to stick to a plan and not expect me just to go with the flow and be inconsiderate of my time. 

Example: if you ask me to go to the store with you, please just make it a trip to the store, don’t make it a trip to the store, then Walgreens, oh then the mall, oh your moms house... that kind of thing. 

One of my closest friends for the last ten years has really been inconsiderate of this for the last two years or so. I really try to be accommodating and understanding since she’s a mom and sometimes stuff comes up, but lately it’s felt like she’s really overstepping and expecting me to just adapt to her random plans when I’m already in a car with her or at her home without giving me a heads up. I know this is coming off as really bitchy but it’s caused me several times to be late to things because she just assumed my schedule is always free..

This week she kept texting me to ask her if I would ride with her to pick up a puppy for her son. Normally I would say yes right away, but I’m feeling really hesitant. The last couple of times I’ve ridden with her or hung out with her... it was so I could actually “watch” her kid sitting in the car while she was inside of a store or shopping center - one time for two hours! Another time I rode with her to get coffee and she drove instead to her mothers house so they could pack up some old stuff of hers - I was just sitting there awkwardly and we never even had our coffee together. I felt really lied to. I could name other instances but these just stand out in my mind. 

So today is the day of the puppy pick up and I crafted a message to send to her and I hope it’s mature and appropriate like I want it to come off as. 

I plan to send this: “Hey girl, I really only want to be gone from the house between 5-6:00 tonight. If that is your time frame between the pick up and coming home that will work for me. I also am able to go if this is our only destination since I only have one hour to spare. I hope you understand.” I also want to add something later to address the other problems or I wonder if I should just put that all together today.",03Jul2020,2
753,"I dated this guy for 8 months. 
At first I wanted to take things slow.
We are both around same age in our 30’s. I didn’t want to pass judgment on him for living at his parents but, I guess I should have.
I live on my own. We both have a kid. 
I started visiting him sometimes. Then I’d go home. I wanted to do things the right way this time. He took me on a date. 
I had my first red flag when he asked me on a date with “other friends” I said that’s awesome. Then later on he mentioned this other friend is one friend. He then asks if I’d be jealous. I asked him if he was trying to make me jealous because that would be a real deal breaker for me. He knew my story about being abused in the past so idk why he was doing this. So I held myself together and said alright I’ll meet your friend.
That never happened. He canceled it.
I’m trying to make this short. So I mostly visited him at his parents for whatever reason. He spent the night at my place a few times but always said he had to go back home to see about his kid. I completely understand that because I have a kid too! So It kinda naturally happened that I’d go to his parents house way more then he saw me. His parents were oddly welcoming! Which was amazing. I think I got more attached to them than anything because I don’t really have a family. He told me he loved me like 3 weeks into the relationship. I thought it was way too soon so i never said it back. He said it was ok. So One day i figured I’d say it back because I didn’t want to mess up things by not believing or trying! So he started to say he needed “space” but when I’d give him his space he would randomly show up at my door. This all seemed to happen once I started telling him I loved him too. So that confused me a whole lot. Anyway I also have a chronic illness and was diagnosed with Dysautonomia and a brain injury. I ended up getting treatment by IV in the hospital. He went saw me once for one night then left to do practice for a play he was in. He was in a lot of them which I was very supportive of. I stayed in the hospital for 4 days and nights. He started saying me wanting to see him every weekend was too much. So one day I tell him I felt like we were drifting away from each other and I felt like he wasn’t that into me. He assured me I was just emotional because I was on my period and I was overthinking.
So I apologized. So he one day asks me how I pay my bills without working. I said honey I’m disabled. I thought you knew that because we met at the drs office where he worked. He was the assistant so I thought he pulled up my info because he admitted to digging in what medicine I was taking and said he looked for my phone number when he first saw me.
Anyway, I explained to him I used to work for ten years before I became really sick and had to apply for disability. He didn’t say much about it. He always came off to me as a little snobby. 
So I’ve always wanted to try and go back to college so I went apply to take the entry exam. He was proud of me. Then randomly he decided he wants to go back to school too! So I was like that’s amazing! His college was two hours away from home and mine was 15 mins so he was leaving. I bought him a really expensive back back from nerdy things web site (bc he liked that type of stuff) I tried my hardest lol. I talked about us maybe going together and renting a dorm and having our kids with us. He looks at me and says, “oh no I can’t do that.” I asked why not but he kinda gaslighted next and we went about our day.
Well New Years comes around and we had plans to pop fire works at my apartment with our kids. I was really looking forward to it. I cooked and cleaned my place. I was ready to feel like a little family. He randomly texts me that night and says, “oh I know you may not wana come bc you don’t feel well but we are going to this party at my dads friends so it’s ok if you don’t come”
I was like oh that’s ok can I go? So of course I ended up going to this party which kinda freaked me out. There was a bunch of really rich people. They were nice though! I forgot the story about Christmas. For Christmas he said I could go to his parents. So I waited all day and I was like when can I head that way? He said wait a little while. Half the day went by and I was like well we spent Christmas by ourselves. He claims he wanted to wait bc his aunt didn’t have a gift for us and didn’t want her to feel bad. I told him Christmas is about being with each other not gifts. Now that I’m looking back I see that was a bunch of excuses. Back to the New Years party.... so, that night I said I was afraid he would leave me when he went to college. He broke up with me. He said he was tired of hearing me say that. I apologized. He said me being cheated on in the past was no excuse to say he would do the same. I said but you are doing it now. I cried and begged like an idiot. He even shoved me off him when I didn’t want to stop hugging him. I should have just left. He literally broke up with me at midnight on New Years. It was crazy. 
Sorry for the bad grammar and mix up of things that happened. It’s been 3 years since and I still think about it. I know it’s not healthy and I need to see a therapist. I was just wondering doesn’t it sound like I was used for sex? The best part for last. He told me he had been thinking about breaking up with me for three weeks before. So the night I told him I felt like we were drifting he should have admitted it instead of tell me I was just overthinking because I was on my period. He tried to make me question myself when I was right and he should have just admitted it. So he left for college now his parents are raising his kid. He dropped out of college and moved in with some chick who’s parents are rich and pay their bills. He works and she works. His dad messaged me and said he hates his son did that to me because he liked me but he really likes his new girlfriends parents. I think that family just cares about money. Who knows. His dad then hit on me and admitted he cheats on his wife and he likes men. Anyway....

We had a lot of sex. My ex and I ( not his dad lol) I feel like that’s all our relationship was based on. 
I think I may have been lead on and used for sex. What do you think? Or maybe it was just the case of not meant to be and out of anyone’s control?  Or maybe he had a problem that I was disabled. He did say I was overbearing and always tired. He knew I had a chronic illness..... 

Sorry once again for the bad grammar and randomness of the story. I’m not good with writing.
Thank you for reading. I really appreciate it.",03Jul2020,0
754,"My wife and I had our first child in late March, right when our state closed down. My wife is a teacher and I work full time in guest services. We timed the baby so my wife would be able to use her maternity leave, then have the summer off. We planned to let my parents babysit during the weekdays when school starts again, but because of COVID, we are nervous about doing that.

My parents are very conscious about the virus. They wear masks, wash their hands frequently, etc, but they go out all the time due to multiple obligations. They shop for family members, help in the community, and very rarely cook at home so they eat out a lot.

Very very few people have come into contact with my daughter because we’ve been worried about COVID. Now that numbers are rising in our state (Florida) again, we’re even less sure about having her around others.

We’ve come up with three options:
A. We stick to the original plan and have my parents watch her while we work.
B. I quit my job so I can watch her full time.
C. I drop to part time and only work weekends.
D. We hope that my wife’s school district lets her teach online, which seems unlikely.

I enjoy my job (the first job I’ve ever enjoyed), but it’s not my end goal. My wife also makes almost twice as much as I do so it wouldn’t make sense for her to quit.

Working weekends, that would mean I’m working all week to take care of my daughter, then work an actual job, so I wouldn’t really get a day off (by day off, I mean a day where my wife and I can share responsibility, if I made her do everything on her days off, that would be unfair). I struggle with anxiety and depression so having some time for decompression is important for me.

At this point, my instinct is telling me to completely quit. I know it wouldn’t be great financially, but we could survive on my wife’s salary alone.

So I'm really happy and optimistic, very positive. Very kind to everyone. I like making people laugh. Yet, some people just hate my guts! For no reason really, I'm never mean to anyone. Not even to people who are mean to me. It's not like I let myself get abused but I end things with respect and forgive, when someone is rude, because I believe in compassion and forgiveness. 

And I believe love is the only right answer to everything. God said so too, and I know because I'm happy and I love. It's true.

Why am I so happy and positive? Time leaves fast, and the only point of life is to live it. To experience it, to live, to comprehend it. To live in a right way. To be happy is to be succesful. That's all what matters. Besides life is beautiful! There's beauty everywhere! There's beauty in the flowers, in the children, in the sea, the sky, the lights! The summer, winter, hugs, kisses, coffee. Movies. Music. Friends, laughs. Walking, breathing, singing. I feel so lucky. I feel fortunate. I'm glad I went through all I went through so early in life, because I discovered such a joy and learned so many things, without having to be 40. I'm in my 20's now and I'm very happy. 

Anyway, I'm kind, happy, tend to be kind of loud and I don't mind attention. I'm just being honest here. I'm not mean to anyone, in fact I like spreading love and positivity. I like it when people leave happier than they arrived. 

But some people hate me, I don't know why. They're usually people who don't seem to be so happy or are kind of reserved. (But not always). Do they hate me because I'm happy and kind?

I feel a little lonely sometimes. But I know I'm not alone. There's someone else out there who understands. I know.",03Jul2020,0
770,"TL;DR: My girlfriend and I are taking a break and I am having a hard time with it. I feel so alone and I don't know what to do with myself.

Hello,

She is (20F) and I am (20M)

My Girlfriend and I have (had?) been dating for 1 year and 6 months. She is what I would call my first ever real girlfriend. I met her through my cousin (is that weird?) who had been made roommates with her by random when she went to school. They quickly became best friends and still are. I started dating her around 5 months after they met (but I had seen her a few times before that).

Throughout the relationship her and I have had many great moments and I fell in love with her, and she told me that she was in love with me too (we got quite intimate and I had never experienced this before, I never truly dated in High School, it felt amazing.) 

There were moments where I would be bothered by something she did, but it was nothing super crazy and I felt like I made a bigger deal out of some things than I should have. I started thinking about what kind of future her and I would have. My cousin and her are very close best friends, like sometimes I felt like it was a little much, not like they were kissing or anything like that, but sometimes I felt like they were kind of like a couple and I somtimes felt like she was closer with her best friend than me. So I decided to talk to my girlfriend about it (I did this over texting which I regret, this conversation should of happened in person). I thought it would be better to talk about this now so we both know how we feel, rather than talk about it 3 years into the future. I talked to her about how I was worried what future her and I would have and what I wanted. I told her I am looking for a life partner, someone to be close with and go through life with, tell eachother eveything and be honest about everything. I told her I felt like if we got married, she would be a life partner with my cousin and I would be left to side sometimes. She got really upset and was crying, she thought I was going to break up with her (I wasn't going to because I wanted to keep trying and hopefully change my opinion of the future). 

After that conversation we made up and kept going with the relationship. The following month wasn't very good, sometimes it would be like normal, but other times she would be very quiet and short with me, and I was concerned. After a few weeks, there was a week where it was the worst (I mostly only see her on the weekends) , over text she was super short with me, and didnt want to meet up the upcoming weekend (it was father's day weekend so I understood). Over text that weekend I told her I was sad and worried about where our relationship was going, she said she was unhappy too. I asked her why and she said she was questioning things. To summarize, she said ""I think we should take a break."" She said these thoughts were in the back of her mind since I had the conversation with her about the future, and it made her think. She felt as being best friends with my cousin, she couldn't be what I wanted and she wanted me to have what I wanted.

We decided to meet the next weekend so she could bring me some of my stuff that was at her apartment. We got ice cream and talked more about how we felt (in person!). I told her I didn't want to take a break, I wanted to try and make things work, but she said she wanted one. So I told her I respected how she felt, so we decided to officially take a break. I told her I wouldn't want us to see other people during the break, she said she wouldn't be hunting for anybody. The duration of 2 months was thrown out but really no exact amount of days, it's been 4 days since then, we only do Snapchat streaks, but don't really talk, but she said we could check in on eachother. It's very hard to get her to say how she feels, she doesn't open up very well.

I could have gone into so much more detail, but for a reddit post I felt I should try to summarize the best I can. I am very detailed in my stories and I felt some of you wouldn't want to read several long paragraphs than there already are.

This break had been really hard on me, I feel so alone, I have been depressed everyday, and cried my eyes out so many times. I'm happy that I have my family, and a friend or two there for me. I keep thinking about the past, and how things didn't go as planned (not just our relationship) and all these bad memories and sad thoughts, I don't feel motivated to do anything. She made me happier than I had ever been, now I feel that I've lost her. She was in love with me too and showed/told me that, now I feel that she no longer feels that way, and it hurts so bad. I feel like I'm being overdramatic but I can't help that I feel this way, I'm a sensitive person. I feel that I messed up and this is my fault, because I talked to her about how I felt about the future. There are other things that I did/said that make me feel like it's my fault, but like I said I don't want to make this post longer than it already is.

I worry that during this break she will fully get over me. I feel like her and I are not on the same page on some things, that I didn't explain how I felt well enough. I want to talk about it with her, but feel that I can't because I want to give her space, not be too much.  What should I do? Should I ever try to talk to her during the break? Or would that ruin everything?

I hope this post fits this sub, if it doesn't I apologize, and please reccomend me to a different sub. What advice I'm looking for is other people's general thoughts on the situation, and advice on what I should do, what boundries should I give her? I'm still in love with her and I don't want to lose her.",03Jul2020,2

781,"*TL:DR - Since I hit 24 I feel more and more miserable and I don't know how to change it. Any ideas?*

Sorry if the title seems...strange but that was the easiest way to describe how I feel my personality change. Also, this will be kind of a...rant, so if you aren't interested in a story dotted with rants, you probably don't want to read it. :)

I'm a 24yo guy. I should be happy, I should be open to new people, I should radiate sunshine and rainbows. Okay that's an exaggeration but you probably know what I mean by it. Even if I don't want to become a person who's kinda too much (positivity can be too much sadly), I'd like to be a bit more sociable, friendly and overall: upbeat.

As many - if not all of us - I have my own demons. Never got diagnosed with everything but from what I've read up on, I'd guess it's anxiety and depression - on a milder level. And a whole lotta ~~love~~ anger issues. Of course I don't expect my issues to just up and disappear. That'd need therapy for one I cannot afford. I've played with the idea of meditation but I'm not sure that helps. I used to do it but never continued for \*that\* long.

I've always been easy to piss off. Most of my family is like that sadly. But since I turned 24 last week, I've been feeling like everything is turning black. My grandmother whom I though I could always rely on told me she didn't care about my emotional state since we didn't agree on something. It hurt...more than I care to admit. I feel like I'm initiating all conversations with my friends yet these convos are less and less frequent. Don't get me wrong I'm a huge introvert and don't need to hang on the phone 24/7 but at least 1-2 times a weak, a text convo would be great - even if 5 min long. I feel like I don't matter anymore. And I'm starting to get bitter and resentful. I basically have nothing I can show I did. I have hobbies, I experienced love yet I'm lonely and miserable. My only hope I'm trying to not get hyped about is a job probably starting in the middle of July. 

So, with all this info, I'm starting to become a miserable, mediocre, worthless and sad character like Squidward. I don't want any of that. Does anyone have some advice on where to start? What practices, what habits are there that could help me get out of this net of negativity?",03Jul2020,1
782,"If you can’t be bothered reading...the whole point of this post is “how do you deal with friendly joking turning into disrespect and bullying?”

I’ve come across this all my life, especially in very hyper masculine groups I’m in (had it at school in lads groups, sports teams in university and now heading into military). When I’m one on one with a male friend, it’s chill. There’s no posturing or one-upping. We can just have a good time and relax, have some beers, whatever.

But **AS SOON** as I’m in a group of 3 or more lads, it becomes a contest. Who’s the most confident, who’s shagged the most girls, who lifts the most, who’s got the biggest biceps. Maaaan it’s fucking tiring. It’s small dick energy, but whatever, it’s not the point.

I generally have a rule with joking around...if we’re all taking the piss out of each other equally, and everyone is the object of the joke equally, it’s fine. But if there is **one person being the brunt of the joke the whole time, it’s not banter, it’s bullying**.

I’ve surprisingly had this where really good friends can suddenly start baiting me out and I have very little tolerance for it. I don’t care if you’re someone I’ve just met or if I’ve known you my whole life...**if you start rinsing me and putting me down REPEATEDLY, in front of others** I’m gonna take that as you flexing on me, it’s disrespect and you’re fucking gone from my life.

Don’t get me wrong, I can take a joke. Most of the time I’m making self deprecating jokes about how pathetic I am (I’m not). And you can make those jokes too. But if those jokes come up a little too often...it’s not a joke...you’re just being a cunt.

How do you guys deal with friends turning into bullies?",03Jul2020,1
785,"So today I woke up and found that this artwork that I had been working on for a while that means a lot to me was covered in water. This is because the plastic cup I set on top of it (for some reason) had a crack at the bottom. 

So that was fun. 

I did manage to clean it up and it wasn’t completely ruined. However, it now has this giant orange stain on it. 

But even though it was “okay” I just felt awful. 

That was the cherry on top of everything that’s happened recently. 

A few days ago my mom said she could help me dye my hair and had this color that she picked out that was supposed to be a lighter, dirty blonde. It came out in shades of YELLOW. I got very quiet and didn’t want to talk to her because that was the ONE THING I was worried about last time I dyed my hair when my mom suggested it. And last time it actually looked really good. But I thought, why not try a shade lighter. And then BOOM: YELLOW. 

And the whole reason I’m cautious is because several years ago I had an incident with a hair product and my hair did, in fact, turn completely yellow and it was damaged enough so that I couldn’t re-dye it. So I was stuck with it for months. 

But to top it off, my mom said we could fix my yellow hair by using this color remover. And guess what? 

IT TURNED EVEN MORE YELLOW. I now have areas that are really yellow and slightly darker yellow. 

It’s not completely horrible but I think it’s pretty much just bad. It’s not blonde. It’s yellow. 

So basically, after this morning everything that my parents have tried to “help” me with over the years has piled up in my brain like how I would get told by my parents and family members about my acne and even though I asked to see a dermatologist, my mom said I didn’t need to. And then after I saw one, it made it worse. So I dont trust dermatology right now. And then when I asked my Mom one day if she had acne in high school, she told me a story where she did and HER MOM took her to a dermatologist right away. And I’m thinking “what the hell??”  “You had fucking acne and got it solved just like that and I have to suffer and figure it out myself???”  

And on top of acne, it’s anxiety. I have a fucking anxiety disorder on top of depression half the tone. I have been told I’m lazy, when it’s not that simple. I’ve had to drop out of college to see a therapist, and at first I didn’t even know what the hell was wrong with me. And guess WHAT. I find out that my MOM’S MOTHER HAD FUCKING ANIXIEY. AND SHE DIDNT FUCKING HELP ME. I HAD TO FIGURE IT OUT MYSELF. 

Granted, they did finally find me a therapist that did know what was wrong, and told me kinda how to solve panic attacks. But it took a fucking month. And every day I had a panic attack. 

So after everything they’ve put me though, I just want to be done. 

I want to move away and be done with them. 

I have to deal with my Dad all the time, who’s fucking anorexic with his stupid eating habits where he can’t think straight and get angry when I’m frustrated that he won’t listen to common sense and that he repeats himself. And my mom is basically anorexic because she’ll go all day without eating. 

And then I had a sister who is bipolar half the time where she’ll be a saint one day and the next critical of everyone and everything. 

I’m just done and I’m wondering if I should be done.",03Jul2020,1
786,"So basically, I was into this theory for a while and it left a scar on my mental health as it caused immense anxiety and depression.

How can I stop this, is there anyway to attribute a different meaning and hopefully erase the old bad one?

Thankfully, that depression and anxiety is in the past now. But I still feel a little ptsd almost whenever I see the word as it brings so many bad memories and feelings. The word is “simulation”. However, due to my studies, I am frequently seeing the word “stimulation” which constantly reminds me of the theory. And it’s bad. Any advice please?

Also, don’t worry, my mental health is fine now, it’s just the ptsd from viewing the word(s) that gets me.",03Jul2020,0

793,"I (22F) currently take care of my grandmother (70).

Before Co-VID wave 1 hit, I was a behavioral therapist. My job paid very well, I was financially stable, had savings, and a promising career that was going to pay my way to getting my master's degree.

My grandmother was diagnosed with Co-VID 19 March 15th, 2020. She has 4 children over the age of 35. I am 1 of 3 grandchildren that she has raised. 

When my aunt told me that my grandmother was diagnosed with Co-VID, it felt like a death sentence. I was terrified. She contracted it in a rehabilitation center. During their investigation of the center they found out that employees were not changing gloves in between patients, beds were left in the hallways, they were not quarantining sick patients, etc. Because of this, her oldest children decided she would not be returning to any facility like this.

Instead, I was asked to take care of her. I was honored to because this is the woman who raised me. I love her with all my heart. When she was admitted to the hospital after her positive test result, they found the following underlying diseases: syphilis, dementia, diabetes, cancer, kindney failure. This is not including other illnesses she already had before.

I have been taking care of her for two months now and I'm **exhausted.** She is bed bound so she relies on me for absolutely everything. My family promised they would help me financially and that this would be a team effort. Since she's been here I've quit my job, spent all of my savings, take care of her alone 24/7, and my bills are piling. My family has kept the promise of my rent being paid but that's about the extent of it.

I am often times starving because when they give me money for food, I don't have enough for two people. As well as following a diet plan due to her diabetes. I'm doing the best I can, but I don't have anything... I'm so tired and no one cares. My aunt lives in a different state and is my mother's power of attorney so I have no say in what happens to her. Nor do they really care what I say anyways. This isn't a one person job and I'm not sure what to do. I've filed for unemployment since I had to leave my job and have heard absolutely nothing.

I don't want her to go to a facility where I won't be able to see her anymore, but I suppose this is my own fault for saying yes. If you read this, I truly appreciate you so much. I feel so alone.

796,"So I am a fairly new driver and I’m kind of slowly learning how to do adult things like deal with the DMV and such. I was given my grandmas old car last year, and I’ve been driving it for around 9 months now. The car is titled to me and has insurance and yada yada. 

Last February, I visited my parents and they pointed out that my plates were expired and needed to be renewed. My mom gave me the advice to just email the DMV for help, since she had just done the same a month prior. I though, “okay dokay! Should be easy!” It was not easy. 

The coronavirus slammed America just around this time and the DMVs across Virginia closed down. My car broke down too, so everything just got incredibly difficult all at the same time. 

I tried to renew online, but I had to change my address first. I tried to log into my DMV account, but I had to call in first. I tried to call in—multiple times on different days—and each time ALL the phone lines were FULL—so full I couldn’t even get on a LIST—so they disconnected me. This was obviously a massive issue that I couldn’t even get through to the DMV. I went ahead and emailed them, and they responded that there was NO WAY that I could gain access to my DMV account without calling first. So, I decided to just print out the paperwork and mail in my change of address to get it over with. Once that was done, I thought I was in the clear. 

I went back to try and see if I could finally renew my tags now. Mind you, it had been months at this point of just trying to change my address. I went ahead and attempted to renew my tags and I was, again, met with the requirement that I HAD to call in because online renewal was ONLY possible via your DMV account. I tried again and again to call in and ACCESS my account, but of course all the lines were full because the incompetence of the bureaucracy. So, I finally went ahead and just emailed them. I asked whether or not there was just some paperwork I could fill out and send in if possible. Snail mail is basically my easiest option at this point. 

It has now been exactly a full month since I emailed the DMV and they still haven’t emailed me back. I’m on the edge of insanity with the US government right now. They sent a confirmation message that they got my email and that they’ll “get back to me ASAP” but They obviously aren’t getting back to me ASAP. 

I want to know what I should do going forward? Should I continue this agonizing journey the way I’ve been, or is there an easier way that I can do things?? 

Additionally, are third party tag renewal websites a viable option if all else fails, or are they scams?

 - the biggest thing holding me back from going to Madison is that all of the residential Halls are full. My only options are to put my name on the dorm waiting list (I'm not too fond of being on another waiting list after 2 months of waiting to be accepted) or to find a roommate and rent an apartment either on or off campus, which is cheep and might be more difficult
 - slightly better engineering program, this is the most important aspect to me but from what I've heard UMN isn't very far behind
 - known for parties. I don't know how true it is, but I've heard that people who don't drink/aren't really partiers can become somewhat outcasts at madison. I don't plan on drinking until I'm 21 so this might be a large factor.

Minnesota
 - I'm already enrolled at Minnesota and wouldn't have to change much. I also live about 30 minutes from UMN and 4 hours from Madison. I'm already signed up for housing, so that beats Madison by a bit
  - I plan on playing ultimate for at least my first year and continue throughout college if it doesn't get in the way of my studies. Minnesota has a better team than Madison, but I would probably still enjoy playing for Madison just as much

Both are very similar so I would really appreciate any personal experience or thoughts on any of my above points.",03Jul2020,1
799,"Hello, I came to this subreddit for some advice. 

Back in May (on the 18th), I ordered a piece of Pokemon merchandise from a seller that I usually buy things from and after a few days, about the 21st, it was shipped. Now it said, that it would arrive between the 15th of June to the 26th of June and even though it was a wait, I was happy with the wait as due to the current situation. I should mention that I am from the UK and the seller is situated in Japan. Also should also be noted that between that time, I had another piece of merchandise from that seller and it shipped after a while (this is due to it being a pre-order and such), but just thought I had to credit this.

From June 15th to the 26th, nothing had shown up. At first, I didn't expect much and thought due to the coronavirus it could have been delayed or it was simply running late. But I had decided that if the item did not arrive by today (the 3rd of June), I should bring it up with eBay to be safe. And of course, it has not turned up. With this, I placed a claim with eBay, with the help of someone in my family to make sure what I was doing is right. I sent the following message

""Hi, The item, the Arcanine fit plush, has not arrived and it's now 8 days overdue from the expected delivery times. Can you please confirm that it has been sent and provide tracking information? Kind regards, Op""

It didn't take some time for the seller to respond and I was greeted to the following message

""This item has already been shipped.  It takes longer than usual. (This is a coronavirus effect) I heard that the United Kingdom needs more time, usually three weeks. Please close the request if you understand If you do not understand, we will refuse future transactions. Please wait until arrival If you wait for your luggage to arrive, we will give you a 10% discount next time If you have any problems, you can open a request from PAYPAL."" (This is a copy and paste)

At first, I wasn't sure what to think? Should I take down the claim and leave it be? Should I risk not being able to buy from the seller again? While the same family member informed me that I shouldn't do anything and leave the claim open. After a while, I was planning to just leave it open as I believed that the three weeks had passed while waiting from the eBay package. And other reasons that could have been due to anger from over analysing a post.

Now that I have cooled down, I am unsure now if I should leave the claim up. As I only had advice from one person and I could still be wrong about understanding the post and have to wait a further three weeks then already. But, the item could have already arrived in the UK and have gotten lost or arrived at the wrong address. I don't know where it can be. It could arrive tomorrow or not for another month. (If it does arrive soon, ofc, I will take down the post)

If anyone is willing to help me with telling me what to do, I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much.",03Jul2020,1
800,"Long post- hopefully you’re bored and will read all the way through and give me your insight... I’ve posted on surviving infidelity and divorce and it’s just not helping because my story is a little different 


So I left my arranged marriage and immediately hopped onto a new marriage with my first love- i was 24—

My then husband and I did not agree on parenting Views— it went pretty bad— so I left him 2 years ago — we weren’t divorced— a month after the seperation I told him I was talking to someone else —- I was honest — anyhow nothing came out of that new guy —

So In May 2018 my now ex husband (he had filed for divorce in April 2018) said we should work on reconciling — we both agreed

I still had my own place but we were together a lot — it was tough - we argued a lot- I would go back to my apartment during those times — well during that time he met someone online—‘around August 2018—‘I had no clue at that time— I got an STD in December 2019 and that’s how I found out - my ex said it wasn’t cheating because we were fighting during the times - and I said no we weren’t fighting all that time and i- till this day -‘consider it cheating —‘he doesn’t 

So ever since I found out in January 2020 we’ve been back and forth and he claims he still wants to work this out and he’s not fully open with me because he’s scared I will leave again and that I’m mentally unstable because I’m constantly thinking he’s talking to another woman 

I guess I want to know- from a mans perspective- does he really want me back— does he really love me— I know i scared him by leaving — and that I had a crush — but I just want to know if he really means it or this is something else...

I’m 38— hes 43—I was such a social and happy go lucky person and this has turned me into a door knob",03Jul2020,1
804,"Sorry this is a bit long, and I'm on mobile.

 I received a call and the lady on the other end said she was an officer with Service Canada and that there was an investigation on my SIN number about illegal activity (From money laundering to drug trafficking, etc.) She was calm, and wasn't pressuring me for any information. I was wary because I know there's scams out there, but I stayed on the line because she wasn't asking for any personal information at the start. She explained to me how I had a few options in what I could do (I could hire a lawyer and fight the charges, or I could stay on the line with her while she contacted the CRA and the RCMP.) I did that, and I stayed on the line with her. At one point she asked me for the last three digits of my SIN number which is where I fucked up. I gave her the last three digits. I shouldn't have I know, but I was lulled into a sense of security, and I really thought I was just confirming the last three digits which I'm unsure if you can use for anything.
I realized afterward that it was a scam as I was getting passed around on the phone with different people and I was told I needed to set up a ""government safe wallet"" to protect my money. I started worrying because I didn't want to set up a new SIN number or move my money without being 1000000% certain I wasn't being scammed. When I started refusing and asking questions the person I was talking with (a different person - her supposed ""superior officer"") was getting more aggressive saying things like the police are going to show up at your door, you're going to be under investigation, your SIN number will be suspended. I knew then it was 100% a scam so I hung up and contacted Service Canada. The lady on the phone gave me the information to file a fraud report with service Canada so I've done that. I've also filed a report with TransUnion Canada. And I changed all my security info with my bank and set up alerts to notify me of all activities so I can closely monitor it.

Is there anything else I should be doing? They had my name and phone number, and they got my postal code and the last three digits of my SIN.

What could someone do with that information? And is there anything else I can do to protect myself?",03Jul2020,2
805,"Last Sunday I had sex for the second time with a new parter, who I’ve known for about a year (work) and am good friends with. Afterwards the side of my penis started burning/was kinda red but made sense due to a lack of lubrication/went for awhile. Go to sleep, wake up pain still there. I’m thinking at this point it’s a friction burn. Worked out that day, swam some laps after work and went home.

on Tuesday a blister appears in the hurt area. Just one, about the size of my pinky fingernail. I flip out and start looking all over the internet trying to prove it to not be herpes. Next day the blister looks pretty much the same, but kinda scaled over with some yellowing skin. I cleaned it, applied some neosporin and a light bandage to keep it clean. Yesterday I contacted my partner and she told me she was clean, she’s been tested once every year (all negative) and that this was her first time having sex in over 3 years. Today the blister has shrunk, but I’m still worried &amp; I really want to get tested. 

Problem is I’m still a dependent. I’m on the family health insurance, and in order to get tested i would have to talk to my parents about it to use the insurance. Out of pocket is just way too expensive. I have never talked to them about sex before, and neither know I have done it. How do I approach them about this? Should I just wait it out and hope I’m not sick?

Tldr: had sex, got blister. Partner claims she’s clean. Want to get tested but can’t without family insurance which would involve a parental confrontation over a topic we’ve never discussed.",03Jul2020,2
807,"I live in Socal. It's expensive, so I have a roommate. We moved into a quiet apartment complex 5 days ago. She claimed all through applying she was a quiet clean person who hung out with her boyfriend and brought him over occasionally. 
On the second day she invited guests over and they partied and drank for 3 days. Our poor elderly neighbors have their bedroom right under hers. The man is on hospice with Alzheimer's and dementia and his wife couldn't get him to sleep. When I asked them to be a little quieter because we have neighbors and thin walls, they bad mouthed me, not realizing I could hear until I told them I could. We have a noise complaint from the office and they are threatening eviction if this happens again. 
So, I need some advice... I apologized in person to the neighbors. I had a long text with her in which she seemed bitter but that maybe she would cooperate. Maybe. Also saying her friends are the problem but also claiming they are respectful people. 
I am very worried about the 4th of July tomorrow. And I'm worried they will wreck the $1000 fridge that I ordered and paid for myself. 
I am afraid I'm going to have to live in a party apartment while they trash things, until we get evicted and she is on the lease. Please help. Any advice is welcome.",03Jul2020,2

811,"I (21, F) just started a new job at a vet clinic literally 2 weeks ago, and one of the girls who has been training me has been frustrating me from the get-go. I know she has the animal's interests at heart and pure intentions, but when she is correcting me on something, she can be incredibly condescending and it makes me feel pretty stupid and discourages me from liking the job. She is also incredibly particular about some things and I just feel like she is scrutinizing me every time we work together. It's intimidating and makes work more stressful than it already is. Oddly enough, I can have some really cool conversations with her that aren't about work, but when it comes to explaining things related to the job, I just feel like she has a huge superiority complex. I don't know what to do--I want to keep things professional and just keep my head down since it's a work environment, but I also don't like feeling like shit at work. What should I do?",03Jul2020,1
812,"I met my bf on Reddit. We usually tell people that we met on a dating app. I first posted on amiugly last year around end of June. His response was: ""Honestly, I think you're pretty cute. There are a few things I'd change though. First, I'd grow your hair out to your boobs. I've always felt like women looked more feminine with longer hair than short hair. Your hair length is fine now, but I think longer hair will make you look even better. Second, I'd fix your brows. Personally think women look better with thin brows so I'd thin them and keep them consistent all the way through. Your current brows start thick and then get thin which looks off to me. You could try an eyebrow threading salon or do it yourself. Lastly, your body needs work. So you don't necessarily have to lose weight. You can go through a body recomposition to lose fat and gain muscle. I'd start by doing exercises to tone your legs, thighs, and butt. You should be squatting if you're not already. You can also throw in ab exercises along with cardio sessions. I honestly think you have a lot going for you. Your skin is nice, your teeth look pretty white, and your face is super cute to me. However, I don't really think you need a nose job, and I feel like pink lipstick looks better on you than red. You look like a Desi girl so I recommend a belly piercing once you're in shape. Ya got boobs based on your last pic, so once you tone your lower half, you're going to be killing it.""

Then I posted again about a month later, and he saw my post and commented again.

He said this time: ""You look like your typical hot/party Desi girl on IG. I think you clearly have a body dysmorphic disorder. Like I said in your previous post here, you really just need to grow your hair out to your boobs because that makes you look more feminine especially since you have straight hair. You're pretty hot tbh. You're blessed with good boobs and your bikini/black dress/last picture that you think you look like a troll show me you know how to dress to flaunt the girls. I'm actually confused, do you not get hit on in public/on dating apps? There's no way guys aren't trying to slide in your dms. I know me and the boys would definitely buy you ladies a round if we ever saw you at a club/bar. As I said before, you should focus on toning your body, but after seeing that pink bikini pic, you're killing it girl.""

Then I responded with: ""Thank you so much for the kind words. There isn’t anything wrong with looking like the typical hot/party desi girl on IG, but that isn’t the look I’m going for unfortunately. :o I don’t notice when I’m getting hit on, but sometimes my friends notice and point it out. I do get asked out irl, but I still don’t feel pretty enough and I think that’s something that comes from within. I don’t have social media like IG so I don’t have guys sliding in my DMs. I haven’t been to a club/bar in a while""

Then he said: ""So then you clearly either aren't ready to enter the dating scene or you have BDD. Again, literally everyone here is saying you're hot/cute so I really think you should seek therapy and what not. You're getting asked out which should show you that you're not some ugly troll. I personally think making an ig would be beneficial for you because the likes and dudes trying to slip into your dms will give you confidence. Not saying you should base your worth off of that, but ig will definitely boost your self-esteem. Good luck to you, if you need to talk or want advice, dms always open! Have some confidence girl! 💁""

Then I said: ""I was on IG for a while and I deleted it because I felt really insecure seeing all the gorgeous and perfect looking Instagram models :( plus a lot of people photoshop and facetune their pics on IG. I think deleting IG actually helped me a bit as I saw less pictures of perfect-looking people after deleting it"".

Then a few days later, I took his offer of wanting to talk/get advice because I was feeling really down on myself because someone said I am average, and I wish I was prettier. I remember he told me that some people will underrate just to make a girl feel worse about ourselves. We started talking from there and realized we are from the same region and we have a lot of similarities. We started communicating everyday as friends, I ended up falling for him, he ended up falling for me, then when I texted him my drunk feelings one night, he told me he feels the same way about me. We met up in person around December where we made it official between us.

I know this doesn’t sound romantic, but it really was. I really liked that he cared enough where he actually reached out to me. And when we found out we have gone thru similar struggles, have the same values, how we can love each other at our worst, we both knew we would be a great match. He is a doctorates student, and he would always sacrifice his sleep at night just to talk to me. We became my best friend, and now he is more than that. We are currently long distance since he is doing his doctorates at another state, but we are from the same area code. We plan to move in together once we are both done with school. We were able to see each other for two months (December and January) and that was the best two months of my life. I’m planning to see him again at the end of my summer internship.

I just still feel bothered by what he critiqued on my posts because he had a lot to say, and I find it hard to believe his compliments

He sacrifices his sleep to talk to me every night. He drives all the way to where I’m at to see me everyday when he was here. He walks all the way to my door. He spoils me with a lot of food. He hugs and cuddles me a lot. When I cry, he wipes away my tears and my snot. Whenever I have a bdd outbreak, he always listens to my thoughts, he reminds me that I’m beautiful (I don’t believe him though), he tells me it’s just bdd and that I’ll feel better after I get treatment for it. He wants me to succeed. He encourages me to put school first. Whenever I have exams coming up, he gives me lots of space to study and prepare for it. Whenever we talk, we talk for hours (unless we have a time limit) and it feels like 10 minutes. He texts me a lot through out the day. He sends me wholesome memes &amp; dog memes throughout the day.",03Jul2020,3
813,"I used to live in a bigger city and had artsy/crafty friends and my former roommate is now a professional artist.

814,"Hi so this is my first post but I would love some advice.

Me: your truly
F: My friend 
Perv: pervert
H: Hero

Ok, so this story begins in 2018 it was summer and me and F had gone to a shop to get some boxes as she was moving and needed boxes to put her stuff in, the shop is only about 8 minutes away from where we lived so we walked to the shop, we got there and got the boxes and we're walking back.

We got to the main road when I looked back and saw a guy walking behind me he was wearing a sleeveless jacket, jeans and women slippers (Ik weird), at first it didn't bother me too much but I felt like something was off and I never said anything so we kept walking until we got to me and F's road (our houses were down the opposite end of the road) I then looked back again and noticed him still behind us and at this point, it hit me Perv was following us as I knew everyone who lived on my road and most who lived in the area:

Me turning slightly to F: I think that guy is following us.

F turning back: him?

Me handing F the boxes so I can pretend to tie my shoe: Yep, stop here and let him pass us

He then walked till he was near us and stopped.

Perv: Yo (I live in one of the biggest affiliated areas so men hollering is common but following women isn't)

I looked up and gave him a dirty look without saying anything and got up

Perv: How old are you

I still never responded and perv asked again and realised I wasn't going to respond so kept walking so I thought he would just leave us alone so we began walking a bit slower so we wouldn't pass him, there was now a distance between us until he came walking back towards us but I never gave it too much Attention cause I presumed he was just turning so he could go back to the main road until he got close and decided to bang straight into my boob.

Me: AH MY FUCKING BOOB YOU PRICK

perv: what did you call me

Me: A fucking prick you pussy.

Perv beginning to get really close to me: don't fucking swear at me

Me: Or fucking what

We kept arguing for about 2 mins until I screamed fuck off and just walked off and he left, thank God.

Then in 2019, I had gone to the shop to get a Sim card for someone in my family by myself, on the way back I walked past a butcher shop and I naturally look around so I saw him inside the shop (same jacket on too) I didn't think he saw me but either way, I presumed he won't try again so I kept walking and realised Perv had got his meat and was now following me again so I began walking fast until I got on my road I crossed the road and slowed so he would go in front (I planned on running the other way to the main road this time) Instead he stopped and blocked my way, he had the meat bag hanging on his left wrist and the left hand in his jacket pocket playing with something (My area is also extremely known for knife crime and stabbings)

Me: Get the fuck away

Perv: How tall are you (he always seems to ask a question, I don't understand why)

Me: Fuck you dickhead

Perv: Come on how tall (I'm 5'8.5, pretty tall for a girl but around the same height as him)

Me: You fucking pervert move

He then grabbed my waist with his right hand, he had a really tight grip considering he only used one hand and I am pretty strong built, but I was struggling to get out (most likely because I was going into a mild panic attack) At this point I was trying to stop panicking but every scenario went through my mind

What if I hit him, but then he might stab me... How can I get out... What if he r---s me...

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, a silver car pulled up with H, even though I don't recall him saying anything perv let go of me and started to walk off so H pulled away and just kept driving, I just kept walking trying to calm down and when I got home luckily only my mom was there and I broke down into a complete panic attack, my mom phoned the police but it's been a year and nothing happened to him even though I managed to get CCTV footage of him following me and I have a picture of the back of him.

I really don't like my sister-in-law, I find her rude, annoying and her personality is the complete opposite of mine. Basically if she wasn't my wifes sister I wouldn't have anything to do with her. She lives in Scotland so luckily I never hardly have to see her. 

So I wasnt thrilled about going on holiday with her but I thought we don't have to share a caravan with her and we'll spend a lot of time going out for meals, leisure centres etc plus we have 2 kids and they'll love doing all this stuff and seeing their cousin. 

Then coronavirus happened and me and my wife made the decision not to go, 1. For the safety of our kids and ourselves 2. Most things will be shut or operating very differently. We suggested we just cancel and rearrange till next year. My in laws and sister in law, her partner and kid are still going but we're not. The holiday cost £500 but luckily we hadn't handed the cash over and we only lost £50 deposit. We also used that holiday money to buy a new oven. 

So all sorted. This was also decided a month ago. 

I came home from work today and my wife said that she has changed her mind and now wants to go. She said it doesn't matter about pubs, swimming pools etc we could go and have walks and picnics and our girls can see their cousin (it has been a while since they have seen each other). I'm not happy because to me that's not much of a holiday and I can do that from home, especially for £500 Which we spent. Apparently my sister in law will pay for us as a ""treat"", but i don't feel comfortable about that at all. 

My wife knows how I feel about her sister and with the lack of activities the idea of being around her for a week stresses me out. My wife said that I could stay home and they'll go (she's happy with this idea, because she knows how I feel) but how the hell would we explain why I havent come?? 

I will admit I'm a indoors person and I enjoy my own company but I was very happy to go before Corona happened but to me it isn't a holiday anymore and we could easily just move it a year and have a much better experience. 

Part of me thinks just do it for my kids being stuck for a week just sounds awful. Plus it is my holiday too and I've only go so many days off in the year. 

Am I being unfair? Should I just suck it up?",03Jul2020,1
832,"This is going to be a long story but I have to get it off my chest because I believe a outside opinion might help me. Sorry for my bad English it isn't my first language

I've been for the past 3 years, going towards 4 in the best relationship op my life, he is everything i've ever wanted, he treats me like a princess and I love every second of being with him and can't imagine my life without him, he is my everything and I really have everything I ever wanted with him and have a good and thriving life at the age of 23 already. 

I am getting my degree in my dream job, i have amazing friends and family despite the situation the world is in right now. I have food on my table and everyone around me is happy and healthy. I really don't have anything to complain about this is why this situation is draining me so much because it's taking all my peace away. 

Dating my boyfriend I met his brothers girlfriend let's call her hannah and in the first year Hannah was the sweetest person, we barely talked and when we did it was about our boyfriends. When the second year came around things fell apart. Hannah really is a great person on her good days,she's kind and caring with a great personality but she has her moments just like all of us.

My boyfriend's family is extremely close and they always see each other and talk about everything and there's always love and unconditional support and I love every moment of it because I never really had this and it's really a healthy environment. Hannah hates that about their family, she can't understand why family should be close and because of this the only time my boyfriend really sees his brother is when she allows it and that's maybe once every two months and any other family members fall in the same boat. She once accused her boyfriend of having an affair with his niece when they went out for coffee. 

When I came into the picture my boyfriend's family were already on a rocky path with her. When the second year came around I got into a fight with her because se constantly had bad things to say about my boyfriend in front of me and where I come from I always defend the people I love. We ended up fighting about her always talking bad about my boyfriend's family and always doing what she wanted and thinking she can hurt my boyfriend and his family and get away with it but the thing is she never did this in front of his brother. In the end we got over it and talked about it and everything was really great.

At this time I genuinely cared about her and wanted her as a friend and everything was over and forgotten or so I thought. About a few weeks ago things got bad, her Bachelorette party is coming up next weekend and at first I wasn't invited, this was weird because my boyfriend was invited to the bachelors, the reason also its weird is because the bachelors and Bachelorette is at the same place and time and everyone will be celebrating together but i was the only one not invited. I left it at that and decided i'm going to have a wine night with my boyfriend's mother we have a great relationship she's like mother to me and a best friend. My boyfriend wasn't happy with this situation because he wanted me there with him otherwise he won't enjoy the night and he ended up talking to one of his friends about it asking for advice. 

The friend went to Hannah and asked why I wasn't invited and she just said she didn't know which is understandable because she isn't organizing it. The day the friend told her I had gotten a message from Hannah accusing me that I'm telling everyone she doesn't want me there which wasn't the case I never told anyone but my boyfriend and my boyfriend never told anyone except the friend and we weren't even mean about it or angry. I just told her what happened and then I was invited to the Bachelorette. The maid of honor ended up jumping down my throat for not asking if she had forgotten me and that I should talk to her about everything but I didn't even know who her maid of honor was and I only saw the maid of honor once in my life and she constantly had something to say about me. 

I left it there and then came the groomsman part of the wedding. My boyfriend is a groomsman. 
I asked Hannah what clothes should he wear and what should he get because I wanted to go buy it for incase we go into quarantine again and we can't get it. She refused to tell me anything again I left it there. Things escalated and she kept cutting me out of situations and cutting me out of any plans and I didn't understand why. She was aggravated with everything I did. When I post anything on Facebook she has a post in response to it. If I post anything on whatsapp on my status she has a response on it for example if I post ""be nicer than necessary"" she'll post ""i hate it when people act nice but they really arent"" and this happened multiple times and it was one of the things we fought about in the past. I left it there and about three weeks ago I received a message from her ""do you have a problem with me?"". I had no idea what was going on I told her I don't know what she's on about. She just kept insisting I had a problem with her. I told her I didn't and she couldn't give me a reason why she thought I had a problem. I left it there again and she ended up telling me we'll talk about it after the wedding.

A few days later my boyfriend received friend requests on Facebook from her entire family and her entire family blocked me on Facebook, my boyfriend's brother messaged my boyfriend that my boyfriend should accept them because they see my boyfriend as their family. My boyfriend asked if I'm going to get any request also because I'm also family if they see him as family. The brother said of course I will. This never happened. That night me and my boyfriend got drunk together and watched movies alone at home and ended up sleeping till the next day till 12pm. My phone was switched off when I woke up I woke up to ""deleted messages"" from her. On whatsapp when you send and then delete a message the other person still gets a notification that says ""message deleted"". I ended up asking her whats wrong and she accused me saying i'm keeping my boyfriend from accepting her family and she wants to know what's my problem with her. I  ignored the messages.

That same night me and my boyfriend went to his mother with all the messages and screenshot asking her what to do about the situation because we didn't even want to go to the wedding or bachelors or Bachelorette. Keep in mind with all of this happening my boyfriend and his brother still has a perfect relationship as it should be. That night my boyfriends mother called everyone together to talk about what's going on(while all of this happened my boyfriend's mother is being treated the same way by her she isn't allowed to see her son only on hannahs terms). In the end they said their problem with me is because of the past and what happened, they haven't forgiven me yet which was crazy because everything that happened she did to me and I just did it back to her which I admit I was wrong but I didn't want anyone to be walked over,she even accused me for being out to get her when I sat on her chair one night when she already went to sleep. but that was a year ago and I admit what I did was also toxic, back then we gossiped about each other which was wrong but  I was under the impression that both of us apologized and that everything was forgotten. We literally cried together saying we were wrong and everything was fine for an entire year.

When I asked them how any of this makes sense to them they couldn't answer me and only apologize(the brother did) . No one could give me an answer about why I was being treated the way i was, my boyfriend constantly asked why they were doing what they were doing but they couldn't give an answer.  She also said I was trying to take over her wedding when I asked what my boyfriend shoud buy for the groomsman clothes which doesn't make sense because.. I don't even know how because I literally only wanted to go buy the clothes?. I ended up telling them i'm only asking for respect from them and I don't have any bad intentions and I'm done always walking on eggs around her for the fear that my boyfriend might lose his brother when hannah is upset about anything. My boyfriend told them they should understand that i'm also family and they should accept it and we're done always wondering what we're doing wrong and that Hannah is part of the family when I'm part of the family and they're done excluding me from  everything . We're done living in fear of losing his brother.

We were in constant fear of being cut off because the only family hannah hasn't cut off is my boyfriend and his mother. I had nights were I had panic attacks because I couldn't handle the situation of seeing my boyfriend's heart broken because he can't even go out for a beer alone with his brother, my boyfriend couldn't even send his brother a message without Hannah seeing it and being constantly harassed and insulted for no reason and we couldn't do anything for the fear of being cut off.

That same night they apologized and said everything is back to normal and everyone said they loved each other. That same night hannahs mother called me accusing me of games and manipulation and I just threw the phone down in her ear without saying word back. We called Hannah and she just said to ignore her mother. I have no idea on how she even got my number. Hannah and her family and the brother ended up deleting facebook this week. She was gone for about 3 days now she's back and everything is starting again.. And i'm tired.. My boyfriend is tired.. Everyone is tired. I'm at that point where I don't even care what she does anymore I feel numb.. I don't even want to see her but I know I have to for my boyfriend's sake.. We have to act like what she does is fine or else my boyfriend will lose his brother and that will be a heartbreak that can't be easily fixed. I don't want them to lose the bond that they have.. Talking doesn't work.. Nothing works she wants everyone gone and it's causing heartache everywhere..

I don't know what to do. This doesn't affects me and my boyfriend's relationship at all because we communicate about everything constantly and support each other through everything and we're really happy but it is affecting our emotional wellbeing. My boyfriend and his brother were like twins and they never did anything without each other now they can't even send each other messages in privacy or even call without it falling into hannahs schedule..

I don't know how to handle this upcoming weekend.. I don't know how to handle seeing her I don't know how to act.. I don't know what to say.. I don't know what to feel.. I just want advice on really anything.. I just want peace.",03Jul2020,1

I keep getting mail addressed to previous tenants. There has been a good amount of junk mail (coupons mostly) but a few important documents.
What should I do with these documents? I've previously written ""wrong forwarding"" on 2 with a forwarding label to my address, to which they wrote ""good forward"" and put it back in my box. Afterward, I blacked out the mailing address and wrote ""Return to Sender"". They somehow returned the letters to me. The several other letters, I wrote ""Moved"", blacked out the mail to address, and wrote ""Retyrn to Sender"" to be sent back. I recieved all these letters back too.

837,"\[F18\] I had a friend I went to concerts with, had our school lunch with a group of friends, and had classes together. I think the reason we don’t really talk as much is because of two things 

1. I decided not to take AP classes my final year, we ended up having no classes together.

2. I ended up with a boyfriend, and my friend and I both started talking less (he ended up with a girlfriend too but broke up)

3. I made the mistake of not making that effort as a “friend” to check in with my friend group. I went into a new one. 

I broken up with my ex a few months ago, and I‘m realizing that I sort of regret not contacting them often. 

I want to talk to him again, but the problem is I don’t know if they feel the same way. Do they secretly resent me for leaving them? Does he think we‘re two completely different people than before? Does he think that the type of person I am today is not someone he could be friends with?

I went to half a year of 1st year highschool already but had to do the rest here, in France in a class below 1st year of highschool. Let's say highschool is 9th grade(15-16 years old), so I had to do 8th grade(14-15). My sister went one class  below what she was as well, from 8th to 7th.  She really wanted to go to highschool but the educational system did not allow her while I could so she has to repeat the year. Ever since she found that out shes been sad and has had some minor scenes of histeria(laughing to herself for no reason or just smiling) and I did not help a lot either since all I've been doing is mocking her and being mad at her for being sad. I cannot empathize with her since I myself am an emotional wreck, so what can I do to help her be better? I do not want to see her like this and I cannot bear the thought of her being sad all the time especially since I also feel guilty because due to circumstances I agreed to my father who was working here already to move with him because I was done with my country but she wasnt, so she also blames it on me.

841,"Hi guys, this is a bit of a read and the event has messed with my head. It’s gone to beyond silly now and I need to know, what have I done wrong?

I’m 29. The female in question is about 35, married with 2 kids.

Last August me and colleagues went out for the day for a mates leaving do. So bearing in mind we’d been out drinking all day, in the evening a female friend that doesn’t smoke started asking people for a cig. I reminded her that she doesn’t smoke and used myself as an example as to how she can stand outside without smoking. She said “yeah I know” and carried on going to light her cigarette. I lightly held her arm to stop her. She pulled against me a bit but she gave in and agreed she didn’t need it and threw it away. She went to sit down a few metres away.

A couple of minutes later she called my name. When I turned to her she asked for a hug completely out of the blue. I laughed asking why. She said she wanted to thank me for stopping her smoke. I was a bit like what, just for that? Ok... She asked if she could ask another question.  She said “why do you fancy me?”. I said “what? I don’t fancy you?”. She instantly got aggressive and started saying “don’t fucking lie to me, you were awkward around me when you first joined and I know it’s because you fancy me. Tell me why you fancy me!”. I said that I don’t but she wouldn’t have it so eventually I said “don’t get me wrong you’re hot, I would, but no - I don’t fancy you”. Another colleague got us to drop it and we went to a club. Night over.

The following morning she made a group Facebook chat where her first message says she remembers the pub we argued in, the club we went to and details in that club. I figured she must remember things. Just a general chat about the night before and nothing awkward about it so all good.

We went back to the office on Monday and she was a bit off. Her hello’s and talking to me were a bit held back on or just awkward compared to what they’d normally be. I figured it’d blow over and it was her just a bit embarrassed.

One month later we had a joint birthday for colleagues after work. She said such an awkward hello that day that I decided that I was going to call her aside that evening and say we can forget it and she doesn’t have to worry, I didn’t like seeing her struggle with it.

We went out and I got more drunk than planned due to drinking games but I remember it. I called her over and she agreed it had been awkward but weirdly she asked me why. I became confused as to why she’d been awkward towards me at all at this point but ok, at her request I’ll explain what happened. She flipped and claimed I was a drunk liar. She walked away saying I was annoying her...

We got to the next pub and I decided not to go in - I was actually put down by what had just happened. I decided to slip off home while nobody was looking. I messaged her when I got home and pretty much said why don’t we sort this out. She weirdly replied saying everything is absolutely fine, we’re mates, the office is awkward and it doesn’t need to be and let’s talk when sober. She was saying she hopes I’m ok as I disappeared. I remember thinking what? That’s one hell of a difference to shouting in my face... but ok, cool, we’ll chat sober tomorrow instead. We left it there.

Next day, at her request, I spoke sober to explain what I was saying the night before. I explained the incident again sober. She said she doesn’t know what to say and she doesn’t get why I can’t just let it go based on the fact that everybody gets their moments on beer. I replied and said oh no, I’m not saying I have a problem - I never have. I was saying that based on the office I figured you remembered and I was just saying we can forget it. She didn’t reply.

We went to the office on Monday and she wouldn’t even look at me, it was very clear something was up. I searched her Facebook to be sure and yep, I was deleted. I messaged her after work and said “hey, just know I’m not moaning, I’m not saying anything was bad, I’m just here to sort this out for good. Clearly somethings wrong - let’s get it sorted”. She replied saying that I “shouldn’t be telling other blokes wives that I wanna f*ck them, even if it is only a joke. It’s not on”. She said that after discussing it with her husband she’d decided we’re going to have space from eachother and stop talking.

What?! So a problem, then no problem, then no problem but thought I had the problem, but then found out I had no problem so developed a problem?!

3 days after that last chat of ours at 22:27 on Saturday night she did a thumbs down on that message of mine. That’s the last interaction we’ve had on social media.

So I eventually realised she said that I said I “wanna f*ck” her... ermmm no, I used the words “I would”? So she’s twisted my story completely and lied to her husband about me to make me a bad guy and is now ignoring me at work like I’m some pervert? She’d come into the office and would blank me. Look through me like I didn’t exist. We went from good mates to me being an ignored sack of shit and I didn’t get why. I was going home and crying some days feeling horrible.

We went to the Christmas ball a couple of months later, still not talking, where her husband came. He death stared me from the bar with colleagues that knew the situation coming to make comments about him being childish to me. I left our work event early because of a guy that probably knows a false story... It got to the point that colleagues were asking if I fancied a beer after work but only when I got there did I realise it was to ask if I was alright because they could see my upset. There’s been a lot of tears (to keep it short), I’m a “bad” guy and I don’t know why...

So 8-9 months later and we’re here. We had to move seats at work and the re-seating was left in her hands. Before we were at opposite ends of the same row as each other but she organised for me to be one seat away from her. On her first day came and asked me for help with work. I found it hard to even say yes and so I decided to email her and get this done.

I emailed her and literally said “my heart is coming through my chest in doing this, so please just reply yes or no” but I asked if I could forward her something to forward home to go through in her own time (as obviously work emails aren’t for chatting). She said she doesn’t think she wants to read it but she’s happy to forget it all now and doesn’t understand why it escalated or went on so long (?!?!???). I replied one last email saying I’ve always considered her an attractive friend but I don’t fancy anyone and that the alcohol just pushed our conversation over the edge that night. I said I’m glad it’s all forgotten about and I was happy reading her answer. Great, conversation done.

She replied a while later angrily saying she genuinely doesn’t care about my opinion and that her husband and her family love her and that’s all that matters to her so don’t say that stuff to her because it makes her so uncomfortable. She said she can see I’m trying to be nice but don’t be. What?!? Don’t say what you were literally shouting at me to get an answer for because it’d make you uncomfortable!?! I was just re-assuring you, you’ve literally admitted you can see I’m being nice?!

I replied and said:

“this has gone from ‘friends and forgotten :)’ to ‘don’t be nice to your friends, I don’t care what you think!’ in the space of one email... 

You said you don’t know why it’s escalated so much... it escalated because you didn’t want to forget this 8-9 months ago when I offered and blamed me with twisted words for what happened. Then your husband came to the ball and death stared me looking to cause drama, to which colleagues made comments on, while I ignored for your sake. I’ve escalated nothing. I respected your decision to have space (escalation) and have stayed away since. I apologise for being nice. Let’s remain civil colleagues as opposed to friends. I’m glad we’ve agreed to forget about it and if it’s been horrible for you as you say then I hope this puts your mind at ease a little x

Let’s end this here as this really isn’t a chat for work emails.

Thanks”

Two days later I was called for a meeting. She’s complained about the misuse of emails. Now I thought this was quite pathetic, she’s going to get herself in trouble for misusing them too but ok, I’ll hold my hands up. There’s an investigation ongoing now as to why they took place and I have to work from home during it as she does.

Today I got a phone call from work for the expected update on the investigation and it turns out that overnight she’s decided to raise a formal complaint on top of the complaint of misuse of emails. Those emails were the first time we’d spoken in 8-9 months, when she told me she wants space, and she’s making a formal complaint!? So we’ve established she doesn’t give a shit about the emails, we’ve established she’s trying to get me sacked. 

WHY?!?!? I’m a single guy who had a drunk woman asking him to tell her what he thought of her and was accused of lying if he said he didn’t fancy her... Why can’t she accept that!?!? I’m so sorry if you feel guilty but you did it and I was prepared to forget it for you but you twisted a story to put it on me and ran instead!!

I’ve written the entire event out on a word document including screenshots of multiple chats to show work the entire story and how it’s been in the office for me which also explains the “why?” behind the misuse of emails. But what the hell have I done wrong in all of this?!? 

There are colleagues who believe that she got more drunk than she should have done and thought I was attractive but regrets it and can’t face what she did.

Crying down the phone to HR today, my head is fucked. Even if her formal complaint (we haven’t been close or spoken in 8-9 months, what could it even be!?) is thrown out, I’m going to get back to the office with it worse than before because she has yet again “escalated” it!?

Do I raise a formal complaint?! Is she testing me?! What do I do if she loses, she’s going to be nuts?! My job is potentially at risk and all over lies as far as I can see.

I can’t win...

844,"Hi everyone. In my old job (job before I got my current one) I supervised a team for a year and was a acting manager of department for the 4 months while my old manager was on maternity leave. I left it out of the resume for my current position when I applied because it wasn’t relevant to the position I applied to. My current position isn’t supervisory (so the past 2 years) 

Now I’m thinking of applying for the supervisor position, I’m thinking of adding both the fact I supervised a team before (for a year) and was an acting manager of department (4 months) and I’m very willing to learn how my current company structures the responsibilities. Since at my old job I was still responsible to preparing reports, setting schedules, reviewing legal documents before they were sent to legal for final review, approving time cards and interacting with various national government institutions and international institutions for planning and joint financing of projects. 

I’ve spoken to my old manager and she said she would be willing to confirm both the supervisory role and the acting manager of department role, if she receives correspondence to confirm since my old employer guidelines give her enough leeway to do that quickly instead of waiting weeks for HR to do it. Along with the acting salary I received since she still has all the information on file and I can use her as a reference. 

However I’m also nervous about my age I’m 28 most others in the department I’m in are in their mid- late 30’s and I’m sure they will also apply even though they do not have supervisory experience. Also in my old job, I could tell those that were older than me (I was 24 at the time) didn’t take me seriously because of my age, until I pretty much showed them that I’m not just some “giddy head” young person, and I can handle responsibility (to the point that is now my fear, fear that my age will work against me to get the position). To the point that when my old manager returned from her maternity leave, she asked if she can shift some of her responsibilities to me and senior management usually bypassed my old manager to ask me questions, and assist in projects (all of which my old manager didn’t mind because she was already overburden with her responsibilities, and recommended a small increase in pay, she called it small, I call it large because 9k extra a year isn’t anything to snort at)  

What’s this subs thoughts on adding additional information to my resume and the position of acting manager from 2 years ago? Should I apply?",03Jul2020,1

847,"I work at Walmart  and was orally raped by a coworker throughout the month of May and some in June. He and I were going out a little and I was processing what was happening to me so I didn’t cut him off when I should have. I really liked the guy and was trying to condone and excuse his actions. 

I confided in my best friend, let’s call her Jane and she also works there, about it. She was infuriated with the guy and advised me to cut him off or have a conversation with him about consent. I had a conversation with him and Jane was there listening. He didn’t really get too much better and was still forcing my head down there. I called Walmart ethics on him and he has since been suspended. 

On June 30th, I tell Jane to block the guy because he kept trying to contact me after I had cut him off. She told me she had been shown evidence that proved everything that I had said about him was untrue. The “evidence” she had was I sent a text to him on June 12th talking about our future together (and that’s not even true). She is now going around the entire store and telling people I falsely accused a black man of rape(so she is also calling me racist). I went to the police about it to get a restraining order because Jane has a key to my apartment and they know where I live. The guy’s family was screaming in anger about me and I’m scared. Jane also texted my favorite manager(41M) and said “I would stop talking to *insert my name here*. You might be accused next”. 

I’m scared shitless and none of my friends can look me in the eye anymore. They all have me blocked and are siding with my rapist. I was raped, spoke out about it and now my best friends are calling me a liar and turning everyone against me. If I press charges against the guy, they could tell the police that I’m lying and I could literally be thrown into jail for false accusations. I don’t know what to do at this point. I’m transferring stores immediately and removing myself from my situation. Any advice on how to react or handle your best friends telling people you falsely accused a black man of sexual assault?",03Jul2020,3
848,"     I went into the police station to make a police report about a domestic violence case. I told my story to the police officer 3 to 4 times and he had me write a written statement. He also told me that somebody would be contacting me by Friday. No one ever contacted me on Friday so I waited another week and still no one contacted me. 
     I went back into the police station to retrieve a copy of the report. When I was reading through the report at the police officers statement was completely wrong. He included things that I did not say and he included evidence that is not pertinent to the case. He even used the wrong name in the report. 
     I called the detective of the case to complain and he told me that I either lied to the police officer or I changed what I said in my written report I called the detective of the case to complain and he told me that I either lied to the police officer or I changed what I said in my written report. When I went in to point out of all of the wrongs in the report The detective told me that it doesn’t matter that the verbiage is just different.  It is more than just the verbiage that is wrong. I was also not told that I did not have to write a written statement I was told I had to.  I wrote a second statement saying I recant my statement due to all of the inaccuracies throughout the report. 
     I went to the police for help not for them to add false facts to the story.  I do not want someone accused of a crime due to false information. 
     Am I able to sue the police department for including false information in the report?

EDIT: I am 20(F) years old and in Michigan

853,"    My 19 year old son is 6'2 and a big guy.  He is on the spectrum and doesn't care a great deal about what he wears, but I want him to look decent, ya know?

I am mainly having trouble finding him shorts for the summer.  I bought him some size 42 Goodfellow shorts at target but he said they were uncomfortable.  He doesn't like anything snug on his waist.

I don't think the size was off, just they way they are cut fit him incorrectly.  They are a slim fit, maybe?


All the elastic waist or not-slim-fit shorts I've found in his size just look like ""dad shorts.""  You know the type, with the baggy butt and cargo pockets lol.

I've seen some shorts in the window of Ralph Lauren Big &amp; Tall that look like they are cut more generously and also look more modern and fashionable,  but I can't shell out $40-50 bucks per pair of shorts. We live in the southern US so have shorts weather most of the year.

854,"A little bit before quarantine  I had the worst events of my life happen. I was kicked out of my friend group because of some misunderstandings. I never got a chance to justify myself and the group chose the other person's side. That left me really hurt since I really trusted them and truly thought everything was okay. I am a really straight forward person and often say whats on my mind because I do not know how else to phrase it. I found out later that they had talked about the way I talked and I had offended one of them without realizing it. I wasn't until I directly asked one of them (the one I felt closest with) that I found this all out.  They dropped me after they all found out I knew but before doing so, another one of them came over to tell me everything that was wrong with me.

Very quickly after I also broke up with my partner because of multiple reasons, but the main reason was me constantly obsessing and over analyzing  all the things that led to me getting kicked out of the friend group

I did join a frat as an attempt to make new friends but I realized that my old friend group joined too. One of them happened to be my grand's little. I recently found out that my frat fam  would exclude me in hangouts because I made the person from my old friend group feel uncomfortable from the ""awkwardness"" (he wasn't one of the ones that directly had a problem with me in the old friend group). Knowing so made me feel really sad since I felt like I was unwanted. To top it off, I found out that the old friend group went around the frat telling a bunch of people how horrible I am. I am not even sure who knows what about me. 

However, 5 months after the whole situation, he decided to reach out to me to hear my side.  I didn't understand that part since he already did hear my side when the situation first happen ( I felt like it was more ""for the tea"" rather than caring about me). But whatever, I retold him everything. After the conversation it really made me feel that he did if for the sake of the fam since we would have to see each other at events. He did ask me to hangout very soon with some of the fam but I can't help but feel anxious. I want to hangout but I'm scared that I'm not really wanted there.

Another thing is, I would get really defensive. There has been multiple times where I would get ""(someone from the old friend group) will be there, just a heads up"" That leads me to think that they still have a problem with me so I would fire back with "" I'm fine with them, if they are not I won't show"". I know its aggressive but it just triggers something within and I don't know how to help it

I'm extremely anxious around people now. I'm scared that I will say the wrong thing and hurt someone's feelings without meaning too. I realized that I will question a lot and overthink. I will worry about every little thing. If I go to frat events, I'm scared that the person I'm talking to already has a bias towards me. 

I guess my final question is how can I put theses fears aside so I can learn to be myself again? I really want friends but I'm so scared to get hurt again and hurt others.",03Jul2020,1

We found a standing shower, and I sat on the counter and she stood infront of me. She looked at me and when I looked in her eyes I woke up in panic and fairly frustrated. I couldn’t stop thinking of this for the next couple of days. Today I woke up to another dream involving her. (Normally my dreams are sporadic with no distinguishable people in them, just the sense that someone is there not knowing someone is) 

Today my dream ended with me and her in the bathroom at my house, she stood near the washer and I the counter, and there was a laundry basket in between us at our feet. She looked worried about something, then randomly kissed me. Right after that the dream shifted to where I was looking at the sky and I was outside of my house but I could not move.

860,"hello lovely people. this is my first time writing about this problem of mine but I do think that many people experience similar thoughts or problems.

coming straight to the point, my main issue is that I often can not pinpoint how I am feeling. I am a 24y old male, so I still have to figure things out about life. It is a feeling of a strong sensation, something is clearly bothering me and makes me feel a certain way, but I can not tell what it is. I cant even tell for myself.

The emotions are often very mixed and I feel my head getting worked up on them, often I feel bad aswell. Like in a sad way, a worrying state of not knowing what to do. But somehow, I find it very difficult to say ""I am sad"" or ""I am feeling helpless"" because of that and that. I dont want to compare myself with others, but thats what people do, and thats also what makes me think about my own issues. Many people around me often can say ""yea I feel so sad about that"" and can always tell why something happens why it makes them feel that way. But for me it is very hard because I do not know if my feeling actually comes from this certain event or not.

Lets take my family as an example. Last year in winter I visited my family and it was a rather dramatic event. I learnt a lot about my family history and why my parents got a divorce, my grandmother starter acting very weird, like losing her sanity and died a few months later when I was already gone.

So there we have a few events: divorce, dealing with family problems I never got confronted with, seeing my grandmother lose her sanity (she died of a brain tumor). This all together is a whole bunch of negative shit.

But looking back at it, did this affect me? how do I know? I feel a certain way when thinking about it, but how can I tell if this has emotionally impacted me? Logically speaking, it could have had an impact and maybe it affected me in lots of ways. but how the hell am I supposed to know that?

this is just 1 example of feeling something, but now knowing how I feel about it and how it may impact me. I am wondering if more people feel this way, I think it could help me a lot to know and talk about it with others (:

861,"I have what feels like an unhealthy obsession with some regular things people go through in their teens. I don't know why I think about this stuff so much but it just gives me this awful melancholic   feeling that's also addicting in a way. Sleepovers in big empty houses, pool parties, hanging out with friends after school, exploring the city, chilling in a parking lot at dusk, watching the sunset from a rooftop. On the outside I don't show it, but deep down I know I'm a sensitive guy and these vibes hit me on a deep emotional level.

I'm 24 and I know I still have my life ahead of me. I know the default advice is ""you can create new memories in the future"", but I feel like the time for certain things has come and gone already. I'll never have school again to bring me close to people, I'll never have the time to dedicate to chasing adventure without worrying about survival. It's even less likely that I'll have people in my circle who will.

I'm from a shitty small place in eastern Europe where there isn't much to do. There's little ways to meet new people, and I've never even felt like I fit into this society in general. Couple that with my crippling anxiety that was at its peak during my teenage years and there you have the reason why I've never been able to live the things I saw on TV.

A huge majority of people (especially the cool ones) that are my age have left the city. My friends are all chasing bigger and better stuff. A bigger city to live in, a better car to own, a bigger paycheck to secure. Our visions of what's important in life do not align anymore. I want to share the small moments with people dear to me. I want to feel a childlike sense of excitement when meeting people that I vibe with. To them, that's something that they've long forgotten and replaced with ""adult"" goals.

864,"I started off my career doing accounting &amp; consulting at one of the Big 4 directly out of college. I couldn't take the 60+ hour weeks, 100+ mile commutes, or the fact that they treated me like a dog and didn't really enjoy the work either. A benefit at B4 is that there is laid out promotion path (usually after X number of years) and there is also a guaranteed change in compensation every year (except during these tiems)

After 2.25 years doing accounting, I left last year to be an analyst at a F50 company here in Silicon Valley. The role I left for was an 'entry level' (0-3 exp) job, so I took a paycut (was desperate to leave). And now, am making almost 15k less than I would've made if I stayed at my first job. However, the benefits of the job is that I actually have work-life balance and enjoy what I do. Additionally, there is no progression that clear (not even to senior analyst) and they stopped all pay increases due to COVID.

We insisted that they go and enjoy their anniversary without us because it's their day, but my siblings changed their minds and want to come with because the restaurant is offering some of their favourite foods. 

Meanwhile, I'm here not wanting to go out at all because of the current situation. Even if we live in a place with less than 10k active cases and are continuously decreasing, I feel that risking my own health and safety isn't worth it when I can eat out anytime when everything's clear. Everyone's taking precaution of course; masks, social distancing and limited capacity in certain public and private spaces (5 people max for social gathering). Also, you need to book at the restaurants you want to go to if you want to dine in. 

Luckily, my parents haven't booked an appointment to dine in yet. I'd really rather not risk my health and safety just to dine out when anniversaries come up again anyway. Besides, we can always take-away food (Like we did for my parents and sisters birthday in the last 4 months of staying at home).

Her mom, who pays a lot of attention to appearance, told her not to remove it with the razor and that she would take her to the beauty salon. My sister refused at first, as she was scared of the whole procedure, but her mother forced her to go anyway. Now she’s done it, and said that it hurt a bit, but she was happy that she was finally able to get rid of the hair. 

I get that in the end anything bad happened, and maybe this is not a big deal but I still think that  this was completely unnecessary, considering that getting waxed can hurt a lot and a kid should not be thinking of doing something like this? And I also think that her mother getting worried about her leg hair and reinforcing her beauty idea on her child is completely ridiculous. 
I mean, her mother started to suggest that she got waxed when she was just 10yo?? Isn’t that a bit too young or am I just overreacting? Her mother also mentioned she wanted her to remove the hair on her bikini area too (but she eventually decided not to do it, because it would hurt my sister too much). 

What would be the appropriate age to get waxed? Again, maybe I’m overreacting and I should also consider that apparently (from what my sister says) everyone her age does it, but I really can’t stand it. Please tell me your opinion about this guys.

879," So I've been trying to piece myself and my life together one piece at a time but I'd like to just know whats holding me back: what am I afraid of.

I just feel like I have huge abandonment issues and trouble opening up and being vulnerable to anyone and I have no idea where to begin in addressing them.

I've just wrote out my entire post and I feel like a huge burden has been lifted off my shoulder.

Full explanation:

I was always a quiet kid, I guess. I grew up in a very close community where everyone knew each other and could trust each other very well. I grew up to a single parent who raised me and my sibling on her own. Never met my dad. Dont even ask about him. No interest in that part of my life.

Growing up I was very introverted in school. I was bullied very bad from ages 6-16 for either racism (being called paki or ni\*\*\*\*), bullied for being poorer than some (I couldn't even afford a correct school uniform or afford to go out and socialise like everyone else), for my weight (I was a chubby kid) and for wearing glasses and being super dorky quiet kid. But I always got a lot of love from my family. As I grew older, I became more reserved from my family and got serious about doing everything myself. It's like a second nature to me to do things alone and push people away and I'm sick of doing it.

Moving forward I felt like just an empty hole. Easily overlooked and forgotten. Excluded from everything I tried to be apart of. Every friend I had as a child we drifted apart. They weren't the best of friends. Stole from me. Weren't trustworthy. Left me out and abandoned me when I needed a friend most. I dont blame them. We were all in the same community of broken homes. I feel sorry for them now I'm older.

In school, I was bullied. Sometimes it even felt like teachers were bullying me or easily passing me up when I failed at things. I just felt invisible. I started getting friends but they didnt feel like real friends. Again it just felt like I was just there and not really apart of the team. Just didn't fit in and I stood out. Girls even started noticing me but it didnt feel like genuine interest in me. I became a guy people flirted with banterfuly but whenever I made an advanced I was rejected and ridiculed.

This became a trend with girls so I kinda just ignored them. The right person would come when they come and I can focus on other things. I dont have the mindset or energy to play games with people.

I was a late boomer into puberty and everything about me changed, but inside my mind I was still that kid. I couldn't imagine the idea that someone might had been attracted to me because it just never happened. Sometimes I dont always notice it because of my mindset but when I do notice it I'm just not down for it and I dont know why. These are attractive girls but I'm not into them for some reason. One time I was in a room alone with a girl and at some point I just decided I didnt want to have sex with her. Part of me was kinda scared I'd get her pregnant and not be ready for that like my dad before me and another part of me thought she'd just think I'm a weirdo for still being a virgin or that I'd make a complete fool of myself. I feel like I still have body image issues being naked with someone. I also avoid questions about myself all the damn time. I hate recieving compliments and I get embarrassed about it.

I want to address these issues and start taking action but I've no clue where to begin. I'm so much better off today than I was a year ago in terms of my thinking but I still feel trapped and that I'm falling into a pit of narcissism.

I've no interest in becoming a massively successful person known by many. I just want to carve my own life and success out for myself and for a few special people to share it with, but I think I have unresolved shit that's just in my mind.",03Jul2020,1

I’ve been such a shitty manipulative and dramatic person who always wanted to play the victim. I was toxic and everything had to go my way or I would freak out. I don’t understand how these wonderful things are now handed my way. I am also afraid to lose it all. 

I’ve been working on fixing these parts of me but the worst thing is is that I don’t really have a personality I’m used to except for being that mean sarcastic person.

882,"Some backstory: my mum has been on and off with this guy for years, they finally got married last year. Years ago he was nasty to my little sister and spanked her and made her terrified of him. I, also a girl, was his favourite, he never hit me and sometimes I felt like he was being sexually inappropriate around me but I was young (around 10) so I don’t remember.

When he moved in 2 years ago I couldn’t forgive him for what he did to my sister and me, so I was cold and petty/bitchy towards him. Often I sparked arguments which led to him hitting me, or hurting me, threatening me and called me names. Obviously I’m not innocent in this as I sparked these fights and provoked him, but physical abuse is too much. I was now 16 and this abuse and provoking continues.

 (as an example, I once asked him rudely to stop playing music at night cause it was keeping me up, I asked him to ‘shut up at night’, he started getting defensive and threatening me because I “couldn’t speak to him like that” we just went back and forth kind of threatening each other until he got up and started hitting me and pulling my hair while I screamed.) 

However, my mum and little sister don’t think this is abuse, they say it’s normal and I’m painting myself to be a victim when I’m really not. I used to think that what he was doing was abuse and unacceptable, no matter how bitchy I was being, but they’re starting to convince me otherwise. 

Recently he has started threatening to take away, and actually taking away, things that are important to me, room decorations, snacks, wifi. He says he can do this as he provided and bought these things for me and doesn’t see why he should provide them if I’m a bitch to him. He says I can have my things back when I treat him with respect or treat him nicely. He’s also threatening to take away more things if I don’t stop being a bitch. 

My mum and sister are on his side, since he’s such a big “financial help” and buys things for me I should be nice to him. 

Some more info: I can’t move out for another few years and I have to live with my mum and her husband until I can move out. 

I don’t know what to do. Be nice to him and kill my self respect to have my things back? Or continue being petty. 
I also need advice on whether I’m not a victim like my mum says, or I am a victim. And whether it’s acceptable for him to treat me that way just because I’m rude and petty.",03Jul2020,1

893,"Hi, I'm currently in my late 20s M and I'm stuck with what I want to do in life. There's so many things that I want to do and I can't for the life of me figure out which one I want most. I love art and design and at the same time I love science, including biology and physics(astrophysics actually). I've got a diploma in digital media for games. 2 years of my life wasted in military service.

I'm currently unemployed since December 19 when my contract ended(was taking a couple months break) and since the quarantine, I've remained unemployed. I was a 3D artist for 3 years that deals with citygml and such. I truly love this industry or to put it simply, the role I was given as an artist. I get to meddle with autoCAD, 3D modelling, i get to experience using a 3D LIDAR scanner which, i must admit, is *the* coolest thing I've ever done, the data extraction that comes with it.

Anyway, what bothers me is that, I truly love what I used to do and would love to further my career in that industry/role. However, I want to pursue a career in life sciences. To be in a lab, doing RnD, looking at microscopes and all that jazz. It's a truly exciting thought and I'm truly passionate about them. I really love learning. Also, it's a tight market in the design sector and I'm not the kind that'll catch and employer's eye with my track record(there's always better people out there).

The problem with this is, firstly, I've got a whopping 1.9 GPA for my diploma because I'm constantly goofing around and not taking anything seriously back then and I lack a promising art portfolio. So now, this have seriously affected my chances at getting jobs or enrolling at a university. I've been considering of enrolling a foundation programme in life sciences(since my diploma is irrelevant to get a regular bachelor's in my local U) and then proceed getting a bachelor's. I've been looking at apprenticeship as an assistant and all that but I'm quite uncertain how the process goes or even if I'm eligible.

I have a somewhat basic knowledge of life sciences(let's just simplify) and I'd prefer gaining work experience(which i believe is most important to understand what I'm working on) and learn more on the side. I don't mind studying part-time while being an apprentice as well.

I don't have any debt besides my bills and I don't have enough funds for a degree that will leave me in debt, which scares the hell out of me.

TLDR; I love my job as a citygml 3D artist(and everything that revolves around citygml/3D LIDAR) and I also love science. I am considering of changing careers but I need to have basic knowledge and experience (which I don't mind going through the long process if it gets me to where I want.)

What sort of advice would you give if I want to pursue either one? And is it possible to find an apprenticeship or an assistant job in a lab while I pursue my studies part-time. I'd like to avoid any sort of debts if possible. Thank you in advance and I appreciate for taking the time to read my post.",03Jul2020,1
894,"A bit of context, I was walking my dog and this lady asked to pet it. I had my COVID concerns, but understanding that people just love to pet dogs I said sure. She then started asking me a bunch of questions like my name, where I live, what I'm studying.. I guess it was just normal small talk. Then she asked about my career and my plan. I told her I want to retire by 35 (kiddingly). She then told me about this mentorship program that she's doing, and then asked me for my number to talk to me about it later. I thought that part was a little weird.

&amp;#x200B;

She called me later that day after a short text conversation. I was trying to get some more information, but she wouldn't really give me any. She was just talking about seeing if I'm ""a good fit"" for the mentorship program and how she needs to make sure I'm ""serious about it so I don't waste anyone's time"". She hasn't asked me to commit to anything, but she told me there's a 5-6 week learning program. Not sure what I will be learning.

&amp;#x200B;

She called me again today, a day later, to follow up as she asked to do on the call. I tried to ask again what this mentorship program is, saying ""I'm not exactly sure what *it* is"". She just said ""It's not an 'it'. It's a 'who'."" And she would just go and tell me how it would help me achieve my goal of being financially independent, and repeating that she needs to make sure I'm a good fit and that I need to be serious about it. Apparently I don't even get to meet these mentors yet, and I have to spend more time with her and she has to get to know me before I can meet them.

895,"Background - I have MILD asthma 

Because of Covid-19 my parents won’t let me leave the house. 
I’ve left the house 3 times in total since March (when my college switched to remote learning and I came home). They say if I go outside I will catch covid-19. Yet they both go outside most days to go shopping, my dad goes to work, my mum will drop things off at her friend’s house, meet her friend etc- but me I’m not allowed to leave the house. 

It’s got to the point where it’s really impacting on my mental wellbeing as they won’t even let me go outside for walks or even meet up with a friend (in my country you are allowed to meet in small groups). 

I find it really hypocritical that they go out everyday but I’m not allowed to leave the house. My mum had  to socially isolate for 2 weeks at the beginning of lockdown (she had come in contact with someone with covid-19 though she didn’t present with the symptoms herself) and during that time she was always getting angry and upset and yelling at my dad at how frustrated she was that she couldn’t do her usual things as she couldn’t leave the house 

I get they want to keep my safe, but it’s got to the point where it’s doing me more harm than good at remaining in the house all day everyday. I’ve deleted all my social media as it was even more upsetting seeing people up and out whilst I was practically locked inside.

My problems with them are that concerning my parents is that I believe to an extent they are manipulative and controlling over what I say think believe and how look also  they require total obedience from me and have said so on multiple occasions and enforced this idea constantly physically or verbally. Similarly as with my other siblings they have also turned out to be there mini me's and bassically do the same thing as them but during my younger years were bullies and often took out their anger and problems on me either physically or verbally.

As I aged I've come to realise this and have resolved to move out as soon as possible however my resolve in this cause has somewhat weakned and faltered because recently they have shown a lot of love towards me throguh being nicer and with many gifts although I must note that this is not due to them believing they have acted wrong towards me as they have never admitted any wrongdoing or acknowledged this so they have never thought theyve done any and although there are still traces of that behaviour I have earlier mentioned

902,"Im 13 and my brothers had his friend here since before this corona thing started. My house is really big so we have a lot if room. Probably enough room for 6 other people. I say this now to talk about later. 

Lets call him... Bob.

In October, Bob started standing too close to to me and that slowly started to turn into him brushing his hand on my lower back or touch my arms. Im lower than half his height so he like... leans own just to do that. In December he walked into the threatre room and sat beside me and he touched my thigh, he touched too close to my private area. 

I asked him to move his hand and he just squeezed and said it will be ok and he like... wiggled his fingers. His hand was wider and bigger than my entire leg and i knew i’d have no chance to get away. 

But he left. He stopped for and he would bring me candies from the store or buy me stuff for some games i play and we’d just hangout with my brother. Then, my brother would leave and it’d be us and we’d just play video games. 

It was like that for months until April when he started asking me sexual questions, like how i like being touched or if i ever did anything with another boy. I thought he was being friendly because he stopped touching me.  Then.. things kinda got worse. Or better? 

This is really embarrassing to talk about... but idk what else to do. 

I sort of forgot what happened in the threatre and we played a lot of games and had fun. He’d buy me stuff so I got comfy with him. 

We started hanging out more. Just us. He asked if i ever kissed anyone and i said no. Then he offered to kiss me and thats what we did. He kissed me and started leaning into me, his hands touched parts of my body that made me tingle. It was... weird. 

Things progressed from kissing, more touching, still with clothes. Then no clothes and he made me please him. It was... a game. 

Nobody in my home knows. My brother is a writer so he writes stuff for hours, my parents work from home so theyre always in their studies. 

I liked what he was doing and yesterday i told one of my online friends (we’ll call my friend Fred) what happened once... me and Bob had sex. It hurt a lot. Like a lot. but... then it didnt and i didnt feel like i was in any danger in the moment. My friend said what he did was wrong and i should tell my parents. 

After i talked more with Fred, he explained it to me and i started to see how it was wrong and i told my parents. My mother told me to go away and my father just ignored me. My brother would probably not believe me since he and his friend have known each other since they were in elementary school. 

He’s noticed ive been avoiding him and is getting a little aggressive. And now he’s scaring me. Idk what to do. I’m not white and I’m in Cali. I dont trust the police to actually help me... considering Bob is white. 

Im getting scared now, because i know its wrong now and he still tries to convince me to have sex again, or please him again. He keeps pressuring me but I don’t want to. Even he knows its wrong since i confronted him a few hours ago but then he said that he doesnt care about the age difference and its ok because he loves me but... if he loved me he wouldn’t make me feel scared if him... he wouldn’t be hurting me. 

Back to why i mentioned my big house... nobody can hear us. Im scared he’ll take what he wants one day and nobody will hear me calling for help. I keep getting those vibes that... if i dont give him what he wants he’ll do it anyways.

But anyway, as the title says, my Mother have a really big Alcohol problem combined with really bad Depressions, which means she has to take alot of Medication throughout the Day.  
Since i was a little Child i had to live with the fact that my Mother doesn't want to live and will End her life one Day, i was constantly afraid of loosing her as a kid.  
She had multiple Suicide Attempts and a bunch of cases where she Overdosed/Sliced her Hands, Legs and Stomach open, Once she fell over because she was drunk and busted her whole lip which left her in a pool of blood, fortunately i didn't saw that since i was over a Friends house.  
She constantly lied about drinking and using way more Medication as supposed even tho it was really obvious.  
Too much happened to write it all down but these are just a few instances that happened, now im 22 years old (M) and it's still happening.  


The Reason it got so bad was that my Dad left her with me and my 3 Siblings alone without paying for us, she also got abused really bad by her parents as a kid.  
But the main Reason is the divorce that happened, my Dad received the Money for us Kids which he had to pay but never did, the government didn't care and blamed my Mother for being depressed and not able to raise us kids alone, the government threatend to take us away from her if she doesn't cooperate with them.  
The Situation got worse every Day since everyone blamed it on my Mother and she not getting the help she needed.  
As my siblings got 18 they left Home immediately and completly broke the Contact with my Mother and me, haven't seen 2 of my siblings in a decade.  
One day i found out that all of my siblings got in contact with my Dad and that they were meeting each other frequently, it didn't take long that my Mother knew it aswell.  
Somehow my Dad told them that my Mother was the horrible Person and not him and that she was at fault for everything and they believed him, they started talking shit about me and my Mother around their friends and colleagues.  
Since that moment my Mother tries everything to get my Dad and Siblings to tell the truth and get everyone involved fined, she is obssesed with these thoughts and don't take in consideration how i feel about it.  


I always got really upset and sad when she were in these states but could cope with it till now, but now i can't take it anymore, im emotionally drained and in some kind of shock state where i don't know how i feel.  
Every little action that happens nowadays draines all my Power and i can't do anything after that for hours, in those times i just lay in bed and look at the ceiling getting lost in thoughts.

I thought i would never reach out to other People about this but i need any Advice i can get right now, i really love my Mother and understand what happened to her but i can't continue like this in my life anymore, im 22 years old and have alot of things i want to achieve.  
We live in a Appartment together which is rented by me, she said already she tries to move out as soon as possible but i honestly don't believe her.  
She is pretty delusional now and have no clear thoughts as i write this down, she thinks i want to kick her out even tho i said it in a friendly voice that i want to live on my own, she also said she doesn't wan't to have contact to me anymore if im serious with ''kicking her out''.

Anyways, she just keeps talking about it and it's really annoying. I was pretty social in high school but I didn't really have friends, but I guess me leaving the house everyday for 6 hours and her occasionally seeing me talk to people made my mom think I was a popular person, which was never the case.

Now that COVID's come around I can't exactly go and meet new people. Even if COVID wasn't the case, I don't have a car and I only have my permit.

She also keeps dropping hints about me joining the air force to meet new people, but she's be telling me I should join the air force for a LONG time and I think her telling me to get a social life is just her way of trying to get me to join.

I'm home all the time doing nothing but job searching and I get that she may be tired of seeing my face everyday, but I need a way to tell her to just stop. Everytime I do she uses it as a way to tell me to get out of her house or to hurry up and leave and honestly it just makes everything worse and I don't have enough emotional strength to deal with that everytime she decides to talk about it. It makes me feel like she sees me as nothing but a loser and a mooch and I've started believing that and it takes a toll on my mental health.",03Jul2020,1
914,"This is going to be a long one, prepare yourselves.

Context: I am a recent high school graduate that lives in a state &amp; city with a very low population. My parents are divorced. Both of my parents are well educated, both with degrees in engineering. My mother is Immunocompromised because of 2 diseases she has. They are quite rare, but in the US, the fatality rate of those with both these diseases in association with COVID-19 is over 50%. My father and his family are throwing a party for the 4th. They do this every year. There will be 30+ people there, family and non-family. 

Some of the people attending: 2 nurses, 1 that works in the local ER. 4 others from a nearby county with the highest number of cases in my state. At least 6 over 70 and at least 6 from out of state.

*** In just the past 2 weeks COVID-19 cases have increased BY A FATOR OF 21 in my county. ***

The precautions my father is taking at this party are as follows: They only invited 30 people instead of the usual 50ish. Tables are 6 feet apart. Everyone still serves themselves food from the same dishes, and everyone is being asked to social distance. No masks, nothing. 

Normally, I would have thought this would be enough. However, my recent graduation tells me otherwise. My graduation required that only immediate family were allowed. When I show up, there are 20+ extended family members there. It’s not that I don’t appreciate the support, it just bothers me that they blatantly ignore rules put in place for everyone’s safety. They did not even attempt to distance themselves. Hugs, close contact, etc. I have absolutely no reason to believe that this party will be any different.

After an argument with my father, I have left his house. I don’t plan to return for at least 2 weeks. My sister, however, is not one to argue. She just does what she is told. 

My question is as follows: How can I possibly express to either my Sister, my Father, or both of them that this party is a bad idea? All comments are welcome, advice or criticism. Thank you.",03Jul2020,2

921,"Hello,

Pre-corona I drank way too much at a friend of a friend's party and ended up blacking out after doing one too many shots. The last thing I remembered was sitting on the stairs of the house striking up a very drunken conversation with my friend (who attended the party with me).

I woke up the next day at the house, extremely hungover, to hear the news that I had vomited a lot, all over the kitchen floor. My friend also showed me videos of me swaying back and forth trying to whip up some kind of motivational speech (which was extremely incoherent) while everyone else at the party was laughing their asses off. Safe to say that this has made me the butt of quite a few jokes from my friends.

I'm ashamed that I got into such a state as I'm usually a quieter, more observant sort of person when I drink.

The videos made me really nervous, as they show a side of me which at first glance, somebody who has no knowledge of my real persona could get the entirely wrong picture from. The video's have caused me no end of anxiety and I'm always thinking about them in the back of my head, making me feel depressed at times, even 3 months after the party has ended. I know because of the isolation that comes with Coronavirus these thoughts have festered, and I've even had irrational thoughts about the drunken videos of me potentially going viral, as they have some catchy phrases, which is something I fear I could never mentally recover from. 

I know I sound completely irrational but I can't get these thoughts out of my head and compared to others issues I know this is EXTREMELY trivial.

I initiated no contact last November and have had some time to reflect. I tried getting back in touch with them a few weeks back with a “Hey it’s been awhile. Want to catch up?” text but they replied with a “Ok, we’ll see how it goes” without any substantial plan.

I’m feeling that they might not feel comfortable meeting up &amp; am ok with that. But I just wanted to apologize, if not in person then in message.

923,"I don’t really know how to begin with this and I’m so sorry if this upsets anyone or if it becomes a burden to read I just don’t know who to turn to anymore. Also this post is suuuper long I’m so sorry.

I’ve dealt with a lot of things in the past four years, but this past year has become especially hard. I’m a girl who has always suffered in silence, I deal with my problems on my own so I don’t become a hassle to anyone and I do whatever it takes to please people and make them happy—even if that means discarding all my feelings or needs. I’m a pushover. I’m a people pleaser. I take things way too seriously, I can never take a joke. These traits of mine have gotten me into so much trouble that it haunts me day &amp; night. This past year I was sexually coerced and abused more times than I can count by my own boyfriend, I was in a horrible relationship with a him. He was absolutely horrible to me. And still continues to twist my mind even though we’ve been broken up for a while. Despite everything he’s done I’ve still kept him as a friend because I don’t know how to say no and let go. I still feel the need to help him, protect him, and make him happy. The trauma I carry with me has turned me into a shell of myself, I am bitter and cold. Defenses always on high and I treat my family like utter garbage when they’ve given me everything in life that I could’ve possibly asked for. I also know that I battle heavily with anxiety and depression, and even though I haven’t been officially/medically diagnosed with these &amp; it’s EXTREMELY horrible to self diagnose I know I have them. The signs are there. The anxiety attacks are there—they never go away. They’ve lingered with me for years. And I don’t know how to make it stop.

My parents aren’t big believers in mental illnesses. Every time I bring up the possibility of me getting help, or my anxiety they quickly shut me down with a simple “no, you don’t have that.” I haven’t been able to tell them about the sexual assaults, and frankly I never want to do so because I’d hate for them to see me in that way. I’ve tried to hint at my mom about it, to see if she’d notice. To see if she could realize that it was a cry for her help. She didn’t. I feel ashamed every day and I constantly blame myself for what happened. Even my ex, the one who hurt me, told me it was my fault. That I should’ve spoken out louder. I should’ve. Only two other people know, and my brother—who is my absolute guardian angel on Earth. And I still feel like my story and my feelings are invalid because people have gone through so much worse, I feel like I have no right to complain and feel this way all the time. I feel like the only way I can get help is by seeing a therapist. And this is where the problem truly comes in.

How do I go about telling my parents I’d like to see a therapist? Someone who can give me a diagnosis, help me, heal me, and get me through this without telling my parents the real reason why I’d like the see them? I was waiting until my annual checkup in a few months so I could tell my doctor, and see if they could convince my mom and help me find one. That checkup isn’t for another few months, and I don’t know what else to do or how else to approach this. Obviously with the pandemic my parents don’t let me leave the house at all, I doubt they’d let me see a therapist now. I don’t know what else to do. I’ve lost all hope. I don’t even know how to go about finding a therapist that is right for me, one who deals with what I need help with. I just want to know how to approach this is the best way possible. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this, any advice is appreciated. And sorry if any of this was triggering or upsetting or if I made anyone mad, I just feel completely alone. I need help before things get worse.

927,"For context, I’ve been diagnosed with panic disorder in the past, and had been on various medication, but what helped the most with my anxiety was Hydroxyzine. You know that feeling when you just wanna sleep and not exist for a little bit? I would take some of it, have some mild ish hallucination, fall asleep very peacefully and wake up feeling much better. 

I’m no longer taking it though because at some point I got tired of being on antidepressants and all that stuff, so one day I was like “hello psychiatrist, yes i am better i do not need meds”. and she was like “ok good but you should stay on meds for a bit longer”. And I did not like that, so I just stopped taking them and never went back.

This was about 1.5yr ago and while depression has been in check, my anxiety is so bad. I mean, it’s summer (16y/o) and I no longer have any real responsibility, so I couldn’t determine any source of stress. And it’s been this way since before the quarantine. 

My chest is constantly tight, and I feel like I’m always waiting for something, or wanting some relief or to be at ease. And I need to constantly distract myself. I can barely even go to the store sometimes because while I’m walking for 5 min, I’m not doing anything. Sometimes I force myself to stay up at night until I’m dead asleep because I hate the moment of silence where I’m not doing anything. My brain just always needs some background noise or stimulation and if I don’t have it, I feel insanely tense. It’s getting more and more difficult to get that — some things just aren’t enough anymore to keep me distracted and at ease. 

The only thing that really helps is going outside into the woods and sitting there listening to podcasts, but I don’t always feel like leaving the house. Playing video games with friends on call also helps me feel more at peace, but I don’t wanna have to rely on other people like that.

930,"So I sent my real estate my entry condition report on the 30th of June, it's now the 3rd of July and we identified a number of health/safety urgent repairs that need to be carried out, it's been 72 hours since i sent the report &amp; I haven't received a phone call or email from the real estate advising when subcontractors will be available to fix the problems.

I've sought legal advice and as per NSW legislation landlords have 24/48 hours to get the problem FIXED, not just 'notify' the tenants when it's getting fixed.

- I have two balconies covered in thick layers of pest bird excrement which are a biohazard for zoonotic diseases that present with symptoms similar to COVID-19. I’m immunocompromised so I can’t clean the balconies myself. I was PROMISED by the RE this would be cleaned by their nominated cleaner but it hasn’t been done.

-I have a garage door that doesn't close properly posing a theft risk of our vehicle (it's a shady suburb)

- I have a shower door that has cracked glass and the panels of the shower door have come off the track so I can't open or close it

- The bathtub is missing a spout so I can't have a bath (or a shower)

- Our main bedroom light fixture is broken so we have no light in there

- The front door's main door handle is missing the entire internal lock mechanism, and there is a door handle in the place where a deadbolt should be. The door is also too swollen for the door frame which means you must use excessive physical force to open &amp; close the door. All other units in the apartment block have both a door handle and proper deadbolt. The gas strut on the door used in the event of a fire is completely ineffective as the door does not shut properly due to being too swollen. This poses a fire, break in and physical risk to tenants.

- The laundry cupboard is full of the landlord's renovation rubbish

The property manager also gaslighted me on the phone by saying the balconies had been cleaned because they were 'invoiced' for the cleaning and I'm just staring right at a thick build-up of pigeon shit all over my bedroom balcony thinking I'm being over the top insane for wanting it cleaned like I was promised it would be prior to moving in. I used to own pigeons and clean up their shit and I can just tell this cleaning hasn't been done.

I've dealt with delays to getting repairs done in the past in rentals but there are just so many issues that urgently need fixing and I'm just so pissed off. And what's worse the property manager even acknowledged that the owner was planning to have these repairs done prior but just let a tenant move in and has made zero attempt to have them fixed. I’m assuming it’s because the owner is trying to sell &amp; doesn’t want to spend any more money.

I'm a fairly patient and reasonable person but I've just had enough, and I want to make an appeal to NCAT because they are taking way too long.

Maybe we just got too high, but the enthusiasm and cute talk we had for the past weeks seemed to disappear and she just felt shy, not really talking a whole lot. Maybe it’s just meeting face to face that she lost interest or something, even though I made her laugh a few times.

She gets drunk one night and gets touchy with another guy friend, and some time later (after I declared I’d rather be single now) sharing selfies of themselves showing how “photogenic we are”. More on that in a little bit regarding jealousy.

After that drunk scenario, I’ve since declared many-a-time that I’m going to focus on being single and loving myself, because that night put me off from her completely for a while. I even told her I’m not interested in anyone. We would still hang out alone at times. Then the day comes when she and her other guy buddy are so “photogenic”, posting pictures of their skateboards together... the jealousy I thought I suppressed erupted volcanically inside.

Currently, I made plans to see her next week, and I’m pulling out all the stops: speakers for music while we swim, Mike’s lemonade, wood for the fire pit. All of it to impress her and one-up this guy she likes (allegedly). This feels like both an unhealthy knee-jerk reaction and a justified “survival of the fittest” reaction.

I confided in others about how I feel, and the constant issue I have remaining is my confidence. I feel somewhat inferior to her guy buddy, and I know there are reasons why I should just be comfortable in my own skin.  

That being said, I could use some male perspective on how to be my best self.

Job (1): Payments delivered late by boss by 2 weeks when I had rent to worry about, and e-mails ignored, and extra work put on my desk to make me stay overtime. 
Lasted for 10 months.

Job (2): Pay was great, but the work was not. After working there for a year, I did not have a single piece that's worth putting in my portfolio and I felt I was standing still rather than getting better, so I quit to try going for a more creative place to help me grow.
Lasted for 1 year.

Job (3): Boss kept drinking during work hours. He also kept touching my shoulders, and he smelled my hair one time. I couldn't come forward cause where I used to reside, I would be blamed or no one would believe me. There was a social event for work and I didn't want to attend. The boss told me that if I didn't attend, he would tell everyone at work that I'm mentally ill and a sociopath. The words kicked in later when I went home, I cried, and got into a fight with him on the phone where I quit.
Lasted for 4 months.

Job (4): The work was fantastic, the pay was decent. Manager contacted me asking me to design a website homepage in 3 hours. As web design goes, you start with research and wire-frames. When I provided wire-frames, I was insulted and humiliated and yelled at. He expected a properly designed website in 3 hours. I tried politely telling him that that's not how web design works, and he disagreed with me. Called me a dumb bitch. I burst in anger, and quit on the same day.
Lasted for 2 months.

Job (5): Fantastic pay, too much shit work. In the first week, there was a project with an extremely tight deadline. I spent the day working from 12 pm to 4 am. I requested a day off for that next day, but it was not given to me. Then for the next 2 months, I worked during every weekend. When talking to my boss regarding working weekends because I had to take care of my grandmother. I was told that I barely do any effort for the company, and that I should be grateful. I quit, again. I asked for my pay, and they wouldn't pay me until I sent a very professional 'fuck you' email that contained screenshots of work emails during weekend and the 16 hour day, and I received my pay a couple of days later.
Lasted for 2 months.

Job (6): A job in EU that I moved for. Employer did not sponsor me or pay for my relocation or reimburse me. I spent $3000 on all the fees, tickets, moving costs, and everything. The work was nice, the pay was nice, the managers were not. Two co-workers of mine and myself were treated unfairly while others were treated fine. According to all three of us, it felt extremely discriminatory, and we didn't know what to do. There was no HR department in the local office. We went to the HR department in the US, and we got reported by them to our managers and we got in trouble for it. Summary of things that happened is; Got yelled at for leaving the job 30 minutes early despite having 'flexible' hours. Manager disappointed in me because I decided to work during a social gathering for the team rather than attend cause I had too much on my hands and very little time for deadlines. I was feeling terribly ill for a week, but there was work needed to be delivered that week for a booth event, so I worked from home extra hours to deliver everything. When I brought it up for the boss when he mentioned I left work 30 minutes early, he mentioned that it was 'my choice' to work while ill. I was blamed for not working on a project after he specifically instructed me not to work on it. When US superiors asked why I didn't work on it, he blamed me for it, and I took the fall. I tried hard this time and I sent an email telling him that I want to discuss everything with him formally and we can reach a solution. He used the e-mail against me to fire me.
Lasted for 5 months.

Job (7): My second job in the same EU country. It was in a different city, so I had to move 2 months ago for it. It was in a complex company that required knowledge and training and proper onboarding. Commuting took 5 hours, work was 8 hours. I was still dedicated, I wanted to keep this job because I couldn't keep any of my other ones. After 2 weeks, we were forced to work from home because COVID. 2 months in, I was required to work on a complicated project with a team to illustrate something. The deadline was one month. I provided 7 different sketches, and the team kept changing their minds every couple of sketches, going back and forth. I would give my recommendations but was ignored or not listened to. I was instructed multiple times that this project is the top priority, so I couldn't work on any other project because of it. Superior told me that co-workers couldn't approach me cause I wasn't working on their projects, and the feedback was non-ideal. I told the superior I would fix it, so I spent the week working 10 hours everyday to deliver the project and finish the other ones. I finished the other projects, reached out to coworkers telling them to come to me if they need help, worked on the big project, created a weekly progress channel for more transparency. Big project failed and I was blamed cause it took too long, and then I was fired literally the next day (yesterday). When I was told why I was getting fired, they didn't want me to comment and didn't care.
Lasted for 4 months.

Now I'm here.

Tl;dr

I've been insulted, humiliated, ridiculed, sexually harassed, abused, taken advantage of, and now thrown away from different 7 work places.

I don't know what to do anymore. I can pay rent for the next 2 months before I might lose this apartment and have nowhere to live. My CV is full of short stints for jobs, and I have to attend every interview with a smile, forced to lie about why I left every job. My spirit's broken in every single way.

Is it me that is the problem? Did I do something wrong? What am I supposed to do here? How am I going to get another job when I have so many jobs in my CV that didn't last long at all.

Please help me. Please. Any advice will help a lot.

Thank you, and I'm sorry for the very long wall of text.",03Jul2020,1

951,"And to be honest, I'm terrified. There's a pandemic going on and I don't think it's an ideal time to be having kids. (To clarify, we didn't have sex during the pandemic but before, around Feb)

I still have two sisters who I'm putting through school, and one of them is going to college in 3 years. I can't depend on my mom since she's been acting like a teenager since my dad passed. Spends most of her time with her boyfriend and refuses to get a job. 

My grandma needs eye surgery and I promised that I can help her out. 

I've brought up the option that we could have my kid adopted but my girlfriend got mad. I was just thinking that the baby may get a better life with someone else. I mean, I can't even figure my own shit out. What more another human being who we have build from the ground up. What this kid turns out to be kinda depends on us. 

We haven't told anyone else yet but she's close to 5 months so she'll give birth soon. 

But yeah I'm scared, mostly for the kid, and my sisters and how they'll react. 

And I'm also concerned about what everyone will say. I don't want to be, but I am. 

I'm just looking for general advice on how to process this kind of news. What to say to my girlfriend as she's stressed out also. Anything really. Please.

953,"So, I moved in my new apartment in May. It's a pet friendly apartment so I have my dog, and she spends most of the day outside since she's a husky and I have to fight with her at night to bring her inside. I don't have a fence yard, my dog is on a leash that is attached to a hook inside. That neighbor gave a bone to my dog, and she became really sick because of digestive issues because of a disease she got when she was really young ( about a month old, she almost didn't make it like 3 other pups of her liter ). But, I told my neighbor about that and she stopped.

Yesterday, she texted me on Facebook asking if she can come see the fan above my stove because "" it's important for her health "". She didn't tell me much more about it, other than she would tell me when she comes over. But, I really don't feel comfortable having her in my apartment. I do plan on going to see her later tonight to ask what's so important. I don't know what I should do, because I really feel like she only wants to come over to check my things and I don't feel comfortable.

What should I do?

We enjoyed it and planned a third one. We agreed to stop talking today.

She said she felt she was wasting my time and I told her that I knew what I was getting into. A few weeks ago, I told her the same thing a few weeks ago too and I consider it’s my fault I’m feeling this way. I feel angry, sad and disappointed. Not at her but at me. I knew she wouldn’t like me but I still caught feelings and everything. I really didn’t plan it. I don’t want to see her anymore. I don’t want to talk to her but I can’t but feel like an asshole because of that. She still has my favorite book and I have hers. I told her I’d send it through mail (She also lives an hour and a half away) and to do whatever she wants with my book.

964," 

Hey...

I'm  desperate. I cannot break out of a negative thought pattern that I am in. I've had problems in the past, but never have I  felt this severely at the end. I was just graduating college when the virus hit and I was planning to move out of the US. It's impossible now.  My family is abusive and I have a terrible time keeping friendships. I  don't have anyone I trust and don't have anyone to talk to. I've been  locked up in my apartment for months and I legitamently feel like it's  giving me brain damage. If there was a camera in this place I would have  some spectacular clips for youtube because I look fucking insane.

Does  anyone know a place where I can move to get away from negativity and  just live a simple life? I have considered being a monk and living in  India. I am looking for the best place to be in the US. I just need a  place to go and relax for a bit and let my brain heal. I have been self  medicating with weed nonstop and recently decided to let it go about a  week ago. The cravings to just give up and start getting high again are  very strong. I would like to live in place like california or florida or  something where there is great weather and nature. I have $4,000 saved  and I don't have any income. I have a bachelor's in psychology with a  minor in sociology. I'm ready to get a job, but my mind keeps telling me  that if the only thing I do in life is get a job that feeds me and pays  rent then it's not worth living out. I want to do something that has an  impact and help people. I want to do something everyday that makes me  hate the fact that we have to sleep. Right now in my life I wish I could  just sleep forever.

TLDR; Where is a good place to live in the US to heal a depressed brain?",03Jul2020,2

967,"so because of covid i lost my job of 2 years and i had no savings at the time...it seems this was also the case for many people in my country .My government came up with the idea of income support for the months of april ,may and june, for people who lost their jobs or were suspended without pay or had been withheld pay during this time and i applied immediately(i applied for April and may)..

months went by and i had not heard anything back from them so i was pretty sure i was not going to receive anything.I was bummed out but i knew i would find a way to make ends meet...

At the beginning of last month i'd applied for a job and got a call back, two interviews later i was told i would be informed regardless of whether i got the job or not..2 weeks went by and no call so i thought i didn't get it but then they called and said i got the selected for the job and would call during the week to explain job process...2 weeks goes by and still no call back and i'm starting to question if i really did land the job...i did however get a email from hr asking for consent on a form but that was it...i emailed them back to do a follow up but they never replied...so i just kept waiting and questioning whether i have a job or should i keep applying for others...

recently i was trying to pay some bills and decided to check how much money i had left in my account and lo and behold there it was i'd received income support for april and may,shocked and grateful i started to pay off somethings. then i wondered should i apply for june as well? 

the deadline for june application is july 7th and i kept thinking about my job situation and how they weren't calling me back but i think i have a job? but i don't really?

would it be wrong if i applied for income support even though i have a job kinda sorta but not really? 

i'm just worried that if i dont apply and miss this opportunity ,the job might fall through and i wont have anything to fall back on since their being so unresponsive with me...

or if i do apply i'm being greedy and exploiting this support because i did get selected for the job even if their being very late with their responses towards me?

ps.the income support i have received should last me a good while if i'm being responsible with it but if i have learned anything  this year is that things may go shit real quick and i wont even see it coming...

so what should i do?",03Jul2020,1

I realised what happened when I hear them laughing about it and complaining about the smell, just standing over it

I ask him to clean it, but am ignored, which is pretty usual, go up to clean it up myself, He slams the door in my face and says he’ll clean it, if you’ve ever lived with him, he’s the sort that won’t bother to clean anything or tidy up after himself unless it benefits him or he is threatened with having the internet turned off 

Anyway, I’m just annoyed with him at this point and tell him to get out of my way, he holds the door closed and replies with “oh go away, you spastic” and then says “you shouldn’t even be here”

I’m furious at him and scream at him to fuck off, but after, I’m just overwhelmingly....sad is the only word that comes to mind at the moment 

I’ve always been insecure about my disability and how others see me, it affects everything in my life, my work, relationships and trying to find independence and having my own home and not having to rely on other people all the time, it does worry me how I’d cope with being on my own, but I want it so badly

He’s an intelligent boy, has a very good grasp of vocabulary so I’ve no doubt this was deliberate, we don’t always get on, but I never thought he thought so little of me, he hasn’t said anything since, he can be selfish but I wouldn’t have pegged him as deliberately cruel in any way, I can cope with it when strangers say things, but I thought he didn’t mind it

TLDR: Girlfriend performs succ and kinks, but don't let me touch her genitalia, not even through clothing

&amp;#x200B;

This post gets automatically removed from relevant subreddits, which is why I post here :(((

\------------------------------------

So, me and my girlfriend have been dating for around 4 months, and everything is going very well. However, everytime I try to touch her near the genitalia even with her having pants on, she pushes my hand away saying ""no"", and no explaination is given when I ask. The same when I touch her torso beneath clothing. Therefore, we haven't had intercourse yet, and I havn't even seen her genitalia. I am able to touch everywhere else with clothing without resistance. What confuses me is that she is very willing to perform (and even likes to do) succ, hand, and my various kinks. I can even feel through clothing her n\*pples to be hard when we cuddle.

It has to be said that she never had sexual experience with anyone else before (this is known to be a fact). Neither is she seeing any other guy (Extremly sure). She is not religious or sexually conservative either (by statement). She used d's and vibrators before, and even one where I could remotely control the vibrations. Before we became a couple, she stated that she found vaginal sexual interc\*urse disgusting, but she never said anything about not wanting even touch down there. She is known to be insecure about her body.

It's unlikely that she is using me for money or favors or whatever, which I would've suspected, if not for the fact that she gives me more gifts than in reverse.

My brain can't understand why she acts in this way. I feel like a simp c\*ck when she doesn't give me access to her private parts. I'm going to confront her soon, but I thought it might be a good idea to ask first. Be honest with me. I am blackpilled and don't want any bluepilled lies. Please help me understand, and give me advice on how I can get what I want. Thanks a lot. (\^-\^)",03Jul2020,1

(Also Seth and I go way back and he's 100% gay so it's not a love triangle haha).

I don't want to be dick to my roommate, but I feel like it might be imposing of me to ask to bring another person to Kyle's small family BBQ. Also, I wanted more time to hang out with Kyle one on one, and get to know his family better. If my roommate comes, I'll need to spend a lot of time with him since he won't really know anyone else there.

Seth and Kyle get along and have hung out a bit when I've invited Kyle over, but they don't know each other well or talk outside of when Kyle comes by to see me.

Me and my roommate never had any definite plans to do something for 4th of July since we are in a high floor apartment building with no yard, and neither of us have been very into holidays, so I assumed he wouldn't care if I was gone for 4th of July. I guess he does...

I will say at once that I don't speak English very well, so I apologize for the mistakes. 
Recently a person very close to me said that he wanted complete openness in the relationship, and also wanted to know if there was anything in my past that he person should know. Not in order to change his attitude towards me or draw any conclusions, but for the reason that the more you know a person, the more you trust her. 
I thought, and came to the conclusion that this person knows most of these things, but there are some that no one knows about. I'm very afraid to tell him about these things, because they seem too crazy to me, although there is nothing SO awful about them. I really don't know if I should say, I want to, I really want to tell about everything, but I'm afraid of condemnation from this person, although I understand that his attitude towards me won't change, because these things have been around for a long time.

983,"This past year has been horrible beyond words.  I’ve been dealing with horrible depression for almost a year.  First my dad committed suisyde (don’t want the helpline auto mod showing up).  This led me to become a hermit.  Then shortly after I met someone completely evil who knew what I was going through.  He would leave letters at my door anonymously that were essentially death threats.  This person somehow figured out who all my friends from three states away were and threatened to torture them with fire, as well as me, unless I did what he said.  It took seven months before the police found the guy.  So yes I lived in fear.  There were also bullies in a college frat (who’ve now been kicked out of that frat for being so horrible to multiple people) who told me to “follow my dad’s footsteps for the benefit of society”.  I ended up failing out of college due to all this stress and now I can’t even get aroused sexually or even be excited.  Need some advice to get myself out of this chasm I’ve fallen into.

991,"I [19M] have this online friend [17F] of mine that’s been going through some stuff lately. I’ve been trying to help her with her mental health. 

I used to be in a pretty dark place myself, and I understand a lot of what she’s going through. I’ve had to talk her out of suicide twice, and she has been self harming a lot.

I used to cut too, but I eventually stopped. At first her self harming wasn’t that bad and I was trying to get her to stop, but after her most recent suicide attempt, one of her other friends cut all ties with her. She freaked out and she’s even more scared and sad and angry than ever. Ever since then, her self harming has gotten a lot worse, and she doesn’t even want to stop anymore. She romanticises the act of cutting and thinks her problems aren’t valid because she isn’t doing it enough. 

I tried to talk her out of this dangerous mindset, but she wouldn’t listen. I got her to promise she wouldn’t do more than 15 cuts per day (The worst I ever did) That promise went out the window, as she cut herself almost 30 fucking times because her sister said some mean things about her. Her sisters a bitch, and I know the pain she’s going through, but she lets the wrong people get to her too much. She gets so sad and so angry over nothing. I get it, I used to be like that, but if she keeps going like this, she’ll be worse than I ever was. 

Recently, she told me that she’d been self harm free for about a week. I started congratulating her, but she got all angry for some reason and said she was going to start cutting again, and there was nothing I could do to stop her. I feel awful, because she got my hopes up, and then instantly dashed them. 

A while after this, she started getting really mad at me whenever I said anything remotely nice about her, and said that if I didn’t say that she was a horrible person, she’d stop talking to me. I tried to calm her down, but she kept pushing me and all of the pent up anger I have at her kind of came out. Im not normally an angry person, but Ive been so patient with her for so long, and I just lashed out. I got so angry that I went really quiet and said some pretty hurtful things. Afterwards, I tried to convince her that I didn’t mean what I said but she didn’t believe me, and tbh, I’m not sure I believe myself either. 

This has made me start to think, and look back. I think the reason I blew up like that is because this isn’t the first time she’s acted in a manipulative manner to me. She says this kind of stuff a lot actually, but I turn a blind eye to it because she normally acts so nice and sweet and talks about how I’m her best friend and the only good thing in her life. 

For example, a few weeks ago she was threatening to kill herself, and nothing I said would convince her otherwise. After trying to talk her out of it for a full day and failing, I threatened to call emergency services if she tried. She’s terrified about her parents finding out about her mental health, so she said she wouldn’t do it. More recently, she admitted to me that she only said that to shut me up and tried to OD later that night. I felt awful, and asked her if I’d made the right decision not calling emergency services. She then got all angry again, and said that if I’d done that, she would’ve killed herself before anyone got there, and that she would die hating me. That was the first time I really realised how manipulative she’s been being to me, and it was only the other day that I realised exactly how long it’s been going on. 

She tends to alternate between constantly messaging me, calling me and just generally never leaving me alone, to suddenly saying she needs some alone time and disappearing for several days or weeks. I’m a major introvert, and speaking to her is particularly exhausting, so I frequently feel like I need some alone time, but because of her history, even when I really need some alone time, and can’t be bothered talking to anyone, let alone her, I feel like I have to just to make sure she’s safe.

I’m starting to feel like this friendship is really unhealthy. The whole friendship feels really intense and unstable, I feel like I alternate between caring a lot about her, to never wanting to speak to her again. I’ve spoken to one of my close IRL friends about it, and she said that I should cut my online friend off. I’m starting to consider it, but after her other friend abandoned her, I’d feel awful if I did the same.

I’m not sure how to deal with this situation, can someone please give me some advice?

992,"Hey r/advice, I’ve been trying to go as clean and ethical as I can with most everything, whether it be or with the food I eat, the soap and shampoo I use, and the clothes I wear. I try not to drive myself insane, but I do make a point to do some research look for things like organic materials, no animal testing, and for the most part made in America. I don’t do the latter because I refuse to use anything not American-made, but because I know that most products made overseas are made unethically. 

I’ve been taking everything one day at a time instead of completely overhauling my lifestyle, but I still can’t shake the feeling that I’m a bad person for using products made in sweatshops or not ethically produced as a whole. I’m overwhelmed by just HOW MANY stores and businesses use unethical means in some way, and while I realize that finding a 100% ethical business is impossible, it still makes me upset. 

I am aware of the harsh reality that while sweatshops, especially those that employ children, are despicable, it is the best option for millions of people in those areas of the world and outlawing them would cause disaster, and has done so in the past. 

I also recognize that there are good people who work at these companies, whether it be businesspeople who have looked up to these companies since they were kids (ironic, I know) or just your local cashier working to feed his or her family, and doesn’t have the option of working for or doesn’t even know of the existence of a more ethical company, because they have much more important matters on their hands.

My result was 148. My school didn't want to believe it, so they made me take another test (With my school counselor) My result was 149. Then, after that, they started treating me like complete shit (Punishing me for things i didn't do, etc.) So i got expelled 28 days out of a month.   
When i came back, some teachers assaulted me (Wanted to take my phone away from me, bumping me into radiators and tables) With my mother watching. She was in shock. Then they reported me to the police for hitting them. I still have a trial.   


Ok. Next year. Same shit. Another high school. Treating me like shit, everything as usual. I totally despise school right now. But i found my dream job. So i started playing League about 1.5 years ago, and quickly found playing professionally was what i wanted to do for a living. (Either that, or streaming.) The thing is; I don't have a good pc. I really want to stream, make content, etc, but it's really difficult when you phisically can't do it. People are telling me to get some studies first.   
The thing is; *I'm already really late to the party.* I should be playing on a high level right now, and i'm stuck in Medium elo. I'm really confused, my depression and anxiety just makes things worse. I also got rejected by my crush a while ago, and i'm still sad about it.

1002,"My father just passed away two days ago and he has a house that will be inherited by my brother and I. I am currently living in the house and my brother lives in a different state. I want to be fair to him but I also want to be fair to myself in both the near future and long term, and I'm not sure what the best way to go about that is. He also wants to be fair but doesn't know his options.

The house was last appraised in 2016 for \~$415k, current online estimates have it around $550k (not sure how accurate those would be), and the outstanding mortgage is roughly $350k.

My thoughts on our options were:

1. Sell the house and split the profit equally after accounting for all fees (not ideal for my situation).
2. He moves into the house and we split the mortgage payment equally (not ideal for his situation).
3. We keep our living arrangements as they are now, but then that raises questions about the mortgage payments and equity. 

* Do I ""buy him out"" right now for what he'd get right now if we sold ($550k - $350k - fees = ??) and I continue making 100% of the mortgage payments. If the house goes up, he would lose out on additional equity. I can't afford to pay him outright and I would pay him slowly over time or when we sold the house, whichever we agree to. Some of that could be payed via my portion of other assets, like a car worth $10k that he wants.
* Does he pay 50% of the mortgage payments (which he probably can't afford right now) and would gain any increase in equity.
* Do we do it as a ratio of available equity now, and he would get that same ratio of equity in the future when we sell?

My dad said he signed up for a loan forgiveness insurance policy recently (in the last 2 months or so) but we haven't been able to find any paperwork, or if that policy has even gone into effect yet, so we're not counting on that at the moment.

My dad thought he had a life insurance policy that would take care of everything, but it turns out it is an Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment policy. He is a military veteran who died from COVID-19, so of course his policy isn't going to pay out. I believe there may be programs that can help us delay the mortgage payments for a few months, but that's something on my list of a million things I need to do right now.

This is exhausting because I am overly aware of everything I say and do ALL the time, and I observe how others behave and respond to things so I can think about the psychology behind their actions so I can mimic it.

 I hate being unsure of how my personality and behaviour will be when I wake up. The fact that I overthink this so much is exhausting. That things like response dont come naturally is exhausting. Being insecure is exhausting. I am scared to like someone again because of this, but I dont want to be lonely.

1016,"Edit: 29M and live in the US.

I have name that is a combination of my parents wanting to memorialize themselves and their families into their offspring. My name looks like “F Scott Ernest Key Fitzgerald”. The “F” is literally just that, the letter “F” - it’s not shortened for anything. The “Key” is my mother’s maiden name. That’s what it looks like on my birth certificate.

My Social Security Card does not have the “F” on it and the SSC was made at the time of my birth, so we can only speculate how it got omitted.

When I do taxes, I omit the “F” because otherwise the system will balk because it can’t match the name correctly.

When I was under 16, I got a US passport and that also does not have the “F” on it. This passport has since expired.

I moved to a different state about 6 years ago and got a new driver’s license. My driver’s license has my name as “Scott E Fitzgerald”, which just adds to this bungle.

Generally, this has never been an issue. Places that needed two forms of ID didn’t care when they saw that the “F” was missing from the SSC and they’d process the form without the “F” on it. For example, in order to get a US passport, you need to supply both your birth certificate and SSC. In hindsight, if there was any issue with a mismatched name, that’s one place where it should’ve been noticed.

Recently, when I tried applying to a government job, they turned me away saying the names on the birth cert, SSC, and driver’s license must match. When I’ve tried to get my name fixed on my driver’s license, the DMV turned me away for the same reason, the names on my SSC and BC must match.

I called up the Social Security Administration in my state, and their advice was to get my birth certificate amended to remove the “F” and that would require me to undergo a name change and provide two supporting documents with the “F” on it. My mother graciously saved most documents from when I was a child, and all the documents list me as “Scott E Fitzgerald” so I’m a bit out of luck there. It seems like the only place that knows that I have the “F” is the hospital where I was born.

The alternative would be to get the “F” put back on my driver’s license and then use that and my birth cert to get the “F” put on my SSC, but that circles back to the DMV issue.

So, my question is, what do I do? I feel like I’m caught in a Catch-22.",03Jul2020,1

This seems confusing, but here's the kicker: it's *suuuper* kinky. Really, *really* weird stuff. Some hentai in there too. And I don't know what the heck to do.

1019,"My ex (23M) and I (23F) broke up 3 years ago but I still see him regularly because we are in the same group of friends. We dated for 6 months but he wanted it to be open relationship, I didnt, I kissed someone else, he didnt like it. We broke up but we were on and off for about a year and a half at least. Important to note this relationship was so toxic that it triggered my anxiety and depression. He started dating a girl from my school which really bothered me especially when I had to see them together. In the meantime, when I went to uni I met this guy (26) we would always make out when we were drunk but were really good friends when we were sober (nothing happened while I was with the other guy). After 4 years we decided to put our different life ideologies aside and start dating. I've never been happier in my life, I wouldnt change this guy for 1million dollars. But when I saw my ex longing after his now ex and knowing that there is a possibility of then getting back together I almost started crying and left the place we were at.

idea of the timeline

1.	⁠Brandon and Malori had a thing, it didnt work out
2.	⁠Audrey got with Brandon at somepoint
3.	⁠Malori felt like her side wasnt taken because her friend is dating her ex and I were hanging out with them
4.	⁠Audrey and Brandon break up
5.	⁠Malori no longer wants to hang out with you and calls me an awful person
6.	⁠I get upset and yell at her



I have this one friend Malori 28F she dates a lot of different people and usually has a new relationship every month. I met Brandon 25M and Audrey 26F a year ago also. Brandon and Malori had hooked up, but he was kind of a fuckboy and led girls on. She said he was manipulative, but because he wasn't outright abusive, I didn't stop being around him, but I never hung out with him on one.

I would go over to his house and watch tv or drink on weekends because I was good friends with Audrey before they dated. Malori was upset that Audrey chooses Brandon. Even though Audrey was texting and talking to Malori to hang out while she was dating Brandon trying to be an excellent friend to Malori, she was still furious. She would see on snap she was hanging out with Brandon instead of her, and this made her sulk for weeks.

Audrey and Brandon broke up because he was creepy. I told Malori about this, trying to her Audrey and me to hang out. She went off on me saying I betrayed her and that im a bitch for choosing the Brandon side. She said she never wants to hang out with me anymore because she told me he sucked. I told her I never hang out with him one on one and I was just trying to chill with my friend group(cause usually more people would be there)

She told me im an awful friend for picking his side, and I got on the phone and screamed at her. I told her this is not my fault and to go fuck herself because I didn't date him or have anything to do with there relationship; also, she never dated him officially. Also, while this was going on, I texted her while they were dating if she was okay. I told her this is why no one likes her with this pity party bullshit. Was i overreacting for screaming at my friend?


tl;Dr: My friend Malori had issues with my friend Audrey dating an ex-fling Brandon and me hanging around them. She said I was a bad friend because I didn't pick her side even though Brandon just lead her on, and I wasn't dating him, so I got mad at her.",03Jul2020,1
1023,"hi, i'm a 21 year old woman who is currently going through the biggest breakup of my life, as well as a kind of intervention-type situation with my best friends/roommates who don't want to live with me anymore due to emotional strain on our relationships.

that's kind of a lot (or at least it feels like it, what with everything else going on in the world these days), so i guess to clear things up, my girlfriend and i had just moved into a 3 bedroom apartment together with my two best friends who are a couple, and another one of my close friends. we'd been dating for about 6 months. 

the confusing part about that, i guess, is we still very much love each other, but we can't be together.  it's just not really the right time in our lives i guess, but my emotions have been totally off-the-wall uncontrollable because i have to live with her (and the rest of my roommates) until my new apartment is available to move into. we've been switching off between the bed and the couch, and it's really civil; there's no bad blood whatsoever. we still play video games and watch anime together and go places, too.

we had a really codependent relationship (mostly from my side) and i need to grow more, admittedly. i basically just have a lot of dependency issues on both her and my roommates (whom i've lived with for 4 years) and it all just came to a head. which i get. it's totally understandable *not* to want a 21 year old daughter when you're the same age and she's really just supposed to be your friend, anyways.

so i'm moving out of the three bedroom place and moving into my own place in about a week and a half. 

my roommates, ex and i all think that this is the best way to save our relationships (as friends, of course) but i kind of feel... left out in the cold for some reason? we still have good times together, and my ex and i are still best friends, so it's really confusing my emotions, i think. i'm not sure how to react to all of this, or even if the way that i'm reacting is the right way TO BE reacting, at that. i'm just really dumbfounded. i feel like i'm on my own. i've never actually lived *by myself* since i ran away from home my senior year of high school, when i moved into my best friend's house to escape my abusive family situation. the feelings of abandonment are real, but at the same time (logically) i know that's not what's happening. emotionally though, it's wholly different. i feel like everything is just happening around me and all i can do is sit and watch. i've been getting behind on my schoolwork, and everything seems kind of pointless now. i've started therapy at least, and i really *do* want to get better for my friends and anyone else later on down the line that i might meet and love, but it's... hard to be a person right now.

so i guess i'm really asking for advice on:

\- living by myself for the first time

\- getting over the person who i really thought (and still kind of think) was the love of my life

\- preserving my friendships/being better at being a person

\*(also as like an added optional question: is there any hope left for me and this girl? thanks.)",03Jul2020,3

1027,"Short story: both of my parents are terrible, they aren't capable of thinking about anyone but themselves, they lack emotional maturity and traits normal parents should have.

My parents are 6 years after the divorce in which I moved in with my father and my younger ( now 14yo) sister has left to live with my mother. Years later my father found another( lovely) woman with a daughter from previous marriage ( now 9yo) and my mother met a guy with whom she had a daughter( my half sister, now 5yo) and I thought that I honestly had oy three sisters.

Apparently I was wrong, I'm currently at my mother's place taking my 14yo sister with me back to my home country, to give her a normal, stable and peaceful life she deserves. I'll be optaining partial guardianship over her, because my mother told me that she won't cause me( more) problems after she has completly fucked up. In the heat of the moment my mother told me that 13 years ago( year and couple of months) she got pregnant again, and my father not wanting another child told their that he does not want the child and my mother if she wants to stay with him, myself and my sister, has to ""get rid of"" said child. Since my mother is personally against abortion it was obvious to her that she wants to give birth. Thankfully she had a friends who were trying years for a child, unsuccessfully, and said friend told my mother that she would adopt the daughter my mother gave birth to. Basically my mother went to the hospital to give birth under her friend's name( which I know is like totally illegal) and their lives go on. My mother came back to me and my sister in my country and as I vividly remember that was a time when it all went down hill and started to fuck up. My father doesn't know about his 3rd biological daughter, and until today the only people who knew were adoptive parents of my sister and my mother.

Now that I'm taking my 14yo sister away from my mother, back to our home city, to at least give this broken child some normalcy. My father will help us at the beginning but he explicitly said that he doesn't want the full custody of my sister as she's troubled child so we will try to somehow make it right.

Knowing right now what I know and how much mess my family is, what the hell happened, how fucked up everyone is and what some people went through I'm no longer surprised with my own mental health problems.

My mother made me promise that for now my father and my 14yo sister won't know about the one adopted and I need to be strong for my 14yo sister but I feel like I barely can breath, I want to cry all the time, I feel like I want to end it all but I need to be strong for my sister. I don't want her to see that I'm crushed. Not only with just discovered sister but with what my mother did to my 14yo sister, how she has mistreated and neglected her. I need to help my sister, I need to be strong for her and get my shit together but I'm afriedn that once I'm alone I'll be crying for hours on end. We are supposed to come back to my country next Sunday, I honestly don't know what to expect form my father and my 14yo sister, they basically don't know each other.

Do you have any advice how to be strong and just keep it together at least for awhile? Yesterday when I made the decision that I'm taking my sister back to my country with me to give her normal life I thought my life's gonna end, but today with the new revelation I just fucking don't know what to do.

I don't know how to build our new life around all this mess. Short after I finally got my mental health more or less together, next year I was supposed to move to another country to back to university. It's not how my lufę supposed to look like. But I also can't leave my sister and let her go, I promised her that I'll try to make it right and if my parents won't be the adult she needs I'll do it, someone fucking has to. I'm barely an adult, sometimes I still feel like a a teenager, but now I'll have to rase one and be an actual adult and the grown up she needs. All I want to do is cry but I'm typing it in front of my sister who is packing all of her things up and she's showing me her drawings so I need to keep it together. Yet I'm as lost as it's humanly possible to be.",03Jul2020,1
1028,"The thought of people judging me for living true to myself paralyzes me. It's torture to me to think people close and nots so close to me find me weird or are thinking poorly of me. I know it's dumb, but I think deep down I'm embarrassed of myself and I project that feeling onto other people.

I've got a couple issues this applies to. One is fully coming out of the closet. The second is marrying my wonderful partner.

I am trans. Or at least somewhere in that quadrant. I know in order for me to be happier I need to fully come out, but my fear of being judged paralyzes me. Same with marrying my partner. I love her so much, I care for her deeply and we work well together. But I fear my family doesn't approve of her due to our relationship's rocky start. Their opinions or anybody's for that matter shouldn't be dictating my decisions but I can't help it.

I don't want to lose my partner, I want to marry her. I want to come out because I know it'll make me happier. But my fears of being hurt or judged are paralyzing me and I don't know how to stop it.",03Jul2020,1
1029,"Ok so,

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in the process of testing for my Black Belt in Ta-Kwan-Doe. I have until October to be in the best shape that I have ever been in. The issue, is that this workout plan which I have set up and planned perfectly is being hindered by my family. My mother told me that my little brother (12) must do it with me (15) so that he could lose weight. I was immediately on board for this, and began prepping him for it. The issue is that he is lazy and hyper sensitive, and cries over almost anything. He refuses to go out with me even when it isn't hot, or isn't a holiday, or even when he says to me ''Im BoReD''.

So, I go to my mother to encourage him, and she immediately says that ""I'm not his mother''. and that ''I don't make his decisions.""  She, like him, doesn't like being uncomfortable in any way, shape, or form. Then she continues the cycle of, ""Do it without him, and your grounded."" I'm honestly starting to consider just overpowering them and doing what I want. My father has Muscle Dis-trophy, and is unable to walk whatsoever. He yells at me constantly, and sits in his room all day playing video games much like my brother.

This also makea her feel stupid and like a joke. I don't have the guts to tell her that im sleepy.
