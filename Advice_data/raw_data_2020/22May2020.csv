0,"Have any of you ever truly and honestly believed that you would never meet anyone else and nobody better than your past love or maybe even first love? And those who have, and met someone afterward, was it just as special? did you love them as much? or maybe even more?  I'm wondering because I truly believe that I won't meet anyone else in the future that I will love as deeply.",22May2020,1
1,"I don’t know what to do. Basically this girl I used to be friend I hit up because we haven’t talked in years. This was a couple weeks ago but that first day we talked from 9am to 3am the next day, so I thought damn it’s like we never left. But because quarantine and her parents bring doctors we haven’t been able to see each other in person so we haven’t talked much and now she says she’s uncomfortable and I don’t know what to do. I want to stay in touch and maybe meet up but I also want to respect her and not bother her now that she is uncomfortable. I also don’t know what made her uncomfortable, she says she doesn’t know either she just is. I’m confused and don’t know what to do",22May2020,1
2,I like reddit because it gets you to meet people who are interested in the same stuff as you but there are also people who disagree with you. I’ve always had a problem with social media in general and my mental health isn’t doing the best at the moment so should I delete it off of my phone?,22May2020,1
3,"Its always been a bad habit of mine. But its only when lockdown happened that it feels like my bad habit just took a bunch of roids. It drives me nuts. Like I always get this idea that everyone around me is working hard and keeping up just fine in their classes, while I'm the only one whos a complete train wreck. I wish I had worked extremely hard the very first day since lockdown hit. I would've been in a so  much better place, and I would've been a lot happier. None of my friends care about me anymore, and I feel as though I'm living in a constant hell. I look back on moments where others have wronged me, moments that happened months or even years ago, and I feel deep and heavy resentment, even though I never thought much about it while school was in session. I think of ways of getting back at people, and make them pay for what they did. But I also realize that everyone, even successful people, has had moments where others wrong them, after all the world isn't a nice place, and thats okay. Nothing is perfect. They don't take revenge, or act like a victim, instead they work hard on their craft, whatever that may be, and make a lot of money for themselves. It helps when I remind myself that this is all in my head. And then I feel like shit because I waste all this time ruminating on ways people have wronged me (again, things I never thought much about when they happened in the moment, and in general any time before lockdown), instead of utilizing this extra time to work hard in school adn actually get my shit together. And then I go back to feeling like shit, because I feel as though I'm the only one who slacked off since online school started, and everyone else worked hard and kept up just fine as if nothing had ever bothered them. I'm an insecure loser, with no intelligence, strength, friends, etc. Is that true, am I the only one whos work ethic and discipline dipped since online school started? Am I the only one whos had douche things happen to him?",22May2020,1
4,"There was a two year period where I went through heavy depression. During this period I was abandoned by all of my friends (which I mostly don't blame them for, since I basically dropped off the face of the Earth and became unreachable). The only joy I got out of life was playing video games with my online friend, who- at that time- became my only friend. We're not extremely close, we don't talk about deep stuff and share secrets or whatever, but playing video games with him was all I had to look forward to, and I remember thinking that if I didn't have him to keep me company and distract me then I would kill myself. So keeping in mind that we don't really discuss deep stuff, would it be inappropriate for me to tell him what he did for me?

**TLDR: Online friend unknowingly stopped me from comitting suicide, unsure whether it's appropriate to tell him as we're not super close and don't discuss deep stuff.**",22May2020,1
5,"I was supposed spend this year travelling and working abroad. However, I am now living in Canada for the rest of the year, due to Covid, which wasn't my original plan.
My situation is rather unique, I'm not in my home country and I don't have a Canadian work visa so I can't work. I don't know anyone, so I dont have any friends here and I can't drive in Canada either. My parents are living in Canada currently so I'm living with them.  My worry is that I'll spend this entire year doing nothing and I really want to make the most of a bad situation . What should I do? Are there ways to make money online?

7,"I work a low level job due to dropping out of college, and spending my late teens and most of my twenties on heroin. I’ve been clean for a about three years, and I got an amazing deal on a rental home in a fairly affluent area of the city I live in. My neighbors are a bit nosy, or they are just friendly, I’m not sure which, but they talk to me when I’m walking my dog and ask me questions about my life. I get nervous and embarrassed, because I don’t really want to tell them about my job, or that I was on drugs for so long. I’m very vague and opaque when answering the questions, talking mostly about my hobbies. I like to make art.

I get nervous at parties also, for the same reason. I’ve been socializing with some fascinating, intelligent, fun, successful people, and I just don’t know what to say to them. Should I just be honest and tell people about my history when it comes up? I don’t want to be ashamed and embarrassed, and I want to find a way to be confident in myself with I’m engaging with other people.",22May2020,1

9,"Hi!
I’m a college student, and for the past few years, I’ve been at the same school. I love my school, and I can’t imagine going anywhere else. My friends are all here, I know the area like the back of my hand, and I truly feel at home when I’m at school. But the career path I’m on requires an acceptance to a program - and I was accepted to this program at another school. This is a huge opportunity for me, and it’s my only option if I want to continue pursuing my career path. But now that I’ve been accepted to this other school, I’m second guessing my career choice. Maybe it’s just FOMO or the fear of basically starting a new life, but I’m having a really hard time even being excited about my admission to the program. I didn’t think I’d have this much doubt. 
On top of this, once I start the program, my days will be full of nonstop rigorous work. I wasn’t even expecting to get in, and now that I have, I realized that my days of normal college experiences are over, and I didn’t even know they would end this soon. If I had known, I would have basked in the glory of college a little more. 
I feel like this big step forward toward my career is taking my life away from me - a life that I was comfortable in and enjoying. I should be excited, but I feel resentment and sadness instead. I’m not sure what to do..",22May2020,1
10,"My mom always liked to have pets. We've had 4 cats, 8 dogs (counting the ones we currently have), a hamster, a parrot, and a duck through the last 17 years (since I was born). The problem is, she doesn't have a lot of money yet she keeps bringing new animals to the house. We currently have 5 dogs and she can barely afford feeding them. And now she wants **a fucking cow**.

I mean, i regularly like having pets. But 5 dogs and a cow is just too much and specially if you can't afford to feed them all, and it's even worse when we take into consideration that a cow costs fucking 1400USD in my country (for the sake of comparison, here the minimum wage is 251USD). And I don't know how to convince her of not buying a cow.

I don't know a lot about cows, but I also fear that it may stink and be loud, shit everywhere in the backyard (and my mom won't clean it) and eat all the grass.

Extra data for the sake of context:

\-My parents are divorced, so my dad can't help me with this.

\-4 of our dogs live in the backyard, so they may be agressive to the cow or viceversa.

\-My mom does not accept criticism in any form, so if I talk to her about this in a serious way, she will just cry and tell me that I'm a bad son and that I shouldn't live with her etc etc. Tbh I wouldn't live with her if I could but that's not in my plans by now.

\-Our backyard is fairly big, so there's space for a cow + the dogs.

\-I have a 7 year old brother and I fear that the cow may attack him. It may attack also my mom but honestly I don't care that much because it wouldn't kill her.

\-I'm 17 years old, male.",22May2020,1
11,"A few months, nearly a year ago, my dog bit the neighbors' boy. The boy was in my yard, the dog was on a leash. I tried to train the dog to be less property possessive but she did end up biting another person. We ended up having to put her down. Fast forward to today. Their son was playing with my daughter and started being nasty. He said he put her on YouTube, that she was stupid, and that he can't wait to beat her up( she's 5'-8"" at 12, so I did not take him seriously.) However, when I tried talking to his dad about the behavior, he was a bit of a jersey. All he asked was if was the one with the dog, when I replied yes, and that we had her put down, he said get the f*** off my property, and refused to talk about his son. Am I being unreasonable to think we should be able to talk about this like adults?",22May2020,1
12,"It seems I'm in a constant cycle of shifting my demeanor in accordance to how I believe my family members see me. I'm 19 and have undergone major changes in the way I think and act, etc in the past few years, and I believe this is for the better. I'm more mature. Problem is, I'm scared of showing these changes to my family because I feel it would devalue their original image of me.

To my mother, I'm still almost like a child. Cheery and enthusiastic, hugs and the like.

For my father I hardly utter a word. (I went through a tough time with his criticisms) I envy those guys who can talk to their dad openly, and go fishing with them, etc. I work for my dad every day and I can't help but keep up the act of the silent, hard worker.

For my sisters I act all goofy and silly.

Note, I don't really have this problem with people outside my family. It's a fresh feeling when I meet someone for the first time because they don't have any expectations of who I am and how I act. Nowadays when I meet with friends or new people I'm who I actually want to be: An adult. I lower my voice and speak confidently. For my family members I can barely manage lowering my voice in fear that they'll point it out. Back when I had my girlfriend and would bring her to my house, these demeanors I would play would sort of clash and put a damper on the atmosphere.

I do not have any mental issues such as multiple personality syndrome. (I'm very mentally healthy) Currently I can only think that it's perhaps because I'm a very agreeable person, and I'm sensitive to how my family views me.

Have you experienced this feeling before? What did you do about it? Thanks!",22May2020,1
13,"So, here i am. Didn’t think it would come to a reddit post but hey ho! Im looking for any ideas on how to reduce/speak to neighbours about their very odd noises. 

My partner and i moved in to our current place about a year and a half ago. Roughly 3 months later the neighbours undertook extensive renovations so they could move in. Now when i say, literally made my life a living hell, im not over exaggerating. 

Construction/renovation was unbearably loud. So loud phone calls were an absolute no go from anywhere in our house. You couldn’t hear someone sat 2 meters from you. (Tried and tested) The noise was louder than i think i could ever crank music up to. Picture a drill, in your home, multiply it by about 5. I am a university student (not in student accommodation - these people are a family of 3 with a 10ish year old child) and i had to resort to going to a bar next door to work. Which wasn’t ideal either. 

Anyway, thats in the past. Nothing could be done about that so i sucked it up and eventually it finished! However, in the past few weeks/months, I have no idea what they have been doing. Its all very odd! 

Both my partner and i are pretty sure its a drill (think drilling a shelf into our connecting wall - type sound) and at other times very loud banging. (Think hammering, or very loud stomping?). Now if this was 12pm, or even 8am on a weekend I would again just suck it up. Annoying but not the end of the world. However this is no joke at 12-2am. I am truly baffled at how they think its acceptable to do this. Its into our adjoining wall as far as we can tell, so they must be aware we can hear it. Not to mention they have a child. Is the child just sleeping through this?? Why on earth would you drill at 1am with a 10y/o child in bed?! 

Anyway, the main point is that this is now actually making getting to sleep quite hard. Either that or it wakes me up if ive gone to sleep before it starts. We don’t speak to them (no animosity - they just don’t seem chatty/don’t particularly smile back). How in the hell do we broach this with them?! All the info online im sure works for some, but i feel incredibly incredibly awkward just knocking on their door and accusing/informing them that we can’t sleep because of their late night antics! 

Tl;dr: neighbours drilling/hammering/banging(?) at 12-2am. No idea how to politely broach the subject with them. All help welcome, even if its ideas to just sound proof our house instead!",22May2020,1
14,".

Ok, so I live in the states in the southern region. I’m a Chonky boy and am leaving for uni soon. So I’ve been trying to run more and more everyday since quarantine started. My self confidence isn’t the highest so I wait till it’s dark outside and a little cooler. Last night I came back from the run around my local trail (2 miles) and saw something. My house is in a culdesac with a playground in front so I just pass by it every night, but last night there was something on the swing. Some tall person with a little paper plate mask ( I think ). I made “eye contact” and they just stared. Trying to be dominant in the situation I waved, and it waved back. Since this was so late (9:45 pm) I didn’t find it necessary to tel my parents, and my father is a veteran so I don’t think he’d take it lightly. I just walked upstairs and showered not thinking about it, but around 11 pm I hear the sound of creaking coming from the outdoors; like what a chair sounds like when you sit in it too much. I peek outside the window that faces the street and see nothing, then look at the park. And the thing was just swinging, there was no feet or even legs that I could see, like if you had a dark bean bag as a cloak. I peeked for all of maybe 3seconds, but as soon as I decided to stop it looks directly up at the window. That whole night I was up holding an old bo staff. Normally I wouldn’t reach out like this but I’m horrified to leave my house past 10. Anyone have any ideas?",22May2020,1

I ask her to explain to me next time why she's upset she said okay, but yesterday we had a disagreement and I just wanted to know why she's upset so as to assure her it won't happen again. She gets all mad that I always want her to explain. I really don't understand why she's always upset. All our fights are always about my problems as a person because it doesn't line up with her thinking and values. Why does she do this?

23,"I'm 20 years old, and I feel absolutely stuck in life.  For the last few years my dream has been to move away and go to school.  It always seemed like that would just happen, that everyone got to go to college and that I wouldn't be any different. 

   When I was 16 I was kicked out of my house when I came out to my mom.  I slept couch to couch for a few years (except for one year, but I'll get to that later), and struggled a lot with my mental health. I thought things were going to get better because i was accepted into a university. Unfortunately, i needed my mother to get loans, and that is impossible, so I had to cancel my admission.

   After a couple years of couchsurfing I finally got my first apartment with a good friend this year. It felt like a step in the right direction, but I still had plans to.  My friend is moving in with a girl after our lease is up and I cant afford an apartment on my own so I'm likely going to have to go back to sleeping on couches in my hometown for a while and I almost feel like just giving up...I have some savings but not enough to keep me going for long.

I basically have two options:

1. After I graduated, I managed to spend a year abroad in Taiwan. It was a combination of knowing the right people who helped me get there and good people who supported me while I was there, and my dad somehow convincing my mother to sign the papers. I've been offered a chance to move there and study business, but it's not what I've always wanted to do.  My original plans were to move to Montana and study wildlife biology.

2. Take what savings I have, sell my car, move to Montana, try to become an in-state resident by living there for 1 year, and wait until I'm 24 so I can apply for loans and things by myself. 

Option 2 is what I really want, but it seems difficult and dangerous. I need either a push in either direction, someone to tell me both options are dumb and bad, or really ant input.... I just need something...

If you read all this, thank you. Honestly it felt really good to just type it out. I've been keeping it to myself for a while",22May2020,1

25,"I’m 23 and 5 months pregnant. I’m very excited and I’ve told just a few family members including my grandma and sister otherwise I’ve kept it quiet. So backstory; my mom committed suicide when I was 6 and we (my older brother, older sister and I) moved in with my dad and stepmom. Now my stepmom never had kids of her own and always would say just how in love she was with my dad. They dated for a short time in high school before my dad got with my mom and had kids and married and all that. Maybe a year after I was born my mom and dad divorced and my dad was with my stepmom sometime after that. So my stepmom didn’t care for my mom and even labeled her as a bad mom and an alcoholic after she died. And to be quite honest she wasn’t fond of us either, although she would never say that out loud. Although she never laid a finger on us, she was very mentally abusive and my dad did nothing but turn the other eye. He didn’t want to hear anything about what she had done to us. I’m not going to get into major detail but I never felt more alone or unloved than when I lived with them. We were always confined to our rooms and ive been grounded for months at a time more times than I can count. I also wasn’t allowed to be in any sports or after school activities because they didn’t want to have to pick us up or spend the money. My moms death was very hard on us, I was a total mamas girl and was at her side every second of the day. After she past, a couple years down the road, I was having an exceptionally bad day and was crying how much I missed her and my stepmom came in and said ‘she’s dead get over it’. I also have nothing left of my moms because everything I did have my stepmom would find and throw away (which she will never tell the truth). But pictures, clothes, jewelry, and trinkets just don’t disappear. 

So now I’m having a daughter of my own and every-time I think about them and the other things they’ve done I just don’t want my baby to be involved in any of that. My stepmom is the best actress and will have anyone convinced that she’s the best mother with so much love to give and the nicest person ever. My grandma’s can see right through her though. Ever since she kicked all of us kids out before we turned 18, she’s been so nice and tells us how much she loves and misses us and how proud she is of all of us and I just try to keep the peace and be civil with her. They also rarely come around the family now except around Christmas. So I’m just asking for anyone who cares, how do I tell them I don’t want them around my baby? I know she’s going to be super upset, anytime I argue with her or tell her how I feel it ends up being my fault and my dad gets mad at me for it and he’ll tell me how much I’ve hurt her. But what about what she’s done to me? I don’t want to feel like that especially when it come to my child. I don’t want my baby to be fake loved.",22May2020,1
26,"My husband (22M)and I (22F) just graduated from college in the midst of the Covid pandemic. We were in the process of getting his Work Authorization before everything shut down, but now all the paperwork has been paused. We’ve moved back into my parents house but it’s not ideal (we have two cats and a dog, my mom also has 2 cats and 2 dogs). 

Does anyone have ideas on how he can (legally) make some money? He feels like a burden since I’m working a lot to supporting us.

28,"Quick context: I am 19 year old guy, moved out of home (lived with my grandmother, aunt and 7 yr old brother)

Look I love my family I really really do, but at the end of the day they are so LAZY and MESSY.

But now I’ve been on my own for a little over a year, and I am very busy maintaining my own life and pursuits as you could assume. 

My grandmother and aunt keep asking me to “come help them out” which translates to me doing all the work for them. The main focus has always been the yard work although lately they have have been asking even more of me.

But I can’t keep up with it! I know nothing about taking care of yards and they never do any simple maintenance like watering, every time I go there is ALWAYS LITERAL TRASH all over the yard. 

I feel so guilty because I feel like I owe them for taking care of me all these years, and I know that if I say I want to stop doing this they will take away my car (that’s my only dependence I have with them) and I don’t really need their car anymore but I don’t want our relationship to get to that point! 

Am I in the wrong for this? I understand that my grandmother is older and can’t really do anything, but my aunt can and so can my brother! And they also have more than enough cash to actually pay someone to do it for them (probably way better than I can)",22May2020,1
29,"I’m on my first job, and I was lucky enough to have landed my dream job. But as is the case with most idealized things, it’s not all it’s cracked up to be and I ended up getting burnt out after my first year. Though as I said, it’s my dream job so I’ve been sticking it out. I’m almost at two years but I still feel burnt out. It’s extra heavy on me since I have a creative job and I’ve really just been unhappy (and sometimes even ashamed) of the things I’ve been putting out, but I’m just too tired to care. I don’t want to let go of my job but I’m pretty emptied out at this point. My bosses and colleagues have been nothing but understanding, but I’m starting to get embarrassed.

I also know how to work with FL Studio and try and make music, mostly beats. If you were to ask me what my dream was, I would say I would like to produce my own music I can use in my own videos shot and edited in my own way. 

Currently I do random edits for small rappers I see can be up and coming, and random art. I just upload them to Instagram and that’s it. I can’t post much on YouTube because everything gets taken down by copyright. 

I’d say I’m better than your typical editor, at least  I’d say I try and do my own thing, I just find myself struggling getting anywhere with what I do.

But recently I realized that I feel almost ZERO attraction to real people: wether I know them or they're actors on tv or something. The attraction is minimal.

I have also had a thing for animated or drawn faces. Its just that as long as I am not looking at a persons actual face or at a REAL human face, I can be attracted to them. 

Is this maybe just a weird fetish? Or is something wrong with me?

33,"
This is a really long post but if anyone who’s bothered enough to read it can give me some advice on what I should do about the mistreatment and also as to why it’s happening then that would be really helpful... writing this has made me realise I seriously need to see a therapist so that’s definitely my next step once the pandemic is over. 

The way I’ve been treated has left me a cold person, I don’t cry and my friends say I’m emotionless however I do have a lot of empathy and sometimes care for others too much but I can’t open up to anyone and can’t bring myself to trust anyone. 

Without going into too much detail about my fucked up dysfunctional family (as i’d have to write a whole book about them for you to even understand my traumatic childhood and family), I’ve always been the black sheep of the family and in my adult life it’s just getting worse. I’m female, 23 years old and the middle child. I have an older brother who’s 26 years old, we haven’t spoken in probably about 7 years even though throughout those 7 years he’s lived in the family home with me on and off (his choice, no one in the family knows why he doesn’t want to speak to me and just constantly bad mouths me) and a younger sister who’s 20 years old, we have a typical love/hate sister relationship. 

I’ve known I was the black sheep from childhood as I was always left to do my own thing, always left out and bullied by my siblings throughout my childhood and teenage years, parents disciplined me a lot harder (more beatings/ being shouted at/ stricter rules being enforced on me etc) than both my siblings. The way I was treated as a child has really fucked me up mentally (depression, body dysmorphia, paranoia, anxiety, bipolar disorder) but since I’m so used to being independent and only trusting myself my whole life, I’ve taught myself not to let it entirely get in the way of my adult life.  If only it was that easy.

For the past few years I’ve noticed my mums gaslighting/ disdain of me has gotten so out of control to the point where I’m starting to think I’m crazy and that she actually hates me. 

To start things off, since leaving school at 18, I decided to not go to university but to start working instead, I got an apprenticeship at a company as a marketing assistant while also studying for a qualification, never once did I hear (and still have not heard) from either of my parents that they were/are proud of me, I had gotten a job, was making my own money and became financially independent, I graduated the course and even got promoted at work all while being under the age of 20... not a peep from my parents, especially my mum who I live with as my parents divorced when I was 17/18. But my mum couldn’t stop talking enough about how my brother was at university studying business and that he was going to be a CEO once he graduates, that he’s going to be making so much money because of his degree, constantly fawning over him and the same with my sister, once she got into uni my mum couldn’t shut up about it, calling all of our family members, organising celebratory dinners etc. All I got after graduating my course and getting a promotion was “....oh but when are you going to go to university?” I got so used to my mum undermining/not caring about my achievements that I no longer saw them as achievements... New job? Didn’t bother telling anyone. Boyfriend? No one knew. Promotion at work? Wasn’t even mentioned. Both my parents know absolutely nothing about my personal/ professional life and they seem to have no interest either. My mum has told me multiple times that I will never earn what my siblings will earn and that I will never have an as good career as them because I didn’t go to university.

This is also where my mental health is downplayed, I’ve been seriously depressed with severe anxiety and paranoia since the age of 12 due to how dysfunctional my family is and their treatment towards me but I’m constantly told I don’t know what real stress is and that I can’t be depressed since I live with my mum, only have a “shit” job and am not at university.

I’m the only one of my siblings that is financially independent, I pay my own bills (and help my mum with hers), my clothes, my food, holidays etc. I’m the only child that makes an effort for my parents at Christmas, their birthdays and mother’s/Father’s Day because I save up and actually care. I’ve taken my mum on holidays in which I pay for everything and give her spending money. I never ask my parents for money or ask them to buy me things (even during Xmas and bday) as I know I can afford things for myself meanwhile my mum is constantly complaining and worrying that she has no money to pay the bills yet she still pays for both my siblings phone bills, constantly sends them money because they waste their student finance on crap (whenever they come home they’re decked out in designer clothes) and they end up not having enough money to pay for rent and food. When I mention that they should both get part time jobs so that they stop taking money from her she berates me saying that they’re both too busy at university and can’t get jobs as they’re always studying so she has to be financially responsible for them until they graduate... and then she’ll proceed to mention all of the times she’d ever given me money or brought me something or when she paid my phone bill 6 YEARS AGO. We argue about this at least two to three times a month. And this is where the “arguing” comes in. 

I’ve noticed that my mum only cares to remember all the “bad” things I’ve done in my life and constantly brings them up. This is where the gaslighting has become a real problem for me. Any disagreement we have she’s instantly in hysterics as to why I’m “shouting” at her and being rude, she’ll instantly call my sister and bitch about how awful I am to her. She’ll tell me how horrible of a person I am, that I’m so mean and spiteful and it’s not a surprise that my siblings don’t like me. She says I’ve never done anything nice for her even though I’m the only child to plan and pay for nice days out, take her on holidays, pay for her to be pampered, cook for her, give her money, help pay the bills etc. My sister also gaslights me the way my mum does, when she’s home from university we’ll have an argument or disagreement and my mum will pull her away saying something along the lines of “I told you not to speak to her, now she’s just shouting and being horrible as usual” my sister will agree and say that I’m crazy and always starting arguments with her when she’s the one who usually initiates any argument we have. My sister has said to me a few times that I’m treated differently/ worse than her and my brother and that she thinks our mum might hate me. 

Meanwhile both my siblings are absolutely horrible to my mum yet she doesn’t bat an eyelid. My brother only calls her when he wants money or food and then ignores her for months on end, doesn’t remember her birthday or Mother’s Day yet my mum still worships the ground he walks on. When my sister comes home from uni, they’re constantly arguing, she calls my mum names, shouts at her, pushes her, takes money from her etc. And my mum does absolutely nothing, she just stays silent while my sister verbally abuses her. My mum will forget about it 5 minutes later and then has the audacity to constantly tell me “why can’t you be more like your sister, she never shouts at me and we never argue, she’s an angel”, when I mention all the times my sister has verbally attacked her my mum calls me spiteful and that I shouldn’t bring up the past. 

When I bring up the fact that my mum used to hit me a lot more than my siblings and that she treats me differently to them she laughs at me and instantly calls me crazy, that I’m making it all up just to make her look bad, she’ll tell me I’m mentally unstable and spiteful for making up such lies and that I should be ashamed of myself. She constantly berates me for being “lazy” on my days off from work, saying I’m useless, lazy and need to get a job when I literally work 2 jobs, make decent money and am barely ever home. I’m so used to hearing this that I’m starting to think that I am in fact all of those things. 

As a child I was skinny, in my teenage and adult life I am between a UK size 8/10(US size 6/8 and EU size 36/38) yet my mother and whole family have constantly made remarks on my appearance ever since I was a child, always being told I’ve put on weight and am fat, always criticising my fashion choices, how I cut or dye my hair, who my friends are, what job I have etc. I’ve heard this since childhood and it has seriously fucked up my self esteem and caused me to have serious body dysmorphia, i was relentlessly bullied for being “fat” as a child/ teenager by my siblings and dad while my mum just stood by and watched, to this day I have not gotten over it and when I mention it to my mum she says they were harmless jokes as I stand there crying at 23 years old remembering all the years of horrible name calling and taunting (that still happens to this day). Both my siblings are bigger than I am, have questionable fashion, tattoos, dye their hair etc but my mum doesn’t ever criticise them on their appearance. I’ve overheard my mum on the phone to my aunties/siblings gossiping about me so many times and I’ll never forget the time that we’d flown back to the UK after my cousins wedding and my mum was on the phone to one of my aunties talking about how ugly the dress I wore to the wedding was, how ugly the style of the dress was, the ugly colour and how fat I looked in it. 

Honestly there’s so much more I could write but I’ll save that for my future therapist. It’s sad that this is me not even going into detail about how I’m treated by my family but if anyone has advice on as to why I’m treated like this and what I should do or if anyone’s in a similar position then please comment below. I’ve kept this inside for 23 years and now I’ve gotten to the point where I’m absolutely fed up with it. I’m planning on moving to Australia next year so that’ll be a good enough distance away from my toxic family.",22May2020,1
34,"I(20F) have recently had the biggest problem in my life occur. I lived at home while attending college and working with my father. My step mother of 10 years, who was emotionally abusive and an alcoholic, died in August and my father remarried 4 months later. The woman who he married seemed really sweet and we clicked very well. I held a high amount of respect for her until today. I will call her Jane.

To add, my father and I have always had a strained relationship due to his second remarriage. He's a very quiet man, carrying a attitude of toxic masculinity, and puts me down more than supporting me. Yet he is still my father. So, naturally after her death, I was expecting to spend more time with him and get footing on our relationship, yet he didn't.

Once he remarried this woman, my father stopped talking to me completely. Not even a single comment, for months. I asked Jane what was wrong and she acted like she didn't know. Well, a few weeks go by. We'd get coffee and she would always ask, ""did your father touch you."" Of course I responded with, ""no?"" This continued to a point that in the middle of the day she'd drag me in their room and ask me, almost an everyday thing. She drew the conclusion like the following: because my father walked around in his boxers, my shy behavior, and that he would wake me up in the morning by scratching my leg. Lastly, she would always confide in me and complain about my father's behavior. Anyways...

I respected Jane. I told Jane where I was going or what I was doing. Due to quarantine, I decided to stay with my mother because I knew I couldn't be locked up with my father and his ways. I've been staying with my mother for almost 2 months and it has been so wonderful not having to walk on eggshells. Anywho...

I get a text from Jane that my father wants to put the car I drive in my name finally. Being happy, I meet up with her today to wait for my father to get off work. 

I get to the house and I am confronted immediately by Jane. She tells me she had to go in my room to find something and she came across my sketch books(diary) from two years ago. She then sets down photo copies of pages that she had. (Note: I had at least 10 sketch books through my high school days, which was 2 years ago) she went through ALL OF THEM. She photo copied any of them mentioning my father and asked me if he molested me. I started crying because I was off put as to why she would go through my things. THEN my dad opens the door to the bedroom beside me and confronts me about a note I wrote in anger towards him. He told me to pack my things and leave. We went after I packed and got the car signed over. I just feel violated and almost like I should confront Jane. How can I handle this? Does she have a right to keep photo copies of thing I wrote?",22May2020,1

Now she is telling me she has paid for vet visits and wants to keep him because of the time and money invested in him. She also accused me of lying when I told her I purchased him for $800. I am not sure what point she was trying to make, but I did indeed purchase him for $800 (I know that's crazy expensive for a cat, I purchased him from someone unscrupulous). Anyways, I am tired of her beating around the bush when I ask if I can get my cat back. I don't like involving police but I am thinking of warning her that what she is doing is technically stealing.

44,"[this is really long!]
I went a college out of state, and I’ve been there for two years, though after this semester, I’m forced to attend a school in-state due to convenience and cost. My best friend at this college was my freshman roommate, and we even dormed together for our sophomore year. Within the first few weeks of meeting each other, we talked about dark parts of our past that I at least never thought I could talk to any other person besides my two close friends back home. We’re even together so much that friends of ours thought of us as a package deal; it was weird to see us not together. 
We’ve had normal friend and roommate fights over our two years together, but nothing serious enough to ever wreck our friendship over. We’re both able to talk through any issues we have calmly. This is the first time that I feel I can’t come to her. 
The reason is that she rushed for a sorority this semester, which meant obviously she wasn’t able to spend much time at the dorm or with me. It caused a bit of strain at first, at least for me, because I was used to having her around more, but I knew the sorority she was rushing for and the girls within it, including her line, and I knew that she was in good hands. 
A major part of me is happy to know that when I leave, she won’t be entirely alone anymore; she’ll have people that can talk with her and help her get out of her dorm a bit. That was one of my biggest fears with leaving, because we were so close, and she’s always had a hard time getting out. 
However, another part of me can’t help but feel really sad too. I’m not even gone yet, and it feels like she’s already moved on. She’s stopped reaching out to me to talk about things like we’ve done in the past, though she’ll send the occasional meme. She talks more to my friends in the sorority even, which also hurts because I know those friends don’t reach out to me as much either. When I’m on facetime calls with her alone, it’s fine, but if our other mutual friend and her line sister joins, it’s harder for me to speak. They talk to each other more and about conversations only they know about. I even have to end the calls early because I feel the sudden urge to just start crying. I know if they knew I felt iced out, they would try to involve me more, but I don’t want to make any of them feel bad when it’s only me feeling this way. 
You might say that I should reach out to her more, and I do. The problem is that I’m the only one ever reaching out. 
I understand that life is about change, and sometimes, friends drift apart, but it hurts to see that it’s already happening. 2 years of friendship in which we’ve shared everything with each other suddenly not mattering in comparison to her new sorority friends. I’m being bitter; I’m sorry. 
When I’m hurting, my main reaction is to cut whatever’s hurting me out of my life. I try very hard in my friendships to restrain this urge so it doesn’t ruin anything. I have depression, which makes this difficult since emotional turmoils like these can trigger a depressive episode and me reaching out harder. However, this is a feeling that I’ve had since nearly the beginning of the semester, and it continues to escalate every time I talk to her. 
I was wondering considering all the information above what I should do. I’m not sure if this is even something I can talk to her about since it’s a natural part of life, moving on and finding new friends, especially with me leaving. I don’t want her to feel that she can’t move on, that I’m simply being jealous, because I know that these friends make her happy too. I do want to continue being friends with her despite the distance and despite my strong urge to just push her away, but right now, even talking to her hurts me. What should I do?

53,"My aunt was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer that had already metastasized to her liver-- her doctor told her, terminal. When the doctor told her this, my aunt was offended and said ""I mean jeez, the doctor basically told me to get a shovel"" and scoffed at the thought. This was almost 2 years ago.

Since then my aunt has gone through chemo and radiation. And I mean, she is in horrible pain all the time. She can't move without exhausting herself but she lives alone and refuses to go into hospice/palliative care because ""that's where people go to die"" and to her that's not where she belongs. She has bad falls, and she falls asleep sitting up and bangs her head on tables and such. Also the radiation destroyed the wall between her vagina and rectum so she excretes out of her vagina. Which is... particularly unpleasant.

She is in a bad way. 90 pounds, frail, has neuropathy. My mom (her sister) drives over an hour and a half to care for her once a week and it's just not enough. We don't know what to do. We love that she has hope but she's suffering and never moved through the stages of grief. Should we indulge her more and keep letting her believe she's going to get better (until she passes)? Or tell her this really is the end and it's time to be comfortable and not suffer anymore? I feel like it's wrong to destroy someone's hope... but I hate seeing her suffer thinking it will improve.",22May2020,1
54,"Hello everyone! mild TW sexual assault maybe? The point is that I’m really not sure

The incident mentioned in the caption happened about a year ago, so not very recent. I was 19 years old at the time and my best friend was 19 as well. I had a boyfriend at the time and never expressed any sort of interest in my best friend, neither did he.

I spent the night at his place because I didn’t catch my last bus home. We were both sitting on his couch (that later I would be sleeping on) but I was really tired, so I curled up next to him while he was watching YouTube on his TV. I pretended to be asleep because I hoped that way I might actually fall asleep. He must have bought it, because he somehow shifted his position and while doing so he put my hand in his lap. Now, at first I thought that maybe he was more comfortable like that or something but I was pretty sure I could feel his dick through his pants.

I just pretended to shift in my sleep and put my hand away. Because he was my best friend I really didn’t want to think anything bad of him so i just hoped it was an accident or something. However, he took my hand again, and put it back on his dick. This time, his pants were gone and I could feel his skin, he closed my hand around it. It took me a second to realise that in fact, I was holding his penis.  Ishifted again in my sleep and this time I made an angry noise while still ""asleep"". I could hear him shuffling (probably putting his dick away). I was really embarrassed by the whole situation but actually managed to fall asleep quickly, really don’t know how. The next morning I left without waking him up. 

I felt really bad for him because he had done something that stupid, I thought he must be so embarrassed, and kind of completely forgot about it for a week. Then I got really drunk, realised how disgusted I was by him, met up with him and ended the friendship. I told him I hadn’t actually been asleep and to never do that to anyone again.

After that, I never really thought about it again. I wasn’t even really sad about losing my best friend, even though he used to mean a lot to me and was the person I trusted the most. But for the last few days I have been studying sexual assault in my social psychology class and I have been feeling really weird about it, there’s also another incident with someone else that was entirely my fault (a guy fondled and kissed me after I failed to make him realise I didn’t want to) but still makes me feel really shitty. I feel like it’s nothing compared to actual victims of sexual assault, don’t get me wrong. I don’t even know why this has me feeling this way.

I talked to my boyfriend about it but I feel like he doesn’t get me and also doesn’t know what to tell me. I don’t even know what I want to be told. I can’t sleep that’s why I’m posting. Do you have any advice on how to deal with this? I feel like in both cases I was way to passive and should have been way more vocal about my discomfort. How can I learn to tell people off? And is this classified as sexual assault (or classified as anything else, as you can tell English isn’t my first language, so maybe I’m just lacking the right word)? Is what he did really that bad or am I just being overly dramatic?",22May2020,1

56,"(Backstory) My mom bought a washing machine like 8-9 years ago and never had any issues with it before. A few months ago it would randomly have issues that would come and go. There would also be water leaking from under it. About a week ago she bought a new one and the company came to deliver it &amp; install it. They told her that they can’t do it because the valve was leaking and needed replaced while leaving the new and old washing machine. (we live in an apartment). My mother calls maintenance &amp; the guy doesn’t listen and moves the old washing machine &amp; hooks the new one up to the old hoses. then says that it’s leaking because it’s not plugged in. He messed the front of it up &amp; then leaves. The water is still leaking from the valve in the wall. So the company won’t come back to install it until they fix this. my mom called maintenance back again today and told them it wasn’t fixed and she moved the old one back because she didn’t want to risk anything like her warranty being voided since they hooked up things they shouldn’t have. They came back today &amp; literally yelled at her and told her that she had no reason to do any of that because she didn’t know what she was taking about. They still didn’t fix the issue. Basically refusing to do their job while being assholes.

58,"Context : My partner is a specialist vinyl layer, and is part of a small company that is contracted by a larger one. The CEO of the small company is best mates with my partner, they get along famously.

TLDR: Higher ups are bullying my partner for leaving after he finishes his job. It's slowly breaking him and I can't stand to watch. 

My partner is a hard worker, and wakes up at 4am every morning by his own choice, much earlier than the other contractors in the factory, to get the job finished before they even start so that the factory line runs smoothly and the other contractors can get started immediately.

This is completely by choice. My partner could start at 7AM like everyone else, but he knows he is the first person to touch a job in the production line so he gets in early to get it done and not have anyone else in his way.

My partners boss is fine with this, he always states that he doesn't pay him to stand around and do nothing, so he'd rather pay him for a job well done and have him go home and relax (whilst still getting paid. Regardless of hours, he is paid for the full day).

Recently a shift in factory ownership happened, (they own the whole factory/production line now, not the individual contracting teams who have their own bosses).

The new higher-ups hate that my partner leaves early, but for absolutely no reason. They say, ""you may aswell stay and do something else, like get ahead"" except if he stays and works on the next job, he will have no reason to come in the next day because job materials come in every few days and there would be literally nothing for him to do. He wouldn't be on site and couldn't be there if repairs / changes were needed.

Ontop of this, the other workers in the production line won't really let him get ahead because they can't work at his pace, and also get in trouble.

Now for the issue :
Every day, he comes home guttered. These people are essentially bullying him (nothing he can report though). They're breaking him down day by day because he leaves early and the new owners hate that, maybe because they're jealous? I'm not sure.

My partners offered to come back to the factory if they need him and he has tried to compromise to no avail.
They're making his job a living nightmare and I hate seeing him come home every day absolutely burnt out and depressed.

He's the only person in our state too that can work on this job, he is very essential.

What can I do? Any advice I give him is useless, I'm out of my league here.
I'm my own boss and I work from home, so I've never experienced this. It breaks my heart to see him like this every day.",22May2020,1

About a year ago I passed out on my couch in the living room and I was playing a game cookie run where if I dont touch the screen for a while it just freezes and never closes my phone or something and since I fell asleep that happened. It was night and my mom and sister were working while my little siblings were in their room I think my baby brother was asleep next to me. While I was asleep my stepdad took my phone and opened it without having to put in the password. He woke me up and showed me he had my phone and lured me into their room(his and my moms). Then he showed me what he had open on my phone it was porn. He asked me why I had it on my phone I said I dont watch that and to give my phone back. He started to grab my hand and and moving it closer to you know where(he says ""do u want to try"" as this happens) I kept saying no stop as I repeatedly pulled away. At some point I grab my phone and try to open the door and realize its locked so I unlock it and leave. Till this day I have never told my family and have been stuck living with him ever since. The reason I dont tell anyone is bc I'm scared I dont want to ruin my family when my mom finally got married with someone and had a kid my baby brother. He works on the house and is making it better for us to live in. Me and my other siblings weren't able to grow up with a dad and at this point I want them happy more then I do me. But every day is torture I'm mean to him but no one suspects anything. My mom has had so many abusive boyfriends like my dad but my stepdad dosen't do that.

72,"I'm sorry this is so long...

My new neighbors moved into the downstairs half of the house I live in the last week of March. The woman, I'll call J, is a little nuts. On the night of their third day here, I could hear her yelling at her young son, calling him nasty names, swearing at him, threatening to kick him out to live with his dad.. And she'd been yelling since they got here. I couldn't stand listening to the abuse, so thinking I was being sneaky enough, I went down to introduce myself. I mentioned I can hear everything and that the place isn't sound-proof, and politely volunteered to watch her boy sometime if it would be any help, since they're trying settle in. I know it would definitely be unsettling, but I meant it as a polite gesture. 

She said she was just fighting with him about the bath. After I went back up, I could hear J telling her son that it was his fault I came knocking. The abuse continues. About a week in, and only with the best intentions, I did some sleuthing. I found the boyfriend's name in the mailbox, searched him on facebook, found J on facebook, and tracked down who I assumed to be her daughter on one of J's old unused profiles. I clearly stated my intentions ti the daughter, letting her know she didn't know me, and that I understood if she declined to reply, but that I was concerned for the safety of the child. She let me call her, and I told her about every nasty thing I'd heard J say to the son (I'll call X.) The daughter told me that X is only 6, has ADHD, and that J is so abusive, she's in therapy because she'd blocked out her childhood from the trauma. She told me to watch for bruises, and said that if I report, she wants me to let her know. She asked if she could tell their grandmother, who she lives with, what I shared, and give her my number, which of course I was okay with.That being said, the conversation was polite, and only informative. I was even honest and let her know how I found her on facebook. 

A few days go by. I'd just gotten home, and J was outside waiting for me. She blocked my path on the sidewalk, and started berating me for contacting her daughter, said I made up lies, threatened me with lawsuits. I did my best to stay calm, never yelled back, and had to walk around her so I could go upstairs. She wasn't set having not gotten a rise out of me, so she threatened to hurt my cats (I let them outside at night, and one of them was recently stuck in a tree for two days, and cried basically the whole time. Annoying, I know.) Only then did I yell and swear back. I immediately called the landlord and sobbed for almost an hour before I went to a friend's to calm down and report to the police department. About an hour after I got there, J sent me a very long message on facebook. More threats of lawsuits, lies about my landlord and her son (acting as property manager) being angry at me, saying nasty things to try to upset me, just trying to be big and scary to get me to shut up.

J later tried to ""make up"" by leaving me a little care package with a mask, gloves, and some wet-wipes, and I thanked her for it and hoped we could be done. She wanted me to stop reporting, and as someone who came here from an abusive home, I refuse to be a bystander. I've continued to make reports to CPS on my own whenever I have enough written down to report on. Her abuse style is gaslighting, threatening violence, name-calling. Anything to emotionally hurt the person and stay in control. She's a control freak. She's complained about me walking around, saying I stomp, I drop things, etc. I never had problems like this with the previous tennant. She followed up with more harassing messages, slandered me on a public forum for my city where she almost completely falsified her account of our little altercation. 

I've talked with the property manager and the police about this. The landlord basically doesn't want to touch it because they signed a year lease (even though she's violating the terms by being here full time, as she's only on as a part time resident.) The police weren't ever able to make contact with her, and despite emailing them screenshots of her messages to me (per their request,) I haven't heard anything. It took me a long time to get comfortable here, and to really love my home. I loved being here before they came, and now I can't stand it. She screams at her son all day, it never stops. She wakes me up around 7am every other day, screaming. It's stressful. It feels like living with my stepdad all over again. 

I know I didn't adress the situation properly at the start, but everything I've done has been with good intentions. I'm really concerned for X's psychological and emotional well-being, and have relayed this to the social workers every time. I don't know what else to do. I don't have the funds to move and no one to rely on for help. My property manager and the police won't help, and she continues to make threats from time-to-time. 

I don't know exactly what I'm looking for, but any and all advice on anything here would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.",22May2020,1

Almost right after the call ended before I got ready to mark my date tomorrow, I realized he said at some point in the convo "" I love you and I want you to be my friend, I cant be in a relationship it takes to much from me I'm figuring myself out its been 5 days, I don't wanna feed you false hope.""

So I reflected...

My last ex before him did a similar breakup with me and time away to ghost me too. He took a break from me and I keep asking him to ""hang out"" we ended up having sex each time and  and he would still leave me. The moment I finally decided to walk away after some time he wanted to patch up but i declined. So I cannot repeat the same mistakes. I let him have control of me and I will not be strung along.

Honestly everyone in my circle is saying ""just let it go blah blah"" but ok I want my sense of control back. I'd be lying if I said "" I dont think I can get him back"" because I do. Hope is a cheap word full of doubt and I dont have that. We both know that we are soul mates so does our family. I can feel hes really lost in his mental cause hes bi polar and doesnt feel good about his money situation. After some thought I think I should only meet him WHEN HE WANTS ME BACK AS A LOVER, not a friend. So should I be up-front in case he reminds me tomo and tell him ""to be honest I still had the one thing you dont have at the moment and it was a chance for us, and I dont wanna hang out with you as my ex. I hope you understand, I'm going to listen to your warnings and respect this split"". Or should I just ignore him?? Either way I know he'll switch up.",22May2020,1
82,"I (22F) recently changed my major to CIS and I’m very excited for it! I’ve been in college for 4 years and for the first time I feel sense excitement for the direction I’m going in. Unfortunately I can’t start the classes for my major until I take “intro to programming”, and it’s full for the summer, so I can’t take it until the fall. I figured I might was well try to learn what I can on my own until fall semester gets here. So, my question is this: Where would you recommend I start? Do you know any resources to help? Any youtubers who have good advice on this topic, websites that are reliable, apps to help practice (so far I’ve downloaded Grasshopper &amp; Mimo), or anything like that? I have absolutely zero knowledge on programming, coding, computers, or anything related to this field so I’m pretty much a blank canvas at the moment. Anything helps :)",22May2020,1
83,"Ok, so...I have a 7 month old kitten. Had her since she was 3 months. Room mate moved in 2 months ago, had regular contact with kitten previously.

My cat is generally well behaved. Very cute, very sweet. She sleeps on my legs at night, she lets me comb her fur when needed, likes being held, sits on my shoulder a lot...generally a sweet and chill cat.

At night, she's a bit wild. Gets excited easily, and as a result sometimes gets hyperactive.

...Especially towards my roommate.

When I go downstairs, my cat is always two steps ahead. I'm disabled, so she has to slow down to do so, and checks back on me if I'm slower than usual.

When my roommate goes downstairs...my cat scratches her, gets under her feet, generally is a pain in the butt.

My cat *likes* my roommate - she'll cuddle with her and play. But my cat is also a bit of a jerk to her.

I go in the bathroom? Cat waits patiently outside.

Roommate goes in the bathroom? Cat waits and immediately causes havoc, attacking her feet and running into the bathroom when the door opens.

When I cook or clean, cat watches or sits on my shoulder.

When my roommate does it, cat gets under her feet. Literally.

I tried telling her that she needs to set boundaries with my cat - like, if she scratches, move her away. Pick her up and just move her. My cat is pretty chill, gives you a bit of space, then comes back and does her thing.

But my roommate won't pick her up, saying she's worried about being scratched. But she gets so irate with my cat, which makes me incredibly anxious and tense due to C-PTSD, and whilst my cat can be a jerk, she's also very affectionate and gentle!

I just don't know what to do. I keep feeling like it's my fault. Maybe I raised my cat wrong? Maybe my fatigue and lack of activeness has made my cat seek it in my roommate? My cat has lots of toys that she often plays with (and gifts to you if she's in a good mood!) and is generally just...lovely and easygoing.

So what do I do about my cat being a jerk to my roommate?",22May2020,1
84,"Throwaway. Also sorry on mobile 


I 18F have been living with my aunt and uncle for a year now. Before I graduated high school (17 at the time) I was kicked out of my home by my mother because she wanted to live in an apartment a couple hours away with her boyfriend. I haven’t heard from her since as she changed her number. I’m really traumatized about being misused at home by my mom my whole life and then just being left alone. After I was left by her and move in with my aunt and uncle I been working for a year now and saved up enough money to get a car and take classes at community college (I start fall). However during my stay at my new home my aunt has been nagging me nonstop about what I should do about my future. I have a boyfriend who’ve I have been dating for four years now. She doesn’t like him because his family doesn’t like me because they wanted him to leave me the first years of our relationship because they thought I want any good because I grew up very poor and they at the time were overprotective. However his family seems impressed that I’ve worked so hard and was going to school soon so they stop talking bad about me. The thing about my current living situation is I am paying my own credit card, car, car insurance, and everything for my education. I find this fair as I work full time and my aunt and uncle are on social security after my  uncle retired early from work. However despite the fact that I work full time I still clean the house and do yard work. This wouldn’t be an  issue if my aunt weren’t putting her two cents in all the time. She doesn’t think I know how to do anything right because I learned how to clean and cook myself (thanks YouTube) and she doesn’t think I can even handle my own doctor appointments or even my own work. The thing is that she does nothing all day and my uncle hates that and she only does yard work and cleaning sometimes ( she cooks too but does quick easy meals or orders lots of take out.) Lately I have been home due to the current circumstances as I don’t work at an essential business. I’ve been doing all the house and yard work still and even spring cleaning now that I have more time to do so. This week my aunt and uncle got into another fight about their spending habits. This isn’t the first time they argued about the other spending too much money. During the fight my uncle tells her to get out of his sight and she threatens to leave which he told her to do just that. She made phone calls to find herself somewhere to live and told me to figure a new living arrangement out. I called my boyfriend and he asked his parents if I could live there which they said yes to to my surprise. I’m grateful they even said yes as they always had a problem with me and my family. While I was packing my aunt gets on my case about how this is a horrible idea and that I shouldn’t go with them. She told my uncle who also doesn’t like boyfriends family and suggested we wait a couple of days to figure it out. It’s been a week since then and they kept going back and fourth trying to get each other to leave. Today my uncle decided to tell me he would suck it up with her so I can live here. The problem is this isn’t the first time they almost made me find another place to live because of their martial issues this is the second time . My aunt had told me months before to move out do to them fighting again. I am furious at this point. This is also not the first time I’ve been treated like this by my family. Other then my mother my whole extended family had found excuses during my childhood to not be a part of my life and when I try to reconnect with any of them I see them once or twice and they stop talking to me again and some I had to go NC with because they where being generally not nice with me. My own father disappeared since the divorce to my mother and no one has seen him since. My bags are still packed and I’m tempted to go live with boyfriend. I have a feeling this fighting they do will lead me to need to go there anyways. At the same time because I don’t need to choose yet I’m tempted to stay and see if things could work out but I’m not too sure? 

Good people of Reddit what should I do? 

Also sorry for grammar 

TL;DR: I was kicked out by my mom at 17 and my aunt and uncle fight so much they made me think multiple times that I’ll be homeless again. I’m sick and tired of helping them and working and paying my own way to be treated like this so should I just live with my boyfriend?",22May2020,1
85,"I’m a 23 year old female. 

Twice in my life I have been diagnosed with PTSD. Once was after I was jumped by two girls as a teenager. I began having intense panic attacks often, but I did not think I actually had PTSD. 

Then I experienced an event last year in which someone I love almost died, and I began spiraling toward something very dark. I became incredibly depressed, I could not eat or sleep, I actually had to be hospitalized. There I was diagnosed again. 

In my childhood my mother’s affection was hit or miss, sometimes I received it, often I didn’t. I am the “scape goat” of the family and felt often as a child that everything that went wrong was my fault, and that somehow I was inherently defunct. My dad was, and still is a functioning alcoholic. My mom has chronic and eventually terminal illnesses. Despite all of this I love them dearly and worry about them a lot. 

So now, I am 23 and living mostly alone (roommate is never home.) I have a boyfriend for about 1.5 years who I love dearly and see myself marrying and he expresses the same. We treat each other with a lot of respect and understanding/always try to understand each other if we fail to. It’s the healthiest relationship I’ve ever formed in my life, and he is one of the people I love the most. He has mild anxiety and is really afraid of expressing feelings and struggles to do so. 

I don’t have many friends but several very close ones and they are healthy friendships (I stopped talking to people who hurt me last year, after two abusive men, and bad friends hurt me repeatedly) 

I’m in quarantine like most people and also like many, laid off for going on two months. I made good money and thankfully receive full unemployment benefits. 

At first I stayed with my boyfriend for quarantine until his roommate came home after being gone. I was slightly more anxious then, but now I’m 100x more anxious. 

Some of this feels like the time period when I got diagnosed with PTSD the second time. It’s a trigger, maybe. I am afraid to sleep and sometimes do not. I have very little appetite. I’m hyper alert and I panic often. I feel either numb or extremely depressed. I don’t feel close to anyone and that scares me. I at least still felt close to my boyfriend but my mind is telling me he doesn’t love me anymore and is tired of my shit. I have no reason to really believe that. He has assured me he does love me even. I feel my close friends are tired of me. This leads to me pulling away or holding on tighter then panicking about being needy and getting depressed and feeling extremely alone. 

I have experienced this before and thought I had a personality disorder. I’ve been given a full psych evaluation and was told this is a result of both trauma in my life and anxiety. 

I don’t want to tell anyone how I feel. I don’t think they’d get it and I sometimes prefer to mentally “shut off”, and pretend as though I am completely alone so that I don’t have to worry about being left behind anyway. The idea of telling the people I love about this feeling terrifies me. I don’t want to be seen as weak, crazy, or too fucked up. That’s how I see myself sometimes. 

I have a psychiatrist who is terrible. I don’t see a therapist but I will ask my GP for a referral for a telemedicine therapist. Right now I don’t know what to do to get through my dark times. I feel like giving up on all of my relationships and just being fucked up alone. But by no means do I actually want that. I want to not feel this way.",22May2020,1
86,"Any child, would get sad because of this because they're very expressing when it comes to emotions. Right? It's the most humane thing in human nature. 

After me, being through so much unfortunate emotional struggles against my horrible parents since I was a kid, 

...this kid didn't leave me yet. This kid, needs closure on her parents. This kid, still yearns for their love because she still has hope or maybe for once, this little girl is looking for actual genuine congratulation for becoming another age because maybe none of her parents genuinely cared in the past. 

Today, I just aged again. 21 years old. I did cry on multiple occasions. I did spend half of the day, just spending my birthday alone in the flesh, I sang myself happy birthday while I was just standing in the kitchen eating my birthday cake I made, alone. No one in the house except my incel hateful cold narcissist brother. 

It was honestly horrible and depressing. I did cry. No human wants that right? 

Why I cried is because I got sad that my parents didn't wish me a happy birthday. I have 32 relatives in this town that I'm currently in and know I exist but none of them wished me a happy birthday either. Except one, carrie, messaged me at 9 pm. 

A 21 year old female, crying because her mommy and daddy didn't wish her a happy birthday. Horrible people would mock me, yes. Normal people, would care, yes. 

This is how I was raised like. I became this emotional soft girl. I cannot change it. I can cry if I want to. 

I will cry and cry even because of this. Because I know this is not right. 

It hurts me so much. 

This loneliness is eating me up. I've been friendless for 10 years. Emotional neglected even today. Suicidal since 2015.

Even my birthdays became my new fear. 

So, I'd just want some advices on how to (title). If it's possible.

89,"( before I start for those of you that don’t know what ocd is its basically patterns or rituals that a person follows to relive temporary fear or anxiety about a situation)

I know this is long but pls read because i really need anyone elses input on the situation

I don’t even know where to start.. My mom has Never been a stable person. She has had very bad anxiety and ocd issues for along as I can remember. In the 16 years that I have been alive she has never gotten help for it. The only was she deals with it is taking it out on other people. She has always had very weird ways of doing things to prevent dangers that aren’t real. She passed that trait down to me. I have dealt with A LOT of mental health issues from since I was very young. It started with just the ocd when I was about 8, I was repeating the same patterns (like shutting the front door just the right way/ number of times because I was made to believe that if I didn’t someone would break in and tons of other things like that) that I saw my mom doing because according to her that was the only way to be safe. the more time went on the more terrified I got. I was so scared that I would do something wrong and my whole family would die or my house would burn down because of me forgetting to turn something off or lock something. My mental heath problems snowballed from there. Over the years my ocd turned into constant anxiety and social anxiety, which turned into depression and anorexia, which turned into cutting myself and suicidal thoughts. By the time I was about 14 I didn’t have a single friend, was Hating my life, Hating my body, Cutting myself and seriously considering suicide daily. On top of all of this my home life was hell, My parents were screaming at each other every day, my dad was cheating on my mom, Divorce was constantly discussed, They were occasionally very violent with each other. Chairs were thrown across the room, at least 4 cell phones were smashed, my mom had to call the police on my dad multiple times. All of these things felt like the weight of the world on my shoulders. Eventually I had had enough. I talked to my mom about it. She told me that my problems were ‘’ a heart issue’’ and ‘’ I just needed to get right with God’’. Those words hurt me so much. That night I had a panic attack because I thought I was never going to get help because she didn’t believe me… She didn’t believe me. Eventually after more months of suffering she agreed get me meds… from Whole Foods. She said she googled my problems and that I should start taking a vitamin… so I did and nothing got better. I mean what do you expect its a vitamin. So than she agreed to finally take me to a therapist. The therapist said that I should start taking a prescription medicine. My mom was not sold on the idea. She acted like I would be a drug addict if I started on meds. Eventually she agreed and after some time it helped a lot! I was starting to feel myself again! But I still had bad weeks, bad months. My mom took it upon herself to decide that i had enough treatment and that I was cured. my mom stoped taking me to the appointments or even letting me know when i had an appointment after some time. she would always say that she ""forgot that i had an appointment"" or that she ''didn't feel good'' so that she wont have to take me which made things super weird between me and my therapist and completely ruined that relationship . She never took my mental health as a real concern even when i was suicidal. when i started taking meds for it she acted like i was a drug addict and she still make fun of me for it. i was always and still am super frustrated that she just decided for me that i had gotten better and no longer needed a therapist.

Which brings us up to the current times. She has been 10 times more crazy than usual. she flips out at the smallest things and i feel like i have to walk on egg shells to not do anything that sets her off. She screamed at me for putting a gallon of milk on the table the other day because apparently that gallon of milk was not safe for anyone to touch but her. She freaks out when anyone touches the groceries or even goes by the front door. I haven't been outside in 4 months... 4 MONTHS not even in my back yard because she thinks that it's too dangerous. i'm starting to realize that my dad isn't as bad as i thought he just snapped after dealing with her insanity for 20 years of their marriage. She is extremely temperamental and when she's mad she refuses to talk about it she just screams because louder = right... If you try to talk to her about anything that shes doing she screams cuss words and for you to shut up, then she picks apart whatever she can about you and goes to cry in the corner so shes the victim. I'm getting so tired of this constant gas lighting and manipulation from her. i cant take how controlling she is any more... and i don't know what to do about it. My mental health has been not great lately but i know that i can't see a therapist again because of what she did last time.

91,"I want to get a job this summer. I am 21 and just finished my first year of college. I live with my father and don’t really have any other living options due to covid19. The issue is that he has always been against me having a job. He has told me that I should just focus on school or being a kid, that it was too expensive/time consuming for me to work, that I don’t need to work, or that me working would increase the EFC on the FAFSA. However, he also tells family how lazy I am and that I refuse to get a job. He will yell at me for being lazy and not working or say “I’m gonna make you get a job and you’re not going to like it” or “Why should you have a job that you like if I don’t like mine?” I had a job on-campus at my college this past school year and I enjoyed it. I didn’t let my father know about it, though. I was able to work the job and get a 4.0 GPA while taking 18 credits and being involved in activities. It didn’t cause me any difficulty with my academics or social life or anything else. I’m afraid of bringing up work because I don’t want to be yelled at and I don’t want to be wrong for asking. I also don’t want to be forced to work because it confuses me. This causes me a lot of stress and confusion because I want to work and I enjoyed my previous job, but it seems weird to like something that I am being forced to do or am told that I don’t like it/don’t want to do it. I also don’t really like the power aspect where I ask and then he makes it forced. I don’t understand why he can’t just say yes.

Am I being unreasonable for wanting to work?  I have read online that working won’t increase the EFC unless I make over a certain amount of money.  Should I just deal with not working until I go back to college in August?  I am taking two online classes, so it's not like I won't have anything to do.  Do I just suck it up and submit to the power since he is my father and I should be respectful?  I might just apply for some jobs and not let him know that I’m working until it’s official, but I don’t want to anger him.

94,"I’m obsessed and I need help

A while back I broke up with my Pakistani friend and it was a very toxic relationship. Him and I would be friends for 4 months and then not be friends fight stop talking to each and be friends four months later and the cycle kept repeating itself. This happened over the course of a year and a bit. A few months ago I decided to cut off ties with him and stop everything with him. Recently I decided to reach out to him and make amends for everything. Long story short, he doesn’t care. So from that, I developed an obsession over Pakistani men and Pakistani sex. All I can think of is having sex with a Pakistani, Pakistani men naked, what their dicks look like, how it would feel to have one on top of me and do those things to me. How does it feel to just have sex with a Pakistani. Because I am not Pakistani, I find myself imagining interracial Pakistani sex everyday and I don’t like that. I get horny by just thinking about Pakistani or when I see a Pakistani man I just think sex right away, dicks, and what it must feel like. I got obsessed over their size and all that and I don’t know how to stop this obsession. 

I’m not obsessed with any other group except for Pakistani men and I think this largely has to do because I broke up with my Pakistani friend. If I’m not fantasizing about Pakistani sex, I’m in a complete feeling of resentment towards all of them and hate them. It just reminds me of the toxicity I had with my ex friend. 

I don’t know how to navigate through this. I just wish I didn’t have this happening to me and I need help. It’s scary and I don’t want this to continue anymore. It’s taking up a good portion of my like and myself and I can’t talk to anyone about it.

(F17)

I discovered I had a septate hymen about a year ago when I first (successfully) put a tampon in. Long story short, when I went to go take it out, it wouldn’t budge, so I took a mirror and discovered that a piece of tissue or something was straddling the entrance to my vagina. I eventually got it out myself by pushing the tissue to the side, which was a little painful/uncomfortable. I looked it up and I undeniably have a septate hymen. Basically what this means is that I can’t use tampons or have sex (technically I could but it would be painful and in my case I think nothing larger than a tampon could go in). It can be fixed with a minor surgery. 

It took me months to tell anyone about this, and today I finally told my mom. I was expecting her to be concerned and look up what it is and stuff but she just said “you are not getting surgery just to use a tampon” and ended the conversation. 

I also have a boyfriend (haven’t seen him in forever cause of corona but we FaceTime everyday) and we’ve talked about sex and I’m so afraid to disappoint him when he finds out that we probably can’t do it. 

I think next time I go to the doctor for yearly checkup I will ask about it but my mom never leaves the room and I never ask her to leave because I don’t want her to think I’m hiding anything.

I feel like I’m wearing a chastity belt and I feel alone in this. I’m too embarrassed to talk to anyone about it. Should I try and push this issue with her?

98,"First off please please be nice, this is my mom and I love her. Secondly I'm not trolling, I'm going to add a little back story to make that clear, so skip the first paragraph if you want to.

My mom is of the 'f*** the man' era. In general growing up, I think it had a positive impact on me. She was onto the food industry from the get go, about all the fun ways they hide sugar and other ingredients in packaged food. She encouraged me to question why I might not want to shave my legs or wear makeup, but was equally encouraging when I decided to and bought me crazy pallets and color so I could express myself. She's been warning me and anyone who will listen about data collection on cellphones and credit cards for years. Yeah there was that one time she got light acupuncture (yes lasers). Yes she does a lot of cleanse/detox stuff, but she studies plants and herbs, and her bff is a bruja (a medicine woman, not a weird white lady). Up until recently everything she's said, while out there is harmless and sounds like she put a lot of thought into it. Like she always sounded like herself.

Recently she sounds like an extreme reddit meme. The vaccines we took were okay, but now they are poisoned, or have nanotechnology. No can tell her what's in them. Covid is so they could put up 5g towers. 5g is bad. She watches a lot of YouTube videos and so do all of her friends apparently.

I tried explaining how Youtube's algorithm works. Anyway she told me she would be open to looking at material I sent her. I want to show her that 'the man' is the person doing this to her. The problem is, I need material that she would be receptive to. I'm not asking anyone to do my homework for me, I'm happy to research, but I'm not sure where to start. Obviously anything from the government is out. I guess I'm looking for some kind of maverick-esk doctor/investigative journalist or something to A) disprove all the actual information and B) show how she being intentionally manipulated.

101,"19 year old male here and it may just be cause I’m a virgin but unless I decide “I guess I’ll masturbate” I rarely EVER get horny.  I’ve gotten jabs at me before about how horny I must be all the time which I never minded but then I started to realize that ALL these dudes think about is sex 24/7 and how to get it.  It gets talked about as a human need like eating but I’ve just never felt that.

I’m not that much of an outcast or a weirdo.  I work out, like sports, drink, smoke like most people my age.  I’ve just never felt that drive and I feel like that’s what separates me from them

103,"About a month ago I was in a car accident because my brother was on his phone while driving. I broke my neck but it was healing and at first the doctors thought there was a good chance I would fully recover. Two weeks ago that changed after a surgery. I woke up with no feeling in my lower body and it hasn’t come back. Now it’s very possible that I’ll never  walk again, and I’ve realized that I’ll need to forgive my brother eventually. I just have no idea how honestly. Half of me doesn’t even want to speak to him, but the other half wants to get it over with so we can be on good terms again. Before the accident we were pretty close. My reasoning is that it would probably be better to have the support of my whole family while in recovery if possible. 

I’m just not even sure how to approach him really. I’ve spent the past month pretty much ignoring every attempt he’s made to contact me, and now I almost feel guilty. I’m not sure if I want an apology or what it is I want. Any ideas about how I should approach him and what I should say? Many thanks.",22May2020,1

106,"Never been in this situation before. Grew up isolated and homeschooled and never had any long term friends. We met 8 months ago, and she’s my first long term friend and relationship. We never lost our bond, nor did we ever lose touch. We had a couple of disagreements, one in March and one in April. We healed from the one in March rather quickly, but- it took some time to get over the one from April.

We are just getting back to normal the other day. She wasn’t talking much because she was under the impression that I didn’t want to speak to her. After I communicated to her that I love her company and speaking to her, we just clicked back together, just like that. We’re gonna take a bit to get back to 100 percent- but we’re doing great!

I feel like we need a long talk, on the phone, not over text. I feel like we should discuss and clear the air from our recent issues. I still love her deeply and I feel like it’d be better to try to make it better, rather than throwing it away.

107,"1. Junk food- I love eating junk food bc it just tastes good, and my family and I have ample amounts of it right now. How do you stop the craving of wanting to go downstairs and eat the food? I know I should stay focused on my diet, but it’s tough
2. Motivation- I’m usually a very motivated guy, but during quarantine, it’s kinda hard to stay motivated to continue to work out and go for jogs and do things. How do you motivate yourself to want to do things? I mean I wanna reach the end result, I’m just not sure what’s enough to push me. 
3. My family- they see me as an fit guy who’s healthy and very motivated. I don’t want to let them down and they kinda get mad at me when I say I want to lose weight: saying things along the lines of, “Why, you don’t need to. I need to. You’re fine.” I guess I’m just complaining, but I don’t feel like they know my perspective on how I look at myself.

109,"Hello Reddit I (M21) have a life decision to make. So this is going to be a long one. Don't worry I'll include a TL:DR at the bottom  As a little back story I've been living in Arizona with my adopted family my whole life. Got sick of the landscape and the culture and wanted a fresh start so I've been saving up for the past 2 years to move up to Washington. I also wanted to be closer to my biological mother and siblings who I've been in contact with from a young age.

Now I finally got to move up here a few months ago in the beginning of February, I moved in with my biological mom and her family till I could get a job and afford a place. I loved it at first and my bio family was excited to see me and have me stay with them. I celebrated my 21st with my mom and her husband and went out to some bars with them. I was able to get a full time job welding within a month. I was starting to look at housing options and figuring out cost of living expenses when the pandemic hit and I got furloughed from work. That's when SHTF... 

(Side note: My biological family has been extremely strict when it comes to quarantine, they've made it clear that if I go back to work that I can't come back to their home and I would need to move somewhere else. I'm also not allowed to order delivery or take out food even if it's contactless and I sanatize Avery thing before bringing it in the house. My license plate expired soon after I moved here but I'm not allowed to go to the DMV to renew it, because I could bring the virus back with me.)

At first I didn't think I would be furloughed for long, I had a job in the manufacturing industry in a company that was expanding. Then it got obvious that quarantine wouldn't be temporary and I needed to find some source of income. So at first I looked at remote jobs I could do from home that wouldn't put my family or myself at risk. But it became clear that I don't have the skill sets and experience for remote work. (I've mostly worked in construction my whole life) So after a few weeks and no job offers I decided I needed to apply for jobs I have skills for. That means I would need to move out before starting work, which is kinda risky.

It was at this point that things started to get pretty tense. My mom noticed I wasn't getting job offers and that I was extremely stressed about not having income. And that it was having a negative impact on my sleep and mental wellbeing. She pointed out that I shouldn't be stressing as much as I am and gave me some advice/pointers on how to deal with that. However, at the same time she repeatedly brought up her opinion that I am not motivated enough and that I need to have better structure in my life. She suggested setting a curfew and other rules for me, basically micromanaging my routine and treating me like a child. I told her I didn't like that idea and she responded by saying ""well I'm sure not living in this house would motivate you to get things done."" 

After that first set of red flags came the second. My mom's husband (btw not my father legally or biologically) heard that his job was considering reducing hours, pay and or staff due to the pandemic. (He works from home as IT networking support). When he found that out my mom told me that I would probably not really be affected by it anytime soon. However she did say if her husband lost hours, pay or his job the first thing they would do would be to give me an ultimatum of either pooling all the money I spent 2 years saving into their resources (which would only last them a couple months), or moving out and figuring things out on my own. But even if I did pool my money with theirs, once that ran out they would still tell me to pack my things and go. 

I considered just packing up and leaving right when I heard that. I wasn't about to jeopardize my life savings and my health and safety just because they think they're justified in demanding everything I have. But I decided the risk of that actually happening was low and it was better for me to just keep job searching.

Another little red flag. At first I was totally allowed to drink at home, I'm 21 after all and my mom and her husband drink. I've had a few drinks before 21 and I'm familiar with my limits. But I've never been drunk in their house, I just don't enjoy being intoxicated around sober people, especially kids. I've also struggled with insomnia symptoms for years so I used marijuana as a sleep aid with their permission and I always left the property to use. (They have kids, duh.) However, one night I came home after toking up before bed after everyone else was asleep. And I started a kettle of tea, then forgot about it and left it on all night. I know, big good on my part. No fires were started though, just ended up with a dry and hot kettle. Naturally my mom and her husband were upset. But instead of just addressing the situation, bringing it up to my attention and working on a solution with me, they decided without consulting me that I am no longer allowed to drink alcohol or use marijuana whatsoever. I disagreed with the severity of their decision but I understand I'm living in their house, not mine. So since then I've stuck to their rule and I've been sober since.

Now it's been nearly 2 months since quarantine started and I've been spending 4 hours a day applying for jobs, following up and contacting companies. I've gotten 2 responses from jobs I've applied to in that time and one was a scam. I've applied for unemployment but since I barely moved here I don't qualify for Washington employment. I also applied for unemployment in Arizona last year so that claim is also making me intelligible for Washington unemployment. But because I now have a Washington address I can't get Arizona unemployment. I started a teaching English course to get certified and get teaching English as a foreign language job online. But that will take months to get my certification.

Now here we are to today. My mom just called me out and said that she's convinced that because I don't have a job yet, the only reason for that has to be that I'm not working hard enough to get a job. Regardless of the literal global pandemic happening around us. I've been telling her how I am applying to jobs keeping her up to date with my progress, but she thinks I'm lying to her and I'm making up the work that I'm doing. Not only that but she thinks that I'm doing drugs (not just marijuana) behind her back. It's obvious that she has made up her mind on what she thinks reality is, despite my efforts to correct her view. She also said that she resents me for making my shortcomings and irresponsibility her problem.

Should I just pack my things up and leave now? I feel like I'm just generally resented for being here and considered a hazard to the family. It's obvious that I have lost my mom's trust for whatever reason she has concocted. But if I move back to Arizona and start from square one I'll feel like a failure and probably just give up. I've wanted to move here for 5+ years and been saving for 2+, but ever since I've gotten here I've just been sh*t on and broken down mentally and emotionally.

TL:DR moved across the country for a fresh start and to be closer to family. Moved in with family, got stuck with them because of the pandemic. Turns out my family is super restrictive and paranoid. Struggling to find a job. Now my mom thinks that I'm not working hard enough to get a job and thinks I'm doing drugs behind her back.",22May2020,1

114,"I have an older brother who graduated high school last year and hasn't really done anything since. I graduated this year and have plans to move out, go to college, start a career, yada yada yada.. but he doesn't seem to want to do any of that. I mean I get it, college isn't for everyone, but all he does is play video games and smoke weed all day. He will do anything to get his hands on weed and honestly it's on the border line of addiction. Our mom freaks out and loses her head every time she catches him high, and the relationship between my brother and my mom has completely deteriorated. My mom is scared that my older brother isn't going to do anything with his life. I have tried motivating him and talking to him about moving out with me and going to a trade school or something, but I don't know if I'm getting through to him. In the past I also used to yell at him for not helping out enough, like how my mom does, but I've stopped doing that and am now just focusing on motivation. The relationship between me and my brother has improved, and I can tell he misses the social interaction of school but lacks motivation/social skills to put himself out there. I understand that not everyone wants to do something impactful or inspiring with their life, but how can I motivate my older brother to do something like find a job or move out or find something productive? Should I even try? Or am I just being an asshole by trying to tell him what to do with his life unprompted? I really appreciate the advice in advance.

117,"I really need advice on this one. I tried talking to my mom about it, but she wasn't very helpful. All she told me was that I had to ""get used to it"". If anyone could help me regain confidence, it would be much appreciated! Let me explain what happened....

Today, I walked to a pharmacy close to my house and bought some stuff I needed. The reason why I walked/jogged was because it was such a beautiful day. The sun was out and it was so warm! I live in Canada, so days like these are a blessing, especially in May. 

After I bought what I needed, I left the pharmacy and started to walk home. I noticed a group of sketchy-looking guys walking towards me. They didn't look well-kept, so naturally, I felt a little off. I steered my walking to the very side of the sidewalk and noticed that they didn't really make space for me to walk past them. In a way, I had to squeeze through them to get passed them. As I was squeezing through, one of the guys nudged another guy and said loudly, ""Check out the hips on **that** one."" The other guys in the group started chuckling and looking harder. Never in my life have I felt so objectified... Other people around me heard what he said, but nobody said anything. I felt so unsafe, self-conscious, and ashamed. I felt like what had happened was my fault in a way... I was wearing leggings, so maybe it was my fault that they looked at me. 

I tried talking to my boyfriend, but I don't think he understands. He admits that what those guys did was wrong, but he also said that I can't expect guys to not look at me or think things when I walk past them. I understand his point. I'm curvy (big hips and small waist), but sometimes it just frustrates me that I can't lead a normal life without having men say these things about me. The experience makes me want to cry. I love myself, and I love my body, but sometimes I wish I didn't look the way I look to avoid having these things happen...I just feel so helpless. I feel unconformable with the idea of having to go out in public... Does anyone have any advice they could give me to make me overcome this experience?",22May2020,1
118,"I have zero confidence. Make that negative three thousand confidence.

Anyway, I’m scared that she and my brother will laugh if I ask to be tested for it. I’m seventeen but I do have a health condition. It’s not supposed to affect teenagers, though, but like I said I’m showing 5+ of the listed symptoms. There’s a high likelihood she’ll tell my dad, who’ll tell my grandparents who I’m sure will think I’m just being paranoid or looking for attention (if it’s not sitting at home studying the Bible or making straight A’s at school, my grandma thinks everything I think or do is ridiculous).

So at first I didn’t think much of online classes and did the work until I wanted to take a break. Little did I know it would go downhill from there. When I took a break and played videogames, I was having so much fun that I did not want to look at the work because I was scared that there would be a lot of it, and the more I didn’t look at it. The more the work would pile up and then the cycle continues. So after a week of the cycle continuing I decide to get some work done. Only to realize I was VERY behind.

125,"TL;DR at bottom.

So, I have several tattoos that have pretty personal meanings. My mom and I do not have a good relationship at all.

One of her friends was at the house and I was talking to my mom and her friend. Her friend saw one of my tattoos that's the Latin motto for my surname's coat of arms. She tries reading it but can't because it's in handwriting and Latin. My mom asks me the meaning behind it and to try to get her to leave me alone about it, I jokingly tell her it's a curse on anybody who asks about it. She replies with ""I guess you're ashamed of it, then,"" trying to bait me into explain it.

I'm not ashamed of it, not embarrassed of it, I just think it's a tattoo I got because it had an important meaning to me. My mom has asked about my tattoos before, and I've tried telling her that it means something to me, and it's not up for discussion. She honestly thinks that because the tattoos are visible to her, she has the right to demand what they mean.

I don't tell her the meanings behind or reasons for getting my tattoos because she is extremely judgemental, she is already degrading about me having tattoos, and it would be opening myself up for her to attack me. I don't want to do that.

TL;DR I have several tattoos and my mom believes it's her right to know why I got them/their meaning, then degraded me when I tell her I got them for personal reasons. How do I deal with this and get her to stop asking about it?",22May2020,1

128,"Hi Reddit. Asking for some pieces of life advice. And want to let my steam off  (textually).

Im 19. I live in Russia, my mom too. She met my father on work, so they started working together.  So the romance begun. After the 8-months of their relationship they she conceived by him. After undefined period of time they just broke up. As my mom told me, she haven’t seen him since that moment. When I was born, he helped us finically (as she told). So I started my enthralling but measured life without him. 
About a couple of weeks ago one man started texting me that we need to talk about my father. For the first time, I didn’t really believed this man. It’s all seemed to me a scam.
After 2 weeks of chatting me this detective started doing this from the second account, so I agreed to text to my “imaginary father” in whatsapp. 
It was him. My mom confirmed that so we started talking about everything. He lives in US. 
I have a tremendous number of my brothers and sisters (I would like to hide this information). One of them texted me, and said she surprised as much as me. But I don’t know why did he hide me.  
After all, all my thoughts are dedicated to my future. United States was my dream for a long time. Now I don’t know. I lived in the good family but without such success and happiness. I lived measured. Now I don’t know what to do. My mom is a good and quite successful person, but I see that I can do more than her.

130,"Hi. I'm 17 years old and graduating high school this year. Before all schools closed I was in a class with this girl who was a year younger than me (she took a class a year ahead). I always thought she was really cute, and I always wanted to try talking to her, but I always got nervous. Then school ended and I never got the chance. 

I have her on snapchat and Instagram but we've never really had a conversation. I'm not sure how to start a conversation without being weird, considering we have never ever talked. I know we have some things in common, like we both play guitar, but other than that I can't think of a way to start a conversation. I don't consider my self unattractive by any means, but I am a little shorter than average which is a big deal for girls,  so I'm also worried she's out of my league. 

I'm also considering if it's even worth trying to talk to her. I'll be leaving town for university in September and she will still be in school for another year. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",22May2020,1
131,"I live kind of in between a big city and the suburbs. I have spent a few years wandering these woods and exploring them and having a wonderful time. I felt really happy to have access to such awesome nature within walking distance. 

Though I am a woman walking alone in the woods, so I am usually somewhat aware/cautious/ nervous when Im in secluded areas

Now I am terrified of these woods and I feel really sad. Sad for the people who lost someone, sad for the woman who died and sad for my loss of nature I think? Sad and scared? I cant figure it out really but I feel pretty upset, which seems weird because I did not know the person. 

Also, its not the first body found in these woods, its actually the 3rd. All of them have been women. But its been a few years since the last one. The woods have lots of pathways in them and seem to have a lot of traffic, although ive never seen anyone. Theres lots of nips and various other trash that show signs of use. 

Im tired of men saying “you can get hurt anywhere, no reason to be scared of walking alone in a secluded area as a woman” or things like that. On different social platforms comment sections Ive been seeing a lot of that. Women expressing concern and men being like nbd. So I am also feeling sad about the privilege that having a male body allows (I know its not always)

I guess I want to feel at peace in nature and enjoy all the good things, but now im just terrified and anxious and sad. 

I keep wishing I could wear those wrist knives the assassins creed guy wears, I feel like those would make me feel safer. 

Maybe Im just in mourning? 

I guess im looking for any words of wisdom or anyone in a similar situation, of loving the wilderness but also being terrified of it?

135,"Sometimes hearing, ""you're not doing it right"" or ""you should've done this"" or ""don't do that"" etc. gets too much for me. It honestly drags me down, makes me feel bad, and makes me feel like everything I do is wrong. It's effecting my mental health. It also makes me kind of upset when I make a mistake that someone else makes and they get mad at me for making that same mistake. 

Even if it were simply telling me that I am doing something right every once and a while, it would make me feel so much better about myself. It's almost like what I do that is not good, is noticed. And what I do that is good, is unnoticed.

She started noticing her dirty underwear being left on her bed and not in the hamper. The 2nd and 3rd time finding them being moved has led her to believe its her little brother. She isnt 100% sure so I suggested setting up phone camera in room when she goes for a shower, which is when this has been happening. The first few times she thought she was seeing things, but now it’s a little obvious. 

She isn’t really sure what to say or what to do about it if she does discover it’s her little brother. she doesn’t want to tell her family and embarrass him. She also has a different type of relationship with some of her family members so that sort of conversation might get weird with them.

Recently though (within the last 3 years), I've been feeling distant from her ever since she got a sugar daddy. So now she is swimming in all this wealth and telling me to come with her to random weekend vacations that I simply can't afford. In addition, when we go shopping she buys Chanel bags and diamond jewelry on the spot and quite frankly it leaves me feeling a bit awkward because I just stand there not being able to afford any of that stuff. Conversations have been pretty shallow too; I'm trying to discuss life goals and deeper meanings to things, and she usually steers the conversation to ""what do you think of this Hermes bag"". I've talked to her about this before and response was that, because I am in law school and will be a lawyer, I will experience wealth too and we'll be on the same page.

It’s been a long time coming. I am her only friend. I feel guilty leaving her out so she’s stuck around. She is selfish. She gets drunk and tries to embarrass me by lying as well as telling people stuff I told her not to tell anyone. She has screamed at me and insulted me many times drunk. She always blames it on the alcohol...

I have never met someone so dependent on me. She relies on me for everything. She clings to my hip and follows me around when we go out. She mimics the same mannerisms I do to an extent I’ve never could have imagined. If I can’t help her or if I try to set boundaries with her, she gets mad. 

She has a good heart in my opinion. I am just tired of being brought down by her. It’s so draining. Nothing against her or people like her, but she’s not very bright. It might be way shes so dependent. 

I’ve tried to talk to her about her actions so many times and she never changes. Almost every time I’ve stood up for myself, she says I’m being mean and I give up. She talked bad about me last night and I don’t know if I should ghost her or tell her I need space or just let it go and move on by working on myself or what.

155,"So, a bit of context:

I'm a senior. I moved to a new school junior year, so I already missed the train to be ingrained into a friends group in high school. I moved a couple times before, and things were messy, but junior year was a new start. I made friends and all, but I ended up getting attached to a couple people, who may or may not care about me too much. 




I feel like my whole life I've been looking for someone to care, as cliche as that sounds. So I may be clingy. I don't show my emotions, so even these people don't know that. I'm very reserved, and save interactions for when other people interact with me. I fear that people may think I'm pushy if I start a conversation, as it feels like that if I do, so I don't. Internally though, there are a few people I feel like I'm obsessing over, or rather, really non stop thinking about. I talk to them sometimes, but since quarantine I haven't heard from them in a while. It seems like they've moved on, but I'm still stuck in my place.




Another person who I still talk to over social media, although they are friendly, seem to be busy with a lot of other things, or some such, and have grown increasingly distant over time. 



It feels like, in general, that I ""need"" these people more than they ""need"" me, if that makes sense. I guess I've been looking for love for a long time, but with high school over, I know that these people will exit my life, whether I want them to or not, and that hurts.



Idk, I guess I wanted to keep on talking to them, but realistically I don't think they'd want to talk to me, I'm not exactly important at all to their life. 


Problem one is that I'm attached to them, but problem two is that I'm worried that they're presence in my mind is kind of altering my thinking or my decision making to be based around them, which is terrible I know, but I'm just unsure what to do.


On one hand I want them to be in my life, but on the other I don't think they'd want to be in mine, and I'm just scared since idk if I'll ever meet people who would want to be in my life (corny and clingy, I know, but please bare with me). 



I'm not planning on doing anything really to prevent them from leaving, as I don't want to come off as weird, but how do I mentally get over them? Like, how do I move on and stop allowing so much of my headspace to be pre-occupied by them or filled with daydreams about them?",22May2020,1
156,"Throwaway account because I don’t want my friend to find this. So I have this friend (24F), let’s call her Theresa, we met while we were in college, and we’ve both since graduated (this is way before this whole quarantine situation). We were always pretty low maintenance friends as we didn’t have the same classes all the time, but everytime we met we are able to get along well and chat about almost literally anything. Eventually we started working at different places, and Theresa started working at a small firm, and her boss, let’s call her Olivia (47F) is quite known in the industry here, and she used to be a teacher as well. Theresa and I still meet occasionally and she started to speak about Olivia in a closer way each time, telling me they went for drinks alone after work. I thought nothing of it and was in fact pretty happy for her she found a boss that could get along with her. 

One day it became apparent to me she seemed to be in a relationship (she has never been in one before), so I was really happy she found someone and asked her who it was, she became kind of coy about it and I somehow guessed it was Olivia. At first I found it a bit odd to be with your boss, but I tried to be as supportive as possible since she seemed so happy. Her family have always been devout Christians so she told me she was going to have a problem about that. (For context, they are such strong believers she used to tell me she too, believe that homosexuality is a sin). I do not practice religion so I usually remain respectful of her views as much as I can. 

So anyway, she became really concerned about how her family would view it and she never told them about the r/s. I tried to be supportive, she appreciated it. She started telling me about how Olivia kept pressuring her to tell her family so they’ll understand she is in a relationship and allow them to spend more time together - so this is at risk of her being disowned by her family (her words). Olivia also kept wanting to meet all of Theresa’s friends which to me is a red flag, because it felt, to me like she was trying to mark territory. It’s to the point where she really got upset that Theresa didn’t make plans her to meet her friends. She seems to like to force Theresa into plans, and being her boss, she was essentially trapping my friend into a low-paying job, telling her she was separating their work and personal relationship, and professionally my friend was not at the level where she deserves to be paid better. I kept trying to tell Theresa she could stay in the relationship but it will be better if she stopped working for her cause those things get messy. 

So anyway, one day she suddenly told me Olivia wanted to meet me as well, and to bring my SO as a double date. I didn’t feel comfortable with that as I, in general, don’t meet up with my friends SO nor do I usually hang out with my SO’s friends. It’s just something I find awkward because you never really know what to say (but that’s just me). So I told her that, and I didn’t want my SO to feel obligated as well. I managed to almost get away from it once, but she made me say hi to her Olivia as she was nearby from where me and Theresa was meeting. It was an awkward hello and she actually referred to me as their “beard” for those that knows what it means in an LGBT r/s. For context this is because my friend lies to her family that she’s with me when she’s usually with Olivia. We’re not in a fake relationship so you wouldn’t really call that a beard lol. The interaction was uncomfortable for me. She is practically my mother’s age. 

So anyway, I haven’t met Theresa in some time but through Facebook I noticed she seemed to change quite a bit, she became really active and just publicising their relationship despite her parents still being in the dark. This quarantine period came and we caught up a bit chatting on Facebook. She suddenly tells me she is going to move out - in the midst of this pandemic (probably to stay with Olivia). To be honest I’m really tired about this issue, I hate to feel like I supported her into deserting her family to be with someone like Olivia. From my point of view, my friend is trapped in a relationship with her predator of a boss but I can’t bring myself to tell her that. She feels pretty alone anticipating her family’s objection and I don’t want her to feel unsupported, because I know my objection will just push her further away. Maybe it could be that I don’t want to be the bad friend, either. The logical way is to let her jump into it and live her life but something just feels off to me. 

Should I say something, or will it be out of line?",22May2020,1
157,"So this story has to do with my little sister. Lately she has been going to get therapy and before this we didn't have the best of relationships. We were never mad at each other but we never talked much between each other. But after having gone for about 2 months to therapy she has been opening up and today I got a call out of the blue from her and she broken-down in tears. She then revealed toe that 2 of my cousins had raped her when she was 6yrs old. A little of a back story when we were younger we moved from the IS back to our home country of Lebanon and this is where the situation took place. One cousin was in his late teens early twenties and the other was around 15 tonl 17 years old. These are the two that raped her and they are both brothers. I don't know how long this went on her nor how repetitive it was. But I believe my sister when she tells me it took place as these cousins of hours never truly liked us from the beginning and even growing up have robbed our house robbed out furniture broken promises and the list goes on but that's a topic for another Reddit post. Now my main questions are is 
1) how to I bring closure to my sister and what do I do when she calls? She's reaching out to me and I would like to build that a bridge I never had with her but I'm not the most talkative person and dont know what to tell her to make her feel better. 
2) what do I do with the knuckle heads? They live in Lebanon and will never be coming to the us both are now married and have children and are in their 30s and 40s. Lebanon of you don't know is very loose when it comes to laws and for a couple hundred dollars I could hire some people to pay them a ""visit"" I don't mean murder but they maybe some broken bones and a visit to the hospital or should inlet this thing ride out?

I met this kid in University, we shared the same class (trying to keep this as vague as possible/scared he has reddit). I thought he was cool and just an overall chill guy to be college friends with. Until, it took a weird turn. This kid deals with a lot of problems mentally, I guess? He’s very sadistic and disturbing. He told me all about the suicidal and homicidal thoughts he has and threatens to do things to himself. Especially when we met. I’m a very sensitive person and I always want to help people, which is why I’m in this issue in the first place.

I tried to help him all the time but it’s getting so scary and weird that I can’t. I unfriended him on a lot of social media accounts (Instagram, Twitter, Imessage etc) and blocked some.

So basically I am an adult woman with 5 adult siblings, two years ago we all agreed to pitch in together to buy my little brother a really nice phone for his birthday (my parents also agreed to put in some money.) this was a really big deal for him because our family isn’t well off and we are all really poor, he had never had a phone before. Well the day came that all of us siblings and our parents agreed to meet up and buy him a phone and everyone flaked but myself and my sister Tyler. My parents said they were broke my other four siblings just basically told us they didn’t want to do it anymore even though we literally discussed it the day before we were all supposed to meet. So Tyler and I felt extremely bad because between the two of us we didn’t have enough cash to buy a brand new phone, and my dad already told him he was getting a iPhone 8. Turns out my husbands cousin sells used phones so we broke and bought one off of him. We knew there was a decent chance the phone was stolen but when we called to get it activated boost activated it no problem so we honestly thought it was a good non stolen phone. Important: we did NOT tell my family where we got the phone from- we said it was on sale at some store by our house. Well flash forward to today my mom is switching phone providers and it turns out his phones been blacklisted we’re assuming because it was stolen. Therefore he cannot use it anymore or have it reactivated. So my dad asked us where we got it from and when I told him he was super pissed. Like he didn’t yell but he sounded really upset. My sister Tyler lives with me and my hubby and we’re currently trying to figure out what to do. They told my 13 year old brother that we stole his birthday gift so he’s super disappointed in us, we called him and apologized and explained that we didn’t know it was stolen when we bought it. He’s a really polite kid but we could hear it in his voice. 
Here’s the advice part: what can we do? We offered to put in for a new phone or flat out buy him a new phone but my dad is so upset he keeps ignoring my offer, my mom won’t even talk to me or my sister. I feel really bad but he did get two years out of the phone and they were going to buy him a new one anyways this Christmas. Part of us doesn’t want to spend 500+ on a new phone just for it to be replaced in a few months but I also feel like it’s our responsibility?

I just don’t know what to do anymore and it’s not like quarantines helping. But, it does feel relieving to vent. Any advice for what to do would be helpful, thank you!",22May2020,1
163,"A family member is suffering from health problems that are worsening each day. I think they require immediate medical treatment or their body will just shutdown. Their country of residence is corrupt so only private health care can be relied on.  it's very expensive so we can't afford it. Do I need to make a GoFundMe? If so, how do I go about finding people to donate? I don't have many friends so sharing the fund with them won't really do anything. 

I don't know what to do. I'm in a bad financial situation myself and the rest of my family doesn't care.  Her husband is very abusive so he's good for nothing. If I tell his relatives, he will hurt her. She doesn't live with him any more but relied on him for child support.  Her mother who's in her 70s, is working to get some money but she hasn't gotten paid in a long time becsuse government is corrupt. 

What can I do? If I don't do anything, I'm basically just gonna be watching someone die because there is no money to save her life. 

I think we need around $3000 to cover the treatment. $2000 would be get a hospital to agree to consider her for treatment. The health problems aren't COVID related because they've been gradually worsening for years.",22May2020,1
164,"I'm a 5'5"" 120 lb teenage female. I don't exercise strenuously, about an hour a day of really pushing myself. I restrict calories to about 1400 to 1700 a day, perfectly healthy (from what I understand) for my sex, age, height, and lifestyle. Despite this, I appear very chubby. And I can't chalk it up to ""not seeing myself for who I really am"" or anything. Strong hormones and a warped teenage girl self esteem doesn't allow me to physically pinch handfulls of fat from my stomach and thighs. I get that some people store fat differently, but it's stored EVERYWHERE on me. I've considered lifting more but I also don't want to get bulky...If I had to guess my own weight without already knowing, I'd say about 160 or so.

167,"I’m a bad brother and son. 

I’m 1 of 4 kids 1 brother, 2 sisters and feel like a horrible brother. 

I have an older sister, younger sister and younger brother. Ages 27, 20, and 16 respectively. 

I’ve never felt super close to my brother and it kind of bugs me but it’s my fault. 

My struggle though is the disconnect between my older sister and me.  We both live with our parents still. 

She’s suffered what I’d consider sever mental illness for over a decade. Spent 5 years at university some of which overlapped with me at the same place, but never ended up getting a degree. 

She has her issues which are very heartbreaking and I am a cruel ruthless person. I truly hate to admit it but I’m stubborn, strong willed, and have little patience. I’m not a good teacher not listener. I have my own weakness but I do have an incredibly soft spot in my heart. 

My circumstances in the household have toughened me up. 

Just to paint a clear picture I haven’t really had a real conversation with my sister I live with in years. She’s pretty guarded yet I don’t make an effort. She’s family so I love her, yet I know I can’t fix her problems but don’t even try to tackle the challenge. It frustrates me and for that reason I avoid it rather than offer support. 

Today, though, I made her cry. I guess bully is how you’d describe it? I made a joke, not necessarily a mean one, but pressed it even when it was obvious she was upset. 

I’m all torn up at the moment seeing myself push her to the point. 

The situation is exactly as described below, a while back she was fighting with me I said be nice or I’m gonna put a banana in your slippers so you step and smash it. After that I’d teased a couple times about putting a banana in her bed so when she lays down it smashes etc. 

Today she ordered a meal they forgot part of it, just for shits I dropped a banana in the carry out bag. She then threw it at me, but missed and it smashed all over the sofa. 

I sent a text saying “you have bad aim!!” Then he’d my dog to try and diffuse the situation when she returned home. 

I teased a bit more while she was eating suggesting her bad aim and I thought she was laughing, it turns out she was crying.",22May2020,1

Like lately I've been getting into child psychology and the topic of aging. All of this seems so cool to me. My problem is that I can not see myself being able to commit to anything in life. I hate the idea of having to pick something to do for the rest of my life. I only have one life to live and I want to get the most out of it and be able to do everything even though that's not realistic.

170,"This is probably one of the scariest things I’ve had to do but the first step is reaching out and admiring you need help right?

In 2017 a horrible situation with my dad was exposed he neglected both my and my sister the police came to the door, the social work came and took my sister into care I was 18 at the time and “they could do” so I went to live my dad and his gf there was no room for me to sleep so I’ve been sleeping on the sofa and still do to this day, I try and speak to my dad have a father/daughter relationship but he always tells me I’m talking shit or shouts at me for trying to have a conversation he’s only nice to me when he wants something, recently I told him I was bi and he said “stop talking shit you don’t talk to anyone” despite dating girls and guys in the past which he hasn’t been bothered about as he “doesn’t care” my dad literally knows nothing about me, my friends names, my hobbies etc he downplays my anxiety which I was professionally diagnosed with in 2016, says it’s all in my head, an act and used as an excuse 
My dad and his girlfriend argues but very very frequently. This escalated in November where every night including college nights they’d argue stuff would be thrown, nasty things would be said about me, and other family members. This stopped mid December then started up again in December 2018 my dad and his gf had both been drinking had an argument and my dad walls out saying he was gonna hurt himself, my dads gf goes to bed not caring I go out looking for my dad and later phone the police, who find him and keep him at the station that night and I had to go to college pretending everything was fine. I then seek help from the college as this started severely affecting my mental health I was getting severe flashbacks I wasn’t sleeping at night, the college involve this social worker but as I was over 18 I ask them not to involve my dad until I speak to him and I wanted all of this confidential for now they help me with the process of moving out I then speak to my dad and he rages “stop fucking telling other people our business” and he severely manipulates me into not moving out, putting doubts into my head like rent etc saying if I go out and I struggle he’s not gonna support me I then tell the social worker that I’ve changed my mind and my case is dropped. Through 2019 they’re had been arguments usually it was about my dads gfs kids and me and my little sister my dads gf severely slagged off my sister and my mum who passed in a drunken state tell her, me and my dad to get out even though me and my little sister were minding our own business making my sister cry my dad had to come in a comfort her and try and get his gf to stop which she ended up doing they slept separate that night my dad sleeping on the floor in the spare room and my dads gf unplugs the WiFi router. August 2019 was the worst yet it last two days day 1 they slept separate and my she unplugged the WiFi there was a horrible horrible atomsphere the next day that second night stuff we’re being chucked my dad smashes the place up and walks out not coming back all night we had to call the police again midday the next day to try and find him, when my dad came back he told me “to keep my mouth shut don’t tell the college, any friends of they’re will be trouble” as I didn’t want anymore arguments and got horrible flashbacks from previous I kept my mouth shut when I started back college they argued again slept in separate rooms most of the arguments would be because they had a drink and all of their issues with eachother came out this time I opened up to a friend who would sit with me for hours after college so I didn’t need to go straight home to the shitty atmosphere. I got closer with this friend and opened up about the arguing and everytime they’d been an argument I’d remove myself my friend and his mum offered me to stay there for a few if I ever needed to this happened quite often whilst I was there I didn’t need to worry about anything, I slept better, I wasn’t stressed, I still had flashbacks, I was more relaxed and felt secure without worrying that my dads girlfriend was going to kick me out all because her and my dad were arguing there was one time they had a drink argued she came into my space and said “don’t bother going to college in the morning you need to go down to the housing office as you won’t be staying here” i did NOTHING wrong that night and she came in and said that. Since lockdown everyday my dads gfs isn’t up for work in the morning they’ll both sit the night and drink and argue on Sunday I built the courage to tell them how much this is affecting me and they said “they are because of me and her kid” which made me feel like absolute shit I do everything to try and prevent them from arguing I just want everyone to be happy, I can’t relocate during this lockdown to my friends as I don’t want to risk anything there was one night they argued I went outside FaceTimed my friend and I started having a panic attack on FaceTime to my friend he heard everything and tired his best to calm me down he said he’s never heard such a toxic environment and saw me in such a state Half an hour later I go back in and ask them “stop fighting” and the door gets slammed in my face. I’m constantly worrying about my safety, being secure, when their next argument is I’ve had multiple panic attacks and flashbacks this week Tonight they had another argument and I realised that I can’t stay here anymore something clicked my mental health is going to get worse the longer I stay here but I don’t know how to go about doing it I’m scared, I  have hardly any money, no job, I don’t know if I’ve progressed to the next level of my course as I haven’t had some stuff marked and That is/was my only source of income is 20, 21 in a few month and I don’t have the best qualifications  how do I go about doing this?",22May2020,1

I’ve tried only taking one of each bin and let them take out their own but they end up using the one we empty and I’ve tried seeing if they’ll take it out if we don’t ( they left it there for the first week and I had to take it out last minute on the second week otherwise they won’t do it. Same thing with bringing them in, they won’t touch em for days I bet they’d be fine leaving it there for weeks.

I know asking them to be removed is a bit much but that’s not the only thing they’ve done.

I’ve been working as a ski instructor for 2 years now and I’m terrified to teach another year. I’m very young compared to others working at this job and I’m very weak for my age. In my job if you get a young child who is to small to get into the chair lift their self the instructor (me) has to lift them up. A few months ago I was in this situation with a young 6 year old girl, and I was to weak to lift her up properly, so she slipped off the chair and was dangling maybe 40-50 ft above ice. Of course I was not strong enough to lift her up but I was able to grab her and hold her before she fell. This kid could have died and it would be all my fault. I didn’t get written up and the parents didn’t even hear about this because I was protected by my company and I feel terrible for almost ruining this family and getting away with it 100% free. 
Apart from that I have a lot of anxiety and have trouble talking so I’m a terrible instructor anyways and all my co workers hate me. My dad wants me to work again another year at a different resort and I don’t think I can mentally even handle it. What should I do??",22May2020,1

179,"I’m crying as I write this, so I’m sorry if I don’t get straight to the point or sound all over the place. I’m twenty years old, and moved back in with my parents and grandmother after quarantine started. I have to say I’m not very independent. I don’t know how to drive, don’t have a car, don’t have a license or even an ID. It sounds ridiculous at my age (I’m embarrassed about it to)but my parents never wanted to take me and I don’t have anyone in my area I know that could help me get to DMV(I wouldn’t be allowed to go by myself). Then I went to college, and honestly just got distracted. Anyway, my mom has always been abusive to me. Physically and verbally/emotionally. I recently lost a lot of weight due to an eating disorder that progressed while I was in college, but got better after a couple months of being home. When I was younger my mom always got on me about being overweight (I wasn’t) but it felt good that she noted I lost weight. She’s also always blaming me for things I’m literally not even a part of it involved with. Today she got mad at me because my grandmother cleaned the bathroom and she got the impression that I told her to do it (I don’t know why I’d tell my grandma to do that for me) or that my grandmother always does “everything” for me and I let her. My grandmother is an extremely stubborn person and does anything she wants, even if you tell her no, she does it anyway. I also have to say this bathroom is inside my mom’s room, so I didn’t know she was in there. (I use my moms shower because my mom wants my grandmother to be the only one who uses the guest one.) anyway, today she gets home from work and a couple hours later, and apparently my step dad told her something (I don’t know what) and I hear her telling him she’s going to “start a fight with me” over something (that thing being the bathroom issue, which I had nothing to do with.) She finds out that she’s misunderstood what my step dad was saying, and goes on a rant about how I’m gaining weight  (even lately she’s told me I’m skinny and small, etc) and how I sit on my ass all day and do nothing(I exercise throughout the day in my room, eat light, don’t make messes except for my room, which I always end up organizing).  This triggered me because I thought I could do better, and I’m already contemplating my light eating schedule (lighter than before) and how I’m going to exercise even more. This isn’t the worst of how she’s treated me, but it really hurt me. She specifically said “I’m going to be very mean when I say this but you’re gaining a lot of weight.”

I’m sorry about the backstory, wanted to give an idea of the situation. I’ve dealt with this a lot in childhood and I feel stuck now.

I have a 3 year old son. On my side of the heritage, he gets some white European. French, Italian, Irish, British, all that. On the other side of the heritage is a bigger mix. A variety of West African countries, Chinese, Malaysian, Portuguese, French, maybe a few others but in v small percentages. The biggest “portions” of the mixed race pie there would be the west African coming first and the Asian coming second (though significantly smaller than the west African). I just want to lay it out now that I in no way shape or form had my son as a “mixed baby trophy” or to hop on the karjenner “black men only” train. Absolutely not! 
I am looking to buy some traditional west African clothing and home decor to honour and appreciate my sons roots from these countries. Anything I buy (if I do buy, depending on what advice I get here) will be from black owned businesses, not white people profiting off selling another culture. 

Seeing as I am white, is this considered cultural appropriation?

I wish my life never happened

I cannot emphasize enough that I would never take my own life. Although I am not a religious person, my last shred of religious philosophy has me too afraid to burn in hell forever. Having said that, it often feels like my life is hell, and I wouldn’t turn the wheel of my car very fast to avoid a fateful reckless driver.

Everyone I’ve known has left me. My mother has left me. My friends have turned on me when one of them lied about me behind my back. These were friends I’ve only had a year, as in my 17 years of life I have sat alone at lunch and seldom spoken for 16 1/2 of those years.

The people that haven’t left me are disappointed or angry at me. My teacher called me a racist in front of my entire class when I eye rolled after she corrected me saying “black history month” to “African American history month”. It ruined my reputation, and any trust I’ve had for a person. My father wants what’s best for me, but I constantly let him down. I know that every six year old has said it, and everyone tells them they’re wrong, but I still hold firm the belief that if I was better, my mother, and stepmother in years to come, would have stayed.

I am so useless I can’t even get out of bed. I just feel too sad to. I’m not gonna claim I have depression, because that would detract from the people who actually have real issues. Regardless, I don’t think I’ve been happy or motivated a single minute of my entire life.

I’m a junior in high school, and while I used to get all As, I have been failing all of my classes. While it makes logical sense, seeing as nothing I can do now will make people like me or give me a brighter future, it makes me feel worse about myself. My father pays 10,000 dollars a year to send me to a school I have a 60% scholarship for in hopes that I get a full ride to college. I’m letting him down there too.

As I have no plans for my future, I have no plans for college. I haven’t even looked at them. At this point, I’m trying to want what will happen to my life. I’m gonna sit and watch it fly by me. That’s what it’s always felt like. Despite everyone telling me I have control of my life, everything feels like something happening to me, and nothing feels like a product of my work and dedication. 17 years of life and I have nothing to show for it.

Nobody knows, and i suppose that nobody will continue to know as i am essentially anonymous, but i have been an anorexic for the past year. I went from a fat kid at 177 pounds to 111 pounds from the end of last year to the end of this year. Supposedly some people reported me to the nurse because they suspected something, so now the nurse and everyone is after me, even though i'm still a chubby person compared to the other boys in my grade. The people who won't even talk to me when i try to talk to them are trying to get me in trouble. I don't know why i am so embarrassing to be around. I get made fun of at school and called ""joker"" and ""Incel"".

Sitting here thinking, i cannot imagine an alternate universe worse than this one that exists without me. Every awkward encounter that i have had would not exist. Every time i have been a disappointment to everyone around me wouldn't exist. Every time that i have embarrassed people by being ugly, fat, and stupid around them wouldn't exist. I have no value in this world. I haven't experienced pain comparable to most anyone else, but it hurts me when i imagine my father in a happy marriage with a better child. It hurts me when i know that my there would be no hole in anyone without me.

I cannot emphasize this enough when i say that i would never end my life, as there's a big difference between wanting death and pursuing it. I just really don't wanna live anymore, and i don't wanna keep fucking everything up. To a degree, i feel like i don't have a right to live, if all i am is a waste of resources and a burden to others. I already know i don't deserve the life i want. Yesterday, as quarantine was ended, i decided to shave my head. I used to have very good hair, and a lot of it which i used to cover my forehead, Now i've exposed my ugly face to the world. I have been discretely tearing up my clothing. I already broke my computer with all of my schoolwork and everything on it because i don't deserve it. I feel like life is telling me to punish myself, so i suppose i should listen.

I know i don't deserve anything, but i can't help but think of the life i would live if i weren't so unappealing. I would look good when i walked into school, to be greeted by a friend or two. I'd get good grades in school, raising my hand and getting recognized by my teachers, only to go home and eat a big dinner with my family around a big dinner. Maybe i could even sleep well at night.

My problems are first-world, and i am privileged person at every degree, but i just feel really bad, I don't even know the purpose of this post if i'm being completely honest. Sorry to bother you with my problems,",22May2020,1

 I want to start of by saying I’ve been cheated on in my past relationships, and although I can say it doesn’t hurt me anymore it still has given me this gut feeling when it comes to relationships. I never get this way unless there’s a reason, usually I know my gut feeling is just worrying. While we were in the “talking” stage, I was in the shower, he showed me a picture of his friends girlfriend (who is an IG model influencer). Another time, we were on tinder (where we met) and we were looking at peoples bios, even though we were talking I still respected him and swiped left, while he swiped right. He later sent me a ss of a clever pick up line saying it was his friends account but really it was his, I knew he was lying even when he tried changing the story saying his friend typed it. 
 Other than that he’s been an amazing and faithful boyfriend, we can communicate well and he respects me. He has been trying to prove to me that I have nothing to worry about, I act like I moved on from it but deep down I’m hurting. I worry that those things might have been the red flags for me to stay away, I get we were just talking at the time but we were already intimate. Please understand we are two people who have created many memories and it’s hard to throw that away. I told him I need some time to think, he’s worried that if this is a “break” I will go off with someone which is ridiculous. I try not to think of this as a reflection of him. Our relationship is still new and I just want to know if there is hope for us, I know my insecurity is one thing I need to work on.",22May2020,1
191,"not usually on reddit, so please be patient with me. hoping this is the right place for this.

long story short, my [16f] parents and I are moving, for the first time in 11 years. we all need a fresh start, and were thinking about it for a while. I’ve struggled a lot over the last few years with mental illness and some physical drawbacks. but it was when the people I thought were my friends cut me off entirely I realized I was ready to finally take the leap. covid has complicated things, but we finally have a new house in a new town and a date to move in.

I’ve been alone, at least somewhat, for a while now. I don’t think I should be that worried about myself in the new town though - I’m pretty outgoing despite my social anxiety, I make friends easily, I have relatable interests. I have a new job in place and everything. but even with that I’m going into my junior year of high school in a new town, and I’m a little bit terrified. if there’s anyone who’s been through something like that before has advice or some reassurance that would be great.",22May2020,1
192,"(Names have been changed for privacy) 

One of my friends’ (well call her Alyssa) sister (we’ll call her Cecilia) was in an abusive relationship (well call her ex Donald). Donald was really rude &amp;amp; emotionally abusive to Cecilia and after taking a lot of his shit, Cecilia decided to break up with him. 

Fast forward about a month later, after constantly messaging Cecilia and asking her to take him back, calling her a wh*re, b*tch, sl*t and every other derogatory word u can think of, Donald had messaged Cecilia and told her that he will be posting explicit pictures of her that she sent him in confidence. Not only that, he threatened to send them to her parents (who are extremely conservative and will ship her off to some boarding school in Switzerland if they ever found out). Cecilia posted on her private Instagram story exposing Donald of all the crap he’s been threatening her with (which Alyssa then reposted on her private insta story) and Donald, upon seeing the posts, threatened Cecilia again. Not only that, he actually sent the pictures to her dad (he deleted them before her dad could see) and he posted them on his private Instagram story (also deleted). He then forced Cecilia to write an apology on her Instagram story, stating that her earlier posts had been falsified and she did it for attention. Cecilia has screenshots of him threatening to leak these photos as well as a video recording of a call between her and him, in which he threatens her and berates her. 

How can I help her?? What can we do to get revenge on him?? His phone is on him at all times and in quarantine we can’t go find him or see him in person to swiping his phone doesn’t seem possible. I’ve considered posting the story myself so Cecilia isn’t accountable, messaging people in my contacts list the story etc but I don’t want to do anything that puts Cecilia at risk. I’ve already told her to threaten to pursue legal action (she’s a minor so he could be charged with distribution of child pornography) but the main thing is she doesn’t want it to get to her parents.",22May2020,1
193,"So a quick rundown of my situation, my best friend had manipulated me and my gf into separating us by exploiting our bad mental healths and make us feel a lack of trust for each other. (I can explain my situation if you'd like, just let me know)
It's been around 2 months since we've spoken and I've been doing... fine I guess. But there's something really weird going on and I can't explain it.
So when we dated me and her, and I'm talking around summer of 2019, I used to have these images and kinda feelings inside of bad stuff such as us arguing, her crying, me crying, my friends betraying me, stuff like that. They'd be either shown in hinting ways or they told me flat out. They were almost like dreams in a sense, but I was wide awake. I didn't think much of it, just me making up stupid scenarios in my head because I am quite a creative person.
Then literally half a year later, these feelings and images I saw in my mind played out almost exactly like they did in my head. It was super strange to me but I just brushed it off.
Then I imagined in my head of her crying again, this was around January. I thought it was weird so I checked one of her social medias and to my surprise she posted a video of her crying about something. I was just in complete disbelief. It was crazy to me.
Now its May, and recently I've been seeing more stuff again, for example I poked my head out the window to get some fresh out cause I was tired and as soon as I did I got the image of something again, and it felt extremely familiar to me. It's so strange to me I have no idea what it all could be. Because I have no mental issues at all, I'm completely healthy and overall I'm pretty happy. So I have no idea what these could be (I decided to call them imaginative episodes just to label it when I inevitably talk to someone about it).
So anyone who actually believes me because I know this seems extremely weird and just fake, but to anyone who believes me, what could it be?",22May2020,1

I was happy someone actually had a crush on my but rejected him because he was mean to me and not my type and I didn’t think of him in that way. Then I started thinking about it this whole time he had a crush on me,,, he talked to me about his dick saying it was small and only 2 inches and I was like “it’s okay if a girl doesn’t like you for your dick size she’s not the one”. One time he sent me these girls nudes and keep in mind we’re under the age of 16. What the heck???!! I don’t know why I didn’t think about it until now I don’t think friends are supposed to have those conversation!!! And he sends me hentai randomly and stuff. I feel awkward now and I want to block him... When I rejected him he was like
 “I guess that’s 26-1”
I said
“What does that mean”
He said
“How many failed relationships you’re 26”
And then he says stuff like “no one will ever love me” I feel like he’s trying to make me feel bad and take back my rejection???
I want to block him because he’s giving me weird vibes why wasn’t I aware until now? but he also told me the last person he confessed to they blocked him and he goes to my school and I don’t want to be mean and block him but now I feel weird about him..",22May2020,1
196,"Trigger Warning: Suicide, Child Negligence, Depression, Anxiety, COVID-19

Me and my GF have been together for almost 6 years, we have a great relationship and we hardly ever argue. Finances aren't great right now but we  had plans to get engaged, start a family, buy a home in the coming years. About a year ago, she told me she was having suicidal thoughts as shortly after entered therapy sessions which made a great improvement to her mental health. Being diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety, a lot of her problems had been put down to her broken childhood (mostly mistreatment from her mother and her father committing suicide in her youth). Until recently we lived with my family while we saved for a house deposit, but in March she decided to move in with one of her relatives to help care for them, as this relative is disabled. I didn't like the idea of not living together, but we always discuss everything and agreed it wasn't forever.

Things have only gotten worse from this point, she put on a lot of weight very quickly (this is only a problem because she has over eaten in the past when her mental health is particularly bad), she was drinking more regularly particularly when the COVID-19 pandemic began. In the past few weeks, she kept cancelling our plans (watching a movie online together or playing some video games, we can' meet up as I have to isolate for health reasons). Yesterday, I asked her what was going on, because she was becoming very distant with me. She told me she moved out because she felt like she was bringing me down with her mental issues, I have to admit I am a very patient person and have always supported her through this, reminding her that we are fighting for a future together. She also went to tell me something else but stopped herself and only after I told her it was okay and she could tell me anything that she said she thinks she might be a lesbian and immediately ended our call, audibly very upset.

Previously, she has been openly bisexual for almost all the time I've known her, but she has never actually been with another woman romantically or sexually so I guess she would be more bi-curious. We also don't have a very sexual relationship ourselves but that was put down to us both not being that interested in sex. This is only important because (after several attempts to call her back) she answered and after I asked her why she thinks this, she said that maybe she's only sexually attracted to females despite assuring me that she is attracted to me also, but not to any other men. I kept a level head because I know hard this is for her, she's very compassionate and I know it was hard for her to admit to me, knowing how much it would hurt me to hear.
I asked her some questions after we got the tears out of the way with and agreed to figure it out. In brief:

Me: So do you want to be sexually involved with a women, or romantically or both.

Her: I don't know. I think both.

Me: Are you still in love with me?

Her: Of course, I wish every day that these feelings could go away and we could just be together.

Me: Could you still see a future with me?

Her: I don't know.

I said she needs to think about it, and we agreed to not talk while she thinks about what she wants to do. It hurts so much to potentially lose her but I could never make her stay with me for my sake. She always calls me the perfect partner and always wants to be around me (before she moved out). I told her she can have as much time as she needs, weeks even. Not to hook up with someone else, but to have me out of the picture for a while so she can think clearly and not feel pressured or guilty. 

About an hour after our phone call, her relative called me and said that she had be taken into hospital after trying to take her own life. I broke down and today I've haven't let go of my phone waiting for news. No one can visit her as visitation is suspended due to the pandemic and I know she hates hospitals and they set off her anxiety. Luckily she is okay, and the hospital has let her leave a few hours ago (which is surprisingly quick) I've just spoken to her and it seems that she regretted attempting to kill herself immediately and got help from her family who called the paramedics. She was weak on the phone but she told me she feels a lot better but she still doesn't know what she wants to do as far as our relationship goes. I told her she can still have as much time to figure it out and she'll never lose me as a friend. She didn't say why she tried to end her life but I know she feels incredible guilt just having mental issues and putting me through all her problems, I always tell her I signed up for everything and anything and that we are a team - this helps but I know that guilt cannot go away so easily and I guess the idea of breaking up, and knowing what that would do to me, pushed her over the line.

I know this a long post and I am really thankful to anyone who has taken the time to read it all. Overall, I just need some advice on what to do or even what to encourage her to think about. She has promised to keep me in the loop and I will do what ever is best for her, but right now I don't know what that is. I know I want her to stay with me, but I have to prepare myself for that likely not being the case and I have no idea how to do that. She has been my whole world in the past, and (as someone who has little to no direction in life), losing the one thing I was certain about, her, will make me feel so lost and alone. Can someone just help me here, I don't know what to do? I am not close to anyone particularly, we share all the same friends and I am not particularly close to any of my family either. 

TLDR: Girlfriend told me she might be a lesbian and attempted suicide, now I feel like I'm losing everything and its all out of my control.",22May2020,1

       All I ask is that he doesn't  do it in front of me in our BASEMENT, ya know where theres no windows. I originally sat him down and told him that I was concerned with how much he was doing it and that I didn't want him to do it in front of me. Since then (2ish months) I've fought him doing it 4 times! I'm at the point where I'm ready to take it from him and throw it away.

199,"Hi everyone sorry if this is long or wrong in anyway I don't typically post. I'm a 24 yr old female who moved home with my mom during this pandemic. My lease ended and I lost my job so I moved into her two bedroom condo, which is the same place I grew up in even though I moved out when I was 16. It's the only condo complex in this very small super wealthy town and is very isolated in the woods. The place is full of widows, trust fund adults with mental heath issues and old single people that are a little off in my opinion. Most just keep to themselves. I've known most of these people since middle school and I've never felt uncomfortable until now. 

I'm friendly enough but do not go out of my way to say hi. We all park in a parking lot next to the building maybe 25 cars. It started with a tulip on the handle of my car which I thought was cute so I put it on someone else's car to make them smile like I did. Then I received another and I noticed they were cut from the tulip plants around the building. I could pinpoint the exact plant it would come from, so I threw it in a tree thinking weird because no other car had them. Then a third which I threw and then a fourth which I left on the ground and stomped on yesterday morning. When i got back that afternoon every single tulip head was cut off every plant and were missing. Not a single head to be found. There's not one left its so creepy looking. During this time I noticed a car always parked next to mine which isn't weird because people tend to either try to park close or far but always in the same general area. I like the walk so I didn't mind parking far until my car got a bunch of sap on it and I realized how hard that was to get off. So I started to move my car recently and this car kept parking next to me every chance it got no matter where I went. This car was next to me basically for two months so I noticed it moving. It also has bright yellow NY plates and I'm in CT so kinda obvious. I even parked by the dumpster and they parked in the grass (not in a spot) to be next to mine two days in a row. My mom and I do not know who he is but she was getting a plant out of my car two days ago and he started talking to her just hi how are you SUPER friendly like they knew each other. I asked her and she said she didn't know him. I noticed he owned the car and went inside right after passing us again to say hi. Later that day when I was getting stuff out of my car he just drove by the street and freaked hard and honked the horn to wave to me. There was another women a few cars down and he did not even acknowledge her. I have never met this man or even think I've seen him. He's maybe early 30s white kinda pudgy and tall but I have not really seen his face. I'm like 5'2"" typical average looking brunette white girl if anyone cares. The flowers stopped for four days when my boyfriend was here and then started the day after he left specifically.

My bedroom is on the third (top) floor and overlooks a walkway. It's a dumb design, so there is only one apartment door up here to the left that I can't see its so far down. It's this cute old nurse who I've cooked for a few times recently because of her service so I know her schedule pretty well. No one walks up here or has any reason to besides her. But recently someone has been walking by a lot and I am too chicken shit to look cause I keep my shades down but my window open. I even caught them walking by at night maybe 11-12pm 3- 4 nights in a row. It got progressively later I remember thinking it was super weird at like 12:47 specifically to walk by twice. my cat notices and I've been awake not working and I smoke weed so the window is open and I hear. They've even just backtracked to walk past the window twice. I also can get sleep paralysis and bad consistent night terrors. But recently the past two nights prior to last I've woken up around 1-1:30 to thumping on my window I swear. It's in the top right corner and I dreamt that they're ghosts but both times as soon as I moved out of bed it immeadiately stopped. It could have been the sleep paralysis but I SWEAR there was something hitting it and my cat was over there too trying to look under the shade.

Now I might just be paranoid at this point but hear me out. I was out all day trying to get parts for my car in queens which is something I've had planned for a while and my mom works. Anyhow I got back today and my bedroom seems off. There's been two dead yellow jackets for months on my window screen area that I just close the window on because I'm too scared to touch them (I know) but they're gone. I went up to the third floor outside my window and one is on the outside on the ground the other completely missing. And there's no holes its not like it fell. How would they both be missing after months and one is on the other side now?? also I keep a mat near this window and I'm a little particular so it has to be perfectly aligned with the wood floor and has rubber mat underneath so it won't slide easily but today it was at a complete angel as in someone stepped onto the corner heavily and it shifted. And the curtains are very different from how they are normally positioned. Also my laptop which I keep on my desk in front of the window was on the floor under the corner of my bed upside-down like it had fallen and was pushed slightly. I have a second older laptop on my desk for burning cds right now so maybe it wouldn't be noticed if the other one fell Idk. And my cat has been acting weird like smelling the curtains and laying in a different area. I kept my door closed today cause I don't want her in my room when I am not home so none of this was her. Also my mom works all day so I left after her today and got back before her so it was not her. I could just be paranoid but with everything happening the past week I'm concerned someone broke in. I don't know about locks but I only lock one instead of both and I doubt it would be hard to pick. I don't know guys maybe I'm overthinking this. My BF is concerned but not my mom she thinks I'm overreacting but she's been an extremely neglectful drunk all my life so Idk what to do. 

Also as a side note I lived a year abroad when I was 17 and I had a female in my class tell everyone I was her gf which I agreed to not knowing the language and would follow me to the park and drop of chocolates and weird stuff but she stopped when I had my host family there threaten to involve the school/police. It was frightening at the time. Then when I was 20 I was hooking up with this kid for like 3 weeks who would drive by my house at all hours of the night and know I was/wasn't home and just did some weird sexual stuff on my property I caught him on cameras I set up. Then a friend had a talk with him with the footage and he apologized later on and eventually moved to philly and things got better. I used to count them as borderline stalkers but I chalked it up to being young and maybe them going through a phase idk. But now I feel cursed or something like I'm a prime target for certain people. I don't know again I'm sorry if this is a rant but I have trust issues and this is starting to all freak me out and maybe I'm looking for reassurance that this is something weird and I don't know what to do :( part of me wants to just ask this guy about the flowers any advice would be super appreciated!",22May2020,1
200,"Ok, so this is really weird and a lot of people at my school are wondering about it. In general, she’s a bad person- told my friend she was fat, called a girl with a slight disability stupid, bragged about smoking weed once, said something really mean to my friend with huge insecurities and “apologized” (later told my friend she didn’t mean it and didn’t feel bad at all), treats her friends really badly (switches friends a lot after she gets sick of them too) etc. Really rude to everyone, thinks she’s better than you, just mean. You get the gist. 

So I’m in this group chat with her, and everyone really really doesn’t like her because she’s really oblivious to a lot of stuff, tried to fake her age to hook up with people she doesn’t know (she’s 14, like me and my friend), and tries to brag about things she has NEVER DONE (me and my friend know her personally). 

Ok so let me get to the point- her mom caught her talking to three guys about sexual things (had actually been talking to six eek) and grounded her. Nobody has seen her since then, and she got her phone taken away I believe. She said she was afraid of getting kicked out, and the last time I heard from her she was hiding in the bathroom (her parents are strict, but not abusive btw.) I found out today from another friend she had talked to someone about suicide and feeling alone. She also hasn’t been at school for a week, and as much as I and my friends don’t like her, we’re getting pretty concerned.

So I've had problems with panic attacks and anxiety off and on for essentially my whole 20s, following a really quite terrible shroom trip that sort of instilled in me a constant vigilance about how I'm feeling. Any sort of fluctuation to my ""normal"" state and I immediately become anxious. (Can't smoke weed anymore, dont even drink coffee.) Now I've learned a lot of coping mechanisms over the years and have gotten a lot better at not letting anxiety turn into panic attacks.

Enter the global pandemic. I've been doing an alright job being calm for about 10 weeks now but the last 4-5 days have been really rough. For about 4 days I have essentially become extremely paranoid that I have coronavirus and that I am going to die. Now I don't really have any of the symptoms. I essentially had a sick stomach/diarrhea 5 days ago and that set this all off (after eating takeout for the first time in forever). I convinced myself that was the first sign tho, and I have been torturing myself with paranoid thoughts ever since. It gets really bad at night, and I have slept terribly since then. I am in a very tired and paranoid state even though I have none of the symptoms and felt totally fine for portions of each day when not totally anxious. But every time I get anxious I get short of breath, and then that goes into a full blown panic attack because I get paranoid that the shortness of breath isn't from the panic attack but is in fact from coronavirus, and that I'm going to die. 

I am thinking of going on some anxiety medication because this is completely debilitating but as i said I am scared of anything that alters how i feel so I have never done it before. But as of right now I am totally paranoid and panicked and I just want to sleep. please help me",22May2020,1

When I asked her why she was still in love with him, she explained she felt she was worth something more. She was a very touch-starved person and never had many friends (aside from, well, me), so she always ate up bad and good attention. He gave her a lot of attention, the bad kind, specifically.

212,Hi. My husband has the option to go to a good job but it would mean leaving me behind for the foreseeable future due to covid.  There are a couple problems that have already popped up. (1) it would add a second housing cost although the job pays enough that this would be taken care of. (2) he wouldn't be able to drive to were he will be at and he hasn't been able to find a reasonably priced car with only 12 days left until he would have to leave.  I don't know whether to tell him it's a bad idea(they would hold a spot open for him).  But it could be over a year before we would be able to make the move we wanted in the first place.  I just don't know what to do.,22May2020,1
213,"I am very close to my friend, and he told me a secret related to a specific person. He said he hasn't told anyone except me. Some days after doing it, he messages me saying how could i have told the other person and betrayed his trust, when I never did it. I tried a lot to tell and make him understand this, but he's straight out rejecting my claim, saying how could the other person know, if I hadn't told them. I haven't had a single conversation with the other person, and even showed him my personal messaging apps accounts, but he still thinks i did it somehow.

I dont know how to deal with this. Hes a very close friend to me and i dont want to lose him.

Something similar had happened before with a gal. She was a good friend then, but due to the situation she drifted apart. After some time, we became just friends, and i thought we had made our peace atleast, but she would still bring it up during fights or when there was discussion related to trust.

I don't want the same thing to happen with him.

Actually something similar happened with me too, where i felt the other person had betrayed my trust by sharing something private with my parents. I didn’t talk to them for some time, but one day straight up asked them why did they do it. They were confused, so i told them, but they very calmly rejected it saying they'd never betray my trust. This person was very close, and I believed them, and heck literally that day my parent straight up said they read it off my phone when I left it open. I felt extremely bad, and my trust with the other person increased a lot.

I just wish if something similar would happen with people who are suspicious of me, so they can know I didnt betray them.

How can i make my friend understand?",22May2020,1
214,"I'm 37 and female, that there tells you something; time is running out fast, if not already too late. Although my cycles are still regular so no reason to think I'm infertile or anywhere close to menopause. 

I knew I didn't want kids in my teens or early twenties, I was always encouraged to wait to have kids until I'd lived a little and matured, but then two long-term relationships failed so it didn't happen in my late twenties or early thirties. During the second long-term relationship my partner lied about wanting kids, I gave everything up to immigrate to be with him, so I not only missed out on having kids with him but coming back to my home country I had to start from scratch so having kids was even less likely.

I'm long-term unemployed and due to various factors it doesn't look like that's going to change any time soon, in the mean time I've no friends and I struggled to find a partner (I'm in a relationship now, but more on that in a bit...). I feel like I've lost a lot of my life, I didn't get to enjoy my twenties and my thirties have flown by, there's already so much that I will not be able to do but if I had a kid now it's guaranteed I'd have even fewer opportunities in life. Clearly I'm not financially stable, which is obviously a huge point against having kids now or anytime soon too. 

I don't even really know if I want kids any more, *but* I think that's more about my mindset right now - I'm very firmly in survival mode, I can't very think about anything else when just trying to keep a roof over my head and dealing with the depression that comes from my situation. I know that in my current situation I shouldn't be having kids, it wouldn't be fair for them or for me - they shouldn't have to suffer poverty, and I don't want to struggle the rest of my life either. Even if I won the lotto tomorrow I still think it would take some time to get my wellbeing to a point where I could be the best mom I could be to a child. 

But I know I'll regret having kids. I imagine reaching 50, 60, 70, etc. and realising what I've missed out on, leaving it too late to ever have kids. 

I've a lot of love to give and think I'd be a good mom, I like the idea of supporting a child and teaching right/wrong. I used to want multiple biological kids, to donate eggs, and to foster/adopt (note: foster/adopt aren't options while poor, so even if you take out biological clock ticking it's still unlikely I'll have kids). I wanted to be able to experience pregnancy, I feel a little like I'm missing out on a big part of womanhood by not experiencing pregnancy - granted at my age I'd be concerned about complications and ruining my body as it won't be able to bounce back easily. 

Also I wanted to be able to have a legacy and pass on genes, as an only child it feels sad to me that it stops with me and it bothers me that nothing about me will continue after I'm dead (no genes carried forward or children to carry on my memory). I keep going back/forth thinking how ridiculous it is to think this way given the vastness of the universe and how insignificant I am, but still wanting that legacy.

Part of my depression is tied-up in feeling bad about getting older - I've not met any of the normal life milestones, as a woman I feel my value is depleted as I lose my looks, without a career or children then I don't know what the hell my life is supposed to be. 

I do have a partner but he doesn't want kids - he's my age and not great financially himself so like me he feels too old/tired/not in the right mindset for kids, plus he has some issues from how his own parents treated him as a kid. He's actually stated he has a baby phobia, he's known for this, and has expressed serious dislike of babies crying. He's not having kids. I occasionally joke about it, we've not talked about my feelings about having kids and I think he just assumes I don't want kids - it kind of makes me sad he doesn't ask me about this, but I guess if I told him all this he'd maybe feel bad or not know what to say. 

On the one hand I'm trying to accept I won't have kids...but on the other there's still this tiny bit of hope that I can't snuff out. I started a relationship with my boyfriend knowing it meant no kids but there's still this nagging part of me wondering if I'm selling myself short by settling and not finding someone where there may be a possibility for kids. Again though, in my current situation kids would be a terrible idea so I'm in two minds about this and winding myself up going back/forth on this idea.

I'm really struggling with the fact that my choice has been taken away from me - I'm not childless due to infertility and I'm not childless by choice, I feel like I've had no choice and I've no support in this. 

**TL;DR** I'm in no position to have children and my partner doesn't want children, but I feel my choice has been taken from me. I'm struggling to deal with the issue as it ties into feeling generally unhappy with my life, along with a wider existential crisis.",22May2020,1

218,"Hello Reddit,

For the past few weeks, I have been constantly stressed about picking a major for college.

For context, I am a rising third year student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, currently majoring in computer science. I arrived at Tech with zero credits and made some mistakes first semester, so although I will technically be a rising junior, I likely won’t graduate until Spring or Summer 2023.

I took the online version of CS 1301 (Intro to Python) last semester, and spent much of my finals week cranking out coding problem after coding problem. One of these days, I wasted an entire morning trying to debug a program that should have been very simple, only to discover a stupid typo and storm off to my room, feeling exhausted and defeated. Through anger and frustration, I thought to myself: “Do I really want to be doing this for three more years?”

I’ve always admired the built environment, I draw constantly, and I have a propensity for art. I’ve considered minoring in architecture in the past, but the curriculum involves no studios and the classes are surveys, at best. That night, for the first time, I Googled the GT ARCH major requirements and calculated how much longer it would take me to graduate. To avoid getting bogged down in the details, I’ll just note that it will take me a semester or two longer to graduate in ARCH vs. CS.

Half of the people in my life have told me to work hard and play by the rules, the other half tell me to do what I love and fallow my passion. I have very little idea what I want my life to look like, but I would love to have a family and kids one day, and preferably be able to support them as well as I can. I also want a fast car, preferably sooner than later. 

A degree in computer science is objectively more likely to sustain me financially. That said, I don’t know if it will be fulfilling to ignore my appetite for creating. Sure, I could do watercolor on the side, but I want to build magnificent structures that redefine design, dedicated to humanity and our capacity of imagination.

No, I don’t have a “passion” for CS, but although I’ve had frustrating days, there were some problems that I actually enjoyed thinking through; there is a satisfying rigidity in programming, like an ancient dialect. Who’s to say that I won’t discover excitement about my major some point down the line? After all, I’ve only taken one CS class.

In addition to it being just as, if not more difficult, architecture doesn’t offer anywhere near the kind of marketability as a degree in CS. A CS major would allow me to do nearly anything I wanted for grad school, and put me in a decent position after that. After all, CS is the future and the future is CS. If I switch to architecture, chances are I’ll try to become an architect, and if/when that happens, only the top 1% of architects (if that) make anything more than a living wage. 

My mom is a lawyer, My dad is a trader, and brother is pre-med. It is not easy going against the grain in an Asian household, but I am lucky that my family is in favor of whatever decision I make. However, if I majored in CS, it would be much easier for them to support me along the way.

I’ve spoken to an Architecture advisors, an exploratory major advisor, a graduate from the School of Architecture, a current ARCH student, the PI of a cool design research lab, my therapist, my friends, and my dog. I should have more than enough information, yet I still can’t decide.

I have a decent amount of time, but the decision will affect classes I sign up for in Fall 2020. I am seriously torn. Thank you for bearing with me, if you’ve made it this far.

224,"TL;DR at the bottom &lt;Long Post&gt;

So sunday me(17yo) and my family got an 8 month old male puppy for my mom which was nice. The dog is a mix of possibly pitbull and american bulldog (the website that we used to adopt him had little details). Before we had the dog we had two male cats that we got as a bonded pair. The oldest is a possible bi-color that is 5 years old and the other is 4 and a half year old dragon-li. 

I was worried of the possibility of having a dog as the younger cat which I'll call ""K"" is aggressive to the bi-color which I'll call ""H"". They fight often and normally it is chalked up to brotherly love as they fight and resolve it with in the hour. With getting a dog, I was nervous of the dog being small enough to be harassed by K or the dog be too big and murder K and/or H. 

My mom was on the fence on whether she even wanted to have a dog or not so we did absolutely nothing until one day she saw our current dog which I'll call ""R"" and got him right away despite the fact that R was a puppy. R is super big and can easily bite the cats of we wanted to. The only thing in way of the cats and dog is a single baby gate that R can jump over if he tries. R is super smart and knows how to sit yet he has this tunnel vision attention that makes it hard for him to stay away from the cats or other animals. 

The first night we got him was messy. R explored the house for a bit before noticing the cat area which we tried to block off to him. After a while my brother(13yo) decides to open the curtain that hides the cats and let R see H and K while being separated by a baby gate. The whole time we K was a nervous wreck, hiding in one room that we can barely access while H seemed unphased by the fact R was in the house. Imagine the first cat R saw was K. K hid in his little room for the rest of the day while I had to drag the dog away as he barked at the cats. 

Monday was a little different as we dealt with the dog and he didn't bark as much when he smelled the cats behind the baby gate (we put the curtains back and we have a blanket over the gate so the animals can't move the curtains and see each other.) Everything went fine until ""Mr.Brave K"" jumps over the gate and sees the dog. They saw each other, and one hissed as the other growled and it ended up to where I held R back in the bathroom as K scratched my brother's face to pieces as he tried to hold him steady.

Tuesday, nothing special happened except K and H journeyed up again while R was outside as we wanted to get the cats used to the changing environment and K runs outside as one of us walked out. Basically we got K inside without scratching anyone and I held back R again.

Wednesday, was the same like Tuesday where we had the cats journey upstairs if they wanted to while the dog is outside. K got out from his hiding spot after an hour of convincing with petting and toys. Me being an idiot held K to the door and him and R saw each other through the glass were my ear was scratched by K and R had to be sent to his cage for a while after getting the cats to their places. After that my mom got home and while doing a project, R got loose where the cats were and while R growled at H, K came up to fight the dog scratching my mother in the process as she was dealing with this as my little sister(9yo) could do thing but be shocked at how he got loose. 

Then today happened and we all played it safe with the full control. We did the usual let the cats out when the dog is out, but after that, the dog kept trying to go downstairs to where the cats were as they kept meowing to be upstairs and outside. We set R in the cage and opened the gate to see how R, H, and K would react but the thing is was that K never came up here at all today and H came up while R was caged but he stayed in the opposite side of the room most while he was up. To end the day, I grabbed H and took him to our bathroom while we got R out of his cage so  he could go on a walk to which afterwords we got the cats back in their space when the walk was finished and R kept going to that gate waiting for the cats until we put him in the cage again.

I don't know what to do about this. I want the pets to coexist in the same place without a baby gate yet R has his tunnel vision set to getting the cats. To make things worse, I think K is having territory issues with R and that explains why he went outside in a haste and why he fought R while he was loose. If anyone knows any tricks to help either the dog or the cats, that would be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR// We got an 8 month old pup (mixed pitbull and american bulldog) that barks and growls at our two cats (one bi-color and other dragon-li) and won't stop focusing on them rather than us while the dragon-li is attacking the dog when he can.**",22May2020,1

226,"My (F/23) parents had went through an intense divorce about 3 years ago, my mom had told my dad she was leaving him in a year and he got pissed off, went in the basement and started throwing shit, like most people would. My dad wasn't the greatest dad either but that's besides the point, she left when he was 2 years clear of cancer, it came back, but twice as hard and now he's got less than a year left. When they went through the divorce it was non-stop trying to get me on their sides by badmouthing the other. My mom had done so much horrible shit to myself and the rest of my family that is unforgivable, but so has my dad. I can't forgive my mom for anything she's done, I talked to her about a year ago (she had moved 8 hours away at this point to live with her girlfriend of two months) and she promised to try harder and make changes, that she would talk to me more. The only thing I heard from her recently was that she got shingles and got kicked out of her house and is now homeless.

My mom's girlfriend is a mtf trans and my mom wanted to live with my grandfather who is a conservative, abrasive drunk that can't take care of himself. My grandpa brings in no money, my mom had been sort of trying to get a job but has been losing all of them for taking days off too early and the girlfriend hasn't even tried to provide anything except maybe cook and constantly give my grandfather a hard time. He got fed up and kicked her out, my mom went with her and now they are homeless (living in a motel for now)

The thing is, my mom has done so much, too much. To the point where I don't even feel bad for her. She put herself in that place and I'm not going to bail her out. The problem is, I know she's not going to change, i know she's not going to try to make things better for her children and make them feel loved and is just going to manipulate them to stay. But for some reason, right now with my dad having less than a year, my mom not giving a shit, and me moving out at the end of the month to start anew and my deteriorating health I miss the shit out of her. But I don't want to see her again because I know it will just hurt me even more when she continues to ghost me. I've given her so many chances and she is my mom but I have never been hurt more or seen more abuse from more than one person and I wish the worst for her but I still care and love her but some I give no shits and some days I hate her, but I am feeling so emotional about everything, missing her and the lack of love.

I don't know how to deal with this or if it's ever going to stop. I just want the pain to stop. I just need to know if there's any way I can deal with this. I don't see our relationship getting any better. I just need to know if there are ways I can hopefully deal with this and know if there is hope that things will get better for us (me, my mom, my dad and my siblings).

The owner of said cafe keep calling me Eli when my name is actually James.
I’m not so much bothered by her getting my name wrong, it happens, but the part that I find a bit awkward is that she is confusing me with my boss who is named Eli.
For a bit of backstory she used to work in the building next to where I work, I had never talked to her while she worked there, eventually she left there to start her own cafe and when I first stumbled across it I brought up that she used to work in the building next to ours. She replied ‘oh yeah I thought I recognised you, Eli right?’ And I said ‘Nah it’s James, Eli is my boss’ 
Because it turns out they make the best coffee in my town I have been going there almost everyday that I get coffee, and for a while after the first correction she didn’t call me by name so I didn’t need to correct her, we’d often make small talk and have a good rapport, like people do when they become regulars at any place.
It was about 2 weeks ago after we had made a bit of chit chat, I was leaving and she said ‘see you next time Eli’
I heard it but was already almost out the door by the time I processed it and just figured I’d let it slip this time
Over the past two weeks she has called me Eli a few times, most of the times were as I was leaving or while she was busy making food or something and she had called it out, and I didn’t want to distract her just to tell her that wasn’t my name, but today she addressed me twice by Eli and both times I felt too awkward to correct her, because I’ve let it slip so long!

I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and avoidant personality disorder about 4 or 5 years ago. I left my home when I was 19 y/o to go study at university in another city, but I'm still 100% completely financially dependent on my parents. 

I've never completed my studies, to be honest never even started them.

My guess is that I got infected at the hospital I work at but that’s not the important part, I told him in an email about my diagnosis and assured him I was only having mild symptoms but i was still gonna be isolated in a hotel but he didn’t reply. I was getting sad because isolation really puts a mental strain on the mind, it’s very lonely...

 I thought maybe he didn’t read it but he frequently reads my email. He was still active on social media which was kinda hurtful. I told him it was kinda hurtful that he didn’t reply and that’s when I received a message saying I hope you get better from him. 

Now, I’m kinda very upset and I haven’t replied because his reply came a whole week after I sent the first email and I feel like he just replied to satisfy me or he replied because he felt he has to just say something. It is frustrating because to me, I don’t think he cares...

What should I do? Am i overacting? Is there something I’m not considering? I don’t think I’m being very attention seeking, (I’m currently ignoring his message because it’s pissing me off )

Any advice is appreciated",22May2020,1
237,"I'm like the type of person who studies heaps for a test, yet fails during the test. Ever since yesterday's Maths test, I was feeling low and anxious for my grade. I am confident that my grade won't be high, however, I'm just scared that I will get a really low mark. How do I cope with this anxiety?",22May2020,1
238,"So background/context. It's long but important to know. Also, I will be referring to my brother using male pronounsn and it’ll make sense why if you read the post. 

I myself am a cisgender female who identifies as polysexual (yes it's a real thing that's different from polygamy look it up if you would like) who is attracted to women and enby(? I'm still trying to figure it out but that's where I'm at right now). I'm a teenager who’s small friend group consists of the gays (tm), theater kids, and emos. Many are all three. One of my close friends (who is all three) is FTM trans. I went to him with this but he was just as stuck as me. 

When I was 11 and just first getting around to thinking about my sexuality, I ”came out” to my parents. My denial and anxiety were so strong that I was too scared to use terms like gay or queer. I stood there for 10-15 minutes trying to explain ”gay” without saying the word or any words related to it. 

My parents’ reactions were split. To be honest, I can only remember that aftermath, not the actual event. My dad didn't and still doesn't acknowledge it, and laughed at me when I mentioned a girl I liked a few weeks after ”coming out”. A bit after that, he said that LGBTQ+ stuff shouldn't be ”infecting children’s media” (direct quote). My mom is, from what I can tell, supportive. However, when my father had made that particular comment and I got rightfully mad at him (unbeknownst to them the very first time my sexuality had been even remotely validated was when watching Andi Mack, a CHILDREN’S TV show, so it was personal to me), my mom stood by him and said that I shouldn't get mad because it was 9/11 and he was having a rough day (he was inside the Twin Towers). We don't talk about my sexuality and I purposefully avoid the subject. There was one time when he found my pride flag and cussed me out giving me an anxiety attack before school (despite the fact that it had been about a year after my ”coming out”) and I went to a friend’s house after school out of fear, but that was one of the more intense reactions.

It's hard to figure out where my dad sits on this kind of stuff. He doesn't think LGBTQ+ content should be in children's media but is fine swith gay people existing. He’s fine with women pursuing careers and isn't misogynistic at all, but makes fun of boys who act feminine. He hates Trump, but not to the point where he would vote for Bernie Sanders. He’s of color, grew up in Brooklyn, married my Japanese mother and had my brother and I. So he's not racist.

He has a short temper and seems to be mad about a good 95% of the time. He hasn't hit me in a while, but that’s probably because I've gotten good at sensing him. My brother, however, isn't so lucky. I wouldn't exactly call my dad abusive, but he has caused more than 1 anxiety attack. 

Sorry for the long background, but here's the actual story now.

Ever since he was little, my brother has acted rather feminine. When he was really small we just assumed it was because he spent all of his time with girls (my mother and I). As he got older, it didn't just go away. His best friend is a girl, and he gets very upset when people do that weird thing where they suggest the two might ”like like” each other. 

Now I don't want to enforce gender roles, so I tried to brush it off. But I just can't ignore it anymore. It feels irresponsible to do so. 

He has said on multiple very recent occasions that he wants his hair long, he has asked many times for me to paint his nails (but I sadly always turn him down because I'm afraid my dad might see), he uses my shaving razor way more than I ever do, he hates having body hair, he cries A LOT, he's very affectionate, extremely giggly just like my mom, hated getting dirty, likes having his hair tied up even though there’s literally nothing there to tie, and just yesterday I made him a little bow and he proudly wore it with no fuss. He wore it today as well. Now that I think about it he’ll jump at any chance he gets to wear hair accessories. 

I have a suspicion he might be transgender, and I don't want him to go through all of the things I did just having to accept that LGBTQ+ is a thing that exists. We were never raised to be homophobic or transphobic, but we never learned it was a thing that existed. So for me, before I could even consider what gender I liked, I had to learn that liking the same gender wasn't crazy and some stupid internet thing (again, thank you writers of Andi Mack for the character Cyrus he was a godsend to 11-year-old me).

I want to introduce him to the community, but I don't know how. He blabbers a lot, and if my dad found out I shared that with him and encouraged him to be feminine we would both be in trouble. 

Another big problem I'm facing with this is that my brother is 9 and thus learns from the older kids around him. Because of this, he does things like use gay as an insult. He equates ”gay” to ”weird” or ”stupid”. It really creates a problem. 

Even if the brother turns out to be cis, knowing about the community would help him be more accepting (and he's gonna need that once he realizes that I'm not joking about this liking girls stuff). There would be no harm in him knowing, and I would rather him know and be a very feminine cisgender man than not know and be a very repressed transgender woman. 

So how should I go about this? Try and introduce him? Wait a bit more? Just keep an eye on him? I really don't know, and I really need some advice. 

TL;DR My brother might be FTM trans and I don't know how to go about telling him about the LGBTQ+ community.

240,"Hi! So I matched with a guy on tinder. We’ve talked for a month. He’s not the usual type I’d go for lol but I think during the time we were talking, I started to like him. He’s more reserved, shy, “nice” guy. We talked on the phone four times. He never really flirted with me and whenever I try to, he doesn’t seem to know what to say. We’ve planned things we’re gonna do after the pandemic. He always messaged me first but he’s also kinda dry. On the phone he seems more interested and talkative.

Didn't hear from him all weekend and when I texted him on Monday asking how his weekend was, no reply. I sent him another snap and he never opened it. Message showed as pending so I figured he had deleted me without saying anything. So confused?? I don't have him on tinder anymore or any other socials.

242,"So my boyfriend and I are long-distance and he doesn't really have much sympathy for others. Sometimes he does things that really upset me and when I call him out on it, he laughs at me which makes me even more upset. He apologizes while he is continuing to laugh and says ""he can't help it."" And ""he's not laughing at me."" I tell him through tears it doesn't matter if he's not laughing at me it still hurts and my feelings are valid, which makes him laugh even more. He is also a very shy person and is antisocial. We are in a friend group though and sometimes they harass me and insult me and he doesn't do anything. I confronted him about it and he says he's shy and can't even do it for himself. I've been with him for a while, but he is really sweet but still makes me feel bad even if it's unintentional.

247,"Sorry ahead of time that this is a bit long. I'll try to be as succinct as possible.

I quit my job right before the 'Rona hit the US (where I live) due to issues with management. Awful timing, but I had a few months savings and I'm in CS so I thought I'd be able to find a new place relatively quickly after a break. I ended up taking the first month off so that I could de-stress. This was a great idea as it made me realize how toxic my job had been.

After that month I jumped on the job-search bandwagon but it's been touch and go. I've been talking to every recruiter that reaches out to me with a job that's in my skill set or sounds interesting. That's resulted in probably 20/30 quick chats in these past few months, and probably half as many interviews, with only a couple going past preliminary steps. I know that a good number have been due to the interviewers submitting my info to jobs that were a bad fit or had pretty much narrowed it down to someone else before talking to me, but several others have just been me fucking up due to interview nerves and such. Hell it could even just be casual sexism for all I know. Every time I try just mass sending my resumes to places I just get stuck in an anxiety loop and it's been crippling my search capabilities. Part of this is due to the fact that I really don't want another dead-end job sitting at a computer 8 hours a day working on some ecommerce site, but  I only have a few years of experience and it's in that. What drew me to CS was the tech and solving cool problems, not being an unthinking code monkey.

I'm now running low on my funds and my apartment complex has decided it's going to be raising rent by $40/month at the end of my lease in a couple months. I tried calling them to negotiate, especially considering pretty much all the amenities are closed still (and will be for months more I'm sure), but was told that it was not negotiable. Normally I wouldn't care too much, I would just move on to the next place, but considering I don't know of any (non-shady) apartment that doesn't require proof of employment, I don't think that's even an option right now.

I know I'm still a lot better of than a lot of people during these times, but still...I just don't know what to do or how to deal with all these issues. How the heck do I get back on my feet when most of the country is still sheltering in place and losing its damned mind?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: quit my job with awful timing. Not sure how to pivot my career. Running out of money and my apartment is eagerly waiting to bend me over. How do I get job in 'Rona times?",22May2020,1
248,"For as long as I can remember, I’ve had unhealthy teeth. As a child, I had teeth filled, pulled, and my first root canal before my 20th birthday. As an adult, I’ve suffered with decay, tooth loss, and multiple abscesses. My insurance doesn’t cover dental outside of cleanings and removals and I’ve reached a point where full obstruction and replacement is my only option. 

Speaking about my dental health is almost as painful as the toothaches themselves. I cry and become so overwhelmed with anxiety that I can barely discuss how awful I feel. The insecurities I deal with daily are so mentally damaging and misunderstood that I just keep them to myself. I feel disgusting. I feel judged by others that don’t understand the financial struggle that’s comes with having poor teeth. 

I can’t remember the last time I smiled in a photo. As a matter of fact, I don’t take pictures because of the risk of my teeth being captured. I don’t smile. 

I think the hardest thing I’ve come to realize recently is that my children are now old enough to question my teeth and why they look the way they do. My nephew asks me at least once a week when my “lost tooth” is going to grow back in. Even innocent questions like those cut like a knife. 

Yesterday, I went to the ER, even during all the COVID chaos, because I couldn’t stand the pain anymore. I cried the entire way there because I knew I had to show them my teeth. I cringed when he had to give me a shot because that’s the longest anyone’s ever had to witness my teeth close up in this condition. And I was thankful that because of coronavirus, I could wear a mask.  But after all this, I woke up still in pain and I’m facing the hardest decisions on how to fix my problem without the finances. 

So I’m asking for suggestions on what to do next.. are there programs for single women like myself to get help getting teeth replacements? Dentures? Etc. please help me stay POSITIVE about this. As I’ve NEVER reached out for help before. It’s such a sensitive subject, but I have my boys and my health to think about.",22May2020,1

Anyway, like I said, I’ve been showing severe symptoms of COVID: fever, sneezing, runny nose, dry coughing, chills, tiredness, hard to get up in the morning, spent two days vomiting—it sucked, like I couldn’t even keep a sip of water and a spoonful of oatmeal down, so that was fun—and diarrhea.

It’s understandable that no adult is going to get up at 11:32 PM and drive me to the closest testing clinic. And I can’t pay for an Uber or something like that. Plus, ambulances are expensive, according to Google, and my mom would skin me alive if she heard sirens outside the house waking the entire neighborhood up after she told me she was going to sleep because she had work the next day.

She didn’t respond, and I never said anything else. All our mutual friends stopped talking to me over time. 

Now I’m alone, and I barely understand what I did wrong. I spend a lot of time wondering if it were better if I weren’t around to hurt more people. No matter how many times I apologize, or try to change myself for the better, I’m still alone. Is there anyway to feel better?",22May2020,1
252,"Hello. I'm a 21 year old female. My aunt is around 55. We are Asian, living in Asia. We stay together with my parents, grandma and my siblings. 

My aunt got a high fever when she was young and became developmentally challenged. She has the mental age of an 8 year old, petty and huge attitude problems. She can't work/get a job and lives off my dad and my grandma. She steals money from visiting relatives and my dad and the helpers, and uses the money to buy mobile phones that we have to confiscate cause she has a tendency of misusing them. She takes things of ours and hides it somewhere and then when we go looking for it she likes to whip it out and get praise. She's not stupid. She's smart, just forever stuck with the mind and comprehension of a child.

She keeps entering my room even though I have repeatedly told her to stop. She apologises and says she'll never do it again but a few months later I will catch her snooping around again. Recently she's gotten bolder. When I last confronted her a month plus ago, she snapped back, ""What?? Yeah yeah whatever I know!""  

I don't like her going into my room because things have gone missing before (my hand soap, my sanitary pads) and when asked she always denies it and my grandma gets super protective of her, but it's later revealed that she took them anyways. 

Her actions bring me discomfort and inconvenience and though it may be small, the little things she does are slowly adding up and making me feel like my room isn't mine anymore. I don't feel like I have privacy, I don't feel safe. My dad only says that she isn't normal so we can't do much. My grandma only scolds her when something is proven to have happened. My mum is fully on my side and scolds her but I'm worried that she'll keep entering and taking things that aren't hers and keeping them. 

What can I do? An anti-burglary system on my door? A sign that says ""KEEP OUT""? I want something that can deter her repeatedly. I will be locking my room as well, but I worry that I will forget sometimes, so I need measures for times when I forget. Also, I don't think it's fair or normal that I have to lock my room in order to feel safe in my own home.

What should I make of this? Is this a weird threat? My desk is near the reported coworker so they know I heard. Said it loud enough. Is it intimidation?

263,"My wife, her brother and I have strictly adhered to our states quarantine. My wife’s sister and brother-in-law have been wanting all of us to see their kids for the past month. Now that the lockdown is lifted, we all want to see our nieces but when it was mentioned they asked her brother “what’s different now and why couldn’t you come see them last week?” We all were stunned and couldn’t respond and it ended awkwardly. How should we respond when they ask us this next? (Which they inevitably will).

Some background-
Her sister and brother-in-law are insufferable- plain ol’ school yard bully’s who peaked in high school. To them, Covid is a hoax, we are stupid liberals, and we are “walking in fear instead of walking with God.” Whadda crock of shit. They are mean spirited, love to stir the pot, and make my wife feel less-than quite often. Not to mention her sister is verbally abusive and an all around miserable person. If it wasn’t for the little girls, I’m not ashamed to say we would have no relationship with them at all. 

Her brother moved in with us just a mere week before lockdown began. That added some drama to the sitch being that now he is feeling guilty for not seeing the kids and is now blaming us for him not seeing his family. He said he wishes he could turn back time and see his family when he first moved back. We have let him make his own decisions regarding the lock down but he thankfully has been respectful and we honestly thought he felt the same as we did until tonight. It completely blindsided us to know he felt this way. We have yet to have a single conflict in all these months of quarantine but to no surprise, their sister has caused an all out blowout between the two.  


But I digress. We will be seeing them soon and I know that because we didn’t answer their question tonight, it will 100% be brought up and more than likely in front of the kids. How should we prepare to respond!? We are at a loss. The little girls matter too much to us and even though they are used as a weapon against us, it’s a battle I’d gladly use ten-fold just to be able to have a relationship with them. How do we remain respectful while also standing our ground? How do we avoid a conflict when her sister and brother-in-law crave the adrenaline rush that differing opinions brings?

I’m still decently young and have yet to really be thrown into the “real world,” so my primary sources of validation, like others my age, are things like awards, recognitions, etc. Now trust me, I know that these things are subjective and I have my own personal endeavors that I feel will end up having much more worth in the end than any trophy could. 

However, I’m still human. If my name doesn’t pop up for something when my friends’ name does, it does hurt. While I’m not faced with constant failure, when situations like these do arise I always try and get rid of my dejection by assuring myself that these awards are, well for lack of a better word, stupid, and that they won’t really matter in the end. I also tell myself that my qualities are likely more valuable in the real world. 
 
After another incident similar to this, I found myself wondering whether this internal monologue was just me trying to embrace my confidence, or whether I had developed a dangerous mindset that I was “better” than others when this simply wasn’t true. I understand that my explanation is long and might not make much sense, but I’m hoping some of you have experienced something similar and can guide me a little. 

I think it’s also worth noting that anything I have accomplished (an award, position, etc.), no matter how impressive, I find myself extremely unsatisfied. A sort of imposter syndrome there. Very contradictory to my reaction to failure, but perhaps related in some way.",22May2020,1
265,"I've been feeling disgusted by certain things about my living situation. Like I literally cannot clean the house because I think about the germs and on not having the proper equipment.

So why don’t I? Well, I get intensely anxious about literally everything I’ve ever done in my life - sports games and practices, going somewhere new, hell stepping out the door and going out in public stresses me out and makes me anxious. Driving is no different. I don’t believe that I can do it. Everyone else can do it, and I genuinely do not feel like I have the capacity to do so.

268,"Recently, my on-campus job had a little Zoom party to celebrate the student assistants who are graduating this semester. Seeing all the pictures of my coworkers having fun and making memorable college experiences has me questioning everything, hence prompting this post.

Basically, I'm entering my senior year of college and I'm scared. I had a horrible time in high school and I was hoping for college to be so much more, but it hasn't been. I'm just afraid that I'm wasting (what should be) the best time of my life, but I also don't know what to do to fix it, for two main reasons.

1) I've struggled to make any real friends. I really hit it off with the first few people I met during orientation weekend freshman year, but one of them ended up ghosting me and another would ditch me constantly for her fuckbuddy (I drew the line when I was sick with the flu and she wouldn't even walk down to the cafeteria to grab me some dinner, with my own money). I actually had a really good friend there for a solid year, and even flew out to visit her in her hometown last summer, where we had a great time - but once I realized that I was always the one making plans, and stopped initiating conversations, she stopped talking to me. I feel like I've had some friends here and there in classes and at work, but I don't know if they necessarily consider ME a friend. My freshman roommate was also a disaster and I've commuted since, so that's out the window too. Everyone else seems to have found their ""group,"" meanwhile I don't have a single close friend on campus.

2) I don't tend to put myself out there a lot, and as a result, I haven't really had a lot of the typical ""college experiences."" I wouldn't say I'm introverted, but I'm not exactly extroverted, either - I have a decent amount of social anxiety and don't like unfamiliar situations. I am open to things and I love small get-togethers and fun events, but I don't like going alone, which is a huge problem for the reason above. One of the biggest things I feel like I've missed is that I've never really been to a college party - but at the same time, I don't drink or smoke, so it's not like that would exactly be a fun experience for me. I was actually the secretary for a club on campus last year, but once the president graduated and the VP went abroad, the rest of the officers kinda lost interest and it fell apart. I've also considered joining the LGBTQ+ organization on campus (I'm ace/demi) but this was kind of a bad experience for me at my high school and I'm reluctant.

I'm not saying I've had a horrible experience in college; in fact, I've met a lot of great people and had some good times. I'm also not completely alone - I have a great family, boyfriend, and best friend (though she's out-of-state, and in no position to be able to meet in person anytime soon), and I'm very grateful for them. I've just really felt like a loser lately, and I fear that a couple decades down the road I'll regret that I didn't take advantage of college life or try harder to make friends. Granted, I still (hopefully) have grad school next year, but that's obviously not the same. Sorry for the long post, but thanks for taking the time to read, and hopefully you guys have some advice for me.",22May2020,1
269,"While she's always held a lot of beliefs I didn't agree with, I have tried to keep an open mind, but starting last year she's gotten very heavily into the Anti Vax movement. After the pandemic started she now believes all sorts of crazy conspiracy theories about the government and how the Dems and Bill Gates are the ones that started COVID-19 to take down Trump (she posts frequently about ""documentaries"" she watches like Plandemic).


She gets extremely argumentative, defensive, and dismissive if I try to refute/disagree with any of her claims. I'm not sure if I'm being a jerk here, but I can't stand to be her friend anymore when she believes such stupid nonsense and won't talk to me about anything else now despite my attempts to steer the conversation elsewhere.

272,"I am a current business administration undergraduate student at a “less prestigious” university (think #70-120 in national ranking or a lower-tier UC school if that helps) who recently got accepted as a transfer student to a top 20-25 school in the nation. 

While I am elated, I am currently struggling with a dilemma. If I stay at my current university, I am on track to graduate with two majors and two minors in four years OR my business administration degree in three years. If I do end up transferring to this business-renown university, I will have to be in college for the four years and would most likely end up with only the one degree. 

Consequently, would staying at my current university or transferring be the better option? Would getting multiple degrees at a less prestigious university be worth more, or would the prestige and connections gained from transferring to the more prestigious college be worth more?

Recently I have watched ""The Kindness Diaries"" on netflix about a guy travelling to far places based solely off kindness. I wanna do something like that (something like r/backpacking) and while I probably won't take it to that extent (completely no money) if I were to do it, I was thinking of wanting to do something similar, just me, without having a cameraman. I want to make it more intimate for the audience by filming what I thought of some things at the end, what I learned and meet and learn about different people in hopes to shed light that there are good people in the world and that everyone has their own stories and struggles, that all of us as people are the same AND to also show the world the beauty and difference of different cultures, architecture and geography (the beauty of the world) so more people seek it out within their lives. Or maybe I'll end up showing that the world is harsh and selfish, which would still be a success in my books.

Though I do have some precautions about going about this:

* I AM a minority, even among my race, our race tends to be quite xenophobic even amongst the ethnicities within said race. Is it still worth trying even if racism (especially outside of my races continent) is inevitable?
* What are some things I would absolutely need money for? Crossing borders? (I wouldn't count food and a place to stay cause that's part of the idea)
* How can I stay safe without judging people?
* Is there anything else I should know?",22May2020,1

I (23M) recently joined a board gaming group. obviously, we can't meet at the moment, so we are currently on discord.

283,"I must first apologize for this post since it will be a lengthy one.  But I would really appreciate any help or tips that yall could give.
(P.S. I am on mobile so please excuse any typos)

To give a summary of myself, I am a 23 year old male from the state of Texas. I graduated college with a Batchelors degree in criminal justice this past December.  I dont have any friends, and did not make any in college due to the fact that I didn't want to go to collge, but my parents wanted me to go. My parents are immigrants, and work really hard to give me a great life. The least I could do was let their only child get a college education. I chose criminial justice because there was a time when I was obsessed with the popular TV show criminial minds. And to be completely honest criminal justice isn't a hard major so I choose it so I didn't have to try as hard.  The whole time I was in college I would just isolate myself, and be an outcast since I really didn't want to be there. I was that one quiet guy in class that would never talk to others, and show up to class and leave as soon as the professor let us out.  After graduation I took some time to relax and have some free time since I earned it. Due to the fact that the whole time I was in collge I worked as well. I would often work 30-35 hrs per week while going  to school full time. My plan was to take one month to relax and then look for a better job. 
But now we  are in May and I have no clue what to do. And I'm scared that people will start to think that I'm a failure. I still work at a grocery store as a cashier, and people will always ask me why I'm still working there if I have a college degree.

I really don't know what I am good at since my whole life so far was always going to school. I never played sports or any clubs. So when I hear people say that you need to do something that you love i can't relate because im not sure what I love to do. I wanted to be a probation office but since I am not a US citizen I cannot apply to many jobs because that's a main requirement. I am only hear legally due to the ""DREAM"" act. 
But leaving that whole citizehip situation behind, I have gotten a few job offers but im scared to take them. I have a fear that I won't be good enough for the job and that I will  just get fired. I'm scared to take those jobs to that fact that I'm scared to fail, and look like a clown to my family, and people that know me.

The only goal that I'm working on now is moving. I have always wanted to leave the state of Texas since it gets way to hot for my liking. I have some money saved up, in a couple  of weeks ill have about 3k saved up. I'm not really sure where I would want to move i just know that I want to move. My reasoning is that if I move to a place that I don't know, have no family then I have to succeed no matter what. Like they say when your back is against the wall you have to do something about it. But  I just hate that I have to clue what i want to do, I know some people that I graduated with thay already have some great jobs and then I look at myself and feel like a complete failure.

284,"My dad doesn’t have a cellphone. He doesn’t want to be called out of the blue and just likes to relax and do his own thing without me, my brother, or my mom “nagging him.” He feels that having a cellphone will allow us to constantly track and bother him, robbing him of his independence. 

Usually it doesn’t cause problems, as he’s a big homebody, but when he does go out driving it means we can’t contact him for hours. If plans change or if he gets hurt, we have no way of knowing where he is or if he’s safe. We have a house at the shore 7 hours away, and the only way we know if he arrived safely is by waiting 7 hours for a phone call from the landline - god forbid if something happens 4 hours in. He also changes his mind about where he’s going a lot, so even if he tells us where he’s going it’s not always a guarantee he’ll be there. 

He used to have a flip phone, but never charged it, so eventually he got rid of it. We have an unused line on our phone plan and an old iPhone 6 that my dad can use, so that’s not an issue.

291,"To preface, I've had minimal contact with my biological mother up until a few years ago. She made several poor choices in her life which led to her six children getting taken away and put into the 'system.' I aged out of foster care and reconnected her with, which led to estrangement with my last foster family. 

She had always been single, never married until last year at 41. I recently moved in with them due to some unforeseen financial issues, as well as a general loss of direction. My own depression/situation is a whole different topic altogether, however, and not the point of this thread, just though I'd mention the circumstances of me living with my mother at the age of 22. Someone who I had known.. very little. 

My step father is.. to put it in nice terms- dull. He's not very bright, the sort of man who just has very little common sense, and I'm not entirely sure he's book smart either. At least not when it comes to my mother. She blatantly, haphazardly lies to him CONSTANTLY. About the smallest of things, be it going with her friends, shopping, etc. etc. 

I never really questioned her intentions or her actions, not until a couple months ago. Whenever she'd supposedly 'go out' somewhere or to 'see' one of her lady friends I would message them and ask about my mother in a low-key, not suspicious way, and I'd only find out that she wasn't where she said she was. 

She's had issues with alcoholism, as well as drug addiction in the past. I suspect that she is still doing drugs, but I don't have concrete, solid evidence in that regard. She and my step father argue about her binge drinking, but it always ends up with her winning and going on to just.. do the same things again. She will say anything, literally anything to calm him down. Blatant lies to cover up her VERY bad wrong-doing. 

Today I went through her phone.. which I know might not have been the smartest idea, nor morally correct. BUT I just had gotten to a point where I was really.. suspicious, and I believe there was just cause to be so. I discovered that she is chatting with someone in their younger thirties, and they are speaking in a not so.. 'friendly' way. The nickname she has for him is explicit in itself, and my step father isn't really smart enough to suspect this or check her phone. He's 56 and has trouble with his own cell phone. 

I confronted her about a couple hours ago because she was 'getting ready to see her girlfriend,' but I had very much seen their plans to meet up. I mentioned that I saw some odd messages flash across her phone screen and she immediately got very defensive, lying outright to me. I argued further, but to no avail.. I conceded the argument because I just really don't know what to do. 

I'm at a loss for words, and I haven't known my mother intimately for most of my youth so it just... Do I say something to my oblivious step father? Do I just outright ignore it? The issue is that if they split I very well may end up homeless... I just don't know what to do.",22May2020,1

293,"So my story is: I’m a 14 year old boy living in America, born and raised. I am by no means skinny or obese, somewhere in the middle. I’m 5’9, and I’ve been having trouble in general with stuff going on in school. I’m sorry if it sounds like I’m complaining, but really do want advice.

1)First off, there’s this one kid who threatened to kill me and a few of my friends with a gun because we asked him if he put on mascara in 7th grade, which we were genuinely curious about. He’s also said some weird shit about a girl and asked for, uh, relations with her. He’s been trying to turn all of my friends against me, luckily most are holding strong. He’s claiming I’m racist, and trying to ruin me by saying I make fun of Mexicans, when I in fact, am Mexican myself and have only used it as a fact, not an insult. What should I do about him? Some suggested I fight him, others say I ride it out... idk what to do.

2)I’m self conscious. Obviously as a teen boy going through puberty, I worry about how I look. How can I control acne? How can I muscles? I’ve wanted to fast, but my parents haven’t let me saying it’s to dangerous. Any suggestions?

3)As a teen boy, in my case at least, I obviously have had feelings for the opposite gender. I really like someone, and I don’t know how to approach it, especially during these times of internet only. I feel ugly, even though everybody tells me I’m not, from my friends to family to my doctor. They say I’m healthy, but I don’t feel like it.

Thanks very much for whoever helps me out. I really, really need guidance right now...

FYI: The boy who threatened me didn’t mean it seriously, but still, what should I do about him?",22May2020,1

295,"I want to get either a degree in IT or a general business-related degree like Applied Science, so I can get an office job. It sounds odd but that’s always been my dream job; something comfortable and somewhat monotonous, where I don’t have to worry about bills or rent but I can still improve. 

I didn’t go right after high school because I didn’t know what I wanted to major in, and I watched my older sister land herself $50,000 in student debt because she didn’t know what she wanted to major in, either, and kept switching. I know the old adage: you’re never too old to improve yourself! But employers might not agree. Why hire a recently-graduated 26/28 year old with no experience in the field when you can hire a 26/28 year old with the same degree whose already had enough time to make connections? I don’t want to work in food service and labor my entire life but I’m afraid I’ve already fucked myself over by choosing to work before attending college.",22May2020,1
296,"So I met this guy at a Christmas party and we instantly clicked. I've been speaking to him for almost 6 months straight since I've met him. He moved back to America to finish his last semester of college so obviously we didn't get time to hang out much after the first time we met. 
We're always texting and talking and we've both indirectly sort of mentioned that we like each other. 
Due to the current pandemic, his classes got shifted online and he moved back to my city 2 months ago as it was safer than staying where he was. We haven't met in person yet due to the social distancing rules.
We still text just as much but this last entire week, I feel like we've both gotten busy/haven't spoken properly. Partially, because I haven't been texting back very enthusiastically and things have been weird at my home. By weird, I mean I had a lot of fights happening in the house and I normally don't talk about it with anyone but I somehow feel like I want to finally tell him. 
I'm mostly meeting him in person later this week (both of our families have been tested and we've tested negative so it's safe), and I want to talk to him about it but I'm scared I'll come off as if I'm oversharing or talking about something too personal and I'm also scared I'll end up crying while talking about it. But things have been so intense, and I want to finally be able to talk to someone about it.
Should I take a risk and tell him or will it be too weird considering I've barely met him in person and the first time I meet him after forever would be this intense?",22May2020,1

298,"I work construction, me and the guy I work for now worked for another guy who was a racist dickhead who we quit working for and I started working for my coworker.

I’ve only been in it a year and he’s got clients built up from working on his own outside of what we were doing for our ex-boss, or else I would start my own business. He compensates my gas (old boss didn’t) and pays me $2 more per hour than my old boss. He’s way more lax and easy to deal with than my old boss was too.

He said to call him tonight to figure out where we’ll be working tomorrow, so I did, but it keeps going to voicemail right away. I left a voice message and texted him as well, but still nothing.

He could’ve gone to sleep a bit early and his phone is off or ran out of batteries, but we didn’t work today because he had to go to court.

He got arrested, he told me and my ex-boss, about a month ago because his son’s baby mama and him got into it (they all live together) and she called the cops and said he hit her. IDK if he did, but he said he didn’t, and they all sound crazy so IDK.

So he went to jail for that and was released the next day, and he’s been arrested for disorderly conduct at bars and stuff so I checked my local jail view to see if he was in jail. What I found shocked me, but it makes sense now.

It said he was registered as a violent sex offender on the jail website. He moved to my state about a year ago and was registered in his state so I guess when he got booked for the domestic violence thing they said “oh, we checked and you were supposed to register in Florida as a sex offender.” He’s a self proclaimed degenerate who cheats on his girlfriend and to borrow a line from “Chuck and Larry,” he would stick his dick in a pencil sharpener if it had a skirt on it. He’s a pretty rough gross guy in general, but he’s always treated me right and he’s easy to get along with.

So I keep digging and find why he’s registered as a sex offender. In 1991 (5 years before I was born when he was 26) he was found guilty of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery on a minor female. I believe it, but man that’s so terrible and disappointing. I checked the laws in his state to find out exactly what that means. In his state, if you have sex with a minor (even a willing one) you will get the aggravated rape charge automatically which apparently is unique to that state. The aggravated sexual battery means he forced or coerced his victim with a weapon, or caused them bodily injury, or he had help from another person, or the victim was less than 13 years old (I really hope it’s not the latter one).

In my voicemail I said I’m going to wake up at the normal time I usually do and call him to find out where we’ll be working tomorrow, but now, I really don’t think I can look at him or talk to him the sane way ever again. Like, the best case scenario was that the girl was a day from turning 18 and she bumped her head of the headboard and got a knot and the prosecutors tacked on the aggravated sexual battery charge, but that’s very wishful thinking.

I think I’m going to quit this job now (only worked for him for 2 weeks). I don’t think I can get past this. He’s always said and talked about disgusting things, which it’s construction you know so I just laughed and thought it was funny, but now it all makes sense and none of it seems funny anymore, just disgusting and shameful.

I think I’m going to take all of the tools he’s ever given me, return them on his doorstep or backyard (what I did with my ex-boss), and ghost or tell him I’m joining the military (I might).

What do you think?",22May2020,1

302,"So this is long but please try to read I don't think I can explain in a TLDR. This happened last year as a senior in college. (The events racism did not occur while I was in college but the event I need advice about did).

Background:

I identify as Hispanic/Latino and lived in a small town with minimal African American people in our town. Between the ages of 13-15 I considered myself a pretty racist kid. I participated in a racist skit for class (realizing now our teacher was racist because she approved our idea, she was White). I said the n-word (not hard r, doesn't really matter but for context I guess) when they came out in songs, and to address friends (who were not African American/Black and who also used the word). At the time, I did not know the horrible history of the n-word or why certain stereotypes were bad to use. Despite being Hispanic my parents never really went into depth about racism against African American/Black people. It was a lot of ""they are treated badly because of their skin color but it is not okay"" and that was it. However, once I got on the internet more I started to learn more about anti-blackness and how harmful stereotypes and the n-word is. I immediately changed my behavior and started unlearning the anti-blackness I was around.

Fast-forward to the event I am talking about:

My college has a good ratio Hispanic/Latino students. Some of the boys I noticed address each other using the n-word. The particular students are athletes and/or in student organizations I am part of. During a student organization event we talked about diversity and equity where many of these boys were there. I mentioned that the n-word was harmful and that people who were not African American/Black should not say it. I also said that I was a person who used to say it and therefore know that it is easy and important to unlearn anti-blackness as a Latino. I wanted to acknowledge my racist past in order to not seem like a perfect person trying to preach to them. That night I also posted the summary of what I shared on social media and apologized the African American/Black community for my harmful behavior (my racist past, and that we should unlearn anti-blackness).

However, an acquaintance saw the post and called me out for posting on it. He messaged me and said that I posted it for for clout and that it seemed that the only reason I mentioned my racist past was so I wouldn't be called out for it later like he saw so many other people doing. I should mention I didn't have many followers but I was posting about wanting this very cool/competitive job so that might be why he thought that. Basically he said I did it because I wanted to be a step ahead when people found racist pics or videos of mine (not sure if those exist but hey, it's the internet). I deleted the posts after that message just because I didn't want to offend anyone else.

It's been a year and I'm still thinking about this. I still feel guilty for my racist past and for making the post last year. I'm not sure how I can make up for what I did in my past or even last year. I do not expect forgiveness from the African American/Black community because I did irreparable harm to them with my actions and words.

I guess I need advice about the situation last year, did I seem to be posting for clout or to be ""a step ahead""? Is there a way I can ever make it up to the African American/Black community for what I did? All I can say is I will continue to apologize, unlearn anti-blackness, and use my privilege when I can but I know this is nowhere near good enough. So how can I be better and not try to hide my past while doing it?",22May2020,1

307,"For some background, my mom separated from my dad when I was really young and moved to where we are now (for different reasons) and we kinda went through a bit but nothing serious. My mom met my step dad and they had a kid, my sister who I love with all my heart. We had our moments and our arguments but in the end we know that the love is there. 

Here's the thing, I've suspected that I was the favorite for a while but my mom didn't go out of her way exactly to please only me nor did she try to make my sister feel less. But I had that thought for a while. My sister is a pre/young teenager and going through that puberty stuff and whatnot. But she's also really smart and I admire her for that so she had some suspicions about me being the favorite. She would accuse my mom of having me be the favorite in a joking manner sometimes and other times passive aggressive and sometimes just angrily. Kinda like a way to guilt me and my mom. And eventually my mom said that I was the favorite in fact but I think she was saying it just to get her to stop. My sister would sometimes say that I was the favorite or hint at it guilting us both in a passive aggressive way. 

My question basically is, how do I help my sister?
 I feel like a P.O.S brother in general and even more guilty with the thought of me being the favorite.

309,"Hey, as from the title I think I'm relatively good at getting myself into a mindset of self improvement when it comes to video games. For example, I used to play/compete in fighting games and I got that through setting my mind that if I wanted to get good I had to bring in hours of practice, learning from better people, setting hours to play, practice, rest, watch guides, etc etc and I definitely saw improvement in my play. Recently, its been shooter games like CSGO where i spend my time improving my aim, and same as before I've been getting better. 

But my problem is with real world stuff that can actually help me such as learning programming or refreshing myself with my college course so I can land a job once quarantine ends, I have a harder time focusing and sticking to my mindset of self improvement. I want to say that maybe its because I'm not interested or invested, but I feel its such a shitty excuse. Has anyone experienced this and what advice could you give. Many thanks!

311,"Hello. Warning Long Post but I need to vent...

I've had this burning thought on my mind lately, I don't know where it suddenly came from but I just can't shake it.

I played football for eight years, and it was a big part of my life. I started out disliking it and being scared to go to practice everyday, then eventually that blossomed into me starting to like it and going to practice everyday. I was never that great at it, but I liked it and did it anyway. Eventually there was this one year and suddenly everything just changed for me. I had this coach who had his eye on me progressing through the years and he believed I could do things even I couldn't see myself doing. I was small in size and couldn't catch for shit, but I was attentive, respectful, and never gave up.

That year was my best year, I was always on the field, I played constantly in Defense, Offense, Kick Off, and everything in between. I still couldn't really catch but I saw myself growing and I was getting tougher, maybe cockier. I perfected the alligator tackle and could take down most guys no matter their size. Then just as soon as that year started it ended. It was sad.

Then came High School Ball, and there were some big changes. There was more people, more intensity, and more expectancy to do better. Freshman year was fun and I was still excited to go to practice everyday, but I lost some touch with a lot of skills. They didn't allow us to do alligator tackles at practice and I fell out of touch with it. I still got some tackles in in some games but I couldn't tackle much anymore. I still couldn't catch, it wasn't till Sophmore year that I got a grasp of that.

Sophmore Year was fun too but I started to get that fear again I used to have. It wasn't a fear of getting hurt though, it was a fear of messing up and being ridiculed for it. The coaches were a lot less lenient than they were before, people got mad often and were a lot less patient. There was a point though that I did start catching! I don't know where it came from but it's like something just clicked! Because of that I started playing more and it felt like the good old days! Then I jammed my finger... and I couldn't catch for a bit. I tried and caught some things but it was never as amazing as it was before. It unclicked.

Then Varsity came and this was a big change for me. Freshman and Sophmore year may have been tough but this was even tougher. The coaches weren't even likable anymore they were all just arrogant assholes, aside from maybe one. I was afraid of performing poorly at every practice and was reluctant to even try worried I'd fail.

Meanwhile during all this I was doing Track in High School as well and that Sophmore Track Season I absolutely loved it! The people were so supportive and the coaches were great! Not to say some of my football teammates were bad, a lot of them were actually really cool and I was glad to be friends with them. But I just wasn't having fun in the sport anymore, I was scared of every practice and I felt judgement everywhere I turned.

So I left. And I went to Cross Country (Where most of the Track Team went). And I'll be honest I loved Cross Country more than Track! It was great! But I'll never love a sport as much as I did Football. Even in those last years where I played less and less and got worse and worse I still had fun and lived being a part of it.

Now years later a Sophmore in college I can't help but wonder what would have happened had I stayed. I obviously wasn't happy in the situation I was in but I can't help but have this burning feeling in the back of my mind that I let my past coaches who believed in me and my teammates and most importantly myself down.

It's not like I was that useful, I mean I couldn't catch or tackle anymore, but I can't help but feel bad about it. And I don't know how to shake this feeling but vent about it!

Did I make the right choice? Should my happiness prevail over my pride? I don't know anymore. I did do a solid 8 years and I tried to like it but it was never the same again.",22May2020,1
312,"For starters, my fiancé’s dad didn’t play a huge role in his life growing up. 
When we got together my fiancé lived with his dad. He was single at the time. I stayed occasionally, maybe 2-3 times a week for about a year. His dad was a very heavy drinker with split personalities one day he’d speak to us and the next we didn’t exist. After 2 years of a rocky road we found out I was expecting. We knew we had to get our life together so rented our first home together. 
The baby came and his dad has a gf. She was GREAT a little bit of a drinker. Checked on the baby daily. Showering us with gifts. We became really close. 
My LO was a few months old and she insisted he would spend every Saturday night with his grandpa and her. I did not oppose because we enjoyed getting adult time. This lasted 2 years. My LO adored her and she adored him. They had the best bond even better than with his grandpa. My fiancé would speak to her occasionally but never became close with her. 
I became pregnant again and she was so excited for another grandchild. When he was born she became very distant. She stopped the Saturday night sleep overs with my oldest. He didn’t understand and still asked frequently to go see her. I would let him call and she would give him false hope and break promises. 
My oldest finally stopped asking to call her. 
Occasionally maybe 1 day every few months she would offer to babysit. Then she went mute. We would visit for holidays and she literally would spend thousands on the top of the line presents and clothes. Awesome!! 
We purchase our first home and she gets an expensive bedroom for them delivered. Never stoped by to see it or our new home. 
A year goes by of being distant and I wake up to a text stating, “you’re such a bitch that’s why nobody wants anything to do with the boys” 
Mind you I’ve never had an altercation with this woman EVER! Never disagreed. No matter how distant she was I always knew I could count on her if I needed her. My fiancé and I never fight we have a very solid relationship. We disagree at times, but never anything big. 
I blocked her and she messaged me on social media saying horrible things. I told her a few choice words along the lines of, “sorry you feel that way, but if you can’t respect me as their mother I won’t let my children be around someone so toxic” 
I knew she had to be drunk, but it crushed me thinking I ruined her and my oldest relationship. The more she kept messaging me the more I realized how psychotic she was. 
Her response to me about not seeing my children again was, “good I’ll save money” Days later she was still at it, but trying to right her wrong by saying I never involve anyone in my kids life. 🙄 We literally live within miles of each other. I shouldn’t have to parade them around like trophies so people can form relationships with them. 
It’s been since January and she tried reaching out to my fiancé recently saying, “I don’t know why she hates me”
My fiancé sees his dad frequently because he drives to his work to say hey for a few minutes. He and is upset I took the kids away from them. I never said he couldn’t see my kids, spend time with them, or anything else. My beef is with his GF, but he doesn’t even attempt to so much call them so he can be thrown in the same boat too!",22May2020,1

I am now mostly alone except for two people who I still kinda talk too if you could call it that. One I text maybe every 3 days but only for a sentence or two and we go our own way. We use to be best friends for years before but highschool and different choices fizzled that out but we kinda reconnected before I graduated.

The other friend I met one yea run highschool before he transferred and we have been in touch for the last 3 years but now things have kinda gone stale. We play games or jam once in awhile but it just doesn’t feel like a friendship if that makes sense. Just like a mutual understanding or something I’m not sure how to describe it.

I just feel like all these changes and especially losing my first relationship and only finally discovering myself do I feel like maybe these “friendships” are not worth it. I have been feeling really alone and just like I am forcing these connections as to reduce this hit I also my feel like I need to conquer it.

Both of them are nice and I am by no means wanting to hurt them but I just feel like I need to move forward and start and completely new chapter. These friendships have their good moments but ultimately feel like dead weight on both ends. I was thinking of just explaining to them how I felt and that I just want to be on my own and how I don’t feel really connected to them as friends. I still really care for them and wish them the best but I just don’t feel them as being anything more than bonds that died but no one really wanted to pull the plug.

Before we get to far in this, I’m doing this to get something out of it and I dont wanna sound like a creep or something, I do this stuff cuz she needs someone that will do this stuff cuz people always leave her. We used to be slightly more than friends but that’s long since passed and we consistently talk about ending up together and such but other times she’ll make it painfully obvious that nothing will happen. But when we do talk about it she seems hesitant and will say things like I can’t risk it or something along those lines. But whenever I even look at another girl she gets upset with me so she wants me around and also stay single but she doesn’t wanna make it anything more. I guess what I’m asking is do women ever put guys in the friendzone because, even though this guy is great and all, they can’t risk losing that special thing they have? And why do you or have you? I just wanna know so that I can make some sense of all this cuz it just kinda hurts...",22May2020,1
326,"Hey everyone! I’m transferring and will be an incoming sophomore for the college I decide on but I need help. My two options are Northwestern and Dartmouth where I will be on the premed track and pursuing a Cognitive Science major. Most of the advice I have gotten is based off of location. But, I like both the city and rural areas so that isn’t really that big of a deciding factor. I was leaning towards Dartmouth but then I thought about how Northwestern may have more opportunities since it is situated near a large city. However, Dartmouth can really help land medical related internships and research at their medical center. I also want to have a good college experience in terms of social life since I wasn’t able to have that in high school (since I was so focused on getting into college) so I thought maybe a city nearby could help.

330,"Hi, I'm 20F. 

I'm struggled with social anxiety for my entire life. I have no friends, I'm extremely lonely and it's destroying my mental health.

I'm not worried about finding a partner, I still have some issues that I need to fix before I even begin thinking about a long-term relationship. Right now, I honestly want a friend who I can hang out with. 

Whenever I discuss this, I'm always told to just ""put myself out there."" That's the problem, where I'm current stuck, there isn't really anywhere to put myself. I live in a somewhat isolated, rural town. I've looked up local meet ups and groups for people who might share my interests, I can't find anything. The closest thing I could find was a creative writing group in the nearest town (about an hour away) but it was geared towards older people.

It now has huge cracks in it. I feel like puking right now I’m so scared and so mad at myself for being so dumb and not thinking. I immediately submitted what happened to the school’s maintenance and gave my information and apologized thoroughly, saying that i’ll pay all of the damages. I also went and told the security guard what happened and he took it really well, saying he’ll do whatever he can to help me not be liable but I doubt he can do much.

336,For context my movie is a machinima about a group of teenagers in a zombie apocalypse trying to travel from one point to another. At one point near the end the main character Malcolm finds his friend Vick (who betrayed them) in the control room of a ravager outpost. Malcolm finally realizes that he should be nicer to Vick and opens up to him and even tries singing Vick’s favourite song to win him back (essentially doing stuff he hates to someone he hates to fit his ego) and Vick then rejects him and leaves. A few minutes earlier all his other fitness left and now he realizes that his ego and his carelessness has made him end up with no one. Until this point everyone he’s met just let him be arrogant because they didn’t care so this is his first time being rejected and it hims him at his core.

341,"My best friend and I (both early 20’s) live with my parents, we’re good kids. No alcohol, no smoking, no drugs and we have common courtesy/respect. 

My situation is this:

My friend and I pay the same rent, but he gets to live the life of luxury and my parents love him. For years I have been the only one in my house to walk our dog, otherwise she wouldn’t get out. I do my own (and other peoples at times) dishes, I help my brother and sister with homework, I give my family money when they need it, I go grab all of their groceries from the store for them, you get the point. 

What sucks is that my family treats me like shit a lot of the time. I will say hi and get ghosted, or just seem like a bother whenever I want to talk about anything, even just casual conversation. 

Imagine how your parents act when you have a friend over, always super nice and on best behaviour towards them, this is what it’s like whenever he comes upstairs. I can hear it from my room, always “hey! What did you get up to today?! Missing your parents??” Stuff like that. It genuinely hurts because I do so much for my family and I feel as if I get treated like dirt but my friend (who my parents would NEVER ask him to do anything (rightfully so, he pays rent)) gets all the love and support.

342,"To begin, I graduated high school in spring 2014. I entered community college that fall because I assumed I had to go to school but had no idea what I wanted to pursue.  I didn't really think about what would happen after high school. I scraped by through most of high school but showed a lot of promise in middle school while constantly being told how much potential I have. 

After 2 years of community college, I transferred to a 4 year university in my town and struggled so much. I went for one year and a summer. The fall semester, I had a family emergency and was only able to get credit for 1/5 classes. The spring semester, I had a hard time focusing and scraped by again. Then the summer courses. I really fucked up there. I truly only took them because I needed the student loan money to help pay for living expenses. And I had to take 2 courses to qualify for the aid and I ended up failing one of the courses. 

That fall, I decided not to come back and I took a year off. I wanted to save up money, travel, figure out what I'd like to do with my life... I was working retail and having to work so hard to make ends meet. That Fall, I applied to so many jobs and nothing worked out. I was doing all I could and it wasn't enough. But it was during this time that I really pursued hobbies and followed interests in my downtime. I was learning languages, networking with all sorts of people and gaining perspective. The following Spring, I sustained an injury and was caught up in an awful relationship with a guy who invalidated me. I hit a really low point and decided I would go back to school. All signs were pointing at me going back to school and I had felt like I was sure of the degree I was pursuing. 

I get accepted into my university again that Fall and I did so badly in my classes again. The next semester, I fail a class I LOVE. Next Fall, another failure in a course that I did my readings for and participated in whole heartedly. And now, this semester. This semester, I finally pursued the one thing I knew I always wanted from my university experience: to study abroad. I had pushed it off because I thought I wasn't ready, financially and otherwise. Despite having fun while there (France), I struggled because I didn't save enough money. Then came the pandemic. Despite the financial relief from returning home, I felt like it was a sign that I shouldn't have been on that trip. It was hell going through the application process alone and then being abroad with no income was awful. Now I'm stuck completing finals for classes 2 months from our last class date for subjects I care nothing about. 

I've been taking this quarantine time to be honest with myself. For some time now, a small voice has been telling me that I don't need to be in school right now. Being alone-- well, I've got 2 doggos with me, and doing so much reflecting has made that voice grow louder. Also, the immense procrastination of doing any of my assignments has shown me how little I actually care for my education. I'm not trying to say education isn't important and that I'm not grateful to be able to pursue it but I don't think it's working for me. And I can't handle that realization. I've always been friends with super smart and hard working people so I know I'm not an idiot. I feel so much passion for learning outside of the school system but I worry what my alternatives will be. I'm worried I'm not smart or savvy enough to make it without a degree. And I literally don't know what my options are outside of getting a 4 year degree. 

By now, I've gotten an associate in arts but I'm not sure what I can do with that. I need some serious guidance and I don't know who to ask. I feel stuck in the same town that I've grown up in. I know I have serious problems keeping up with school work but I'm also clueless as to what I want out of my education. I feel like I haven't come of age yet and I'm turning 24 next month! I need to stop making shitty decisions that put me into a corner. I feel like I have nothing and everything to lose. Please tell me there's someone out there who's gotten through this and turned out successful and happy. I just want to find MY definition of happiness. 

Thanks for reading this long winded, first comment of mine. Good luck on your journey during this pandemic:)",22May2020,1
343,"Long story short, my mom lost her longtime job in February(18+yrs) and my Dad who Ubers/Lyfts for a living can no longer work because of COVID-19, they can no longer afford to live by themselves. My partner and I  have a spare room available in our home and have offered our space to them. The problem is that I'm really struggling with this transition. I love my parents and they've done so much for me and them moving in with me is the least I can do for them. But, I'm having a hard time coping with all of these new changes. 

&amp;#x200B;

First, my parents have a ton of stuff. Like bordering on hoarder-ish. We already live in such a small space, and they've brought over a quarter of their things and our one-car garage has basically been filled with their things. I'm also concerned with the pests my parents might be bringing over from their home. They used to have a cockroach problem in their apartment and since moving a few of their things over, we've started to see a few crawling in our garage, which I'm really not happy about..

&amp;#x200B;

There's also the question of my parents' two dogs. My partner and I have a dog too, but he does not like other dogs, plain and simple. Whenever I've tried to bring over my dog to socialize with their dogs, it never goes over smoothly and we have to separate them constantly. My parents' dogs are also not potty trained and in their apartment, my dad leaves sheets of potty pads throughout. I'm also worried about them peeing all over my furniture and floors. But overall, I'm just really concerned about all the dogs' wellbeing as I'm sure that them not getting along and having a totally new environment is going to stress them all out.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner and I really pride ourselves in our home. I clean my house constantly and the thought of my parents cluttering the house with junk, inadvertently bringing cockroaches from their apartment, and the dogs peeing all throughout my house, and even more things that I could list of that really makes me more than unhappy with the entire ordeal of them moving in. My partner is kind enough to agree with them moving in, but I know that it's starting to take a toll on him too. The garage was supposed to be his small woodworking workshop/ home gym, but with all of their things, he can't use the room anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

We love my parents, we really do. I just don't know how to mentally deal with this transition. I get angrier and angrier with every fault that I see with them moving in, but I know that's wrong and I should accept this as new normal. It's been so mentally exhausting that I even get weird dreams about it!!

My girlfriend and I need some advice. We have been going back and forth for the last week on what to do.

I graduated last year with a degree in business. After interning and traveling for half a year I am wanting to go work in the game industry. With my skill set and connections, I can most likely get a job but it requires me to move away to a larger city. I really am pumped on the idea of getting a game industry job.

My girlfriend of 6 years has a tough time with decisions and after a long time and a short break from post-secondary has decided to go back for a degree she is really excited for. It would take her 3 years to complete it. Then we can move away to a place where I can find a job I am excited about. The catch is that there are no jobs in the game industry anywhere near where this school program would be, and that this specific program she wants to do does not exist at other Universities.

Both of us go back and forth as we both feel guilty having to sacrifice the other's short term or long term ambitions. We also don't want to do long distance, so that is not an option for us.

354,"So my parents made me go stay with my sister for quarantine, and I’ve realised how selfish she can be. I have very poor vision, so bad that if I’m not with my glasses on, I could pass as legally blind. My glasses is like a wheelchair for me. I literally can’t do anything without it.

Let’s say I finish doing work for the day and close my laptop, arrange my books and stationary on the table neatly for the next day, I wake up and it’s gone. My glasses that I set on the bedside is gone and I can’t even see to find it. So I wake my sister up and ask her where she has moved it to and she goes, idk just check around. This happens way too often. She’s “tidying up” and then she rearranges everything. So if I’m used to finding my glasses in her makeup bag, suddenly her makeup bag is gone somewhere I don’t know. I spend so much time looking for my glasses cause she won’t even help cause she doesn’t remember moving it. But I’m sure I’m not the one that put my glasses on the top shelf where it’s hard for me to even reach. 

I’m so sick of it, I keep telling her to not touch my glasses but she always denies moving it. It’s either that or I have multiple personalities and keep moving my own glasses or shes just lazy and doesn’t remember where she put it and is too lazy to check.
Not only my glasses, my clothes, my books, my games. She moves everything. This morning I had to spend 3hrs squinting into my laptop screen cause I didn’t have time to look for it and I needed to submit and assignment.

I’m a guy and I’m really into my good friend. I like everything about him. It’s hard to explain. He’s genuinely perfect. Personality to body. And to be honest, I’ve had a thing for him since 5th grade. Never told him about how I felt, but I’ve called him cute on yolo. Said never to call him cute again. I respected that so much it hurt. 

I want to not like him anymore. It kills me every time I hang out with him; every time he talks about his exs, every time he takes his shirt off, every time we touch in any way. It kills me knowing he will never think of me in any way besides a friend. Or business partner. I come over and when I do, I usually stay 2-5 days or more with him. That’s a lot of time to be in your thoughts with the person you like, constantly thinking negative stuff about yourself. Constantly feeling bad. Constantly. I honestly wish we weren’t friends. It just gets hard mentally after the second or third day. 

I don’t want to say anything. I don’t want to think about him anymore. I don’t want to be friends with him. I like him a lot as a friend too though. He’s genuinely amazing.

I’m really worried about this, because this only happens when I’m around my dad. I live with my parents and my two sisters(16F and 7F), and I really don’t have any problem with any of them except than my dad. Due to the coronavirus thing, all of my family has been staying home except of my dad, since he still has to work, but he leaves pretty early, comes home to eat lunch, then leaves until like 5 o clock then comes back home.

This has been happening to me since the last couple months, probably since the quarantine started. I’ve never had the best relationship with my dad, but never something like this. 

Every time my dad comes home and I’m around him, even when he’s not even acknowledging me, I feel like trash. I feel dumb, useless, uncomfortable, and pretty anxious. I hate when this happens and it just makes me want to lock myself in my room. 

I’m not sure, but I kinda feel like its because I’m not the son he wanted. He is kinda homophobic, and even tho I’m not gay at all, I do have some feminine quirks if I can call them like that. Its just like I do some feminine movements and things like that. I’m also really into video games and every time I am around him while playing I feel like he’s just thinking I’m a lazy mf and that I’m not doing anything with my life. He also sometimes ignores me when I talk to him or when he talks to me is usually in a harsh way and I just feel like he doesn’t care abt me. Another thing I know as a fact is that he prefers my sisters a lot more. He is a lot more affectionate to them and is always giving them little gifts, like food or something nice, which he doesn’t do with me or does a lot less often. 

I really don’t know why I feel like this, since in the deep end I know most of these things aren’t true, but I just wanna know if I should just not pay attention to these thoughts or somehow try to get my relationship better with him, could anyone give me their thought on this? :/",22May2020,1
361,"Yesterday I went to my friends house because I have a toxic family and I just needed a break and someone to talk to. I was over there and she talked to me about it and gave me some really good advice. Anyway, today it suddenly dawned on me that we only ever talk or hang out when one of us is depressed and needs help. Now I feel really guilty because I don't want our friendship to be devolve into just that. Obviously I know it's okay to talk to your friends when you need help with depression, but it's not okay for that to be the only thing that you talk about.

Recently we have a tradition of sending out hampers to each other for celebrating some religion-related feast, and this one friend from uni wanted to send me something. I didn’t ask her what she wanna send me, and I gave her my address. Most people send out cookies or desserts, and since we live 500miles away, I assumed she would just give me some cookies or other dry things. And I thought she knew I’ve became vegetarian from my posts. 

But turns out I assumed wrong. She sent me this frozen premade chicken dish. I know I’m not supposed to assume things and I should’ve told her beforehand about my diet. Although I asked her about her preferences (“Do you have any particular food you dislike/don’t eat?”) because I wanna send her hampers as well, but she didn’t ask mine.

375,"I met this girl in late 2016 (let's call her A). We became really good friends quickly, and after a few months, I started catching feelings. She was taken though, so I never acted on them. I bounced between crushes and whatnot, but A was still at the back of my mind. But sometime in late 2017, me and A got into a bigger, albeit childish fight, so we stopped talking for a little while. However, during that time of non-communication, she manages to break up with her boyfriend and get with her current girlfriend (let's call her R). We started talking a bit more after, and became best friends again. But this time, I couldn't stop thinking about those feelings from 2016 and expanding on them.

Now, to get to the point. My crush on A had never gone away, just been slowly simmering for almost 5 years now. And I don't know how to deal with it. Obviously, I don't want to steal her away from R. They have a very healthy relationship, and A has stated multiple times that me and R mean just as much to her as the other. And the usual tactic for ""lost cause crushes"" is to cut them off to lower the chance of acting on them, but since we're best friends, I don't want to do that. I don't want to do anything that would make me lose her from my life, but I can't get these feelings out of my head. This post is on the ""last resort"" end of things, because reminders that I can't be with her tend to make me upset.

I’m 19F and my boyfriend is 20M. We’ve been together for over a year now and we do see marriage in our future, just not right now. We’re both still college students and we’d rather be much more financial secure before making that next step. 

We’re both middle eastern and in our culture theres no such thing as moving in together before marriage. We don’t just get to live together if we arent married. We cant go on vacations together or even go to each others houses if we havent been married through a religious figure. My parents are more relaxed than other middle eastern parents because they let me have a boyfriend. But they dont know that we’ve had physical contact with each other. My mom always tells me “make sure he doesnt touch you”. like okay mom, sure. 

In our culture it’s pretty stressed upon that women get engaged early. Especially if they’ve been with a man for a few years. I expect that my parents will start to pressure us by 22 if we’re not engaged. It sucks.

The problem I’m having is that I keep worrying about every little thing for the future. Like, what if we dont have enough money saved by then or what if we take so long in school. Sometimes i cant stand this culture. Whats wrong with being with someone you love if you’re not married. Why cant we do normal things like kiss or hug. These pressures have been bothering me so much. I keep overanalyzing everything in my life. I also dont want to pressure him and ruin everything we have. How can i stop worrying about this?

385,"So, cutting to the chase pretty quickly how to I tell my friend to stop being a jackass and act like a normal person without it sounding vindictive or rude? 

Background:
We’re two college students and this friend who I’ll call “S” is a really great friend. She is part of my core group of friends and we are all a part of the theatre department at our school. 

During the summer of last year we all worked together building sets for the plays that the theatre was doing over the summer. S was made our shop foreman and so our direct supervisor. I didn’t really care about that part because yeah whatever I’d rather die than be in a leadership role so good for her! 

What came next, however, just big-time sucked. S became sort of a control freak - at first during the summer I attempted to give her the benefit of the doubt - she’s a lot younger, she’s inexperienced with leadership, she’s just being a little crabby because she doesn’t know what she’s doing, etc. What sort of began to bug me was this STARK contrast S began to show between her “work” persona vs. her “friend” persona. 

We started this past school year and S, unfortunately, kept up with this rapid switching between personalities. While I no longer have to be a co-worker due to the small size and nature of the theatre department, I have been subject to her Royal Highness’ behavior with great frequency it has been it was enough to give me whiplash and to begin genuinely pissing me off. The friend personality is great, funny, kind, and gentle - the work personality is literally so insane; it’s like she forgets what basic human empathy is

1. She always has to be “correct” in her opinions/ideas and refuses to take any input or criticism that might be different. This is genuinely the one thing she does that bothers me the most. Like I literally couldn’t fall asleep tonight bc I’m just thinking about the conversation I have to have with the theatre faculty to be like “I’m gonna kick her ass if I have to work with her this coming semester” and it’s making me like UPSET. 

2. She gets really snippy and short with questions and just seems frustrated and angry if you can’t do something SUPER quickly or are at all confused about something that’s going on. 

3. She has to be in control of everything and there’s no good way to like ask her to chill out. We’re both a part of like the honorary society for our major and hold executive board positions. She is Vice President. Another one of our friends is the President. We are meant to be tabled for the semester and she like went behind our president’s back and like called a meeting to adjust literally all of our bylaws (which like it needed to be done but it isn’t her place or her job???) and she just gets like SO angry when someone else is in charge???? 

4. I’m not the only person who is absolutely incensed by the way she treats people when she’s attempting to be a “leader”. In our department of like 20 people??  A little over half want to like overthrow her. 


I don’t know how to deal with this because I really don’t want our friendship to go to ruin because I snap at her one day or lash out. I have just been like trying to roll with the punches but I’m like  t h i s  close to being an asshole to her instead of having a healthy constructive conversation about how she is treating people making them upset. So, if anyone has any advice or sage words of encouragement I would appreciate it!’",22May2020,1

I thought it would go away and that it was just a cold but it never did. After some googling it led me to think it might be a sinus inflammation. I have contacted my family doctor but got the reply to go get an appointment with another doctor who specifies in noses. Sadly.. the doctor has a full list of patients and only free time is after a month. 

The problem is that I have exams in one week and I heard they might check students temperature before letting them in the room because of the corona virus craze.

387,"First of all, im well aware that my situation could be way worse, I have supportive parents, the privilege to be in medical school and financially taken care of, which is exactly why I dont know if im making a huge mistake by staying or getting off of this 'path'.

Ive had mental problems for as long as I can remember; depression, anxiety, self hate you name it, ive had it, though im slowly trying to reach out more and figure stuff out.
Nonetheless, im just not a functioning adult or human being right now. I dont know if I actually want to do medicine but either way im pretty much self-sabotaging and fucking up my way out of school  (not studying, not attending exams, failing exams)

Im at a point where im pretty sure that im just too stupid for it, that its 'just a matter of time until I fail' so i might as well drop out now and safe myself from the humiliation.
Funnily enough though, I cant actually tell if I could live with myself If I were to fail that way and if my alternative Plans B,C,D,.. are real options or just sheer desperation.
There have been times where I cant see myself as a doctor AT ALL, as well as times where I couldn't imagine being anything else and that, yes, this time ill finally figure everything out, sort out my problems and get my act together but those good days usually dont last very long.
Ive thought of going into nursing, biology, microbiology, psychology but im ngl, it would be a hopeful shot in the dark, hoping that it will be different this time. Obviously everyone wants me to stay (understandably), to try harder and longer but I feel like im breaking myself at an even faster rate this way. 

As for my future I mostly want be financially stable. More importantly I dont want to waste my life, I want to make my family proud but Im so weak at the moment...I cant even force myself to study, sleep or get dressed which doesnt make it any easier.
My reasons for medicine are varied (im good at rationalizing), I respect anyone who does it a lot, its very interesting and you get to help people so im not the type thats just in it for the money (both my parents are doctors and I admire them a lot).

I dont expect much of a response but anything would be appreciated tbh, I dont know which way to go.
For now ill just force (and probably fail) myself through the semester and hope to achieve some certainty. Im also in the progress of getting a therapist to help with the mental side of things.

I’m in a relationship that’s been going about 3-4 months now and I’m very happy with the person, meeting families, etc all that good stuff seems fine. 

However, with social distancing measures in place it has been odd just like for everyone hanging out without anywhere really to go as we both currently live with family. It’s difficult especially without the physicality which I understand is nowhere near as important as keeping everyone healthy.

We had been planning a small trip to an Airbnb with a remote contactless lock in an area with very few cases that is now allowing rentals and other businesses to reopen but the date has now been pushed back further and further because she doesn’t want to face criticism from her family even though you can argue she’s been to stores that are immensely higher risk than the plan we had in place.

Its a combination of the shared misery of quarantine, having her decisions controlled by family, losing work to be able to have my own space, and the obvious physical frustration.

But I don’t know if I should talk to her about it because I don’t want to influence her decision of whats safe or make her feel like she’s putting people in needless risk although she doesn’t seem to follow that standard otherwise. I could just need to vent about it but I don’t know how to handle this properly without going insane being stuck.",22May2020,1

I've heard of people that after studying this they went to Denmark or France and got their university degrees in two or three years because this course can be transferred as credits for university.

I would really like to go to Denmark. Not sure why, but I traveled there and I loved it. And I love how the vibe is so different from Spain (where I live now). 

But I'm just lost with my life. I'm not sure in what I want to work. I want to go to university as an excuse to move to other countries and because of boredom. I think part of me refuses to grow up and I get the feeling that if I study it won't feel like I'm already an adult. I know it's dumb.

We had several conflicts that resulted in her storming off in to our storage room over the past few months. Most of the time though, our relationship was very amicable and we spent a lot of time together. 

I know I'm insensitive sometimes but I just have very crude humour. I try to change but sometimes my crass nature just slips out. I am also scared that she might do something harmful to herself again. The last time we had a fight, she stabbed her arm multiple times with a scissor and drank rubbing alcohol and cologne.

Anyway, I am tired of having to be constantly vigilant of what I say when I'm around her. The smallest thing sets her off. Like telling her that I like this character from a series more than her favorite character.

393,"So off the bat I’m gonna provide some info, I’m male and 15 years old and the girl I’m talking to is 15 as well, I’ve know her for about 3.5 years and we’ve been pretty good friends for almost all of that time. We’re both fairly mature for our age and when we first met we sorta clicked, we have similar senses of humor, similar life goals, and similar morals. 

I did make a move on her a year ago, and it was pretty awkward I won’t lie, but it wasn’t a bad type of awkward. We just complemented eachother on looks and personality and that was it, I still regret not trying to follow that up later but I ended up falling in love with someone toxic and slightly manipulative that used me as support without giving anything else in return. It’s safe to say that ended a few months ago but I’ve been really depressed and anxious for the past few months and I feel like a piece of shit for not just going after the first girl.

We kept being friends when I fell for the toxic girl but didn’t talk as much, but now we’ve been talking pretty frequently and I’m pretty sure she still likes me, but I’ve also received a few mixed signals from her. I’ve been taking things slow because (I hate to admit it) I’m still not completely over the toxic girl, and I thought it’d only be fair to give the first girl the blankest slate possible before trying to advance our relationship. I really do like her and care about her, but I don’t know how to express that to her all things considered. 

I fear that blew my chance with her and I’ll just end up being friend zoned. She has other guy friends that show interest in her and I’m scared that if I take it slow and wait until I’m mentally ready to put my love and trust into someone again the other guys will make their moves and I’ll be left in the dust.

395,"I’m a guy and I think there’s something up with me. I’m not bipolar I swear but I’m not sure what’s up 

Like most guys out there I want a gf and not just for sexual reasons but I only feel like wanting one when I’m lonely or honestly jus feelin horny. 

Unless the girl is into everything or most things I am I can’t ever picture a female and I being “together forever”.  I’m not afraid to commit to a girl but more like i just don’t want to, like I don’t feel like it

Not to give off the wrong impression, it’s not like I’m getting girls back to back like some player. I’d be happy to find one but none around me just seem to “measure up” if that makes sense.

396,"To preface I just finished my freshman year of college. I had always been into astronomy; ever since a little kid, I would read books and look through a telescope at the cosmos and have recently taken to taking astrophotos. I always thought I would apply this to my career. However, upon taking Calculus my spring semester, I realized I was neither good at calculus nor enjoyed the class whatsoever. So I switched majors from that of physics/astronomy to history. I've since been having an internal debate about whether or not I did the right thing: I always thought I would become an astronomer or something similar and curse myself for not trying harder or getting better at the math side of things (don't get me wrong, I enjoy the astronomy part). But another part of me believes I am not cut up for the career and should settle and stick with history. I don't know whether it was a lack of trying that I switched majors, and now need the advice on whether I should ""try harder"" at astronomy/physics or if I should stick with history. What would you all do in my situation?",22May2020,1
397,"I (28F) just found out my brother (24) and his girlfriend (22)  have gotten pregnant by accident and are 4 months along. Due to being in an old fashioned thinking country, both sets of parents (ours and hers) are having them get married. They are still young, and (unfortunately IMO) she will be dropping out of medical school due to the pregnancy. He is working and should be able to support them financially. 

 I'm sad that they were not careful enough to avoid this situation (abortion is illegal btw in the country), when condoms at the minimum are available. This is clearly a life course changing situation for them both and adds in a new life into the mix. I'm just shocked that this all happened right now, when I'd spoken to him before about family/life goals, he did not want to consider marriage until his 30s but I supposed this has pushed the timeline on a fast forward.

How do I react, what messages of support can I tell him? I guess I don't need to shame him but I do want to remind him how serious this is that he is going to be a father in 5-6 months.",22May2020,1

399,"So my name is Jas, I'm 19yo male and since I was a kid I always had this weird sense of alertness when something bad is going to happen with me and it's through flickering of my left eye, I've came across number of such cases where I didn't even had any bad thought in my mind but when my left eye flickers something bad happened eventually and in most cases actions that I take after that sense are responsible for that.
Recently my left eye is flickering as never been before it's too worse that it got red for couple of days, I thought something might have gone inside it some dirt or smth so I put eye drops for some days but no change was there, it's been almost a week and I am terrified as fuck, it's so unreal I can't control it properly and I am trying my best to stay calm, I am doing everything to distract me from this cuz I don't know why this is happening and what is coming towards me. What should I do?

P.S - Some of you might think I am superstitious or believe in magic and stuff but in actuality I'm very much against the superstitious/cult thing, I don't have any thoughts about magic and stuff, the sense that I get by flickering of left eye is purely from an experience and have noticed this everytime as when I've grown up.

401,"So iv been in quarantine for 75 days and for the past month and half iv been applying to over 120 jobs. In this time it gave me the distance to realize im not bound to this city and job. Im 25 and no kids. Im in small City Iowa because its where i went to school. I got the job at the Po because it was the one i got and is stable income. But right now with unemployment and unable to to work because of my chemo iv had the time to think about it and realize i can do something i want to. I have 3 college degrees and nothing im doing with it. Thats money just lying on the table im paying to. My life is revolving around this job I dont like because thats what is comfortable. So with this iv started applying to jobs, In L.A, Austin New York and any other city that i could get into the video game industry and or the entertainment industry where my passion was. . But ya so iv been applying to 120 jobs and have heard back from about 32 of them. A couple of them that i could get feedback from, that wern't automated, did tell me that i would have to relocate is a issue. I wasn't planing on moving until i had a job offer, but what if not moving is keeping me from getting the job. So am i thinking crazy that i should move to Austin before i have a job? I mean im already on lockdown and unemployment, so if i do that here or there its no difference. The draw backs are rent would be more. But i have been putting money away for that. Also id be leaving everyone i know, My mom and brothers and friends. But also i dont feel i should have to hold my life and passion to be near them. Can i just get some advise. Am i being selfish and short sighted? I'm thinking ill do it next week which seems soon but people change ther lives in a single day. I.e. my dad died and it changed our whole live. Or people get divorced and have to change. At least if i do this im going with a plan. Ish.

My family has been trying to comfort her saying that it's okay and very normal to take out loans for school and that there are probably people who take out more than she will have to. We told her that our older sister also has loans that she is still paying off. But she's got really bad anxiety and even had a pretty bad panic attack yesterday which took alot out of her. She's starting to regret accepting this school but I don't think that it's right to give up over money even if our family isn't that well off.

404,"Hi everyone I’ll make this as brief as possible but I need to get it out of my head because I’m not getting answers from just thinking! Anyway I’m wondering if my mother is toxic or if I’m just being a dramatic ungrateful daughter. She’s done a good job at protecting and keeping my sister and I comfortable. But I don’t think she’s been the best for our Self-Esteem. I’m an introvert and she’s an extrovert. She has mentioned to me that I’m never going to find people that want to be with me if I continue to be the way that I am way. And a part of me must’ve believed it because a few years later and I’m friendless and only have my sister and my boyfriend to count on. Shes insulted my personality many times this way. She knows of my social anxiety and I’ve tried to make her understand but for some reason she uses that as an insult and it just hurts very very much. It’s like a wound that I carry around and she just opens it again. I’ve always felt ashamed for being the way I am and idk what came first me being ashamed for how I am or her insulting the way I am and then becoming ashamed of it. Is there something so wrong with being introverted? Why do I feel like it’s such a bad thing? I am quiet but why does she use it as an insult to hurt me and why does it hurt so fucking much? I don’t see quiet people and think something is wrong with them? Do other people view quiet people as inferior or is it just my mom? I just don’t get it. Idk why it insults me when people call me quiet when it is a fact. And I could sit here and write paragraphs of all the bad things she’s don’t but also all the good things she’s done. I honestly think the bad would outweigh the good though. I’ll just name a few that stand out to me. 
She said no one would deal with my crap if I continue to be how I am. 
She said I don’t talk enough. 
When my sister was at the hospital she told my family that I don’t even talk so me being in the room was not a problem while my sister rested. When I told her she never let me go to friends house she responded with what friends I never had any friends. ( I did have to do a project at a friends house and she didn’t allow me to go and we ended up with a bad grade because of it)
She needs help with a lot of things. Always calling my name needing help with one thing or another. She can clearly do a lot of those things she just wants others to do it. 
She always calls me a dumb ass even after I told her not to and she said well it’s because you are a dumb ass. Idk if that’s normal in families but in my family it’s seems normal to call each other names. 
Talks to my dog and says she’s the only one that loves her in front of me and I just walk out of the room cus it’s manipulative af.

408,"Since the beginning of quarantine, our school's been on overdrive in getting our lessons taught and homework coming in so that we can finish the national syllabus before our upcoming public exam which practically dictates if we're eligible for a further education or not. Our schools pretty well known for academics and always pushes us, but since online teaching started I've felt that it's been way too much.

So the online schooling follows the regular school schedule (7.30/8.00am - 4pm) with usually at least some form of homework every day. It wasn't a problem starting off since we're all used to this routine, it started when I started taking a break.

Biggest mistake I made since that has caused my workload to snowball ever since and now I feel like I need lots of catching up to do compared to the rest of my peers including that public exam in the back burner pressuring me.

I've since then lost pretty much most of my motivation to do pretty much anything. I stopped working out and most of my friends can't talk since most of them are dealing with this too and are always busy. Any ideas on how to get myself motivated enough to catch up on time?

412,"I feel like I’ve messed things up permanently.

I’ll try to keep this short.

I am a 16 year old guy who is tall and I would say fairly good looking. I am decent with words and sometimes pretty smooth when focused. I play guitar and have written a good amount of lyrics in the past couple of years, which I have yet to show to anyone. I am considered wise considerably beyond my years. I am also considered the smartest person in my 320 person school. I tell you these things because I feel in this situation all factors must be presented.
And now I will present the negatives about myself. This will hurt.
I hail from a family known to be creeps, have done some creepy things myself, and also am considered disgusting partly due to a teacher who didn’t let me use the restroom an entire day and I ended up pissing myself in front of everyone in 4th grade. Fuck you cuntbag teacher. Anyway I’ve been awkward up until the past few years.

Now for the more recent stuff.

The girl I present to you became the principals daughter by marriage, and is in my opinion the cutest girl in the world, even though I have not heard anyone else say that. She is incredibly smart as well.
Back in 5th grade I had a crush on her. This was just one of the ordinary crushes you get and that’s that. Some guys made a big deal of it and I eventually learned that she liked someone else. Expected that.
Fast forward to beginning of 2019-2020 school year. We have a couple of college classes together and I begin to notice her more often. Now I had crushes on other girls between these times but I often found that I didn’t really care about them. I found myself actually caring about the girl who I will call SW.

Now my connection to SW was not very close. The principal has named me her favorite student multiple times. I have not had very many opportunities to get to know SW over the years but considering that I will address the next line.

What I developed over those few years was way more than a crush. In fact several of my friends are convinced I am in love, and so am I at this point. Now it seems that considering I have not talked to her that much it would seem that I do not know her that well, but I am amazing at telling who people are by the way they act. And the vibes I get from her are insane, like I don’t know how to explain. No one else has drawn me in like she has.

My attempts to reach out to her started a few weeks into school. I invited her to one of the weekly youth events that she rarely goes to, and she came. Now what messed this time up was me being too nervous. We ended up sitting down and saying nothing over chicken and dumplings. I approached her later and apologized.
This next attempt hurts me to talk about, because I believe this is what messed it all up.
I took some advice from my mother. What you need to realize right now is that me and this girl are what I would call acquaintances even after so many years. My mom suggested I ask her parents if I can take her out to eat one day. Overall the answer was no and I wasn’t able to talk to her for a week, not because they told me I couldn’t but because it was impossible. She is in a different grade and even in such a small school it is insanely difficult to talk to someone outside your grade. 

A little time passed (like 5 months) and right before quarantine I had recovered slightly. We have had a couple friendly interactions and I am good friends with most of her friends as well as her older sister.

At this point I’m still very concerned that I am at a total loss. She has a lifelong guy friend who is charismatic af and popular af who her parents love and is basically me but hasn’t done what I’ve done to fuck things up. He gets to talk to her all the fucking time. They “dated” for a week but she broke it off. All of my friends say that she says I’m weird whenever I’m brought up and says stuff like “OMG, he’s so weird, I would never!”

Then they say they thought she liked me and one of them says that they notice her looking at me in class. Then I think. She tried to get into all my groups in college classes. I caught her staring at me in math(we have one regular class together) and she came to a youth event for ME.

But that was before I fucked it all up by asking her parents if I could date her which she apparently thought was really weird, or my friends are dramatic. I don’t know why that did it but damn.


I have 2 years left of school and the ways I can contact her are limited. I would have to ask her parents permission to ask her for her phone number, she doesn’t have social media, barely goes to youth events and at school I never get to talk to her.

So for one: did I fuck it up by asking her parents to date her or was everyone being dramatic about her thinking it was weird?
And two: at this point in time with what I have in the above paragraph and that other guy who does everything right, do I have a fighting chance?

Tl;dr : I don’t know how to sum this but: girl thinks I’m weird only because I asked her parents if I could date her when we are basically only acquaintances, I have 2 years and not many opportunities, do I have a chance?

Edit: I want to clarify here. What this might be is a giant misunderstanding, I though about addressing that I did something wrong by moving too fast. I know some people that reply to this post will say there is absolutely no chance. I will neither confirm nor deny that, but I’ve been trying to let go for months now. I’m very self aware and am starting to worry if I have a mental health issue, or if I am too strong willed of a person.",22May2020,1

I was always told that this is something super popular in Japan and people actually like this. I didn't worry as much back then, I was a kid with no care in the world. Now that I've discovered more in my years it's really started to concern me. I'm extremely self conscious over my teeth now.

Well as I grew older, I stopped confiding in them about a lot of things because I started to get screamed at for even the smallest of things. But having no siblings and still being so close to them, I still wanted to talk to them about my day and listen to them, have conversations.

&amp;#x200B;

But lately I realized something I should have realized many years ago. They don't seem to care at all. Sometimes I will approach them and talk about something completely normal and they don't even hear it, pretend I don't exist or just do not acknowledge my existence. Most times I say something, wait for an answer but they both don't even look up from their phones or away from their TV. I leave the room when this happens and they still don't even look up, like I hadn't even said anything. It hurts so much when they do this, and when I bring it up with them they say they are busy. Busy? They are scrolling through instagram! Its not like I am hounding them all the time or that they need space or something, I talk to them maybe twice or thrice a day nowadays (I am home from college due to the lockdown and usually spend all my time attending classes or doing chores). But this kind of thing has been happening for the past 6 to 7 years, so its not a result of the lockdown.

A few days back, I asked my mother something and she told me I need to leave her alone and that I'm acting like an immature 10 year old child, that I need to grow up. I agree, she was watching a movie at the moment and I did interrupt her this time, but it was something a bit urgent that I needed to talk to her about. She told me this in the most hurtful way possible.

And even before this, if I talk about something, they just stare at me and shrug and go back to doing whatever they are doing, like I'm some stranger who is interrupting their life. And I'm so hurt all the time because I don't understand why. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to stop wanting to tell them things about my life now. They brought me constantly expecting me to tell them everything and now that they don't give a fuck I don't understand how to stop seeking validation from them. 

Don't ask me to move out as I am from a country where kids don't move out until they are much older or graduate college.

I got broken up with in march, and was on here and ask reddit about it a while ago for advice. Well I'm at the stage where i want to look for a girlfriend again. But, this is where it goes a bit sicko mode.

y'see, I'm going into my senior year this year, and on one hand, i would really like to have a girl that i can bring to homecoming (which i have never done yet), and it would e pretty sick to go to prom with someone as well. But, i feel like it would be a tease for me to start a relationship now, because i want a really long lasting relationship, but at the same time I'm going to college in a little over a year and a half, meaning unless we went to the same school, we would have to both be cool with long distance or just break up.

**\[This is like my third time using Reddit, so if the post needs to be posted somewhere else, tell me, thank you\]**  
**\[Sorry for any mistake, unfortunately I'm not a native English speaker\]**  
Background: **Teo** was the face of this group of Internet ""friends"", he decided to start a youtube series with all the group and everything was fine, but eventually some people became aggressive to him, me and another friend of us, because we are his best friends.   
They insulted us and said really bad thing about **Teo**, and even when they left, they continued to give shit to us, even tho we were not in contact anymore.   
**Teo** was really in a terrible moment and knowing that these people still continued to torment him, made him really scared of joining in other online groups.   
Me and the other friend continued to be there for him in case he needed everything but nothing changed, actually, my relationship with him became the worst, even tho I really like spending time with him, he said multiple times that I became a terrible friend, and that he can't count on me for anything \[This is kinda true, I became a terrible friend and I couldn't keep any promises I made to him, but I'm trying to become better than this\].  
Some months ago, we heard from some people that those who threw shit to us continued to do that, but, other than that, they also said some personal information about **Teo** to a lot of people, they even said a lot of bullshit to make him fall into a bad light \[I'm not going into personal details, but everything was really bad\].  
Me and the other friend talked to the shithead that started all of this and he told us something to the line of this: *""I only did it in private, how could i knew that other people on the group would say it to others and that they will make up bullshit, It's not my fault, I can't control what they say"".*  
The discussion ended with a ""we will not see each other never again, and no one will talk shit about anyone"", but a week ago somebody came under one of **Teo**'s videos and said something really really bad about him, and that made him really sad and panicked.  
At the moment I really crave for violence, I really want some justice or anything else, but I don't wan't to accused of anything, I kinda hope that in the future the karma will hit them back with the same shit they did, but I'm angry and sad for **Teo** who didn't deserved any of this..   
So what should I do, wait and hope for the karma to hit them back?",22May2020,1
423,"Today I was in the second hand/salvation army store and the lady in front of me was buying old undies (which looked well worn), pjs and bathmats.

I really really wanted to reach over say ""I'll pay for your items too"" however, I didn't know how I would come across and if I would offend the lady or how to approach the situation. In the past I have payed for other peoples items at the check out if I can see they aren't well off but the last time I did it the man called me 'crazy' and 'why would you want to do that' when I offered to pay for his items.

425,"Hey there,

I've for awhile been thinking of getting or making something small (cheap) for my friends when I see them again for the first after the quarantine in our area is over. Basically something that says ""Hey we made it through and I missed you"". I really don't have much money to spare at the moment so I was thinking of going for something more creative and/or humorous rather than something that's actually practical. Maybe something like chocolate slabs with googly eyes and masks since that's some what fitting. Another idea I had was to make a fake magazine or book with the title of ""How to socialize for those who forgot"" with tons of jokes and ridiculous advice, especially inside jokes since our friend group has many of those.

So basically time isn't much of an issue, but budget is.

Any of your people's wonderful ideas would be amazing!",22May2020,1
426,"I'm from Mexico for starters. 

We have somewhat normal neighbors, except for the son of our next door neighbors, he's already around 30 years old and just a fucking deadbeat.
Whenever his parents aren't in town he throws parties and makes a lot of noise. It has always been annoying, but it wasn't all the time so it was whatever. But now with covid and the entire country on quarantine it has been hell.


Apparently his parents left to be with their less shitty kids that live in other cities and left the asshole behind. He's been throwing parties the whole mf week, but the last three days have been hell for my family and I. He blast music, he screams and hit the walls and it goes all night long. My mom and I are heavy sleepers so we've been able to sleep a couple of ours, but my sister hasn't slept at all at night. Yesterday I called the police against my mom wishes but it worked, the noise stopped.


But today it was completely out of control, he blasted music the whole day and stopped for a couple of hours just to start again at midnight, so my sister and I made my mom call the mother of the deadbeat. The lady is quite nice so she called his asshole son immediately and of course the noise stopped. The thing is, unfortunately our houses share one wall so you can hear almost everything on the other side, and we heard part of the conversation. He said we were clowns and uptight assholes, he even called his mom a slut. It was pretty insane for us (his parents are both teachers and respectable people in our town).


After that, six shots were fired. My mom refuses to believe it was him and his friends but it was pretty obvious it was them. So now my mom is fucking scared and me and my sister somewhat worried. Here in Mexico having a gun usually means you're into heavy shit. I'm feeling quite guilty about making my mom make the call and I don't know how to make this situation better.
My mom lives by herself now that we're old and we're just here because of quarantine so I feel like I just created a problem for her.
Any advice?",22May2020,1
427,"I bought a townhouse a few months ago, and coincidentally one of my co-workers owns the unit 3 doors down.  I haven't really interacted with him much on account of the quarantine, but I was just sitting on my patio having a hot chocolate when all of a sudden two of my neighbors started having a loud and possibly drunken conversation, by my estimates I suspected one of them had to be my co-worker, was hard to say for sure since he sounded drunk.

Then I started hearing some buzzwords that really caught my attention, and I started listening very carefully. It was my co-worker alright, and he was talking about our job so somebody. We work for the government, we're not supposed to tell people what we do or how we do it. He didn't give away information on anything specific, but to even be talking about any of that, I can't believe it.

It makes me feel very conflicted because I know what he did was very wrong, we swore on the bible, but I know I'm not going to rat him out either because I still like him in all honesty.",22May2020,1
428,"Hi so just to share the argument a bit
I have mental health issues (GAD mainly with a bit of depression) after my nan died, I hit a low point. I confided in two friends (call them A and B) My friendship with B has always been a bit 'rocky' while A was one of my best friends at the time. B is one of those people that makes everything about them and always have to have something extra. I told them about these issues, saying that I'm struggling and that I've had to visit the doctors to seek help. I was later told by someone other friends that A and B were discussing how I'm a 'moron and I'm making everything up.' B also suggested that she had OCD and other traumatic mental illnesses and i must admit i did make some hurtful comments (i hate myself for it now) 
Now it's been a year and I'm missing A quite a bit, B transferred to a different college so A was left alone pretty much all of last year, I'm disgusted in myself that I didn't say hello to her or even sit with her. I want to just say hello and say my side of the story and try to move on - she was a lovely friend and I had a lot of good memories with her prior to the argument.
Do you think it's sensible if I try to contact her again and just say im sorry for how i acted then and throughout college?",22May2020,1

[Long]


I had a very stressful job the past 3 1/2 years. In 2016 I started working for a startup IT-Company with 30 employees. I went from IT-assistant to Team Lead in 2 years and from Team Lead to Head Of (and superior of 36 People way older then me) a few months later. When I got the promotion the company had already grown to 10 mio rev and 200 employees and since most processes were built by me they needed me in the upper management. 
I was the second youngest employee at the company but number 5 when it came to responsibility. I loved my job and I would spend weekends and evenings with coworkers that quickly became friends. We would travel, go clubbing and have bbq. I loved my life.

In May 2018 I had a very nasty breakup with an LTR of 4 years. I found out that she cheated and then she vandalized our shared apartment and scratched my car.

Suddenly I was standing there, alone, abused and left with this mess. It took me 4 months to be able to think straight again and repair all the damage and get new furniture because I felt like crap.

Then in September 2018 I met this wonderful girl, she was a coworker, she was older than me (28) but she was just the cutest und most understanding women I have ever met. I quickly came attracted to her and we both fell in love. She eventually ended the relationship she was still in and after a few weeks we got together (way too fast I know, didn’t know better back then). It was incredible for the first 3 months until she suddenly became very sad.

She dumped me one day before New Year’s Eve in 2018 because she wasn’t over her ex. 

That’s when it started inside of me. The feeling I can’t explain. It was way worse than the other breakup. It was crippling to see her at work and I could eat, work out or leave my bed. When I was with friends my mind would constantly drift into negative or obsessive thoughts.

So my dumb ass tried to fight for her because I believed this was due to being really in love with her.

It worked. Late January 2019 we were back together. But I only got half of what we had before. She wouldn’t commit to me. So I tried to find out why and wanted to support her, she wouldn’t let me. She then dumped me again because she thought that this was pressure.
I was also often frustrated which she interpreted as anger towards her. 

The kind of frustration where you don’t say anything after being rejected or something you know? A basic human behavior in my opinion.

Well she dumped me one week after my birthday after I started an argument via text, because two months of being blamed and constantly rejected had their toll on me. It wasn’t a bad argument, I just wanted to let her know that it hurts me to be kept a secret in front of everyone and that it makes me feel bad if she doesn’t commit to me or even tells me she loves me.

When she dumped me she was cold as ice honestly. Suddenly another person. She would ignore my texts but read them. She wouldn’t even look at me when I passed her at work. 
So one text turned into 5.
I texted stuff where I explained that I wasn’t angry but frustrated, one where I told her that it’s not okay to dump someone and don’t give him an explanation why, one where I begged.. you can tell.

I could cope with the brutal rejection, literally being abandoned.

The feelings I’m trying to explain got worse, as the situation at work also got worse. Actually it already became pretty bad in December 2018 and both of us were constantly talking about the mismanagement in the company. 

But in April 2019 it got so stressful that I had to work 60+ hours a week and when I didn’t work I tried to work out or chill but I was constantly feeling as if someone is about to kill me.
It’s until this day. It’s like my body is in constant flight mode. Like I’m running from someone who wants to kill me. The worst in the morning right after waking up.

This combined with obsessive thoughts about her and being very very sad to the point where I’m literally too weak to even do the dishes. I do them eventually but much too late. 

In late April 2019 I ordered a brand new car and a friend of my suggested to go on a vacation that he then booked for us. I did this because I thought it’s going to help.

The holiday was in late May. I even installed Tinder and had at least 4 hookups with incredible beautiful girls (I think I’m a quite attractive male even though I’m short being 5‘8). I would meet them, enjoy the time, have sex but the next day I felt to empty to even reply them so I ghosted all of them.. each time. I feel very bad about this. I made me even feel worse.

When I went on the vacation I got a text from her, she was at the same island! So we agreed to meet up the second week of the vacation and spend a day together.

It was romantic as hell. I wanted her back so badly after feeling like this so I put in hours to find many beautiful secret spots and the best restaurant on the whole island. I rented a car for 2 days and picked it up the day before our date.
I bought some flowers and wrote a letter, secretly drove to her hotel and paid the reception a few bucks so they would hand it to her just when she finished breakfast the next day. 

The date itself, the whole day, was amazing. It was the best day of my life. All the things I’ve seen the food I’ve eating the songs we’ve sung together in the car or the songs, or when we were watching the sunset and I started playing the ukulele I brought with me and we sat there singing „can you feel the love tonight“ from lion king. Both of us are capable of amazing vocals because she was in theater and I was raised with music and had several vocal coaches.
The rest is story..

I still think back to this.

We got back together and she told me she’s going to commit to me and introduce me to everyone if it goes good for a while, I agreed because I was even more obsessed at this point.

It went on, days, weeks, months, she would spend most of the week meeting her nephew, some of her girls and then take 1-3 days a week to spend the evening with me. That’s all I got.

The job became so bad that I would have stomachache in the morning literally stomachache. I got reflux, smoked so much I even finally earned the sleep apnea. I lost my muscle definition and even more hair on my head (stress related hairloss + alopecia).

This went on until November 2019. I would treat her good, better than she probably deserved. I helped her move to a new apartment, made her „handmade“ furniture and a lamp she couldn’t afford to buy that I then spend 18 hours designing and building to make her happy (looked better than the original in the end). I’m quite good at DIY stuff.  I wrote her lovely texts, we had amazing sex that even became kinky and she seemed pretty happy.

But I wasn’t. I was still waiting for her to commit to me or tell me she loves me. I had been waiting for her to process the last relationship, I had been waiting for months, I did so much for her. I think she felt it, felt that I became quiet.
She then again interpreted my silence as anger.

She would ask me what’s wrong with me and I told her about the things at work. Sometimes I was angrily talking about work for an hour but she wouldn’t answer or give an advice but just be quiet. I didn’t realize because I was happy to vent.

I booked a hairtransplant for December 2019 in turkey for the same reason I got on a vacation and bought a car. To solve a problem, to feel alive again. I wanted to feel something. I wanted to have nice hair again because I thought I will feel better if alopecia won’t bother me anymore.

I quit my job the last week of November with a notice of 3 months and that let to terror because many people would not accept that I’m leaving. 
I got another and better paid job in less then a week.

The old company would constantly try to blame or bait me. Stuff like „you will never find a job like that again“ „don’t you dare to ever try to come back if you leave once“ „we will sue you for xy“.

But I stood to my decision. They then offered to release me with pay from the 15th of December on and I agreed. I think they couldn’t stand me anymore and wanted to get rid of me.

Some of these days I thought about dying. I literally would drive on the highway, start speeding and thought about hitting the next tree or wall. I don’t know what this was but I think it was just too much.

When I was with her she would constantly be angry or quiet.

The hairtransplant by the way was a nightmare, I did that completely alone and didn’t understand a thing they said. (But hey looking at it now it was a great decision)

When she saw the wounds at the back of my head she started crying and told me stuff like „why would you do something like that“ she literally blamed me for doing that lol? It’s my head I didn’t care. Didn’t hurt though.

Well a week after that she invited me over (22nd of December) to sleep at her place. She planned Christmas with me and New Year’s Eve. When I was at her place I realized I need to pick up some groceries for the meal we wanted to cook. She took a nap and I went shopping. When I came back an hour later her car war gone and nobody was there.

I soon found out she had a „panic attack“.
She left me seating there knowing nothing about what’s up with her. I called a few friends to calmn me down etc.

2 hours later she dumped me because I was “constantly aggressive, unhappy and emotionally abusing her”.  I saw the madness in her eyes, I saw that she was really afraid of leaving me, I saw it wasn’t staged, that she was really out of her mind. I don’t know what happened, I knew she had anxiety issues for years at that point, I knew she had been through a lot of stress at work too. I hugged her, she pushed me away and I hit a glass full of water with my elbow on the table behind me. For sure it fell on the floor.
That’s when she stared screaming “please don’t hurt me”, suddenly the door opened and two of her friends came in and kicked me out of the apartment. 

I don’t know if I abused her or what ever in her eyes. To be honest I was never verbally or emotionally abusing her, just venting about work sometimes because it was a hard time. I spend hours googling and researching if I’m crazy.


What happened afterwards? She blocked me everywhere. And I spend two and a half months at home sitting on my ass until the new job would start. I would lay in bed until 12, shower, eat and then workout. 

I got quite big again and gained almost all the muscle back I had lost in 2019. But when I spend time with friends I couldn’t enjoy anything. All I thought about was that I wanted to go home again and lay in my bed.

My apartment became extremely messy but when I met friends I would be groomed and dressed nicely. I hid it. But I was ashamed about what I did with my apartment. It was disgusting.
I know this wasn’t okay but I didn’t have any energy. You can’t imagine how hard it even was to drive to the gym, do grocery shopping or shower. I feel so disgusted by myself but I swear it was so hard to do these simple things.

In March I started my new job and it felt pretty good to get out of my apartment again and meet new people. Well that was like a vacation for two weeks then the corona lockdown came.

I was fired within a week, burned through most of my savings in one month (car, food and rent). Started to work as a freelancer and got a few leads. 

 I developed a webproject and mobile app for people suffering from lockdown and quarantine. A web portal where people could offer and find help. It got me into national TV, radio, newspapers. I wanted to feel something and in taoismn I read that doing good things will make me feel something. 

Guess what? I wasn’t even nervous when I was in TV or interviewed by the radio stations. I felt nothing. If I felt anything, it was anxiety in the morning and being very sad for the whole day. But the projects occupied me and when I put my linked in in the imprint companies contacted me to do stuff for them.

My ex got wind of that and contacted me through Instagram. 

I thought my life is turning around. We had contact every day for three weeks, when they allowed it we went on long walks, video calls, we talked about everything and I was okay with what happened. Her explanations about anxiety and childhood traumas made sense. Her saying she’s in therapy gave me comfort.

And then? Out of the blue she rejected me and told me „I can never be in a relationship with you  again“ „I need to go now but it‘s great we’re on good terms now“.

I feel as if she only wanted to not feel guilty anymore and used me when she felt lonely during quarantine.

I want to die now.. I got my job back btw. Homeoffice and 4 Hours a day. 

Oh and my flat is a mess again and all I feel 24/7 is emptiness and I feel as if I’m haunted by demons.

Yesterday I was walking down a street and imagined being dead.

Because my life has never been happy. I always worked my ass off to have things others are privileged. I was bullied as a child, my mom is a narcissist and I don’t have any contact to her except for sometimes meeting her when I visit my dad. You know why I was bullied? I always stood up for my little brother who has aspergers.

I was always skinny, short and an easy target until I spend years building the muscle I have on my frame now. 

And the worst is? I never had money. Couldn’t go on university, couldn’t travel a lot. Nothing.
I lost many friends in my teens because I simply couldn’t live the same lifestyle.
That’s why I burned myself out at the last job because they paid decently and I could suddenly afford stuff like a new car and a nice apartment, clothes, Nike sneakers and watches. Could go on vacations. That’s why.

And why did I put so much into my last relationship? Because I loved her and I thought if I only do enough she is not to abandon me.
There have been many women in my live so far. I’m extroverted and I like a challenge, I guess they perceive me as very confident even if I’m not. 

But being loved? Like really loved the same way I loved my ex? That never happened.


I don’t know how to get out of this. Where to start in my messy flat, how to get help in system where you’re screamed at on the phone if you ask for a therapist, with waitinglists up to 2 years only to get therapy or an examination. Something is clearly wrong with me I mean I don’t feel anything expect for anxiety or sadness.

I don’t know if I can ever get over my ex. Even imagining she’s with someone new kills me on the inside. She’s in her late twenties. The next one is gonna marry her, they’ll have children. That’s another level than the breakups I had.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I always do good things, treat people well, work my ass off, dress well, groom myself, watch for my health but I don’t seem to be enough for this society.

434,"Sorry for the long story. 

So my uncle (let’s call him Jerry) is my dad’s younger brother and moved to an Asian country in 2016. There he got married than divorced, and in March 2020, he got a letter saying he had to leave the country before the end of April or he would be sent to jail. 
He called my grandmother, his mother (let’s call her Karen) who lives in Morocco whose borders had just closed for everyone because of Covid-19. And she told him to call my dad to ask him to stay at our house (we live in a European country where he could come to). Keep in mind Jerry hadn’t spoken to my dad or any of us once in the 4 years he was there, because he was mad at my dad who told him it wasn’t a good idea to move to Asia before he left, but he spoke to his mother every single day. 
My dad told Jerry he could stay at our house when he got back until Morocco’s borders open again, then had to force his mother to buy Jerry a plane ticket to get home because Jerry had no money left but she didn’t want to buy him one.

So he’s been staying with us for over a month now.
My parents have done everything for him since he got back, they gave him a phone, have been cooking his meals everyday, doing his laundry, and obviously giving him a place to stay. I helped him set an online bank account because when he got back, his bank account had been shut down for some stuff he stopped paying when left. Jerry decided to ask his uncle and aunt to pay for his debts. My dad found out about it and told Jerry that’s not how life works, and he shouldn’t ask people for money like their mom Karen does (all my grandmother does is try to get money from people, so my dad and her don’t get along, while my uncle does the same as her). Jerry lied to my dad’s face saying he never asked for the money, that the bank sorted him out, which obviously wasn’t true because my dad found out from his uncle and aunt who told him they payed Jerry’s debts.

It’s pretty much unbearable to have him here, he does absolutely nothing to help around the house, makes a mess everywhere (he does weird stuff like not flushing the toilet, cutting his nails but just leaving them somewhere for us to find, or puts water everywhere in the bathroom when he takes a shower). Whenever we ask him to do the smallest thing to help, like pick up the crumbs on the kitchen table or do the dishes, he always does such a bad job we have to do it again after him anyway, and when he’s done he says ""you’re welcome"" expecting multiple ""thank you"" from us, yet he’s never thanked my parents once since he’s been here.

We find out every couple of days from other family members that he speaks to them on a daily basis, telling them my parents are mean to him, are humiliating him in front of my sibling and I, and some other stuff he makes up. 

I know he’s in a tough spot in his life, he’s basically homeless, has no job and no money, but he’s so ungrateful to my parents, is useless around the house, is annoying as hell, pretends everything’s cool when he only started speaking to my dad again because he needed something from him, and lies all the time to my parents who are only trying to help him. 

We are just waiting for the Moroccan borders to open again. He says he doesn’t want to go, telling us he can’t stand his parents yet he speaks to Karen every single day and only listens to her. She manipulates him, and apparently has been saying now that she can’t have him live with her because she’s too old (she’s in her 70s and in perfect shape). We have no idea when the borders will open again, and if they do, my parents will have to try to convince him to leave. 

I just want advice to deal with him or a way to get his ass back to Morocco as soon as possible (he’s not a Moroccan citizen).",22May2020,1

But I don't like it, I suck at making phone calls, there's like 100 things you have to remember if someone makes a reservation and I'm not good when it comes to remembering things. I'm also really bad at walking with a tray and I don't like it because it's usually really busy and gives me stress and because of that I make a lot of mistakes.

441,"So my partner(25M) of 4 years has had a really tough year as he nearly lost his eyesight after being assaulted. He’s slowly recovers but was in out out of hospital for a few months for check ups and surgeries. 

Besides all this happening he will have completed his last assignment for his BEng on Wednesday. I wanted to do something nice for him especially since I haven’t seen him since February due to lock down and us both being in different cities. my only problem is I can’t think of anything and have a budget of around £200, any ideas? It’ll have to be something that can be delivered as I won’t be able to see him face to face. 

Background: He’s on a keto diet so It’s a bit hard to get anything food related unless it’s sugar free and low in carbs. He’s allergic to flowers and I feel like he deserves a lot more then flowers and chocolates. He loves cars and motorcycles and isn’t a massive drinker. He has very sensitive skin but loves face masks if he doesn’t react to them.",22May2020,1
442,"My boyfriend of 2 years, Best friend of 4 years, and the Father of our beautiful babygirl since March (So two months) has been starting the process of enlisting in the military. 

I am very supportive of this discision, We have had some minor issues in the past. He has cheated on me about 3 times but those stitches are healed. He was very overwhelmed and against the idea of having to be a father, But now he absolutely loves our daughter and has been glowing with her and just an amazing dad. He struggles alot with his depression, as do I. But Our relationship feels stronger than ever and he seems very driven to work hard to give us a good life. 

He said hes been pondering the idea of joining the military for awhile but never really dived into the thought process. Hes leaning towards Underwater welding and is excited to do something cool and hands on. I look forward to him being able to work in a field he will potentially enjoy and be able to feel acomplished in his work. Hes very smart and has so much potential, Id much rather this route than to watch him waste away and not use his smart brain for something worth it ya know?

But I am so worried..
For his safety, Its some physical work and has potential to get very risky and dangerous, Is there a way to ease the worry for his safety?

For the time he will spend away, Hes going to miss out on hunks of time with our daughter, They say the first year is the most crucial in a childs life. Thats when they truly start to become people, Will that impact her negatively? 

What if he finds someone while away he fancies while Im at home raising our daughter missing him like crazy counting the days til hes home, and then he wants to go be with them instead of come home t me? Is there good ways to prevent any fading for our relationship?  Ive read so many horror stories of these couples that fall apart and find others while away in the military, And although I have confidence in our relationship. Those thoughts linger and I get so sad. 

When we talk about it hes like ""Ill be anti social most likely"" , ""Im gonna be so exhausted from phsyical labor i wont even have the energy for people"", ""Im gomna be focused on doing the work and my own thing so I can just be done and come home to you"" Etc. So he seems pretty deadset on just doing his thing and getting shit done. No desire to fuck around and drag ass. 

But all these stories are going to my head and I just dont want him leaving to change us in any negative way. 

How do I help the worry and do my best to prevent anything from falling apart?",22May2020,1

449,"Im gonna say it - my dad's been what I would consider emotionally abusing my mom for the last few weeks. She is a housewife who recently started working again during quarantine. I hugely support my mom becoming independent but not so much my dad. He claims she's too busy to do anything nowadays and picks at whatever she does wrong or forgets in a passive aggressive way. To me she's doing nothing wrong, she's working, keeping the house clean, and feeding everyone. She's also going through pre menopausal depression and he keeps threatening to leave since he can't deal with how emotionally fragile she is. I often wake up to them fighting and then my mom cries. She recently cried on my birthday as well, out of frustration. He refuses to eat what she makes for him. To give you an idea of what he's doing: if she makes food and it goes to waste because he doesn't eat it, she gets taunted that she's wasting food, and if she doesn't make anything for him she doesn't care about him. I can see her being driven crazy and she is truly trying to make things better, and he claims he's tired of trying and will find someone new in 6 months.
He's pretty nice to me and my younger brother but it's hard to ignore the stress he's giving my mother. I'm very attached to her and I'm scared she'll suffer from another stroke, this time more serious. He taunts her a lot, and I have to bite my tongue to stop myself from saying anything, because he takes his anger out on her. My mom spoke to her parents about the problems because she couldn't keep it in and her parents took her side and asked my dad why he's behaving like this etc. Well he didn't like that and told her to stop talking to them. 
So, I know people are gonna tell me to not involve myself in this or that it's not my problem but it is when your mom comes to you with suicidal thoughts. Ik it might be wrong on her part to tell me things but I really REALLY can't blame her. 
I'm scared they're going to divorce. I don't know anyone who's been through a similar process, and I live in metropolitan india so it's kind of a taboo I guess. He has said some horrendous things to her, like that he'd rather she have cancer, at least that's not emotionally draining. 
No one knows why he's behaving this way and he won't explain his behaviour or tell my mom what she's done wrong so she can fix it. He's causing her and me pain as well, my mother is so sweet and she's my best friend. She has raised both of us with so much love and car. She doesn't deserve this I feel. What do I do?",22May2020,1

453,"Hi. So I (17f) have been with my bf (17m) a month and we’re in a ldr. 

My bf has depression which means he will go days without speaking to me, which I do understand because I get how hard it is to do anything when ur in a really depressed state. And those days aren’t really the problem as much, they sort of just add to it, so he is constantly on his PS4. Which leads to no replies obviously. And we used to ft every night when we first met, and now I’m lucky if we even ft once a week and we’ve only been together a month. When we do ft he always talks about how lucky I should feel cos he just wants to play COD all the time. And that makes me feel rubbish and I’ve told him that but he keeps saying it.

On an average day I’ll probably get about 4 sc from him spread over the space of the whole day, and maybe a 5 minute call of him telling me about how great he is at COD until he gets bored and hangs up. However, I’ve noticed that when he wants something his replies are a whole lot faster. For example, since we’re ldr we send pics and stuff in that nature right, which is fine to me. But after HES finished he will go “I’m going for a shower” and then will disappear for 5 hours. 

One red flag, I think, was when he was trying to pressure me to send him pics of my boobs. So I’ve only sent him pics in my bras doing stuff because that’s what I feel comfortable with. And it first started with begging, which I told him no but in a jokey way as to not ruin the mood. But after I’d told him no about 5 times he said “if I loved me you’d do it”. And I completely shut that down I messaged him saying how much of a disgusting of a thing that is to say etc and he hasn’t done it since. 

It’s just annoying cos some days he’ll treat me absolutely great and will call me in the day and at night, and tell me how much he loves me etc, it’s just that those days don’t come very often. Probably once a week maybe even once every two weeks and all I get other than that is silence.
And I have told him about how much it bothers me when he doesn’t reply, he apologises changes his ways for a day then goes right back to it.

But yeh I do love him at the end of the day and he tells me he loves me. I don’t think there’s a chance he’s speaking to other people, I just think he’s rubbish at using his phone. But I don’t know how much longer I can last being in a relationship with someone who can’t even give me attention.

454,"So I recently got out of a 2 year relationship in which we literally shared everything and I'm trying to find new hobbies I can dive into.

Reading, coffee, gaming, whisky, bass, guitar(, Netflix) and cooking are out of the question since they wouldn't be new to me.

Also I'm a poor coolege student with depression and severe back pain, so I can't really do much sport or something expensive.

Yes, all of the hobbies above are still fun but I need something new to call ""mine"" instead of trying to ""to get back"" the stuff we used to do together.

I'm kind of interested in plants and bowshooting (I don't know the correct term). Both of these things seem to be not on the cheapest side though.

457,"I (28yo) have been with my current organization for close to 3 years now, and have had the same supervisor (40+yo) since my first day. I work in a big company of over 1,000 employees, and it is very hierarchical now. Despite that my supervisor and I have a great working relationship (close enough to share about our families) and he is very appreciative of the efforts I put in. At the start of every year, he has gifted me with appreciation/encouragement gifts. They usually cost $200~$300. I accepted them as they were not extravagant. 

I recently wanted to buy a new laptop for personal use and he offered to ask one of his friends who works for the brand for a discounted rate. This morning, he dropped me a message saying that he could get a discount, and he would pay for the laptop as my early birthday gift. The laptop retails at $2k.

My mum insists that I pay him back for it and I broached this with him as well as it is just too expensive of a gift. He does not want me to pay him back.

I was intending to pay for this purchase over a couple of months/a year. Giving him a sum of money upfront now is possible but I will need to tighten my belt for the immediate future. He will most likely just wire the money back to me as well.

I might need to add that I was recently looking casually for a new job, and he was aware about it as I needed him to stand as my reference. Not sure if this had any bearings on him wanting to ""tie me down"". I also just heard back from the other organization and I'm turning down the offer.

465,"recently my (f25) best friend (f25) has been really off with me since I started seeing my boyfriend (25). We have all been in the same friendship groups since school, I have had other friends since, and she has lots of other friends too but we have that kind of friendship where no matter what we were always very close. Last year I started seeing one of the boys (25) in our friendship group. We never saw it coming and had never even thought of eachother in this way but we absolutely fell for eachother and are still very happy to this day. However, since we have been together she has been really off with me, cancelling plans and ignoring all of my messages. I have asked her many times what’s going on to talk about it but she never seems to be able to tell me what it is that I have done wrong. I reached out to her one last time because I couldn’t imagine us not being friends, and I wanted to fix whatever it was but she was making lousy excuses and was being quite immature. I am a nurse and see horrible things every day, so I just don’t tolerate childish behaviour. So we have not spoken since. I don’t think she likes my boyfriend more than a friend because she currently lives with her boyfriend. 

What I am struggling with is that I have lost a very good friend of many years, and haven’t had the closure to why this is. I’m worried that I will be pushed out of the group which is a horrible feeling. But my main problem is that she is constantly texting and wanting to meet up with my boyfriend. I understand they are still friends, but it’s really hard for me when he tells me he is seeing her because I still don’t get what I have done wrong. I feel like I am back at school and I don’t know whether what I feel is anxiety or jealousy. Every time he is with her I get so anxious and I’m not sure why. We would always do everything together as a group, and now I’m the one not invited. He knows I am really upset by our fallout but I can’t expect him to not be friends with her just because she doesn’t want to be friends with me any more. They have been friends just as long as I was with her. 

I’m wondering if anyone has ever been in a similar situation, and how I can deal with this. How can I stop myself from feeling so anxious every time they meet up?  I really don’t want to end up losing my boyfriend over this and I worry that I will say something to him about it and it will come out wrong.

My neighbourhood is currently under reconstruction because the city council decided to demolish an old apartment building from the 1950's. Since it was still occupied by people they had to move these people elsewhere.
Unfortunately they also moved one family which often cause trouble to an apartment building right across my street.

Now these troublemakers have a clear view to my kitchen and living room since they live on 3rd floor like me. I don't have blinds on my kitchen windows so I can't even block their view. I often see them looking at me while I eat in the kitchen because they sit next to their window most of the day. The distance between our windows is maybe 70 metres so I'm not sure how much can they see. I recently started to have a feeling that they are maybe recording me and making fun of me.

we hit it off a little and exchanged snaps.
We’ve talked on and off but this connection i’ve never felt ever before in my life. It feels like i know him already, i feel so comfortable talking to him, i feel this strange weird attraction to him. 

Trust me i’ve tried my hardest to get over him and not think about him because it’s so on and off with talking to him but the same feelings never go away. I usually never get attached to people but for some reason, I feel this emotional AND physical attraction when i still don’t really know him. I was reading about soulmates and i mean this sounds like a soulmate situation??

This connection i feel blows my mind because i mean we have the same exact birthday, same fav color, kind of the same mindset. I also did a tarot reading (i don’t even know if those are real) but what the cards said was exactly SO ACCURATE, and basically saying this person loves me and has love for me but they’re not ready in their sense yet or whatever...

And when i heard the love i was like ?? Love?? LOVE?? how could he love me if we only have talked for a few months..but i really thought about it and my feelings for him feel like love...like i love him...that’s how deep and strong this connection...i just really want to know how he feels about me too... oh and keep in mind we haven’t hung out in person yet..!!!

what does this sound like? am i crazy or can anyone relate to this? or give me something ? i’ve been praying to god about this and i don’t know what’s right or not

474,"I’ve been living with my GF and two other roommates for the last six-months-ish. My GF is irritated at roommates for not being respectful of her stuff, and wants to move out. I’m fine with this, I don’t begrudge her this choice. However she’s always talking about moving out with me, and finding two-person apartments together. I’ve been wanting my own place for a while now, just so I can have my own space. 

The real problem is when finances come into it. She lost her job because of coronavirus, so she’s making just about enough to cover 500$ rent through side hustles. She keeps saying she’s not happy living here, but the only way she’ll be able to move out is if I go with her and split rent. 

I feel like if I just move into my own place I’m stranding her somewhere she doesn’t want to be, but I also feel like I should have the right at my age (21) to have the freedom to live where I want.

475,"Background:I have a wife and one kid.

This  kicked off a few years ago. I left for a month of training and the  house was in pretty decent shape. I came back and the house was a  hazard. My wife had used an axe to open two doors because she couldn't  open them and refused to call anyone for help. Additionally, plates in  the sink were stacked and disgustingly dirty. There was mold growing on  multiple plates and in multiple bottles. The rest of the house looks  ransacked. Glad to be home, bit my tongue and didn't say anything. I  immediately got to helping her clean. The entire time she's telling me  to just leave and she'll handle it. I continue trudging along with a  smile saying not to worry about it. It gets back to where it was.

Fast  forward, I have to leave for another month for training. I return, but  this time I have someone drop me off. She flips out on me because she  doesn't want them in the house. They just drop me off. Walk in, and low  and behold, it's a pig pen. Again, I shrug it off, get to cleaning.  Smile, everything's ok.

I deploy.  Gone for a year. We nearly divorced while overseas, but managed to  bandage it up and we made plans to go forward. Get home. Now I've been  in a few houses that I've had to call child services on. I should've  called them then. Everything is disgusting. I found dishes under the  couch with its own ecosystem. Diapers dirty and scattered about. I  smile, shrug it off. Proceed with life plans. To include having baby #2.  Yay pregnant.

Two months later, more training. Come back, and low and behold. Scenario repeats.

Corona  hits. Wife loses job but luckily I'll be able to afford everything  until November ish. I'll be in contact with people who have Corona. We  clear out a room and I setup a self isolation room. Everything I eat I  buy out of the house save for leftovers she wants me to get rid of.  Acceptable losses. Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago. I'm allowed  back down because she returns to work. I Catch up on chores! Clean,  smile and shrug. I start doing the dishes at some point and it takes  three loads in the dish washer to get to the bottom. There's trash in  the sink spread throughout, and plates still have food on them. Some of  the plates I recognize as being from dinner BEFORE I was in isolation.  Moldy disgusting stuff. I finally get to the bottom of the sink and am  about to clean it up. Then I realize there an inch... An entire inch of  sludge in the sink, watery squishy moldy sludge. I say screw it, change  into clothes to go for a run.

She  pressures me as to why I’m leaving. I tell her cause I need to blow off  steam. She keeps digging. Finally I inform her that she's disgusting and  if she keeps it up I'm leaving her because there's no reason for it.  She says it's cause she's tired and depressed. I tell her I'll give her a  chance to fix it but don't give her a time line.

Today - I'm still so disgusted with her I'm thinking of saying screw it and divorce anyways. I need help.",22May2020,1
476,"Hey, I'd really appreciate it if you read until the end and gave me some advice. I'm really stuck and have no idea what to do.

Pieces of context that all matter:

A couple months back my father and mother were going through a hard time. I thought my dad was 100% in the wrong, and I fully supported my mom through it. We go to our grandmas house biweekly and sleep there for one night because my dad forces us. I love grandma, but I don't like staying there for the weekend every other week. There is nothing there for me to do, no hobbies to practice, and I can't even complete any schoolwork.

Non-context part of post:

While they were going through that time, my dad was trying to buy me off to his side, and my mom, well I was already on her side. I fully trusted her and I loved and cherished her, meanwhile I withheld strong apathy for my dad. One day, before we were going to leave to my grandmas house for our biweekly trip, I asked my dad if I really had to go to grandmas on that day. He suddenly started raising his voice and yelling, he took my little brother, packed up both of their things, and stormed off. Him and my mom had a screaming match on our front-door, because she refused to leave as well. She stood up for me, and that's why I loved her.

But, then while my mom was talking to my aunt on her phone, she suddenly had an ""epiphany"". Our dad didn't feel loved enough and it was our fault. We had to take a taxi to my grandmas house and show him that we love him. I was strongly opposed to this idea. Not only did I already hate my father and was glad that he left, I felt free and almost joyful. Whenever my father is not involved in my daily life for more than 2 days, I suddenly start feeling much better about myself, and I start being much more productive, social, etc. But whenever he comes back I greet him with a fake smile, and I immediately go back to moping around the house all day. At that point, his mere presence was a burden to me.

She spent an hour following me around, telling me how serious this was, how we could solve everything right now. In the end I caved in. I trusted her after all, she said everything would be accounted for, would be addressed. We took a taxi all the way from one city to another to get to my grandmas house. When we arrived, my mom and my dad hugged. My little brother was incredibly happy. I thought that everything was coming together.

But, it didn't.

It's been a month since we took the taxi. My dad and my mom take weekly Zoom therapy sessions, and they seem like they used to a year ago. Turns out my mom was partially right, my dad was acting up because he didn't feel loved by my mom and I. But, it also turns out that, surprise surprise, even when my dad isn't acting up, he is an irritating asshole with anger issues. He never apologized to me, and went from trying to buy me off to being an angry POS again. Yesterday we went to my grandmas house. I was told we'd just stay for a few hours and go. But, my dad suddenly changed his plans, and said we were going to stay there for 2 days. I was obviously livid, but as usual, I couldn't express any negative emotions towards his decisions, because it would be met with yelling. This is why I didn't want my dad to be involved in my life at all, because he always suppresses me.

I told my mom about this, the person that I trusted the most. I told her how I can never express my emotions to him. But, my mom didn't want to listen to me. Now that she and my dad had made up, she didn't need to treat me kindly anymore. She was indifferent to my problem, and said in an annoyed voice ""it's just 2 days"" and walked off. That was never my point in the first place, but the fact that before she'd take my issues with the family so seriously, and now she was giving half-assed annoyed answers and walking off was devastating.

She came back 5 minutes later and asked how her new dress looked like nothing happen. I told her that she had used me to make up with my dad, when I rode the taxi with her and fake hugged my dad it made him feel better, but that was the opposite of what I wanted to achieve. And I told her how she is now acting completely indifferent to any emotions or feelings I try to express. All I got for an answer was ""You can think that, but it's not true"". I told her I wasn't talking to her or my dad until I got my apology for everything that my dad has done. A kid should never be hit for expressing his concerns, but my mom suddenly is now acting like it is the norm and has always been the norm.

What do I do now? I'm stuck, I have no one to trust. Don't recommend a therapist or anything like that, because there is no chance that I can get one right now obviously. I'm 14 and dependent off of 2 people who don't care about me and manipulate/use me as they like.",22May2020,1

480,"This is long, I put a Tl;Dr 

My life is an absolute rollercoaster. I (19F) had been dating my ex (20MTF) for about 4 months. Things were pretty nice for the most part, we loved each other a lot and we didnt have many issues until I found out I had to leave college and she invited me to live with her and her mother. I accepted, as my home life wasn't good at all. She was amazing to me, showed me a lot of care and treated me well. She had struggled with substance abuse for a while but I did my best to get her to stop abusing those things as much. I really, truly loved her. 

Things started going badly about a month into that, she started neglecting me, started drinking and smoking way more and my mental health started to spiral out of control. I suffer from depression and paranoid schizophrenia but it was never this bad until the isolation happened. I ended up overdosing, but I threw up quickly after because I felt terrible for doing it. I admitted it to my ex, and she was understanding at the time, but I stopped taking all my meds because I was paranoid I'd do it again. Needless to say, I got worse. I ended up smashing my head against the wall a few times because I couldn't handle what I heard in my head. I was just an absolute mess, which isn't an excuse at all but it got worse because she started texting and flirting with her ex which made me break down even harder. She had left to go to the store but didn't tell me she was back, and I went downstairs while she was on the phone with her ex and it was hard as I was really just worried. I didn't realize how bad I had become, which makes sense as to why my relationship kinda got ruined mostly by me. 

That morning I told her I'd take my meds, and that was that. I wasn't doing well that day, ended up drinking a few beers and then some rum. She came home, and asked me angrily how much I drank. In that moment, I decided to lie about the amount. Not entirely sure why, I felt scared and I'd always lie out of habit due to my past experiences at home. She looked at the bottle, and got really mad with me for drinking her alcohol and then lying about it. She told me I couldn't stay there anymore and I needed to leave. 

Then we broke up a few weeks ago, and she was extremely cold and didn't even want to look at me. She said I had to leave but she'd take me wherever I needed. It was really hard, especially because things were fine only a few days prior. I found a place to go with another one of my ex's. She decided she was gonna go visit the girl she was flirting with who lived several hours away but it was on the way to my hometown. We left a few days earlier than she wanted because I couldn't handle being around her for even that long, I just offered to pay for gas. She just was completely cold, even though I probably deserved it. 

It was hard on both of us. I stopped eating and sleeping because of pain and anxiety, and I wanted to leave desperately. We left, and halfway we got McDonald's and sat in a field. We still loved each other at the time and had a heartfelt conversation, she buried a lighter in the ground telling me how we'd come back for it when we loved each other again either as friends or lovers, but she had hope for our relationship. 

She dropped me off with my ex and her girlfriend, it was really hard because I didnt have much and was living on a couch. The person I was staying with kept trying to touch me and made provocative comments towards me, which sucked too. I just kept going outside and slept on a bench instead because it was better than the other place. Some guy threw a rock at my head so now I have a lovely mark. My ex by a few days later on her way to see the girl she was gonna see, I guess they were gonna drink and get high. She realized how miserable I was, and that the place I was at wasn't safe at all after she asked about the mark on my face. 

 She asked me to come home. 
To her home.

You kick me out? And want me to come back again? What?

I said I'd think about it, if things kept getting worse. She left and spent 3 days with that girl, and came back to visit me again after. She said she wanted to be in a relationship again, and try to make things better. I didnt have shit to lose anyway so I said fuck it and went. 

I have no idea why she even bothered because we broke up again, it was obvious she didnt love or care about me and I kept trying to get her to admit that and she finally did yesterday. She had downloaded all dating apps including grindr and hardly told anyone we got back together, shit was hard. The night before, we hung out with a friend of ours and she drank and smoked a shit ton. I ended up vomiting and the scab on my face bled because I scratched it and all she said was ""You hit your head on purpose again."" My friend was deeply concerned about me, but she wasnt at all. He told her that there was, in fact, a little bit of blood around an open scab and she didnt say a thing. She got up and left, and we couldn't find her. I took her phone with me when we walked around looking, and eventually we got back and she said she just fell asleep in her car and all she wanted was her phone back and didnt understand why we were worried. I saw that it truly was over after that

I realized that I had made a mistake coming back. I tried my best to make things easier but she didnt try at all. The damage had already been done and yesterday she finally said she doesnt feel the same way about me and that I should leave. Again.

I didnt know what to say because she was instantly cold again, so I got up and ran outside without taking anything with me. I kept going into a park, through trees and eventually falling face first into a creek that I didnt see. I managed to get back out, but my face and hands are fucked now. I stumbled back, and passed out on her floor. She was just mad at me for running away and told me to leave her alone so I just kinda left again. 

I don't have anywhere else to go, I made a lot of questionable choices but I'm not sure what the fuck to do. Friend couldn't let me come over but we got a hotel room to chill together for the night.

I fucked up, I'm an absolute mess and I take responsibility for what happened. I just don't know where to go from here, I'm absolutely lost. Broke, sad and alone.. in a pandemic. What do I do?

TL;Dr

484,"Tl;dr at the end 

My boyfriend and I are together 5 years - I’ve never had reason not to trust him prior to the last 6-8 weeks when he started acting distant and different to usual. I know it was a massive breach of trust but I went through his phone while he was sleeping expecting to find nothing and put my worries behind me. I regret doing it now and violating his trust like that, but nonetheless I found explicit snapchat messages (not images, just written messages). 

One was to a well known pornstar, another was to account that was sending nudes (he had saved them in the chat but they appeared to be of different girls in many of the images), and 2 more were to female accounts that had not replied but the messages were explicit so I presume they’re similar types of accounts although I have no proof. 

I don’t have a problem with him watching porn- it’s normal in our relationship. However this takes things a step too far for me. It doesn’t seem to have gone on too long with him messaging each account for only one day. I’m not too worried about the current messages but I’m afraid I’m no longer enough for him and this may be the beginning of him cheating in a more serious way. 

Is it worth bringing this up to my boyfriend considering I also breached his trust by looking through his phone? Is this really cheating or is it something minor that’s not a cause for concern? Is it likely that over time he may be tempted to take this further, perhaps messaging girls he may actually meet up with IRL or getting with a girl on nights out?

I was ecstatic and I am so grateful to them for it. 

But lately I have been having some issues with the tank temperature and feeding can be difficult as this tank stands almost as tall as me, which meant I needed to get a stool to stand just so i could reach the bottom of the tank to feed him his worms. I have also read on a website that deep tanks make it difficult for them to come up for air. Now I'm seriously wondering if i should be buying myself a 40 dollar long tank to replace the deep one. But i know how much money my family spent to get me that tank and I'd hate to disappoint them but I also want to look out for the health of my axie. I'm sure he would be fine in the deep tank as I've had him in there for months with no issues. But I know that the longer tank might be easier to handle and better overall for him.

It seems to me like the current regulations are unessesarily forcing singletons to remain single and celibate, which is not good for our mental health.

It's very easy for those living with their partners to criticise, and maybe I would if I were in the situation, but I feel like they're forgetting what it's like to be single, and unless they've been in prison are unlikely to know what it's like not to have any prospect of consummating a relationship!

I'm not advocating a complete removal of restrictions, far from it. But a path back to something that resembles normality while sustainably reducing risk would surely be a realistic place to be.

How are people approaching this issue in their situations? Do people have any advice regarding broaching this topic with a socially distanced date?",22May2020,1
505,"My grandma died a couple hours ago.

She lives overseas, usually we visit in the summer for a month or so. She has like 11 children, and about 45 grandchildren. Half here and half there 

Usually I only call every couple of months. I was telling myself a few days ago that it's been a while and I should probably call. Then she was hospitalized and died today.

I don't know if it's unreasonable to feel guilty about this. I love her and she's so good to me when I visit. Yet I couldn't even be bothered to call her more than I did (although tbh my social anxiety is a factor behind this). Given that she has 45 grandchildren I'm not sure how much thought she gave me, but I still can't help but think how she may have died being upset that I didn't call her enough. 

Any advice helps thanks",22May2020,1
506,"I’m posting here because I’m really lost on how to help my mum.
It’s long read so my very sorry and I’m pretty emotional right now so I really do apologise for grammar and spelling errors and of it doesn’t flow smoothly.

You need some backstory here to explain our relationship then her relationship with my grandmother, so I’ll start with mine (B) and hers (N).
I’m the 2nd oldest of 5 kids and the oldest girl out of 2, we have had a very strict but loving relationship for as long as I can remember. When I was 14 by younger siblings father passed away suddenly and it caused a huge divide in the family. His death and divide fused my mum to fall into depression. 
She did well for a awhile healing but around 2 years after my older brother by 6 years decided he no longer wanted his side of the family involved in his kids lives.
It shattered my mum to be torn away from her grandchildren and this combined with a case of sever workplace billing lead to the brink of suicide.
Over these years I took it upon myself to look after the younger kids, raise them and be the mother because she couldn’t be. I played her support person as she emotional leant on me and I player therapist for a long time.
Now 9 years later after all this but mum is better and has gotten the help she needed, I no longer play the partner role but occasionally take over when I need to.
So in all she leans on me when she needs to and vice verse.
Well tonight is one these occasions.

She came home from work late and noticeably upset and she revealed that her mother got in contact with her to tell her that she has bone cancer and wanted to see my mum before she dies as she ‘has some things to get off her chest so she can go to heaven with a clear conscious.’

Her relationship with N has been near nonexistent since N left home at 15.
The reason for this is because of proven severe abuse. My mum was regularly beaten, starved and tormented since she was adopted. One incident includes E stabbing N on the inner thigh for allowing her little brother to scrap his knee at a park. My mum finally left home at 15 and was homeless for a long time to escape the abuse. She has since repressed her anger but it very fearful whenever E is mentioned and she relied heavily on her dad who passed away 5 years ago to help her move on.
I mentioned N was adopted, well she and her older brother C were the only kids for 10years due to my grandad being infertile, he left when my my was 4 and she remarried. When they divorced E had another son and ‘changed her ways’. Apparently she’s tried to keep contact with N throughout the last 30years but N has led her at arms length to protect us.
I knew a lot of the abuse from my mum telling me but tonight something my mum thought she imagined was confirmed.
Between the ages of 8 to 12 E had made N believe that she had imagined her friends rape and several hospital visits for anorexia.
Some years later N’s dad confirmed the rape by telling N that when he confronted E about what N was telling him, E had stated that ‘she knows what had happened but it happened to the wrong girl’. He beat her and was arrested for it but that’s another story.

N never fully believed her mother would get someone to so that so she pushed away in her mind. The phone call tonight however brought something up.
She has vivid memories of the hospital visits a concerning her weight but she remembered something else. She remembers going because of excessive bleeding due to trauma to the hymen.
She remembers her dad coming over and questioning what had happened and she remembers E telling him that C did it and she let him do it.

My grandmother let her adopted son who was 10 at the time rape my mum and then protected him from punishment and made my mum believe she was just imagining it.
My grandmother hired a man to rape my mum when she was playing with her friend but he got the wrong girl (the girl committed suicide 7 years later btw).

And now she wants my mum to go to her on her death bed to clear her conscious and ask for forgiveness?!? I don’t know if my mum could handle the confirmation of the realisations and I’m scared that other horrendous things will be brought to light if my mum were to E.
I don’t know how to help her, I’ve always been the shoulder and rational opinion but I’m truely lost. What do I do?
My mum is a strong women and has moved past a lot but tonight alone scared me as she couldn’t grasp the idea that her own brother did that to her, an 8 years old girl. I’m worried she’ll regret not getting answers or that she’ll never be able to close those doors again.

Again sorry for the long read and sorry for any errors, I’m on a mobile and all over the place mentally.",22May2020,1
507,"The fitness center I go to (in the Netherlands) has been closed since mid March due to COVID-19. They offer a subscription service in which you are allowed to attend 5 classes per month whenever you want and, since they have been closed, they have been adding those classes to my profile such that I can attend the missed classes when they reopen. 

As I did not want to make them struggle financially I was okay with this and kept my subscription running. 

Now I wanted to cancel the subscription because I’m a student and this was becoming a significant useless expense and they informed me that they will not honor those owed classes if I cancel my subscription.

I feel ripped off as I have basically been paying 50€/month for nothing and they could easily offer me a gift card with those owed lessons to use once they reopen. They expect customers to be understanding and accommodating with their business in this weird times while they don’t show the slightest willingness to help themselves.

***Below was my original post***

She just won’t go away

I’ve (35F) been dating my fiancé (37M) for just over a year. About 3 months before we met he broke up with his ex (40ishF) of 3 years (on and off).  

They dated for 3 years. She kept breaking it off and going back to her ex. Back and forth. Back and forth. One time, he was dating this girl and still talking to the ex. The ex showed up at his house and literally chased the other girl out. 

After they broke up the last time she went back to her ex and they moved to GA (we live in NC)  

They talk now and then and he’s never hid it from me. Over Christmas the ex’s daughter was in a parade and asked if my fiancé would come see her. He asked if I was ok with it. I said yes. He went. Well, the ex was there and asked him if he wanted to go to a party with her and her parents.  I was not invited. 

Then recently, she texts him out of the blue to tell him she’s going to NY to help at the hospitals.  I was kinda annoyed. (Why would my fiancé care? What was the point of that?) 

I feel like she is slowly trying to worm her way back in and trying to stay relevant. 

He’s offered to stop talking to her but I don’t want to be ‘that’ girl.   I told him I just feel like she still has feelings and she’s unhappy with the choice she made.  He agreed that she is miserable and that she probably is regretting it but ‘too bad for her. I found my girl’. 

I trust him completely but I can’t help but be annoyed. I’m wondering if I should just go ahead and ask him to cut ties or if I’m being overly sensitive. 

To be clear, he’s never hid anything. And he’s never showed interest in her or given her attention over me. 
He didn’t go to the party. I’m not sure how he speaks of me to her. 

Whatcha all think?


UPDATE: 
So, I thought that he stopped talking to her. Technically, he did as far as I know, as in he doesn’t reply to her texts.  

However, 
he has not removed her number. 
He has not blocked her from his phone. 
He has not officially had that discussion with her. 

And I found out that he made his FB profile again and added her. This made me hit the roof. 

I told him that cutting off one form of communication (kinda) but adding another is not acceptable. 

He says it is because he doesn’t care about FB and they don’t talk on it. ( he got FB 3 days ago and added her yesterday) 

He told me I’m ridiculous. And that it’s not an issue. But it hurts me. I feel like he’s choosing to fight for her and not me. 

In my eyes,  since we are engaged, if I say ‘this girl (she’s literally the only one I’ve ever taken issue with) is a problem, and I can’t handle this. I feel like she’s disrespectful and has made no attempt to get to know me but has a history of ignoring boundaries etc. and therefore I deem her as a thorn in my side.’   Then he should say ‘ok. Done’.    She is his past. I am his future. But he says I’m being unreasonable. 


Am I? 

Im not asking him to hate her. I’m asking him to let her go. That’s it.",22May2020,1

I have an ok paying job drive an ok car and I’m really into my health/fitness I also don’t mind fashion and other shit like that. Recently I’ve started noticing this negative and jealous type energy coming my way. Sometimes from family member but majority of time from complete strangers. I got told by a close friend that they have watched this happen to me for almost 2-3 years ever since I turned 18, I didn’t really noticed it because I was always stoned and kind of just numb to most situations socially, I would always be to shy or just paranoid. Now that I haven’t smoked weed in over a year I’ve noticed this a lot myself. A lot of other guys tend to try and bring me down or make me feel shit about myself. It’s never the guys that are doing good them self’s but always the guys that look like they have nothing going on in there life, I actually get a long with people who are on my level or even have a higher level of success than me. Stuff like this happens a lot though and it’s kind of making me avoid social settings at all cost. I had to stop playing cricket/footy because it just got that bad that it wasn’t worth playing anymore. Mainly the older guys 35-40 would always try and make me feel like shit! I’ve been told I’m good looking attractive and I don’t have much trouble with woman but I think my looks are starting to maybe sabotage some of my opportunities. Right now I just feel like staying inside so I don’t have to deal with anyone’s negative energy. When I smoked weed I didn’t really noticed it or feel it.

511,"TLDR at the bottom.

I love my sister to death. I really do.

My sister is very kind, reasonable, and charming, but she can get super aggressive, especially when it comes to her own opinions.

If we’re at my parent’s house, and we’re all having a discussion that she brought up, it can quickly turn into a heated one when somebody pitches in and gives their own opinion that differs from hers. It’s not like she means it, but she can get super snippy and restates her opinion in a way that makes yours look insignificant. I don’t exactly know how to explain it other than she can be really aggressive when she disagrees with you, and it can come off as belittling. 

She doesn’t just do this when we’re having a conversation, but also whenever somebody does something she personally disapproves of. When things don’t go her way, she can be extremely pushy and try to put you down so that she can convince you to do it her way.

The problem is, she doesn’t notice herself doing it, so more often than not I just ignore it and tell myself that that’s just how she is. Only lately, it’s been bothering me like crazy, because I can’t even have a civil conversation with her without feeling put down and dismissed for stating a different opinion. 

I can’t even make a suggestion whenever we’re planning a gathering/ trip/ putlock or whatever without having her telling me all the reasons why I’m so stupid for suggesting something only SHE doesn’t approve of. It’s not just me that notices this, my other sister also can’t stand this behavior. My narcissistic father seems to be the only one who enjoys conversing with my sister. 

I’ve tried talking to her about it, but she brushes it off and says something along the lines of “I’m just stating my opinion. You’re being extra sensitive today, maybe it’s your period/ you’re going through some personal issues/ you’re mad at something and you’re just projecting”. It’s always my fault. I’m the one being touchy. I'm the one with the problems. 

I have self-worth issues that she knows of and always blames that on why I can’t handle a conversation with her.

Look, let me make this clear; I’ve had people disagree with me before. We’ve all had. I disagree with people all the time, but no one ever ends up hurt by the end of the discussion or feels dismissed. Somehow, I only ever feel hurt when I bring up a conversation with my sister. Unless we’re both on the same page, then the conversation actually ends up being pleasant.

How do I explain to her that her behavior is putting a strain on our relationship? Am I being unreasonable? Is there something that I need to change in myself?

Sorry for all the typos. I’m just really irritated after a Skype call with the family a few minutes ago and so I just typed this all real quick. Thanks!

TL;DR my sister can be really aggressive when she disagrees with me, to the point where she belittles your opinion in order to make hers look good. My other sister and I hate this behavior, but every time I try to bring this issue up, she brushes it off and makes it look like it's my fault for being too touchy. How do I deal with this? Is there something wrong with me that I have to change and not her?

516,"So I've run into a situation where this guy, one of my senior classmates was repeatedly harassing me on the messenger class groupchat. He would say often humiliating and degrading things to me on the groupchat. I did not want to respond, as that particular student had been talking shit about one other student. I had told him multiple times to simply stop because I was getting furious. I could not block him or leave the groupchat due to important information regarding senior events being held in that groupchat. Eventually I had enough and DM'ed him telling him to stop. Instead of stopping he made me look like the bad guy by justifying what he was doing through saying stuff about me. He then said in the groupchat more humiliating things and harassed me in the groupchat. I told him to stop but he refused to stop. So I reported him to my school's administration, using screenshots as evidence. That student got in trouble and his parents were called. Since it occurred in the groupchat, all of the students' parents were called, or almost called. Then some students texted me saying they didn't feel ""safe"" texting me anymore after I had snitched to the administration.  Not everyone did, but a few people did. I want to make this clear: I was not snitching because I wanted that student to get in trouble. I had enough of him constantly harassing me in the groupchat, and since he wouldn't stop or the other students wouldn't tell him to stop, and that he didn't stop. I had reported him because I simply wanted him to stop bullying me in the groupchat. There was no other reason for that. And I had reported him as a last-ditch effort to get him to stop.

I do plan on going to law school after I finish my bachelors so that’s something I have to think about as well since that’ll cost a lot of money. 

Here are my options:

SeattleU-$27,195(11k would be federal loans). It’s a good small school which I like, it’s close to home so I won’t have any expenses besides tuition. It also has a nice research program where I can get some extra experience.

CUBoulder-$85,810(11k in federal loans). This is my dream school. I love the environment I love the state, I love the people. When I visited I fell in love. However I would be paying for everything on my own. I wouldn’t have my parents to fall back on. 

University of Minnesota-73,520(11k in federal loans). This has the best psychology major out of all the schools, it has a very pretty campus, and it gets snow which I love. However, because of the pandemic I’ve never actually been on campus in person. I also would be paying for everything myself here as well.

I work for Walmart over in Online Grocery Pickup and it has exhausted me in recent months due to the pandemic (just made 6 years a couple days ago). 

What basically happened was was that I was asking my mom about possible jobs that I can apply to and both her and my stepdad are livid at me. Only my mom talked to me saying that I don't do my best to make myself decent, that I have the patience roadrunner to my brother (I ended up losing a lot of my patience due to him being able to conplain and grip about his work and i couldn't do the same back- he always barged into my room without knocking first and basically I got tired of him playing Fortnight); not to mention that she said I became very bitter and self centered during this past year. While it's true that they had to fight me to get to do chores in my teenager years- 6 years later as an adult and it's hard to do chores when working at Walmart.

My mom said that I became the person that they thought our oldest brother was going to become later in life and that she was very disappointed in me. She said that the past year was a complete failure and that it wasn't my brother's fault (implying that I'm the failure). She hates that I am always on Discord talking to people that I can relate to and talk in my free time because I'm always too tired to go anywhere.

So I've had plans of doing this before I graduated HS, but it's been a year since then and I feel like I haven't made much progress towards this goal. I posted here before asking about some advice on moving out, but a lot has changed and I would appreciate some more advice and shared experience on this.

Right now, my plan is to move from where I am now (Florida) to Arizona. I have friends and some family out there and it seems much more appealing than staying in my current area, for multiple reasons. I plan to move out in a year/year and a half once I finish school, though I know I need help because I've never moved out before, not to mention across the country. This is what I need help with the most,

1.  Right now I don't have much money saved up (A little over $600). I do plan on making as much as I can before the move but my current job doesn't pay well, so I was hoping to have something better lined up in my new location before I actually move. What would be the best way to secure work before moving, if thats reasonable?

2. I'll be moving with a friend, though I have a few others who have been on and off about making the move with me. Should my friend and I move on our own or is it a smarter move to bring more people?

3. The moving process doesn't seem easy, though I'd prefer to do it on my own instead of paying for a moving service. I can fit everything I'm bringing in the back of my jeep, too. Is this a good idea or should I pay for some help?

4. Is there anything else i'm missing or should know about?

I’m currently applying for jobs —  need a part time job until I can get back to my actual job — I’ve been looking at job boards, and these job boards allow you to apply to the company through them.

533,"My friend is a scholar in SG and broke her ankle a few weeks ago. Besides the hassle of sorting out school work and classes, which haven't been canceled she struggle to move around with crutches and a wheel chair. She's been moved to a disabled room on the ground floor but she relies on other students in her hostel going to the dining hall to get her food. In theory there is a schedule where four people get her food and bring it to her room for her but its not uncommon for student/scholars to skip meals in order to study. When they skip they don't seem to let other people know and just tell her tgey aren't getting food. She says many students aren't on their phones much so even if she texts them they don't always see or respond.

535,"I wanna start by saying that I don't think she's a bad person. I've been critical of her in the past and still am but not as much as before since I've talked to him about what I think of her and he cleared the air on some things. Things have been going well for the past few months, but now they're having talks about moving many states away. It's not the fact that he wants to move by next year that hurts. He's talked to me about possibly moving prior to the relationship, but it didn't really sound serious and he wasn't acting on it. Also the location he named was different from her preferred location.  


It's the fact that she's always wanted to move, even before dating him, and I have know that she brought it up to him and is pushing for it. If he were to plan on doing this without any influence it'd still hurt, but not as much. If he moved we wouldn't lose contact and I wouldn't lose him meaning we're not friends, moreso him physically not being here. It would take a flight to even see each other. It may be selfish on my end, but it's tough feeling like you're going to lose one of your best friends. We're in our early 20s and I've been best friends with him since I was a little kid.

U see it all started in 7th grade when I was on Christmas break or sum and I texted her on instagram asking her if she wanted to be my girlfriend (which she agreed to after that). And after that we started video chatting with her friend after school, text each other, and occasionally try to plan meet ups. Pass by a couple months and I felt like I wasn't ready for a ""real"" relationship with her yet so i texted her saying that we should take a break for a little while( which she was fine with) the day after that at school I asked her were we cool and she said yeah so after that we'd text each other sometimes, we had randomly just stop the video chatting. But we were all cool then we go to summertime of last year this is when  things start to get werid she starts to ghost my messages which really confused me. During the duration of summer I ask her friend why isn't she bot talking to me and she'd say idk( keep in mind that she's    
One of my ex's best friends) but I believed her but my ex never texted me back for the rest of the summer and one thing I forgot to point out was that she acted like I didnt exist on a group chat I was invited to. Anyway SIX YES SIX months later she finally texts me back saying ""Bro keep my name out of your effing mouth k thanks"" with a middle finger. I told her what are u talking about, I literally did nothing to u at all we get into an argument  and she asks me "" have u moved on"" I'm like from the relationship yeah but I thought we were friends and she asked me was I obsessed with her which me me mad as heck.

543,"Apologies in advance, this is going to be a long one. 

TL;DR: I want to help people no one else will, but I know it will cost my own mental health to do that. 

I have always been a very empathetic person. I spend all of my time analyzing other people. I look at everything, their unconscious behaviors, expressions, decisions, vocabulary choices, and anything else you can think of. I am literally *always* doing this when I am around *anyone*, to a point where it’s exhausting to spend time with people for more than a few hours because my brain just gets tired of running a mile a minute. I do this because I want to know how everyone around me is feeling, and how they are affected by whatever situation we are in. I want to know if someone is upset about something, or excited about something, so that I can tailor the situation for them to the best of my ability. 

This trait has a lot of positives – but also a *lot* of negatives. I love that I can be in tune with other’s emotions so I can make them happier. I also love that people of feel they can come to me for help. I genuinely want everyone around me to be happy. The problem is, I often let my own happiness be the cost of their happiness. I do set healthy boundaries, but I will do my best to make others happy, even if it means hiding the fact that I’m not. 

I tell you all of that because this, obviously, is why I chose to study psychology. I specifically want to go into clinical psychology to work with patients one-on-one. The reason for this post is that I also want to go into criminal psychology, specifically to work with inmates.

I should tell you: I have a set of morals that I believe very strongly that I haven’t ever seen in another person. I do not believe that evil people exist. I don’t believe that inmates should be labeled as bad people for the rest of their lives, *no matter what they did.* Yes, even the people who commit the worst crimes in humanity, in my opinion, are not evil. Now, I’m not naïve. There are definitely people who should get a life sentence without parole. There are people who should be isolated. I know that the safety of the innocent is much more important than the happiness of those guilty of crime. 

I do *not* believe, however, that those who commit crimes don’t deserve help.  And I want to be the one to help them, because I know that most people won’t. For the sake of preserving the length of this post, I won’t go into specific detail of why I want to help them, but I will answer questions about it in the comments if you’re interested. 

Here’s where I state my actual problem. As I’m sure you can imagine, the response to my moral beliefs and possible career goals is not friendly. I don’t ever tell these moral beliefs to someone until I have known them for a long time, for that reason. Recently, I shared these beliefs and my wish to work with inmates with my boyfriend. While respectful, he vehemently disagreed. He’s one of the people who believe people who commit terrible crimes should be violently killed. He is someone who I expect to be in my life far into the future, and it makes me sad that he will never understand why I do what I do, if I were to work with inmates. 

There’s also my family. I no longer live there, but I grew up in central Minnesota, where most of my family still lives. Again, I won’t go into detail (I’ll answer questions), but the culture of people from Minnesota makes it so that my family won’t ever understand what I do either. The people from Minnesota will always hide their true feelings in order to look good, and they will never discuss anything more personal than their favorite pie flavor. I mean *never.* My family already resents me for moving away from home, and they resent me even more for pursuing a career that is the opposite of how they act. If I were to become a criminal psychologist, they would absolutely hate it – but still act like they love me. And because I’m so good at reading people, I will feel their hatred toward my core beliefs and purpose in life every time I see them. 

I have never met someone who understands my desire to help inmates, and I don’t think I’ll ever personally know someone who does. I still really want to pursue that path, but I’m afraid I’ll just live a life full of disappointment. I don’t want to spend my life doing something that I believe to be noble, but that will constantly make people judge me.",22May2020,1
544,"Hello there. First time using reddit here. I just needed advice on what I'm currently dealing with ever since college, any advice will do. See, ever since I started college, I've been dealing with many things such as depression, anxiety and most commonly fear. I've feared a lot of things ever since I've turned sixteen, and with depression and anxiety along, I had difficulty with my social life and how to express myself (mostly anger, basically I'm a kettle that's waiting to explode) making it difficult for me to make friends and join clubs. On top of it, since I'm not the smartest student I would fail on subjects I'm not good at resulting my mom to threaten me to drop me out (most of the students I know wont help each other, been like this until I guess the second semester of second year when I met my best friend)

But upon meeting my best friend it slightly got better, but at the same time got worse. Since I got a really bad view on my self (thanks to the bullying I receive during high school). I'm constantly afraid and worried about a lot of things. My best friend was to only comfort I have during those years.

One of the things I""m currently worried about is my future and my self worth. Despite the fact that I've graduated college, what didn't go away was my fear of making mistakes during work since I was taught by my mom to never make mistakes(I'm not kidding here) and when I started my first work a year ago, I was so paranoid of not making mistakes I nearly had a breakdown after a rude customer snapped at me by accident, my coworkers were rude(not all) and I'm so stressed out to the max. I tried opening this to my mom one time and she just brushed me off saying that it was just in my head and it was no big deal...I was devastated. She's the type of person that doesn't believe in depression and mental problem. Because of my problem, I resigned from work to figure out how to deal with this, because I knew that I wasn't going anywhere with my problem and boy she wasn't happy...made a few comments about how I'm just using it as an excuse to be lazy. I haven't worked since this early January and because of Covid-19 I had a lot of time to look for help. I tried to ask advice to some of my relatives, but just like my mom, they didn't believe in mental problems. But one of my uncles suggested that I do something creative for a change. So I did painting. But doing painting, my mom said it was a waste of time. So now, I have no one to turn to ask for help...

Oh and about my future, I'm not really sure of what I want to do anymore...I've always dreamed of becoming a writer ever since i was a child, but i was discourage to do so because they said it wont help me in the long run.

I could rant as long as I want here but i figured to just leave it this way as not bore anyone about my problem. Please help me...I really need help here.",22May2020,1

549,"So after showing interest in a job to help out a family friend. I said I could start whenever. I filled out my application and met with the employer. They talked about how they look forward to working with me. It turned out the job entails working maintenance at a beach and pool club while customers are there. Watering everything, setting up, painting, cleaning and fixing the bathrooms. My family doesn’t like that I’d be potentially exposed and they want me to call and say I can not work there. I understand their concern,  I am worried myself. but I pride myself on my work ethic and hate that I kinda committed to the job.

550,"So I’ve worked at this coffee shop for about 1 year but 3 months ago it got bought by new owners. They had never worked in the coffee business before let alone own and run a business. When they first bought the stand I was a little bit of a kiss ass just because I didn’t know if they were going to clear house and fire us all or not.

They fired one of my coworkers because she was supposedly stealing but I’m suspicious that they just didn’t like her. After they filled her position they didn’t let me or anyone train the new girl bc she had worked in coffee before(which is a terrible idea because every coffee stand is different and even a day of training would have been needed just to show her how we do things and where everything is located). I offered to train her but my bosses shot me down.

As the month went on, I had asked for more hours and told them that since I am the longest standing employee I didn’t think it was unreasonable to give me a few more hours. She was pissed off after that. 

Not even a week later she gave me my 90 day review. We didn’t talk about my work ethic or performance as an employee but instead she stood there for well over an hour and talked about how shitty I was and that ‘nobody liked working with me’ even though the only time I ever saw the other employees was at shift change bc there is only ever one person in the stand at a time. I have rarely talked with my coworker and yet she complained to the bosses that I ‘seemed to have an attitude’ when making small talk in passing. The list went on. She talked about how I lost a contest against the other two employees, how I asked for what I wanted(more hours), and how she wished her business partner was there too because ‘she would have A LOT of stuff to say to you’. But never once did she mention my customer service skills or coffee making.

At the end she said I should find a new job and they were essentially firing me but we’re giving me a few days to find another job. I stood there silently while this went on. I didn’t know what to say. But seeing as I had bills and I didn’t know how hard it would be to get another job during the corona quarantine, I asked for a second chance. She said no.

An hour after she left I got a phone call, she said that her and her business partner would give me a second chance but I would have to drastically change.

I got this feeling that she had planned all of this and was trying to manipulate me so that I would fall in line and blindly listen to her. I think she got tired of me when I stopped kissing her ass and started asking that she not put the schedule out the day before it started.

What should I do?

556,"Okay. I would like some actual tricks or tips of things I can practice to be more likable. I am probably autistic. I’m not diagnosed, and I’m not gonna bother you with my whole list of symptoms right now, but I have pretty bad problems with facial recognition and people  don’t feel close to me. Lots of times in my life I have the experience of someone thinking that I’m mad at them or being mean to them when it’s not what I was going for. People think I’m “a bitch“ or “intimidating” I’m painfully bad at smalltalk. Because of my issues with facial recognition I don’t always know who I’m talking to. To deal with this over the years I just focus on my few close friends and have a habit of ignoring strangers and new people. I’m trying to change that, but it’s very clunky. When people first meet me they usually have very strong feelings towards me.  I’m decent at attracting people, I’m pretty and quirky and I have a lot of financial success (despite a complete lack of education, all the learning disabilities, and having my own way of doing things) so people are interested in me, but relationships don’t tend to get close unless they are sexual. Also new people sometimes really deeply dislike me for what seems like no reason to me. On more than one occasion people have imagined that I hate them or have a big issue when I am barely even aware of them. My financial success also is weird for me, because I have more money than any of my peers. I know some people from my circle are jealous and resent me because it seems unfair that I was able to accomplish so much. I have no idea how to navigate that. I live a moderate lifestyle and I don’t flaunt my money, but my businesses are publicly very successful and it’s pretty obvious that I can afford anything I want.  The advice of “just be yourself” and “be genuine,” is not what I’m looking for. I try that every day, but I need some advice on how to make people feel like I’m connecting with them. I do know that I should ask people questions and be genuinely interested in what they’re saying, but that’s actually pretty hard for me to be “genuinely interested” when I’m not. I try to fake it, but I think that people feel that and it makes them like me less? Anyways any advice is appreciated, especially specific things that I can practice and apply every day. Please try not to be mean? I really want more friends and I’m willing to change my behaviors.

So the plan right now is: She'll get a new job, save up for a car and have one before the college starts in september (shes about halfway with her savings) so she can drive herself to college because her dad will not. Then hopefully get a dorm and move away from her dad. Then graduate college and hopefully I'll be doe with all my schooling too by that time and then the plan is to move to Australie together and get setteled there (Australia because we both have solid English and I dont want to live in the states). This is very stressful for me knowing my girlfriend has lots of stress and pressure because of this. She has no friends or family that have her back if she falls. I am truly the only one she got. How do I guide her through this and make our plan work out?

563,"I'm (16F) and I'm immunocompromised as I have chronic asthma and diabetes. The virus has me getting anxious and even borderline germaphobic.

I clean stuff I buy from the grocery store, I obsessively feel the need to clean places other people touch other wise I feel anxious and that can even trigger panic attacks, I feel afraid even thinking about other people touching me and whenever someone accidentally does I wash my hands at least 3 times. 

My eczema has started acting up bc of how much I wash my hands. 

Eid is gonna be sunday (it's a religious holiday) and even tho in my country it's allowed to let 4 people in at your house I panic about it as I do not want anyone to get in my house.

 I also am afraid that since my family want to visit other family members that those people will touch them and then my family members will infect me. 

My family doesn't get me and make fun of me, especially my little brother. He says he'll go around touching everyone just to spite me and then touch me. 
They think I'm overreacting, and yeah I guess but they are also way to chill about this! It gets on my nerves so much, it's like they don't care at all that we could die just bc they don't keep distance listen to the things the government says is safe and clean stuff. 

Anyway, I just keep getting worse and how do I calm down myself. Also how to get my family to understand me and stop stressing me out even more?",22May2020,1

566,"Okay. Some context: 
I was violently assaulted at a party in college and was in denial and a complete mess before finally transferring schools. One of my friends who stuck with me for the rest of my time at that school was seriously one of the greatest friends I’ve ever had,  I was honestly a less-than-great friend to them. I don’t know why, other than I was hurting from my experience, and wasn’t acknowledging it and they were just my outlet. I couldn’t see that I was probably hurting them, too. They called me on my bs in such a loving way and would always listen when I went off about something and try to bring my attention to the root of the problem. They would always remind me I was worthy/important even when I felt the opposite was true. 

Fast forward about a year and a half later to the present day, and now that I’ve done some intensive work on myself (LOTS of therapy/self development/trauma processing/maturing) and grown a lot, I just... feel horrible that they had to deal with my projection. I am now finally able to recognize what a true friend they were to me, no matter what. I woke up this morning with a very strong urge to reach out and apologize/express my appreciation for them, even though we haven’t really talked since I left (besides birthday texts and one or two phone convos lol). 

I guess I’m just looking for some second opinions... deciding whether I just ignore that urge, or honor it? Would it be needlessly bringing up the past, or an opportunity for us to each get some closure?",22May2020,1
568,"First off, I (18F) have a great relationship with my mom and love her very much. However, I have a hard time confronting her as she isn't receptive to contradicting opinions.

I've always had insecurities about my body, but have generally kept a positive attitude about myself. But one thing that has continually bothered me is my breast size (32D), because my first and only (ex)boyfriend used to repeatedly tell me he liked first who had smaller chests. 

I want to feel confident, especially since bikini season is fast approaching. I mainly just want to feel confident in less covering clothes, so that I'm not roasting to death half the time.

I recently ordered a cute bikini from an online site, and I don't think it's revealing past what a bikini should reveal (it nearly covers my whole breast).

I showed my mom and she told me it was ""too much"" and that I'm ""putting myself out there negatively""

I also wore a shirt with cleavage today to social distance walk with a friend, and she repeated those lines along with ""less is more"" and ""men aren't into that"" (refering to my crush).

Especially because my history with my ex boyfriend's negative comments, this has rekindled that insecurity.

I feel like a slut and I don't even consider what I wear to be over the top. How do I tell this to someone who doesn't listen, and get her to understand that her words have hurt me?",22May2020,1
570,"Hey all,

About two months ago i moved into my first apartment with my buddy and girlfriend.

Prior to moving in we were promised a parking spot with even an official document and email having a parking spot (two in total, one spot and our garage). On our second day moving in we called to get an explanation on how some stuff worked, as well as our parking spot because the one they gave us had a car in it already. It was then we were informed they made a mistake and we do not having a parking spot outside of our garage. 

We don’t live in the city or in a busy area at all so parking outside of the apartment isn’t an issue but it is a hassle.

My biggest dilemma is this: there is literally a parking spot directly across from our garage that has been vacant for two months and empty every time we came to check out the apartment prior.

The assistant to the manager for the property (the manager is hard to get in touch with, like pulling teeth)
Is kind of twisting things around. He’s the one who promised us the spot in an official document as well as told us he fucked up now he’s saying it wasn’t him it was his manager despite me only talking to his manager twice.

I don’t want to make a big deal about all of this, but waking up and every time I come home and seeing that spot empty is kind of a slap in the face.

What do I do?",22May2020,1
571,"posted aswell in other related subs

For example: we are flirting and going on dates for months (3 or 4) then they suddenly stop talking. In this case, I would ask what is going on.. but I am used to hear on the internet that I should always be cold when they get cold too, instead of showing even more attachment (asking what is wrong).

Example 2: Is there a right time to develop feelings? I had only one girl I liked, we flirted 3 months and for her taste I attached ""too quickly"". My ""excuse"" (for her and for me, and I actually really believe in it) was that I went trough a sad time in the past, being bullied 4 years of my life during school and developing anxiety and sometimes, depressive episodes (14-18y). Then I went to college entrance preparatory course (where I met her) and it was awful, but I managed to get a good score and now I am in my 2nd year at college. She was heartwarming to me, made me feel special, various other girls approached me in the past but no one had that much in common, she has the same taste as me and is intelligent and cultured. We flirted and she said (and by the way she acted, demonstrated) she liked me. Then yes, I really liked what I saw. We never went on a romantic date because one day I got really anxious and alone and I ""fucked it up"" by saying that I ""loved"" her. She was the only friend I had as no one other than her was close enough for me to talk to about these things. Therapy never really helped and my family is just my sister (which would make fun of me), my mother (which would be annoyed, because she is so strong and ""never complains"") and my father (a very absent person).

So I feel guilty of that day where I ""confessed"" to her my feelings about things. Things got worse and worse from then on. I wanted to go out at least to get to explain to her what made me say those things and maybe listen what was the reason behind her never getting too ""emotionally close"" with people. She said by text messages she never had a serious relationship because of that, have a hard time expressing emotions, etc.

She said that we would go out, but she didn't knew when bc the preparatory course is 6/7 a week and she studies a lot. I understood, but of course I had a bad feeling about this. One day she opened up to me and said she was really really sad with her grades development and that she felt lost, even talked about suicide feelings.  Now listen, I know well these feelings.. I saw all my school friends turn their back to me for 4 years entire, had no other person to talk to. I decided to go see her in her course, we talked a bit (really shortly, as she needed to take the bus) and I said that she could count on me. She appreciated the gesture. But from then on we started talking less and less, and we both have said in the past that we would always be honest with each other, so I asked what was going on. She were always evasive and said that she didn't have any time bc of the course. Needless to say that things got worse (how could she not at least wanted to talk to me after what I did, and when I opened my feelings she said that I ""attached too quicky"").

And jumping right to the end of the story, we finally got out one day (with me not knowing if it was out of interest or out of guilt by her part) We talked ofc, but it was nothing like I imagined it would be: she said sorry for the way she behaved and that she didn't knew how to demonstrate that she liked me, I said that it hurted me, but I forgave her since she was sorry and things would ""change"". There was a lot of silence sometimes and even though we don't care, I was feeling that I wouldn't want to be the one ""competing for her attention"" asking questions all the time. In the very end she even got on her phone instead of talking to guy she had a crush on for a whole year during the course (and got real sad when I left it), was there when she needed and was disregarded by the same reason that when came from her side (the suicide talk) approximated us, instead of pushing us away (like when I told her my feelings about things).

I decided that all of that wasn't making any good for me and decided to never talk to her again. Now here am I, asking Reddit what should have I done? Sometimes I think I should never open my feelings to someone again without knowing them for at least 2 years and getting out with them at least 10 times with multiple proofs they like me and having opened up before. And then sometimes I think I should be myself and ""act naturally"".

Another thing that comes to mind is that maybe love isn't for everyone, because I fear if I act naturally (which is based on how much I like the person and having at least a reason to think they like me too) I will always get heartbroken. And then I should play hard to get and other games, or maybe keep an excel spreadsheet marking the right time to each thing to take place. Anyway, it gets me thinking how me acting like someone that cares for the other made her feelings last 3 months (90 days), and her acting like someone that doesn't made *my* feelings last 9 months (275 days).

Maybe just one failed relationship doesn't make enough for a diagnosis, but I sure as hell need to learn something here. So if you read until here, I thank you, and ask you for your advise. Be as harsh as you want, be as kind as you want... just be honest.",22May2020,1
572,"I am 22F and in college. I can’t focus long enough on my college work to get any assignments/studying/etc done, I consistently fail exams and haven’t handed in any essays in the past year. 

All of my college lectures have been moved online and exams were replaced with essays and of 5 exams I have completed 2, deferred 2 and am trying to finish 1 that is due today but I just can’t do it. Every time I sit down to do any type of college work it’s like my brain shuts down, I don’t understand anything I have to study and I find a million other things to do instead eg tidy my room or scroll through social media. 

I have tried making timetables and lists of what I need to get done but I never follow them. This is the second college course I have enrolled in, I dropped out of my first course after a year because I just really hated it and took a year off to decide what I wanted to do. I started the course I am doing now which I really enjoy and it’s in a field that I would love to work in in the future but I just feel like that’s impossible considering I can’t get any work done and I barely understand what I have to do. 

I feel so stupid and lazy and I have had a consistent pain in my chest for the past 2 weeks as this is when all my exam replacement assignments are due. I just don’t know what to do, I have considered maybe I have a mental health illness as depression does run in my family but i can do other tasks outside college work, I have a part time job which I can work with no issues, it’s just that I literally can’t focus on college work. I can write a few sentences of an essay and then I just check out for an hour when I know I still have work to do but I just can’t bring myself to actually do it. Even before college moved everything online I was missing tons of lectures and I knew I had to catch up on what I missed but I just...didn’t? 

I have been wanting to speak to a counsellor for a while and my college does offer free counselling sessions but obviously that’s not available now since college is online bc covid. I’m just wondering if anyone has experienced a similar thing or if it sounds like maybe there is something I need to get check d out? I don’t even know",22May2020,1
573,"So there is a girl I've talking to, however she already has a guy and is very hostile to people talking to her. In my case she keeps it kinda of a secret to him.

That's when things go south, yesterday she unblocked me out of nowhere and started following me. However she stills has her guy in her profile pics. In order to make sure what was going on and without sending a direct msg to her I asked a friend of hers how and why she just unblocked me. She told that it was an accident and when she realised it she just unblocked me. This thing contradicts the thing she told me. I know that something different is going on but not sure why. Any ideas?

574,"Okay so I really tried to think of a way to give some backstory but every time I did, I wrote over 1000 words and didn’t even start talking about the part I need advice on.

So to shorten the backstory (it’s not necessary to read it but it does provide some insight into what my parents are like) - I’m 19 and I live with my parents that are very biased and strict. I also live with my sister that’s 3 years younger than me. My entire family is extroverted, I’m introverted. I have also been diagnosed with anxiety. My parents don’t like the fact that I’m introverted (and therefore don’t talk to them constantly and am quiet most of the time). They like to play the victim by saying things like: “Oh you don’t like us then? You don’t talk to us that much, do you hate us? Would you even care (and cry) if we died tomorrow?” And they really enjoy curing my anxiety by saying “just talk to people more!” Whenever they come home from work they give me a list of chores to do while they take an afternoon nap, not taking into account that I have school and that I’m equally tired because of it. My sister rarely has to do any chores. If I fail to do all of the chores, they threaten to cut off the internet or take my phone. They’re also strict in other ways and HATE any electronic devices. They love to snoop around my room. We only have one family computer and they love to snoop around under my folders, my search history,... This turned me into a very paranoid person even when they’re not around. Even though I’m 19 I still have to go to sleep no later than at midnight and when I go to sleep I need to put my phone in another room because of “radiation” (and because they assume I’ll just spend my entire night on my phone).

Okay so about a week ago, a small family gathering took place in order celebrate my birthday. 10 people, no more. (Small gatherings are now allowed in my country so we weren’t breaking any laws and yes we took precautions still so no worries there). My dad got annoyed at my grandmother because “she talked too much” trying to have a conversation with him so he went inside the house, yelled my name and demanded that I talk to her instead. I had just finished vacuuming the entire house, went outside and talked to my grandma. But the lovely lady stood up and decided to walk around our house to check out all the flowers we have because she’s a nature lover.

Now, as soon as my annoyed dad and I were alone, he started cursing me out out of nowhere, saying very vulgar curse words to me. (Now, I was raised knowing cursing was bad since my parents didn’t condone it, which is the reason why I still don’t curse to this day) I wasn’t expecting that he would curse me out and since it was really vulgar and something I would never say to my potential child (especially if somebody else was the reason I’m in a bad mood), I felt really hurt and I closed off. So a couple hours later, when he decided to initiate a conversation pretending like nothing ever happened, when I’ve been visibly hurt by what he said, I told him that I wanted him to apologise to me. But he got mad at me again, this time saying that I’m being very disrespectful and that he will never apologise to me for anything because I’m living under his roof, eating his food and I’m here to respect him, not the other way around. I have been only giving him cold replies for the past week and haven’t had a single meaningful conversation with him because whenever I bring it up, he yells at me saying parents should in no way ever apologise to their children (plus the things I already said above, he basically repeats himself). I don’t know if I can respect him as my parent when he can’t seem to respect me as a person who needs to be treated as such. I feel like I deserve an apology, especially when he released his anger on me when somebody else actually put him in a bad mood and it was not my fault in the first place.

Is it right to even expect him to apologise? And am I doing the right thing by wanting him to apologise? I would love to hear some opinions regarding this matter.",22May2020,2

Nurse is definitely over 10 years older than me which makes me uncomfortable too. I’m 23.  Then it evolved into coworker talking about how I look “damnnn [name] I see you looking like that” etc etc. 
then talking to me about his sex stories and saying how big his dick is and then it just got weirder from there. That convo stemmed from nothing really, he was just talking to me about his past relationships, and it just got dirty, he told me that every girl he’s ever been with has gone crazy after him and he says the reason is because his d*ck is so big it drove them to crazyness. It made me wildly uncomfortable, and even more so after I left and realized if I was a male, he would have never told me all that. 
He started asking why I was even with my boyfriend and questioning my relationship ALL the time [someone showed me your insta and I see you girl, why are you even with your boyfriend??”] and asking to go out with me, and then out with me AND that nurse. That alone made me feel scared for my safety.

580,"hi, so Im a senior in highschool. My brother graduated from this college (lets call A) and my family loves this school and really wants me to go. I got on the waitlist, and got into another college (lets call B). So, my family and I wrote letter of continued interest to A and my brother emailed his former dean saying what can we do to increase chances. 

After i sent the letter in, i realized i dont want to go to A. yes, it is very prestigious, (top 20 school) but I simply dont want to go there, and I have now realized B fits better to me and I have a plan for what to do at B. B is slightly less prestigious, ie one of the best public schools in the country, but I thought that my plan at B would work better. I also thought that I didnt want to follow in my brother's footsteps, and also I just didnt like the school. 

So, about 10 days after I sent the letter in, I changed my waitlist response to no without telling my parents and brother. I know i should have talked to them about it but I also know that they tell me if im getting in im going there, and that I would be forced to go to A, as my opinion doesnt matter, it would be my parents decision. While I do know it is wrong, I thought it was my future and I should decide. 

However, they recently found out that I said no to the waitlist because they were looking in my email for something. Now, they are devastated. They are shocked they could raise a daughter like me, and how could I make that decision without talking to them, even my brother who emailed the dean is hurt. My whole family doesnt speak to me, and now my parents will offer no financial help to B. Not only that, they think im a horrible person who will just lie to them and betray them constantly. Theyre saying its unforgivable and they are really upset and i feel horrible. just horrible

So now, I need advice into how to get my family to like me again. We are such a close family, we hang out every night, cook together, talk about everything, and I just want to get my family back.

588,"This was a response to a comment:

Also I am in contact with the detective who originally arrived on scene. This isnt a cut and dry incident.

Okay I just got further explanations and details. Trying to type details objectively cause I want to make sure I'm not sounding biased. I'm having a hard time judging situation myself so what do you guys think: 

I was thinking that the recording isnt going to help either for the same reasons, although I know him well enough to whole heartedly believe  he wouldn't have purposefully or knowingly seek out a 14 year old for sex. He says she was on his facebook friends list with a lot of mutual friends. Originally asked him for a ride somewhere for 20 dollars in gas and it was the first time they ever spoke. He agreed to do the ride. Says she then began to make sexual advances and send photos to which he responded by stating he wasnt interested in sex and also asking her age because he didnt want to give a ride to an underage girl. She repeatedly insisted she was 18 and needed this ride regardless of him not being interested in her.

Says once she got in the car she started to act more aggressive with her sexual advances and he began to record their conversation without her knowledge because of the nature of her behavior. He asked her age again and she again stated she was 18. Began driving her to her location and stopped at one point to get out of the car because he said she was so persistent and he was uncomfortable. Tried to get space to weigh his options by saying he needed to take a leak. She followed him and continued pressuring him and he explains to me that he just agreed to get the situation over with. Said he doesn't really know why he agreed when he didnt want to but that he felt uncomfortable and definitely expressed a lot of shame when we grilled him about agreeing to do it. He didnt even want to show her profile because he was so embarrassed. Says afterwards he dropped her off at an apartment complex where they were greeted by a man who looked to be in his late 20s to 30s and she got out of the car and hugged and kissed him and then he left. 


The next day the parents called him from her messenger looking for his daughter claiming she is missing. His first question was if they had sex. He admitted that they did, and the father said she was allegedly 14. He told my friend that she had done this several times before to other older men and he wasnt seeming surprised or concerned. He wanted to know where he dropped off his daughter and demanded that my friend even go back to the location and take a video of the apartment. My friend asked why the dad wouldn't just take the address and go there himself. He said he didnt have a ride.

My friend actually agreed to do this for the dad and went back to the apartment to take a photo and said when he arrived the dad was actually already there waiting, and was coaching him on how to take the photos and what he wanted in the photos of the apartment. He asked my friend to send the photos to his phone, which he did. The dad the pulled open his phone camera and began recording, and demanded my friend explain in detail exactly the events of the previous night with his daughter. My friend refused as to not incriminate himself. He told the dad to just go knock on the door and confront the guy who was last seen with his daughter, and he didnt respond. He instead started asking my friend to follow him down the road where the police were allegedly waiting to speak to them. My friend questioned why the police were not meeting at location and refused to follow and the dad then became aggressive by threatening to physically attack and kill him, and my friend says that the dad even stated that he knew where he lived. 

Right in the middle of the yelling, my friend claims that a police cruiser pulls up on location and that a detective and a regular officer exited the vehicle and pulled my friend aside to tell him that they received a call from a ""family member"" of the dad and the girl where they warned that the father had informed them, prior to arriving at the location for the photos, that he intended to kill my friend, and that the uniformed officer was staying with him to ensure his safety. He says after a while of answering all of the detectives questions about the situation, he was told that for now, hes just a witness and was free to go. He said that they never asked him the nature of their relationship with the girl or even indicated that there was a concern about this girl being raped or being missing at all. My friend was allowed to go home with no follow up information at this time aside from the father allegedly being intercepted by police from coming to his house. 

My friend fears for his safety and genuinely seems scared and traumatized and confused by the situation and is afraid to talk to anyone or get help. Maintains that he is certain he was unaware of her true age, that he asked about her age not because he was sexually interested but because he was concerned by her behavior and him getting in trouble by being around her when she asked him for help. He said he recorded because he thought it would show that he did his due diligence in being responsible for verifying her identity. Says she could not produce an ID and didnt have a reason for not having one. 

He also says that this girl has constantly messaged him for a week prior to this happening asking for rides. Said she would send multiple messages in a row if he didnt respond and said she became increasingly desperate in needing a ride away from where she was. He says that after this incident  happened the girl has not messaged him at all and completely dropped off social media which seems to indicate maybe she is missing or just ran away. 

We went on her profile and noticed that she posted many selfies that were loaded with comments from older men ranging from 23 to 30, all flirtatious, some even arguing over who she ""belongs to,"" and even various comments from bystanders calling out some for being in relationships and to stop, ""messing with these girls,"" which was the only thing we saw that even hinted that she is truly underage. She does not comment or say anything and only posts photos with captions stating that she feels ugly. My friend suspects that she is not a minor and that this is some type of black mail scheme to lure in men and scare them into thinking that they'll go to jail for statutory rape if they dont do something in exchange. Even wonders if he was being set up for some else's crime because the due process for such a case didnt happen the way it was supposed to. 

Found a profile of a 25 year old man who commented flirty things on her photo four weeks ago and his profile page literally has a statement that says, ""just looking for a nice girl who is actually my age."" Might not be connected but if it is it implies she is possibly a minor and upset someone enough that they felt the need to publically Express that they were fooled by this person. 


The suspicions come from the father, he made it clear that he is not concerned enough about potential pedophiles having sex with his underage daughter to err on the side of caution and report them to the police every time. He did not report my friend to the police for the sex. No one in the family did. I feel as though this is unusual for a father to do and that the mention of an older man having sex with his minor daughter would have been the first thing mentioned when reporting her missing, which he also did not do. The police only arrived because there was a report for my friends welfare being in danger from the father. 

There is also the unusual activity on this girls facebook. I now have a concern that this may be a possible instance of human trafficking regardless of whether or not my friend was actually intending to have sex with a 14 year old.

589,"I’m 24. Currently my mom, 59, lives with me and my partner. My partner really wants us to have our own space, and to live just us. So I’m going to pay for my moms apartment (she has a myriad of illnesses rendering her unable to work and government payments don’t cover cost of rent) and he’ll pay for ours.
My mom is my best friend. We cook for each other, spend a lotttt or time together, entirely rely on each other....I’m so not okay or ready with moving out. 
I know it’s ‘time’, I guess? And maybe it’ll help us not be so dependant?
But I just think of how sometimes she won’t eat unless I cook for her because she’s too tired to make her own food, little things like that, and my heart breaks.

I might just add that my partner moved countries to live with me, and his mom was his best friend too and he left that behind to start a life with me so I just feel selfish and childish being so heartbroken about leaving her.

How do I become okay with this???",22May2020,1
590,"TL:DR at the bottom, but I highly encourage you to read the post to understand more. So basically some backstory here, I’m 14 male and my mom and/or dad won’t let me leave the house at all, unless they are there to accompany me. An example; She won’t even let me check the mailbox outside (which is 10 steps away from the front door). Another true example: I was trying to help my sis build a tent in the backyard and my mom made her walk me to the backyard. 

I was homeschooled until this year, where I went to a public middle school (I started a year late so that’s why I’m still in middle school) and while I was homeschooled I was depressed every single day and thought about ending it as soon as I woke up and until I went to bed. I told my mom this was due to having absolutely no freedom because of her overprotectiveness, and she said she was protecting me and that I’m wayyy too young to be leaving the house alone (I was 13 at the time), and that my depression is all my fault because I have a bad attitude towards life.

In short she’s a religious nutjob which I think probably has some mental issues based off of what she’s told me. My only outside time is at school (which I’m thankful for) but I still can’t do anything or even go on a walk outside alone.
I’ve tried talking to her with facts and statistics, but she dismissed them instantly and insists she is right (she’s the type that will never believe they are wrong) 

Recently she has been trying to control my older sister (she is 24)...she has a boyfriend and loves spending time with him, but my mom went apeshit over it and was really mad she wasn’t spending time with her. She even lied that I was sad that she wasn’t at home very often. She was also very mad that my sister was sleeping over at her boyfriends house, and threatened to kick her out because of it. As for my dad, he is...well....very verbally aggressive and can not control his emotions at all, and has wanted nothing more than to get rid of them since they started rebelling slightly as teenagers. Basically he wants to kick them out too.

So now that you have a little taste of what life has been like during quarantine and for a few years also, is there any way I could go about this?

I’m honestly just waiting for quarantine to end so I can walk out the front door and go chill outside. I don’t care if my mom is mad at this point, I’m just gonna tell her where I’m going and go walk outside. She will probably ground me forever (I’m not even joking) and if I keep doing it she will most likely change the code of the house (our house has a lock that you enter a code in to open the door) and not let me back in. Only reason I say that is because I’ve heard them several times discussing if they should just change the code whenever they get mad my sis is leaving and enjoying herself. I have no doubts that they would do the same to me.

She said I could go outside when I’m 16, but I don’t believe that. She told both my siblings the same thing but never let them leave the house. My sis got fed up and just went on a walk and my mom realized that she can’t do anything because she’s an adult. 

Also my mom constantly changes her tone from “gtfo” to “no please stay i don’t want wanna kick you out I’m trying not to” 

Honestly wtf do I do? Is there anything TO DO at this point with her? She’s so difficult and I’m honestly so fed up with her bullshit.

TL:DR my mom is trying to control my sister (24) and she won’t let me leave the house alone at all, not even to check the mail or grab a package from our doorstep. Read the post if you want a taste of what she’s like and her behavior. Wtf do I do?!

EDIT; she had a huge argument last night at like 1am, everyone in family was involved. She just texted me and said basically “don’t talk to your sisters about us or anything at all including us. For now on you must ask me if it’s okay to spend time with them, yes even for video games you must come to me and ask or there will be issues”. She’s paranoid that I’m somehow involved in their argument and basically told me that any interaction has to go through her, I think this is her way of trying to break our already shitty relationship.",22May2020,2
592,While I use gaming as a way to run away from problems and forget them It’s good to do every while here and there. But I have a problem where I don’t do anything else.

594,"18F. 
My family was never a peaceful one with a father who doesn't know how to express his emotions and a mother who is emotionally attached to everything that will threaten you if things don't go her way, divorced naturally. My dad's outstationed for his job leaving his car behind and my grandmother thought about his car being in the sun would be a problem. She told my aunt about it and she called my mom about the issue. The simplest solution was to park my dad's car in the shade where my mom's car is parked, solved. But of course this doesn't happen peacefully.
My mom has a thinking that my dad's side of the family spites her to death and would gladly want her out of the family (thus divorce), so when she heard this she was really annoyed and bought a car cover to shut their mouths. She also thinks that they are trying to take me away from her by influencing me, paranoid is what I can describe it so she naturally hates anyone in my family with my surname.
When my aunt came to drop off food she saw it and asked my mom about the issue, since she thought the cover would become an argument among my parents. She came to me first and explained the issue, my mom saw us and was pissed. My aunt came in peace just to explain the situation since she understands how my dad thinks and he'll be pissed about the cover. My mom didn't take it in very well and stormed off to swap the position of the cars saying to be ""They win, I've lost another daughter now"" (I have an older sister who has escaped this shitstorm) thinking that they've successfully influenced me to become apart of the family she hates.
I seriously don't know what to do anymore, my mom always had trust issues and had gone through depression after the divorce, now with this she'll hate me and I'm afraid she'll attempt to commit suicide or drive away to somewhere, she's done it before so I'm really scared. She accused me of in her own words after I explained I just listened to my aunt and never gave opinion ""do you want to make me have depression again?"" Just hearing those words break my heart, i want to make it better but I know she's bloody hard headed and doesn't take explanations easily so giving her both sides of the situation and finding a common ground ain't happening.  
My mom's emotionally attached to me and refuses to let go of me to have a life of my own, heck even closing my bedroom door and not showing her my projects gets her nerves. Having a ln unhealthy coping mechanism, she releases pressure by smoking in our bathroom, 3-6 times a day. 
The divorce happened when I was 14 and now I'm 18. Since then I've been the peacemaker and tried to solve everything as calmly as possible, going through my own depression of having hopeless parents and existential financial dread.  I'm really reaching my breaking point with this petty issue, my plans of jumping off a building is getting to me and honestly I can see a good point to it, my mom doesn't have to worry about losing a daughter to my dad's side and I get my peace, plus funeral fees are significantly lower than my current education fees. Thanks for reading, I gotta check if my mom has attempted to drown a bottle of hard liquor and smoke to die.",22May2020,1

598,"Hi! 

Basically, I was wondering if it would be possible to buy a plot of land in the UK and then get a bus and convert it into a house in which I can then rent out?? 

Obviously you have the problems of planning g permissions etc which I just worry they would decline ??? 

Would this be possible? How could I make it possible? Where can I find cheap land? Is there any cheaper ways to do this?

The plan is to be able to have passive income such as money from a rental (with no mortgage or anything as we would have bought land and converted everything with money up front). To then use that rental money to fund travelling Europe in a converted van we have. Then come back to our property possibly after our rentals contract is over and live in the UK for how ever long we want until we rent it out again and go travelling again.

599,"Today I was cleaning my 14 year sisters room and underneath her bed, I found a box with cigarettes and I think weed? Last year we found out that she was self harming and smoking and we thought she stopped and she even went to regular counselling which she was discharged from.

I myself am also a minor in the UK and my mum is a single mum doing a full time job. 


Is there any support in the UK, like a rehab or something that she can go to? And I don’t know how to tell my mum about the issue. My mum herself has so many health problems and is quite frail so I think she will be severely effected if she hears about this.

607,"I graduated from my university today and that would make the average person so happy to have done that. But me, I don’t feel anything even after I developed so much as a person while in school, I became more personal with how I feel to other people, I started talking to others, I cracked my shell but when it comes to stuff like this that involves my family, nothing. 

My family has made it a big deal throughout my childhood to, not drag me down for my accomplishments but they didn’t really care or show any appreciation. For my older and younger brothers, they’ve openly showed how much they care for them and what they do. I don’t know what made them change but they started to show some concern for me and for what I was doing but because how the way they treated me when I was younger, I just didn’t care and they stopped. So now that I’m graduating, I don’t feel anything not even a sense of pride, I wanna feel prideful of something I did. I even bought my cap and gown to see if I could get some reaction but when I put it on, nothing...just a fake smile for the pictures is all. 

What do I even do? Where do I even start?

(I would just like to state that I don’t want the build a good relationship with my parents, I gave up on the boat at my high school graduation where they kicked me out for a week because I didn’t want to follow their dream of me being a doctor and then told me to come back home)",22May2020,1
608,"Hey everyone. So, I made a post a while back about this girl who has given me the cold shoulder ever since we’ve met. Our husbands are childhood friends, and we’re all 24/25 years old. Both relationships have been going on for about 6/7 years, so we’ve known each other for that long. I get along really well with my husbands friend (her husband) but I don’t get along with her. We’re both quiet, so I think that set us off on the wrong foot when we first met. On top of that, I had severe depression &amp; social anxiety, so I wasn’t really reaching out to anyone for that matter. 

So, ever since the beginning we haven’t really talked. I decided at the start of the new year to message her, &amp; try &amp; get some sort of friendship going. I apologized for being stand-offish &amp; asked for a chance to hang &amp; get to know each other... so she barely responded to my long thought out message where I was trying to start a conversation by saying “sounds great!” A couple days later her husband texted my husband, and we went on a double date. I thought we had fun, I enjoyed myself. We were all talking &amp; messing around, drinking &amp; playing games. But after that, she started to ignore me even harder. She wouldn’t even say hello to me anymore in general settings. Like she’ll acknowledge me when they come over to our house, but that’s few &amp; far in between. Anytime we’re in a public setting, I’m ignored, no matter how hard I’m trying to say “hi” or be friendly. 

Now, I’m starting to notice very petty things on social media. Like, she has never liked a single one of my pictures with me in it. She’ll like a post about my husband or my dogs, but as soon as I am in the picture, it’s ignored. She’ll watch my stories, but a lot of the time I notice her copying them. Just a few days ago, she made an IG for her dog. I don’t usually care for pages like that, but since I’m trying to be a bigger &amp; nicer person, I followed it. Her dog is cute so why not? Well, she never followed me back. I may have searched too hard, but I noticed she followed the other wives back (we have a group of like 5 couple friends) &amp; all their husbands, &amp; had even posted, &amp; she still didn’t follow me back. She def saw it because she’s posting something multiple times a day everyday. 

It might be small, I can’t tell. I just have been trying so hard to overcome my SA and work on being more outgoing &amp; getting to know ppl past my comfort zone. All of her actions have me feeling kinda shitty. She’s making me feel like I’m a bad person to be around or something even though other people have been warming up to me &amp; talking with me. Idk. I’m over seeing her face everywhere when she makes me feel bad, &amp; I want to unfollow her on Instagram. Do y’all think this is childish? Or am I helping my mental health? Do you think it’s warranted, even though I will most def be in the same room as her in the future?",22May2020,2

TL;DR Mother in law is upset I didn’t want to cancel plans to accommodate her. Treats me like shit. I remain nice and calm. Eventually I canceled plans and she is still upset. I’m still upset, I feel disrespected and unvalued. 

For context: As of the last 3 months, my fiancé has had his daughter basically full time. His ex is falling off the rails, and has not made an effort to come see their daughter. She makes plans and consistently cancels or shifts them. Basically baby momma is losing it and we’re documenting everything. He is currently getting ready to go to court against his ex for full custody, so he’s been pretty stressed out. Mother in law is heavily involved in the daughters life, as she should be. But she tends to cross a line, and we’ve never stood up for ourselves. She comes over whenever she wants, no heads up. Walks in without knocking (she has a key). She will talk to baby momma behind fiancé’s back. She has previously talked badly about my family to fiance, to which I told fiance if she did it again I would go off. She hasn’t done it since so I’m assuming he said something. 

On Wednesday, baby momma wants to pick up the daughter for the first time in 23 days. She is custodial parent, so my fiancé really has no choice. My fiancé’s mother also wanted to see the daughter. So, we dropped daughter off at mother in laws house at 10:30am and baby momma picked up the daughter at 2pm from mother in law. 
All was well, until 9pm baby momma says she doesn’t feel good and she’s bringing daughter back. Says a bunch of crazy nonsense as well. Daughter shows up in bad condition. Same diaper she left mother in laws house in at 2pm, diaper rash, completely drenched as she peed through her diaper pants and on to the carseat (she had to borrow our car seat because she somehow forgot to bring her own??), filthy, and extremely fussy. 

So much more I could add, but this part doesn’t pertain to my mother in law issues.  It turns out baby momma had made plans for mother in law to babysit the following day. I kept mother in law updated when the daughter came back and daughters condition. Mother in law informed me that baby momma had made these plans but I didn’t read into it as we were very stressed out for daughter plus, daughter wouldn’t need a babysitter anymore. My fiancé was extremely angry and crying, and I was taking pictures of everything, getting daughter cleaned up and ready for bed. 

On Thursday, I had previously made plans with my own mom a week in advance. She was coming over, she lives far away from us and would be spending a good chunk of the day at our house. Daughter was originally included in these plans. Babymomma got daughter and daughter was no longer included in these plans. Now that daughter was back with us, she was included in these plans (again). My mom was excited to see my fiancé’s daughter, she’s only seen her 4 times ever. My mom had never even met daughter until April. My mom had bought clothes for daughter and was excited to have her try them on. My mother in law asked me if she could come get daughter, and I let her know my mom was coming over. I asked if she could get her Friday. She was noticeably upset.  I tell her I will check with my mom to see what time she’s coming over and let her know so we could try to figure something out. Mother in law gets angry with me over text. My fiancé was sitting right next to me as this was happening, and read all of the messages. 

Keep in mind, fiancé is still very stressed about his daughter and his babymomma. Fiancé messages his mom and tells her she’s out of line and needs to apologize. With everything he has to deal with, he tells her he doesn’t want to deal with her drama. Mother in law tells my fiancé that i can go fuck myself. Mother in law text me blowing up. I’ll insert the text below. Removing names of everyone involved. 


Mother in law: “Leave me alone right now! If you ever take a disagreement that we have like that to FIANCE again we will not have a relationship. I have never talked bad about you! I have never done anything but welcomed you into this home with open arms. I have never done anything but love you for how you love FIANCE and how you love DAUGHTER. I would never in a million years have expected to be told that you are telling FIANCE I have talked bad about you. I am floored at that accusation. I am upset over always being second to your mother when it comes to my grandchild. DAUGHTER is not her grandchild, she is mine and just once I’d like to be first. This was something between you and I and I wanted to step back because I felt myself getting angry and because I love you I didn’t want to. I dont know what apology you think you deserve from me because I said nothing wrong to you and I have never done anything to you. So I guess I don’t know where that leaves us. I told you yesterday BABYMOMMA said I could have DAUGHTER today. Your mom coming over to try clothes on won’t take up a whole day. I only wanted her for a couple of hours. I’m so disappointed in you. I’m extremely hurt and you running to FIANCE like that made this so much worse.”

I went through all of my text, and fiancé’s text and wrote down every day mother in law has seen daughter in the last 2 months. She has either come over or daughter has gone to her house 26 times. Compared to the 4 days my mother has seen daughter, she was obviously overreacting. 

This was my response
 “He (FIANCE) was talking to me as we continued to text and he requested to see the messages. I never accused you of talking badly about me. He asked me to see the messages as we were talking because we were trying to plan for you to get her today. My mom had never even met DAUGHTER until April 26th. She’s only seen her 4 times ever. I didn’t know you wanted DAUGHTER to try on clothes, my mom just wanted to because the store she got them from isn’t close to our house and she would have to be the one to return them, not FIANCÉ or I. If you want DAUGHTER to try on the clothes you’ve gotten we definitely can. You’ve basically bought her whole wardrobe and we love everything you have gotten her. She gets good use out of it and you know her size and what will fit her because you see her. You are Gracies grandmother. My mom is not. My mom is not trying to be her grandmother, she is just trying to help and make an effort to be in my life. The 4 times DAUGHTER has seen my mom are the only days I’ve seen my mom since Christmas. I can count on my fingers how many times I’ve seen my mom in the past year. The times my mom has seen DAUGHTER is only because we have to go over there to do something or help her out and DAUGHTER is with us 24/7 now. 
You don’t have to apologize to me at all. I’m sorry I upset you so deeply. I want you to know, I didn’t go running to FIANCE to “tell on you”. He woke up, came into the living room And were talking about the day and trying to figure out how to make everyone happy. I’m sorry it’s even gotten to this point.  My intentions were never to upset you or start an argument between anyone. 
I love you very much, I consider you a mother to me! You do so much for all of us and we know it.  I’m not mad at all. It made me really sad to see how upset I’ve made you. I told my mom to forget about today so you can get DAUGHTER whenever. When everyone has cooled off maybe we can talk about some schedule or preferences we all have so everyone is content and prevent this from happening in the future.”

At this point plans with my mother were canceled to make mother in law happy. 

Mother in law responds “I will call you in a few minutes when I can stop crying and talk. Please don’t cancel your mom. I don’t think I’d feel up to coming out there now. I’m pretty shaky. We can talk later. “

I cannot let this go! I was nice because I didn’t want to stress my fiancé out any more than he already is. I also feel my relationship with mother in law is important and i didn’t want to say anything I would regret. I feel like I let her walk all over me, and didn’t step up for myself or my mother! I was so hurt by the messages mother in law sent my fiancé and I , I ended up crying myself. I could’ve told my mom she could come over still, but I didn’t feel up to it anymore either. I just cried for the better half of the night because I feel so overwhelmed. 

Dealing with fiancé and babymomma issues, having to accommodate everyone constantly. Baby momma will not talk to fiance, so she messages me. I have to be the one to plan for her to get her even though she constantly cancels. Baby momma is custodial parent (a bad one at that) and I have to walk on egg shells and accommodate her because she has the ability to take daughter away. Because of this, mother in law text me constantly every day asking for details on baby momma, daughter, and she also makes plans for daughter with me. She plans with fiancé, but he isn’t the best to plan with because he rarely checks his phone or replies to text. I have to plan and accommodate with my family to whom I barely see anymore because I’m constantly seeing fiancé’s family, leaving my family to feel alienated. 

I don’t know what to do, my feelings are hurt. I feel everything I do for mother in law goes unnoticed by her and she disrespected me. I have not talked to her or replied since her last text. Fiancé doesn’t know what to do, and honestly has more important things to worry about. Mother in law comes over whenever she wants, no heads up or warning. Every parenting move my fiancé makes she judges and degrades. I myself make decisions for daughter when fiance is at work. For example, what she eats, what she does, etc. mother in law has something to say about everything!! I feel like I’ve been worn thin.",22May2020,1
613,"I had a summer romance with a guy when I studied abroad in France (I am currently a rising junior in college). We had the most amazing time. I feel that it was the first time I had felt this way about someone, everything seemed so romantic and spontaneous, very movie-like- as if it were a dream.

After spending the summer together, we continued talking a few months after until he ghosted me out of the blue, with no reason. I sent him a message afterward wishing him the best, and he replied after a while apologizing for ghosting me. He said he would never do it again, that he felt terrible about it. He was feeling emotionally down and said he didn't want to contaminate me with his negative energy since I am such a person of light in his eyes. He said he was going to do everything in his power to win me back over again and I agreed, saying I forgave him and that everyone goes through tough times, but that he could be open with me. I did tell him- if you ever do need to stop talking to me, which I completely understand if you need that space- just be honest with me so I can get closure. A day after that- he ghosted me again.

Months went by and the pandemic came around so I sent him a message to know how he was doing. He was studying abroad in Italy, the center of the pandemic, so I was worried. I didn't expect to have any kind of relationship again, I just wanted to make sure he hadn't fallen ill. He replied that he was well and then began texting me. We began talking to each other once again, but I didn't expect much from him, and I would speak to him with the thought in mind that at any moment he would ghost me again.

Then he had this talk with me saying that he always pushed people away. That he would stop talking to his friends even, because he would just go into this state of mind (he said it was some combination of narcissism and drift) Then he brought up that he ghosted me a while back, apologized, said he felt terrible about it, and that he wouldn't do it again. He said that he really valued me and that he wanted to be a good friend at least for me. We had actually made plans that I would go to France to do a semester abroad soon, and he was even looking into opportunities and housing for me over there. He seemed very invested. I told him I didn't expect him to be there for me because he had made those promises before and failed- all I asked for was honesty and in the case he needed space and to not talk, closure. He agreed but said he wouldn't ghost me again. Two weeks later, he did just that and stopped talking to me, for no reason. 

It has been bothering me that I didn't get any closure and I don't need him in my life, I have learned to let go, it's fine, even though it hurts. But I am not sure if I should text him asking him to say our goodbyes or if that's too dramatic? Just so I could get some closure because it has been on my mind constantly. I begin wondering if I did something wrong, but I also have my pride. Should I or should I not write him?  What should I say?",22May2020,3
614,"So I haven't had my first kiss yet but the porn I watched messed with my brain a bit and made me agree and from texting I think he thinks that I'm going to have sex with him and I don't want to do that and I'm worried that he would want to stop being friends if I say no even though he probably wouldn't but I just feel a very nervous about everything and doubt it but I know if he wanted to he could do anything to me and he knows I would never tell my parents.

617,"Big note here : I apologize for the impolite title, but I don't know how to put it in a better way. I don't live in the US, and be prepared, there is some absurd level of mindfuckery happening. Beware massive text wall.

So first off, I had to send some very personal files via mail to an office before May 28. The office closes at 3 pm on the 20th due to stuffs (I learned the reason later on below). The mailing service can't promise about delivery time, still I took the risk and sent it anyway on the 19th, since I thought that even if it didn't come at time it'll get redelivered the next day.

As any of my previous bet has gone, it failed miserably as the package was delivered on 8 pm. Ofc the place is closed, and even worse, later on I was told that the place is going to be closed from 21 to 27 due to covid and national holiday. Fuck.

Anyway, I thought that was the end for me before I realized that I could just return the stuff to myself and send it on the 27th again with overnight mail. So I requested a Return to Sender on the 21st. Early morning this day (22nd), somehow my mail was getting REDELIVERED despite my call the previous day.

And also somehow, SOMEHOW there's a person in the office who received the package. Even though they strictly said it was closed. Despite being enraged to both the mailing service and the office, I was glad that my mail arrived. I thought that all this fuckery was over, and I breathe a sigh of relief. Oh boy, how wrong I was.

At noon (timezone diffs, GMT+8) I checked my airwaybill, without any particular reason. And then, there it is. Somehow my mail which was already delivered, IS CANCELLED and is back to the delivery person, for the 3rd time. Just wh... How the fuck?

What it looks like to me is that after I request Return to Sender, the girl at Customer Service got lazy and reported the request late to the Delivery person, who took back my mail after it had been delivered. That, or my Delivery person was just garbo in his job and didn't notice the request earlier and didn't bother to call me for clarification, at all. I do have part of the blame for sending it on the 19th though, won't dodge that.

At this moment I'm just so done trying to resolve all this bullshit, and I'm so stressed since those files are  extremely personal and important. How do I go from here? Return to Sender may take up to 6-7 days now, and mailing service won't keep my stuffs any longer at the warehouse.",22May2020,1
618,So this has been happening a lot lately. But it's usually along a long sidewalk. This feeling starts at the bottom of my spine and works it's way into my brain. The only signal sent is to run. However I know I'm not in any danger. I usually have my dog with me whenever I feel like this and I know he feels it too. I know there has to be a reasonable explanation for this.

622,"(TL;DR At the bottom) My sister (24) in a nutshell is a very laid back/lazy person, she hasn't found a job yet, she's always on her phone talking with her sucky friends, and she always prioritizes her friends over us. She has always brought trouble to our family circle and it's often about her making decisions for her own benefit or for her friend's. She doesn't listen to us when we try to give her advice or when we don't tolerate her behavior. She's like a child when they get passive aggressive and cover their ears, blocking whatever others have to say.

My father is a pacifist, a really religious person and he talks behind my sister's back. He complains about her not helping with chores and when she spends an entire day on her phone. Deep down he's so done with her but he keeps tolerating her behavior. He always comes up for excuses for her like, ""She's young and when we're young we are carefree. I would've probably done the same as she did if I was her age.""

He constantly validates her selfish behavior but if I (20) want to make a selfish decision or if I mess up about something he becomes incredibly distant and cold. He shows disappointment all over as if I was his only hope. It makes me feel incredibly responsible for the overall happiness in my home because it's like I have to compensate for the times my sister messed up so I can balance it out and make everyone happy. Many times I've stayed silent to avoid hurting anyone's feelings but the other day I exploded.

I argued with her when she told us about another selfish decision she wanted to make. She wanted to go to a friend's house where they don't care about the virus and don't take the right precautions to protect themselves. There are 12 individuals living in that house, one of them gets involved with the wrong crowd for drugs. I ended up insulting her, I offended her after trying to explain a hundred times how risky her decision was. So many things I had bottled up spilled all over that day.

At the end, my dad focused on how wrong it was of me to insult my sister and brushed off the fact that my sister put us all in risk of catching the virus after visiting her friend. We both cried out of anger that day. My dad comforted my sister while I cried alone in my room. Now we're in a very hostile situation, we're not talking to each other and I'm avoiding dad. I'm starting to feel guilty and I don't know what to do.

TL;DR My sister makes risky decisions and prioritizes other people. My dad comes up for excuses for her behavior. If I mess up I'm one big disappointment for my dad. She put us all in risk of the virus, my dad excused her and focused on how I messed up for insulting my sister in an argument we had. I feel responsible for the overall stability and happiness of my family circle.

(2) he wouldn't be able to drive to were he will be at and he hasn't been able to find a reasonably priced car with only 12 days left until he would have to leave.

629,"so me and my crush I lll call her jam cause y not. Are really close and became good friends, um so I was going through airborne training a few weeks ago, and I had confessed to jam that I had a crush on her(since I thought I was gonna die jumping out of the plane) , but that I couldn't be in a relationship at the time, since I wanted to learn more about her, she had a positive response to this and now we talk every day, but a little before I confessed she had broke up with her ex since she wasn't sure if she loved him at the time. but now she is trying again with him to see if she can fall back in love with him as jam worded it. But it's been about a week since she has made that decision, and her mental state still seems to be a mess. I think it's harming her more than helping, but I'm not the type to be a homewrecker that's a fucked up thing to do. So I've just been patiently waiting for my chance

Normal I would just say fuck it and move on tho the next person, but jam has been a large motivation in my life woth her art, and recently she has become not only my idol but her personality and physical appearance is the definition of my dream girl. She has even excepted me for who I am like she is perfect. She's is the only person I've ever considered to be my wife in the future. Knowing she is taken should of removed my crush but my love for her is burning stronger than ever

Tho when I have to much time to think I wonder if waiting for her is really the best idea. It could be a few weeks before I have my chance or a few months, or a few years

I'm working on myself atm while I'm waiting working out, and talking courses to improve my art

She told me those wrappers must have been in there for months, which sounds unlikely since I usually do her laundry and check her pockets.

I usually trust her but this is just too fishy. Do I need to someone make sure she isn't sneaking out, or do I take her word for it?

I'm 21 and my girlfriend is 23. She is amazing. Total wife material in my eyes. Great mind set. Bright future. The thing is recently I've been feeling conflicted.

It's not like I stopped noticing attractive people once I got in my relationship but I would just push it deep down and remember I'm committed.

The thing is I met a girl at a party who was totally DTF and I didn't but, I really wanted too. And it just made me question was I even ready to be in a relationship.

I'm torn because I obviously love and see my girlfriends potential. I'm also not interested in these other women emotionally just physically. I think part of this stems from the fact that I've only been with two women my entire life so I'm curious. Whats sex like with different people? What do different girls feel like?

632,"A very good childhood friend of mine (we have been friends since 6 years old) was suppose to get married in July. However, they had to postpone that to next summer due to COVID-19. She was also planning a getaway weekend for her bachelorette party that was suppose to be this coming weekend, but that was also cancelled.

Her maid of honor (someone who I have known since I was 3) is planning a surprise get together at the bride's house this weekend. I am not sure how many people will be coming, but maybe around 10-15? The bride lives on a huge farm, so I think the plan is to hang out outside.

However, with COVID-19 I think this is a horrible idea. I am an epidemiologist and feel very uneasy by this whole thing. Case counts are decreasing slightly, but still too high to go out comfortably and parties definitely shouldn't be happening. The only person I have been in close contact with in the past 2.5 months is the one person I live with. I have seen my family, but always in parking lots and we've stayed 2 meters away from each other. It is absolutely critical that people DO NOT socialize in person with anyone they do not live with. In addition, where I live, you're not allowed to be in groups greater than 5 people.

The MoH asked me about 2 weeks ago if I would be available on that weekend for this gathering and I said I am available, but it also depend on where we are with COVID-19 at that time. She said she plans to have a social distancing get-together (I doubt this will actually work out this way - I doubt people will follow this once there). Plus, there is suppose to be a thunderstorm the day of the get-together. If this happens, it will be the worst idea for all of us to hang out inside of the house. Some of these people also work jobs where they're unable to work from home so interact with a lot of people daily, increasing the chance they spread it.

I understand her MoH wants to do something nice for her, but this is the worst time and it's a horrible idea. I already said I would go (plus she checked in with me about a week ago to see if I had allergies so it is not like I didn't hear from her for 2 weeks - I had a chance to see I am not going anymore). I very firmly believe EVERYONE should be staying home. This is my specialty. I have a graduate degree in it. I don't feel completely comfortable going to this thing. Sure, I could try to maintain social distancing, but there may be some situations that day where that isn't possible. Plus, it could rain and we would be stuck inside (the worst thing that could happen).

What should I do? Should I go anyways? If I don't go, what should I say to the MoH who is trying to do something really nice? This is just a really crappy situation to be in.

634,"I am [19F] and my bf is [20M]. I am a bit shamed to say this but I’ve been meeting him behind my parents back whenever they’re out to work, or outside of the house in general. My parents are not strict to the point where they won’t allow me to date, but I never felt comfortable sharing that part of my life with my parents. I always had the habit of lying to my parents to not disappoint them. It really backfired on me. Both of my parents grew up in asia and came here when I was 11. Understandably, we are very within the asian culture of being not sexually active, and being sexually active is looked down upon especially for females. I am also an only child. My parents are understandably protected over me.

I fucked up by letting my mom find my plan B box, she was infuriated mostly because I had sex without protection with being it my first time. (this is a lie and i lost my virginity when I was 18). She was SO disappointed and hurt from this and I feel really guilty. The anger was fair on her part, and i understand her anger 100% 

She wanted me to break up with my bf first, but she calmed down later and told me to never do it again. And asked me if I can act like a “young adult”. Then, something happened, she got suspicious and doesn’t trust me now. Now, she wants to meet him with my dad 2 days from now. And I am CRAZY nervous. 

The part I am truly nervous about is how my bf is on polar with my parent’s views on freedom. He doesn’t understand asian culture no matter how much i tell him. He’s too confident and oblivious to the seriousness of the situation. I am scared that he’s gonna offend my parents or vice versa. He wants to come clean about everything we have been doing. 

I sound/look very stupid and careless reading over this. Please criticize my actions if deemed necessary. I regret so much over everything and how this fucked my relationship between my mother and me(it was already bad). It was me being not communicative and non-confrontational.

640,"So recently my girlfriend broke up with me and I tried asking why she did. So I could get closure on the reason she did. Now, I know myself, I know how I treated her. I treated with upmost respect, was faithful, would’ve done anything for her, protected her and made sure she was always safe, gave her the freedom everyone wants, and just cared, loved and gave her everything I could. She told me she broke up with me because “I would push her problems away” but every time she came to me with a problem, I would defuse it, it was always “you don’t show you care” but that’s the thing. I would always caress her hair, call her beautiful randomly, stare at her and every time she would tell me to stop, I’d tell her i was starring because her beauty fascinates me, I did more but it’s a lot to type. Basically I did everything I could to show her I loved and cared for her. Then another reason was “I just wanna be alone, I’ve been in relationships after relationships.” But that doesn’t make sense to me now Bc here she is talking to some random dude that is “just a friend”. And another reason was that “you are a lazy fuck who does nothing but play video games, eat and sleep” so I got laid off because of the pandemic. So I decided to enroll in college in HVAC so I could get my life started a different way (I’m 20). Apparently me sitting at my desk doing homework almost everyday along with tests. And then after all that, playing video games WITH MY GIRLFRIEND. Is me only playing video games eating and sleeping. And also. I clean up around the house too so it’s not like I sit there all day, I tend to my dogs, cats and my snake. But she said all that, but she hasn’t had a job in two years, is in nursing school and her family is rich. I’ve always been on the poor side of life so maybe that’s something that had to do with it? Idk. All these changes in moods during our relationship started in my opinion, when she started hanging with this new friend. Her new friend has 15 different guys who are all her friends. No girls. Which is fine. Except she fucks all of them whenever. Which is absolutely fucking disgusting. So I have a feeling her friend wanted my girlfriend to dump me so they could have that “hot girl summer”. Anyways, a week later. I get a text from my ex, she tells me I’m disrespectful, an asshole, and just the worst boyfriend. And this really hurt my heart. Because I’m such a nice person, and I’ve never down talked her once, she came at me with hate over nothing. And then she told me to get a life. I have a life, I play with the boys and hang out with them when I can, and plus I was in college. I’m just emotionally a wreck right now and if anyone has any advice for me or can help me come to a conclusion on what it may be.

Im not anti weed, but when you are jobless because of it, theres somethin to think about.) for the past 6 or so years.

I didnt expect anything from him because of his financial situation (even though he manages to always have money for weed). Anyway, earlier this year, me and my gf was planning a baby shower, i mentioned it to him and asked him to come and he gave me a poor excuse about his health (sinus polyps) saying he would be sniffing and sneezing every 5 minutes. I thought it was bullshit but let it go. A couple mos later, i was sending out the invites via text and i sent him one and no answer. 

However, he would text me here and there about little stuff like basketball and news, But he wouldnt mention the baby shower. I told him not to worry about getting a gift, i just wanted him to be there to support me and see friends we havent seen in awhile. He said he would come, but i sensed some bullshit in his tone. 

More and more time would lapse without contact, and when the baby shower finally came and gone, although it was a success and was very fun. still no contact from him and he never showed. By that time, i decided not to reach out because im disappointed that he didnt come. He didnt bother to hit me up telling me he couldnt/wouldnt come or at least a congrats afterwards.

She has been talking throughout the night over the past week and I told my mom about it so she went in to check her phone and talk to my sister. (My sisters phone locks at night but she is able to make calls, it being locked is due to prior mistrust with my sister) she found that my sister has been sending sexual texts and other things to this California number (we're from Ohio) and my sister has explained that it is her friend Alex (Alex is apparently trans and has influenced my sister to think she is trans as well but shes a cisgender girl. Shes basically a trender right now) my sister told my mother Alex used to go to her school but moved although we have never heard of this person before and myself and my mother dont believe that.

So, my parents are nearing a divorce. The only reason why they are staying together now is because of my 9 year old brother. 
Lately, my father has been staying some nights at this other woman's place because they are starting a business-- which is true.. however.. My mother found for the second time now a pack of viagra pills in my dad's toiletry bag, which he is very suspicious around to begin with. My mom knows he has a relationship with her, she's fine with it, what hurts her is that he keeps lying about it and everything even though he knows he does not have to. He lies when she confronts him about it too. I hate to see my mom so upset.. she turned to cigarettes and alcohol now because of this. 

Here is where I ask for advice; How do I help my mom and brother if I can? How can stay calm during this? Right now I'm stuck at home doing online university work due to the lockdown. This is making me so depressed, I just want to not exist right now let alone do my degree.",22May2020,2

I have a degree in marketing and management which I sadly will not have need for in the rural area I wanna live in, and that's why I am here on reddit to gather advice. 

I spent all my life living in a city and honestly I wake up depressed every single day, I consider most people evil and greedy and I just want to live in peace in a rural area, have some land to live of it and enjoy rest of my life. 

I have no idea how to grow enough food that can sustain me (yes I am alone, no kids and no girlfriend). My main concern is not having a house (I have saved up for it) and also I am not scared to live alone. I will get a dog that I always wished for. 

So my questions are the following:

1. How do I learn to grow food in a place where 4 seasons occur per year?
2. How do I make a living in a rural area with no traditional job in a company, but have to sustain myself economically and more
3. Is it possible for me to learn how to survive in the ""wild"" by myself at this age (31) without prior experience in ANY form in this subject? (I lived in city and have a degree in marketing and management)

656,"I’m 22M and my older brother is 28M. This goes far beyond normal sibling bickering, my brother has been in many fights, has been constantly kicked out and is currently homeless, he talks about his third eye and how he uses it to talk to animals. He’s just an extremely aggressive and violent dude, super provocative and confrontational.

Because he’s homeless and can’t stay anywhere without getting kicked out he’s once again been stayin with me and my parents, where he essentially makes life hell for us, he talks out loud and talks shit, argues with my mom etc, for years he’s made us uncomfortable and on our toes, he’s destroyed property, threatened us etc. 

This started because he was harassing my mom, she had been nursing a bird back to life and it’s about ready to fly off but my mom didn’t want to let it go just yet, but my brother being who he is takes the bird, and like a kid he threatens to let it go and is raising it in the air so my mom can’t get it, laughing and all that, this was in the kitchen so I was there to get water. I telling him to relax and that he needs to stop, and so he does the usual by staring me down, getting this real crazy look in his eyes, and moving close to me.

Now keep in mind, he’s done this to me for years, if I stand up, oppose him, breathe incorrectly, he puffs up, stares me down, pushes me gets in my face and is just like “sO wHaTs uP” 

So at this point I’m close to snapping, I’m not physically opposing and he has lots of fighting experience, but I’m tired of him coming in dragging his balls, making lives hell because my mom is foolishly trying to help him.

Instead of backing off this time I decided to punch him, it just sorta happened, we exchanged for a tiny bit and he hit me with a good one and knocked me down, he does his pigeon dance and he’s kicked out.

My question is: I don’t feel any better, he isn’t going to change if anything he’s going to want to fight me more. I want nothing to do with this guy, my entire life he’s been this slightly deranged animal, for years been harassing me and my parents. Do I get a restraining order?

I find it extremely hard to care about anything else. I really disliked high school other than a broadcasting class I took my junior year that made me excited to go to school for the first time ever.  After I graduated high school my parents pushed me to go to college for comp sci. I fucking hated it so much. I made it through about two years before failing out because I just couldn't bare to go to my classes anymore. During this time I started dabbling more with video editing. Nothing huge but it was actually the first thing I really enjoyed in my life that didn't feel like a waste of time.

I passed a voice audition to qualify for the job. I was actually excited But things just never seem to go right.

Last year, my Mom had enough of my Dad and she requested a divorce. My dad refused to divorce her because he claimed ""he couldn't afford a divorce lawyer,"" so my they agreed on divorcing without a lawyer and just paying the court fees. I'm not sure if this was the best way, but my Mom certainly didn't still does not have enough money so I understood. So there is no alimony. Tbf, my dad is awful and I would happily never see him again.

The problem is my Mom needs to find her **own** place to live. My mom and I currently SHARE my childhood bedroom because of the divorce. He sleeps in the other bedroom. (2/2 townhome) My father is the breadwinner of the family.

I'm a new medical resident and my plan was to take her with me to my new state and start a new life together. That would require my mom to quit her job here (she makes $14/hr) and find a new one. However, COVID happened and jobs aren't exactly easy to come by (she is a bookkeeper -- she got the job while studying accounting but that has been put on hold as well). She doesn't have any formal degree either. She told me would have to stay in FL for her job and not move with me. I went ahead and signed a lease for a 1/1. We're paying $700 for this room monthly (half the mortgage, split between my mom and me).

Now that I'm moving out again, my dad is demanding that she leave the house. He doesn't wish to be with her alone (he is already seeing someone else).

My question is: should I just bring her with me and have her sacrifice her job? (She has an expensive car lease -- dont ask) or pay her monthly so she can live on her own in an apartment? (I was thinking like $350 or $400). I feel like it would be nice to have my Mom home after I come from seeing patients. She could also take care of my dogs and not worry about having to pay rent. On the other hand, she will have to find a job eventually. If she stays here, she can have her independence. Another thing is she feels tremendous guilt for putting all this pressure on me (I don't really mind). What is the best option?

Well first of all i suppose, they have known each other for a very long time (since they were 7 years old). They got married a couple of years before i was born, and from what i know, they always had marriage troubles. I remember them fighting all the time when i was younger, these days they don't even fight they barely speak to each other, and i know she's been thinking of getting a divorce for years now. They don't sleep in the same bed, i know he's seeing other women (with her ""permission""), and they pretty much behave like roommates who happen to have two kids together.

This however, is new. She always used to criticize him for the same things, but those were regular things, some stupid habits and quirks that began to frustrate her over time, and now she's suddenly saying that he's abusive towards my sister? I know my dad, he's not perfect, and he can be a bit dismissive and emotionally unavailable at times, but he's not a violent man. He never even touched my sister, or my mom for that matter. I'm sure i don't know him in the same way that my mom does, but we all live together, i would have noticed something was going on. My sister would have told me if something happened, she tells me absolutely everything.

Maybe the worst part of this mess, is my mom expects me to be on her side and support her. Which i can and will do, i can be there for her, and be her shoulder to cry on. I can't however, see my father as an abuser, because i truly don't think he is one.

A few days ago I got back into programming in a sudden surge of motivation, but knowing myself it won't last long. To be completely honest, I'm already struggling. I don't want to give up but it always ends up in that. And it's not just programming, it's learning in general.

I'm doing an online course which had already taught me a lot but at first I set a goal of ""1 chapter a day"", then practicing until I'm comfortable using what I learned. Then it went to ""10 lessons in one go"", then ""10 lessons a day"", and now I'm at the point where I'm going ""5 lessons in one go 10-15 lessons a day"". This last bit is better but still not the best.

So it gradually decreased. Since I really want to learn I want to get motivated.

I have tried a few things like setting an alarm, doing the ""work"" before the fun, taking it slower but more consistent, turning learning into a habit but somehow I lost motivation. Currently I'm really curious about the habit-building thing because I think that can probably help me best but I'm not sure.

So, what are some neat little tips N tricks you stay motivated?

680,"It’s a bit of a long story, but I wanna know if my dad is in the wrong or not.

I ordered pizza today for my family from a shop that is literally two blocks away, but we can’t go pick it up due to the stay at home orders in our country. We needed it by 6:30, so I set the delivery time for 5:45.

By 6:00, the pizza still hasn’t arrived, and we were getting a little desperate ‘cause we had to share w a few other people. We called to check up on it, but we were kept on hold for maybe 10 minutes. My dad got mad at this, and when a guy finally picked up, he started yelling at the poor guy on the phone, stuff about customer service and how they were ruining the name of the company and all that. The guy on the phone was kind of rude, I’ll admit, because this is one of the busiest times of the day, but my dad was scary angry. The employee said the order was on its way and quickly slammed the phone down, ignoring my dad when he asked for a manager.

It’s 7:45 now, and the pizza still isn’t here. My dad managed to find a manager’s number and is now ranting to him on the phone, and I’m terrified that my greed for some pizza could cause a poor guy to lose his job. Is my dad a Karen? And if he is, how do I stop him?",22May2020,0
682,"My partner and I love on a blueberry farm. We live for free in a tiny house in exchange for grounds keeping on the farm. The owner of the farm does not profit off his farm, he keeps it for hobby. When we moved here, we were told we could have free rent and eat as many of the berries/eggs we wanted in exchange for 80 hrs / month of work (sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on weather and what is needed). We are not paid but we’re told we could profit off the farm if we wanted to. The farm is 15 years old and we do the majority of the work. 

We would like to try to make a profit selling blueberries this year to local grocery stores. The farm owner said we could do something like this as long as we told him and cut him in. We would be picking the berries, at a rate of ~4 lbs/hr/person, and selling them for hopefully 4.50 per lb. The owner of the farm would not be picking. 

My question is, what would be a fair cut? My partner and I share finances, so we would be considered 1 cut, while the owner of the farm would be a second. We would pick as many berries as we were able to, which would leave more than enough for him to use them for his normal annual wine-making and other uses. I want to get some advice on what a fair percentage would be before we approach him, so I am well prepared and don’t agree to anything that is not in our best interest.

684,"A couple days ago, I was getting drug tested for a job. It’s a position at a hospital, and I was getting drug tested by employees there (not at a 3rd party clinic) Out of the group of 4, I was the only young person there. I was also the only person that wasn’t there for a nursing position. A couple things occurred that I thought was inappropriate. Firstly, they mentioned numerous times, in-front of the other applicants, that I wasn’t there for nursing, even though we were only getting drug tested (not interviewed). I also brought my vaccine records (I was the only one to do so, because they called us a only day before to let us know we needed to come in to drug test). However, I was the only one made to take a blood test to “verify” my record, even though I was up to date on everything. The thing that pissed me off the most though was the fact that when I was actually taking the drug test, they made me go back in the bathroom to produce more urine. Fine, whatever. But when I was in the bathroom, I could hear them making fun of my voice, and laughing. The part of the hospital we were in was quiet, and the door had gaps on them. I have a lower voice for a woman, but I don’t think that’s any of their business either. They also held my urine up in front of the whole group, and opened it up and temperature checked it. I was extremely embarrassed, and thrown off. I was the only person they did this too. After this experience, I’m really questioning whether I should even take the job. I haven’t said anything to HR, because the same nurses will be doing my orientation next Monday. Am I overreacting, or should I be concerned?",22May2020,1

686,"I've  had two parakeets for years. These birds have got me through the worst  points of my life. I have a history of self-harm and when I'm alone thinking about doing it I often sit by their cage and talk to them to relax. They have kept me from cutting myself so many times. I have extremely bad depression and anxiety.

My mother works at a little hardware store that often has stray cats in their gardening area. My mom fell in love with two kittens. A week or so ago  she asked me about us getting them. I said I would be very uncomfortable doing so because of my birds. I stay in my room a lot of the time but I  like to leave my door open sometimes because it gets very stuffy and I  need airflow. I also leave my door open when she is at work because I  have to look out for my disabled younger brother. She told me I could just leave my door closed. However, I said I like to leave it open and sometimes I forget. That I don't want to live in fear trying to remember if I closed it or not. Also have my room get all stuffy. She said okay and I walked away thinking the conversation was over and that she wouldn't get them. At the very least she would come to me again to talk before doing anything.

At the time of writing she has just gotten back from the store. She had cat food  which I didn't think much of since we feed neighborhood cats. However, I  noticed she had a little box scoop. I asked her what it was about. She said for the two kittens and we would be getting them in about a month. I  freaked out on her. They said I was being controlled and it is their money so they can do whatever they want with it. They told me to leave them alone and go to my room. I am terrified that they'll go out and get them without telling me because of this.

I  feel like she is putting my birds' lives at risk. Even if they don't get through the cage and attack them. Birds can be stressed out very easily. Birds can also self-harm and pluck out their feathers. Or do other self-destructive acts if they get too stressed. I still don't want to have to live in fear of this happening. I'm terrified of losing them. I love them so much! I would be devasted if they got too stressed or worse if something awful happened. I had a panic attack when I  confronted them about this. I still am going through one while writing. I  am still a minor so I can't leave and I refuse to give my birds up.

I don't know what to do. I really need some advice. Am I being unreasonable asking them to not get the cats?

Edit: We talked. She is going to crate train them and keep them in her room so I can leave my door open if needed. If anything happens we'll go from there. Thanks for helping me realize I was being unreasonable! It's hard for me to realize that sometimes because of my anxiety disorder.",22May2020,2
687,"Hi,
Basically I'm a bit stuck on what to do.

At the moment I'm going out with someone who I love, like a lot. It's not just me saying I love someone cus they look pretty or because I just have a crush, I love this person.

I've made some mistakes that I kinda dont wanna talk much on, but it was because I wasnt and still am not sure how she feels for me. 

Like I feel like I'm being pulled back and forth emotionally. I feel like I'm being used in a way, and I'm not usually the sort of person that takes it, but it's because for the first time I'm in love.

Really, i want to spend my life with her. But I'm not sure she does and think very soon she will dump me or cheat on me. 
I feel underappreciated, uve done so much for her, been there for her, bought really good expensive nice stuff,and then when I ask for something usually it's like I have to put up a fight for just the simplest thing. Its that she doesnt do the se for me. Everytime I speak to her it's like the only way she doesnt seem bored us if I say in gonna buy her stuff.

Like 8 say, usually if this was someone else, I wouldnt put up with this. But I cant help how I feel. I'm so scared and worried because soon I think were not gonna be together. And I feel, if I'm honest suicidal. 

I just want to spend my life with her .

What I was gonna ask is, should I try and change.
I try my hardest to please her but dont seem like she notices.

Should I try and be exactly who she wants, be perfect formr her. Try and do everything she wats cus I dont think i cld bear not being with her.

I feel like I just bring her down. Tmthings are weird now.

Should I become almost a different person, so that maybe I hv a chance if staying with her a bit longer.

So, to help with the money issue while working on my portfolios, I want to start doing Commission work - more for digital art since I don't have to worry about sending things through the mail (though I also paint and work with clay in my spare time, so that's a future possibility...). 

I've never done Commissions before though (at least not for strangers, people I know have hired me to do charcoal pet portraits and I'd normally charge about $30, since it'd only take me about 2 hours to do a single portrait). I'm just scared I'll be charging too much. 

So, I want to ask: [Take a look at my example price template](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAf2QtyFrp2/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), and tell me if you think the pricing is fair. 

The pricing is based on how much work, time, and skill I'll have to put in. It can't really take into account the individual complexities of each project I'll be asked to do.

692,"I think I am such an idiot that I could very well be Darwin Awards nominee. 
Couple of years ago I arrived in Canada with the intention to study in university and get a degree,  but the new environment, homesickness, depression, cultural differences, “long desired freedom” and countless other reasons, that in hindsight are just smart sounding excuses, created changes in those plans. 

During the first year in uni I got into drugs, alcohol and parties. Nothing serious drugs and alcohol wise but by the end of the year it was certain that I am not gonna make it to a second year and would have to leave Canada and go back home. I didn’t want that. Like a complete idiot I simply said to my parents that everything is fine and I am still studying. 

For more than 2 years I kept saying this lie but in reality I lived in Canada without visa, without degree, without any desire to change things. I lived alone in rented apartment reading novels, watching films basically being unproductive, antisocial waste. I simply didn’t think of consequences and didn’t care how it all would end up. 

Less than a year ago I started translating novels from my native language into English just for fun and ended up earning a bit from it, so at last something started going on in my life. I started cleaning up my habits, until recently I was reminded that my passport will soon expire. 
So here I am not knowing what to do. To be honest my options are quite limited. Come clean and get deported. Create another convoluted and disgusting lie about how I got my passport renewed and live without a passport as an illegal immigrant. Go full Hollywood style and get a fake passport. I even seriously contemplated suicide as a solution. 

On one hand I truly don’t want face the consequences of my own actions. On the other hand something finally started to make sense in my life. I am sure that if I had a chance to go back in time all this wouldn’t have happened. I wouldn’t have to lie to my parents living life of a disgusting parasite and hurting them, living without direction and any desire. I regret last 5 years of my life.
If I go back to my hometown, I would probably face jail time. Draft dodging and all that.

To be honest writing everything down right now I realize that I don’t want to go back home and face my parents. Any option right now seems whole lot more appealing than logical and right thing to do, even eating a bullet.",22May2020,1

694,"Hi everyone! I’m on mobile so sorry for any mistakes.
So, to keep this story short my parents had a very bad divorce when I was 11, it involved infidelity and resulted in them pretty much hating each other. 
Now my mom kept her engagement ring because it had sentimental value but stuck her and my dads wedding bands in a bin in the attic. Neither of them wanted them and I guess they weren’t very valuable because my dad wanted to sell them but pretty much didn’t get anything for them. So in the attic they remained.
When I was 18 and about to move out for college I was cleaning out the attic and found the rings. They hadn’t been touched in years and even though my parents divorce was awful they were still my parents, and I wanted something to remember them being married during the good times. 
Now, three years later (I’m now 21) my mom told me she was cleaning out the attic and couldn’t find the rings. She then said that she wanted to “throw them out for good”. 
I felt bad but didn’t say anything to her about me having them. I understand that ultimately they belong to her and my dad, but she just want to throw them out and my dad doesn’t care. They really do mean a lot to me and I want to keep them for sentimental sake, but should I fess up to having them and give them back?

698,"Due to the mention of sui, AITA said I needed to post this here and not there.

So, some background: I (25F) grew up in a very religious area of east Texas. My dad is conservative, mom is a moderate. Both are very, very Baptist. I am... I am not what I was raised to be. At all. I'm very leftist, bisexual, and polyamorous. I wouldn't call myself an atheist. And I really, truly want to believe in God. I really do. I just... I struggle with Christianity as a concept, particularly the fundamentalist kind taught by the Southern Baptist Convention, and I've been made to feel extremely unwelcome in those religious spaces. My parents are pretty aware that I've stopped going to church and generally don't push me into it when I go home. 

I've recently had a series of very upsetting things happen to me over the last week and a half. An old flame decided to end things all together and I'm devastated. I am also having to stop my current meds for my autoimmune disorder and going on to chemo drugs (or drugs that have a similar toxicity/risk associated with them) is a very real possibility. So I'm fresh off of what is more or less a breakup and I'm confronted with potentially losing my hair. And it sucks, I considered my ex to be one of my best friends and now I am having to give him a considerable amount of space through one of the scariest journeys of my life thus far. (NOTE: the ex does **not** know about the chemo/biologics, this development occurred after the breakup, so please do not call him an asshole. He made the best choice for him and I can't hold that against him. I don't think I'll be telling him about the chemo, either, unless he happens to see me mention it in passing on Twitter or Facebook.)

And since the chemo would be to suppress my immune system, any chance of leaving my condo for the foreseeable future (until the pandemic ends, which could be months/years from now) would officially be out of the question, including for groceries. After July I will be living totally alone and will be isolated from everybody. My dad called and told me that he didn't think it was a good idea for me to go on vacation with them after our state opens back up because of the possibility of me having a compromised immune system. My immune system issues can sometimes cause bronchitis and occasionally pneumonia, so he's probably right. 

I've also recently been confronted with the fact that because I have an early onset of a disorder that normally only affects older people, my life expectancy is very likely to be reduced. And my risks for lymphoma after I hit middle age are pretty high. I will be lucky if I see my 70s. My 26th birthday is in less than two months and I've been freaked out by my own mortality and how unfair everything pertaining to my illness seems. I sob uncontrollably every time someone brings up my birthday plans. Because of reasons that make no fucking sense to me, this has caused a constant stream of quasi-suicidal thoughts in my head. Maybe it's trying to exert control over a situation where I have none? Don't worry, I'm not actively in crisis right now and I have a game plan for if/when I am again.

Obviously, I've been a lot to deal with lately and I think my friends have kind of checked out in their own ways as well. I definitely do not feel like I have a support system aside from my therapist and my roommate at the moment.

Not going to lie, I am in an extremely dark place. I am having a hard time staying focused at work and I feel like a lot of things I had been looking forward to have been yanked out from under me. The only thing getting me through the day is the alarms for my psychiatric medication because I know that relief for the overwhelming emotions and anxiety is on the way. I look forward to days when I have an appointment with my therapist as well, even when the sessions are painful, because at least there's a human to talk to. 

Alright, enough background stuff. The issue: my parents are aware of the aforementioned fuckery and keep telling me to open my mind and heart back up to church. To open my heart up to men from the church. Words cannot express how badly I do *not* want to do that. I am the antithesis of everything they want young women to be. I don't want kids. I don't want to be a SAHM, I want a career. I don't want to ignore my sexuality. I don't want to be monogamous. I don't want to submit to a man outside of the bedroom. They've made it abundantly clear that people like me are not welcome there. 

I get where they're coming from. One, people with my values/lifestyle are few and far between in this state. And two, life's shitty stuff was a lot easier to deal with when I believed I had a pre-determined soulmate and that there was something less shitty to look forward to after this life, and that the suffering on this plane of existence wasn't all for nothing, but now I'm not so sure. I think shitty things just happen because they can, not because of some pre-determined divine plan. I know they don't mean it this way, but offering church as a cure-all just seems extremely dismissive. Both of who I am, and of my situation. And frankly, I think it's insane to ask me to pretend to be something I'm not to that extent. 

I know that they're probably just scared that I'm going to go to Hell and that they don't want to spend eternity separated from one of their daughters. But still. 

WIBTA if I told them to not bring it up again, and to state that I'm willing to limit my communication with them if they continue to disrespect my beliefs? Or am I overreacting due to my urges to kind of withdraw from everything?",22May2020,1

When we first got together I had extremely high anxiety, and regrettably got upset with him too often. In my defense he was my first boyfriend and I struggled with knowing how to deal with certain things. 

It’s been years since then and I really do not get upset as often. I would say that I get upset/mad about things just as much as anyone else in the world, which I believe is a very human response. 

But according to him I can’t get upset ever, and should try to work on this. This has lead to several fights when I’ve mentioned how I feel about things, usually very calmly, to which he usually either shuts down completely by saying “you’re overreacting” or “you shouldn’t feel that way”. The worst part is he always blames me for these fights and tells me I need to change. I’ve been really hard on myself about it and to be honest it makes me feel pretty bad, and as if I’m the devil in the relationship causing all of its problems. 

I recently expressed to him that I feel like I can’t ever feel anyway other than how he wants me to feel, and that oftentimes he gets mad at me just for expressing how I feel. He says he‘ll work on it but I don’t know if he will based on what happened the other night..

So basically we were recording a 1 minute video to send to his family member to say happy birthday. I really wanted to be in it because I feel like I am part of the family and it would terrible for me not to be. We recorded one take and after I asked him if we could redo it because I didn’t think I seemed genuine in the video. He responded “no no we’re keeping this one it’s good”. I literally begged him to re-record it and eventually he said with a tone “fuck it let’s re-record it but it has to be quick because I don’t have time. Go charge your fucking phone” 

I got pretty upset about this because he basically got mad at me for saying I didn’t like the video (His response to this was that he wasn’t mad but was just stressed and that I should have known that he actually wanted to do the video-hypocritical no?) It didn’t matter to him that I didn’t like it. It only mattered that he did. I then left the room and tried to be alone. He came to the room and continued to argue with me saying “I knew you were going to be like this”. 

I got even more upset at that and eventually told him to just re-record the video on his own because I didn’t want to be in it. Obviously I did want to be in it though, but I was angry. Sometime after this things calmed down a little and he said “we can try and record it in the morning”. I don’t know what I said to this but since I was upset I may have said no. We ended up going to sleep and he apologized which I felt like maybe was ok and I wasn’t as mad. 

Yesterday though I asked him which video he ended up sending. He said that he sent the video of only him because he was “taking my word for what it was worth” (since I said I didn’t want him to send the one with me in it while we were arguing) and that he “knew I would regret not being in it”. I was absolutely devastated by this because he didn’t even ask me again... and to my surprise he apparently went to another room and recorded the video on his own the night we were fighting (it was like 1 am) and sent it right then. He didn’t even wait until the morning. 

According to him I fucked up and should regret saying for him to send a video of him on his own. But I disagree because it was very clear that I didn’t mean this, and he had been in the wrong the whole time. It also upset me that he said he knew I would regret that, but still followed it anyway.

Can anyone give any outside perspective  of this? I feel so exhausted from the fact that my feelings aren’t taken seriously, but he doesn’t seem to get it.",22May2020,1
704,"My boyfriend and I met on a dating app a little over a year ago. We’d been on four dates over the course of 2 weeks but we were texting every day and we both knew we liked each other. We obviously hadn’t discussed exclusivity at this point but I liked him, I knew I wanted a relationship with him, I just didn’t know where it would go since I had only just met him. 

At this point, I go to another city to visit a friend. My boyfriend and I hadn’t had sex yet, we had only made out and I was waiting to have sex with him because I was nervous. That night I got extremely drunk and made maybe the worst mistake of my life. I went home with a random guy and slept with him. I don’t know why I did it. I’ve never been into one night stands, I’ve only had sex with people I’ve wanted a future relationship with. I feel like in my drunken state I wanted a “practice round” because I was worried about sex with the new guy I so desperately wanted to impress. I know it’s horrible. 

I’ve never told my boyfriend about it. I don’t want to hurt him unnecessarily since we were just getting to know each other and neither of us knew whether things would be long term or not. However, I feel incredible guilt and I hate myself for doing it. I don’t want to destroy my relationship over this.",22May2020,1

706,"So long story kinda short. My girlfriend and I have been living together for about 6 months or so. Things are usually pretty great with the odd fight now and then. The COVID lockdown hasn't helped at all though. We had a really big fight and me not opening up to her. I'm a quiet guy to begin with, and I dont even know what to talk about most of the time. So I decided to actually tell her about me questioning my sexuality. Shes was really caught off guard and almost disgusted. I felt a heavy shame and wish I never brought it up. But we talked about it some more. Asking me if I had experience with same-sex relationships or sexual interaction. I told her I had a couple off experiences. We ended the conversation on an awkward note. Woke up the next morning and now shes really quite and awkward around me. Things are definitely not the same. I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt that's maybe shes still processing it? I just wanted to ask, how can I normalize that conversation with her and make her feel less awkward?",22May2020,1
707,"Hello All,

I'd like to start off by saying I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to read my post. My story is hard to put into words, but I will try my best.

When I (23M) had first met her (25F) there was unbelievable chemistry between the both of us. Just like fireworks. I have only ever been in a serious relationship once before and that had ended terribly. As we had gotten to know each other we had fallen deeply for one another very quickly. The more we spoke, the more I found out about her. Eventually she opened up to me about her past and her previous abuse with her ex boyfriend, and her abuse from within her own family. I did not care about the baggage. I love her for her.

It became apparent that this baggage affected her greatly over time. She would constantly try to tell me that I deserved better than her, that she was “too messed up” or that she was “a piece of garbage”. Everytime she tried to leave because of her own self esteem issues or doubts I would reassure her and tell her how much i love her and how amazing she is. This became a recurring theme in our relationship.

Eventually her ex boyfriend began to threaten to commit suicide if she did not go back to him and move back in with him. He was a manipulator and it was terrible. She told me she felt responsible for him and his mental health even though he was abusive and terrible towards her. I had then told her that if I had meant anything to her she would not move back in with him. I thought this was the end of our relationship. I ignored her messages the whole day and she called me at the end of the day and told me “The whole day I was so upset and the only person I wanted to talk to was you, but I couldn’t and it hurt so much. I am with you, and I have to let go and you have honestly saved my life because if I went back to him I would probably end up dead.” We continued to speak about her feelings and she told me the only reason why she ever stayed with him or wanted to go back with him was because she felt that she was nothing and that she deserved to be treated poorly. She had told me that i was changing her own perspective of herself because of how unconditionally I cared for her and how good I had treated her.

Usually I am fairly laid back with women, I never necessarily go out of my way to be chivalrous or to do anything that was overly kind. With her it was different and I must admit I did everything I could to be good to her. I used to bring her a rose every time I would see her, we would sleep on the phone together. I would never let her pay for anything. I would always do random acts of kindness just to cheer her up. Sometimes if she was having a bad day I would drop off food for her, if she was sick I would buy her medicine and made sure she was resting. I made sure she knew that whatever I had it was hers, and that if she ever needed anything I would be there. I did all this without ever expecting anything in return, I just felt she deserved to be treated as I could possibly treat her. I wasn’t the perfect boyfriend, but I tried.

We had talked about everything, our future together, our children. I can honestly say I cannot imagine myself with anyone else. As our relationship deteriorated I became more insecure with myself. I realized I became very pushy towards her, and that I was likely very overbearing to her as well. I understand where I went wrong.

She had broken up with me, and told me that she no longer felt romantically involved with me anymore. This had shattered my world apart and I did not handle the breakup well, I thought it might be possible that her abusive ex-boyfriend might be in the picture but she would never tell me. In the coming week she would message me and ask if I was okay everyday. After about a week and a half she had sent me a snapchat of a gift that I had gotten her for valentines day and that left me extremely puzzled. (I should add that I am the type of person who likes to overthink everything.) She proceeded to send me memes and other things until one day she apologized, for the things she said during the breakup and that she shouldn’t have said some of the things she did. I accepted her apology, and the next day she had told me she thought she might have Coronavirus. After two days of me checking up on her and making sure she was okay, she had blocked my phone number, my instagram and my snapchat.

This left me puzzled and extremely hurt. Why message me and send me things just to block me? She had left one form of communication open, Facebook. I never reached out to her, and I tried to live my life. After about one month of not talking to one another she had reached out to me. I was posting regularly on my facebook story of me doing things and going places and generally trying to be my best. I would go out into nature often, take pictures of my car, go on hikes and go to nice parks. She had reached out to me and asked me “where is this park” and it just so happened that it was a park that we used to go to a lot together.

This was the start of us speaking again. My brother recently had a son, and she had congratulated me and wished my family well. I went hiking to a place that she loved to go to and a place we had planned to go together and posted it on facebook and she had told me “you are just going to go all my spots?” I will not deny that yes, I was posting on facebook because I knew she would see that I am doing well without her, but me doing all these things and going to all these places was part of me healing, as weird as it sounds but me going to this place that we had once planned to go together was me admitting that I could do it on my own.

Here is where things get tricky (we are almost at the end I promise.) That same day that she had messaged me about going to all of her spots, she had seen me driving. I was leaving my brothers house and going to a park. I had seen her car, but did not think twice of it because it might not have been her driving. I had gotten to a stop sign and she pulled up beside me. It really spooked me out. I drove away and then messaged her asking if it was her. She then proceeded to tell me it was “such an odd coincidence, that I was behind her” and things along those lines. She flat out accused me of following her. That really upset me. I wasn’t following her, and even if I am crazy about her, I would never do crazy things like that.

After her accusing me my emotions were running high. I was tired of the pointless conversations or her checking up on me. I was tired of this accusation. I sent her a long message, basically telling her that I miss, that I care for her and I wish we could rebuild what we had and that I would always be there for her just like I had promised so long ago. She then told me she wished me the best and that it was best if we didn’t talk for a while and that maybe one day we would be able to rebuild our friendship. She had said goodbye, and I had once again told her, that even though things are the way they are I would still always be there for her if she needed me and that I was sorry things had to be this way.

Fast forward to yesterday, which is where I am stuck now. After almost 2 weeks since our last conversation she had messaged me. She said “Hi ThrowRA8131, idk what is going on with you but I get the feeling you haven’t been in your right mind lately. I am sorry for how things turned out with me and you, it was never my intention to hurt you in anyway and I sincerely hope you’re doing ok. I was shocked and not expecting this. If she doesn’t want to be with me, then why is she continuously messaging me? She is giving me many mixed signals. I proceeded to tell her that “It seems like you have a lot going on in your life. I think you need to figure out what you want. I will still be here for you however I’m not going to wait forever.” That took a lot of courage for me. She continued to message me saying “wait for what?” and then sent another message saying “Sorry I didn’t mean to insult you I was just concerned for you and wanted to make sure you were good. You know, since our last convo didn’t go so well.”

I am floored. I don’t know how to respond. She knows that I love her unconditionally and I know that she cares for me. I have no clue what external circumstances even caused our breakup. I don’t know whether she is single or with her ex. I feel lost. I know how I feel about her and I know I want to work things out. Usually when it comes to her I am very soft. She is my weakness and she knows this. I am trying not to show that to her at the moment. I want things to work. I just don’t know what to say or do. Please help.

TL;DR Girl left me, I want to work things out. I feel like I'm getting mixed signals. I am looking for ways to fix things, not end things.",22May2020,1

711,"Okay.

So my friend who studied school with me is now in the UK doing college while I’m here in country X.
I whatsapp called him yesterday and we had a a nice 2hr convo in which he told me he broke up with his girlfriend.
And he was really in love with that girl and tbh she’s the one who broke up with him.

He told me that he’s talking to a new girl he met on PUBG.
After I told him that she might me a catfish and all, he reassured me that she wasn’t because they had exchange numbers, Instagram accounts and had a few video calls.
She speaks Spanish and he speaks English so they find it difficult to speak to each other. Like google translator.

It seems that she has this massive crush on him, which isn’t that suppressing since he is a handsome guy.

Anyways, this girl’s cousins, called J, is the one who speaks for them since she knows English and Spanish.

So on the phone call yesterday my mate was like how about we 4, me, him, his girl and J go on house party and talk. 
He basically wants me an J to start talking.

But I don’t know what to say to her, especially since he mentioned she’s really hot, that’s going to Mel me even more nervous.

718,"So, my BIL died last year of liver cancer. Was diagnosed type 2 diabetes early summer previous year. Was under hospital consultant keeping an eye. He lost a bunch of weight but was equally actively trying. I think I remember him saying his faeces was pale in the summer but I may have misheard him...anyway, he died in May last year leaving three young kids. It sucked. 

Fast forward to now; my husband is 39, 40 this year. He has always struggled with his weight. He is 19 stone (6’1). He has a ‘beer belly’. 

He drinks almost every night, doesn’t get wasted but I think he drinks too much. He himself said he knows that so there’s no point me beating a dead horse. He has on average 5 various beers a night then a couple of JD &amp; cokes. Maybe a dram of whisky too or instead.

The last few weeks I’ve had this awful impending sense of doom - it could just be cos I’ve been sorting our life insurances etc. And it’s been a year since Steve died. It could be cos I’m not 100% cos of lockdown. But I noticed this morning his beer belly has shrunk significantly and he noticed it too. It could be cos he’s been working out with our kids 20 mins 4 mornings a week...but as I say it’s sudden. He’s not got any other symptoms. The bottom of his legs/ankles look a bit spider veiny.

Am I just being paranoid??

TL:DR; BIL died of liver cancer last year at 50, 5 months diagnosis to death. Husband 39, 19 stone, drinks 4/5 beers then JD &amp; coke every night. His belly has shrunk in a week. I’m now convinced he’s got liver cancer.",22May2020,1

So I have a really good friend who has a ton of friends like him, they drink and party a ton and I’m just more conservative. However, we both really enjoy each other’s company and he claims that he loves hanging out but, on multiple occasions, he makes me feel like a last resort like there’s just nothing else to do. For example, this morning, he walked to my place (pretty far) and picked up breakfast too. Huge surprise and I was so happy, although, he’s still a little drunk and didn’t go to bed yet... so I ordered 2 switches that we planning on picking up today, so I asked if he would stay over (he usually does, especially because I work everyday so weekends are best for me, especially sleepovers), and he said “maybe.” And I asked, “oh okay, why? What are your plans for tonight?” He says, “oh nothing, no plans. But I haven’t like actually drank and had fun with John (his roommate) in a while because he works during the week and his gf will be over.” So this set me off, please tell me if I’m overreacting here. I say, “So do I lol... that’s why you’ve said in the past you try to reserve a weekend day for me... And if his gf will be over then like what? I don’t get it” and he said “Well idk if they wanna like all hangout and drink and stuff.” So I kinda called him out and said that I feel like a back-up and he gets PISSED anytime I say those words or “not a priority.” Maybe I’m just old fashioned, but isn’t it rude to have plans (yes picking up the switches and ASSUMING that we’d play games together is on me) and when asked about the extent of the stay - “Will you stay over/late enough to play?” He says “maybe” because HE’S WAITING TO SEE IF HIS ROOMMATE WANTS TO DO SOMETHING.  

Like wtf! Now we’re mad at each other but I just don’t see how he thinks I’m being ridiculous? He says, “oh my gosh, that’s what friends DO. They understand if something comes up. This is not something to get upset about, you’re overreacting.” and I was like, “nothing “came up” though???? That’s like when you don’t expect it, like your car breaks down and you can’t make dinner.... this is you literally WAITING to see if there’s something more fun to do and you won’t give me a definitive “yes” or “no” to hanging out because you’re waiting to see if your other friend whats to drink.” So please, someone please explain to me how this is not rude or making me a “back-up-plan?” I am an understanding person, but I think it’d be a whole different story if he had plans before hanging out with me for the night and straight up said, “no I can’t stay long, I have plans tonight with John.” But NOOOO he’s not telling me yes or no because JOHN, HIS ROOMMATE WHOM HE LIVES WITH, DOESNT EVEN KNOW WHAT HE WANTS TO DO AND HIS GF IS IN TOWN wouldn’t they wanna hang out just them since they only get weekends?!?!?!

When I did see my future I thought it would be easier for me if I just ended up with a boy since I wouldn’t have to come out to them or my parents, and my parents would be happier. I can see now how bad thinking that is, and I just recently was told about comp het and it completely changed everything. 

I talked to my girlfriend about this since she has gone through a similar experience with formerly identifying as bisexual and realizing she’s a lesbian. I have pushed away the idea so much of me possibly being a Lesbian because of how negative the word was to me growing up. I have no problems with others identifying as a lesbian (and I could not be prouder of my girlfriend) but for some reason I have been affected so hard by comp het that it is so hard for me to accept. I already struggle as is with change and especially big changes since I’m very much a creature of habit. 

I need advice on how to accept myself. I have a therapist and talked to them about this but I need more advice.",22May2020,2

734,"Before the pandemic lockdown , around February.           
I (F, 20) told my boss i would be leaving the job around May 15, because I would be getting married and moving away to NJ (i live in LI , NY).  Obviously Covid19 has made us move our wedding date. I have been working in a doctors office as a MA, but I was tested positive for Covid (no symptoms whatsover , thank God so Im okay) . However my boss also got sick and has not opened the office, so I have been filing unemployment benefits. My mom tells me that the office seems open because people keep going in and out of the office (there are other doctors there though) and when i asked the office manager if they opened , she got all offended and said “dont you think i would have told you if we had opened, thats outrageous “. I live 30 minutes away so i cant just casually go by and check for myself any day. But then my boss asked me yesterday that since i was going to work only until May 15, if I can write a resignation letter. 
However I believe if i do that, i cannot file unemployment benefits anymore
So what i am suspecting here is that 
-they are “firing me” and want me to say i quit the job. 
-they might be open and didnt tell me. 

What should i do??? Or how should I respond? 

TL;DR: i was supposed to leave my job mid may, the job i work out hasnt opened so i have been filing unemployment benefits, and now theyre asking me to resign. And they might have lied about opening the office.",22May2020,1
735,"I'm a rising senior 16 year old male. My mom really wants me to do some kind of engineering and while she isn't really forcing me to do it, she's basically forcing me to do it.

736,"Hello Reddit I (M21) have a life decision to make. So this is going to be a long one. Don't worry I'll include a TL:DR at the bottom  As a little back story I've been living in Arizona with my adopted family my whole life. Got sick of the landscape and the culture and wanted a fresh start so I've been saving up for the past 2 years to move up to Washington. I also wanted to be closer to my biological mother and siblings who I've been in contact with from a young age.

Now I finally got to move up here a few months ago in the beginning of February, I moved in with my biological mom and her family till I could get a job and afford a place. I loved it at first and my bio family was excited to see me and have me stay with them. I celebrated my 21st with my mom and her husband and went out to some bars with them. I was able to get a full time job welding within a month. I was starting to look at housing options and figuring out cost of living expenses when the pandemic hit and I got furloughed from work. That's when SHTF... 

(Side note: My biological family has been extremely strict when it comes to quarantine, they've made it clear that if I go back to work that I can't come back to their home and I would need to move somewhere else. I'm also not allowed to order delivery or take out food even if it's contactless and I sanatize Avery thing before bringing it in the house. My license plate expired soon after I moved here but I'm not allowed to go to the DMV to renew it, because I could bring the virus back with me.)

At first I didn't think I would be furloughed for long, I had a job in the manufacturing industry in a company that was expanding. Then it got obvious that quarantine wouldn't be temporary and I needed to find some source of income. So at first I looked at remote jobs I could do from home that wouldn't put my family or myself at risk. But it became clear that I don't have the skill sets and experience for remote work. (I've mostly worked in construction my whole life) So after a few weeks and no job offers I decided I needed to apply for jobs I have skills for. That means I would need to move out before starting work, which is kinda risky.

It was at this point that things started to get pretty tense. My mom noticed I wasn't getting job offers and that I was extremely stressed about not having income. And that it was having a negative impact on my sleep and mental wellbeing. She pointed out that I shouldn't be stressing as much as I am and gave me some advice/pointers on how to deal with that. However, at the same time she repeatedly brought up her opinion that I am not motivated enough and that I need to have better structure in my life. She suggested setting a curfew and other rules for me, basically micromanaging my routine and treating me like a child. I told her I didn't like that idea and she responded by saying ""well I'm sure not living in this house would motivate you to get things done."" 

After that first set of red flags came the second. My mom's husband (btw not my father legally or biologically) heard that his job was considering reducing hours, pay and or staff due to the pandemic. (He works from home as IT networking support). When he found that out my mom told me that I would probably not really be affected by it anytime soon. However she did say if her husband lost hours, pay or his job the first thing they would do would be to give me an ultimatum of either pooling all the money I spent 2 years saving into their resources (which would only last them a couple months), or moving out and figuring things out on my own. But even if I did pool my money with theirs, once that ran out they would still tell me to pack my things and go. 

I considered just packing up and leaving right when I heard that. I wasn't about to jeopardize my life savings and my health and safety just because they think they're justified in demanding everything I have. But I decided the risk of that actually happening was low and it was better for me to just keep job searching.

Another little red flag. At first I was totally allowed to drink at home, I'm 21 after all and my mom and her husband drink. I've had a few drinks before 21 and I'm familiar with my limits. But I've never been drunk in their house, I just don't enjoy being intoxicated around sober people, especially kids. I've also struggled with insomnia symptoms for years so I used marijuana as a sleep aid with their permission and I always left the property to use. (They have kids, duh.) However, one night I came home after toking up before bed after everyone else was asleep. And I started a kettle of tea, then forgot about it and left it on all night. I know, big good on my part. No fires were started though, just ended up with a dry and hot kettle. Naturally my mom and her husband were upset. But instead of just addressing the situation, bringing it up to my attention and working on a solution with me, they decided without consulting me that I am no longer allowed to drink alcohol or use marijuana whatsoever. I disagreed with the severity of their decision but I understand I'm living in their house, not mine. So since then I've stuck to their rule and I've been sober since.

Now it's been nearly 2 months since quarantine started and I've been spending 4 hours a day applying for jobs, following up and contacting companies. I've gotten 2 responses from jobs I've applied to in that time and one was a scam. I've applied for unemployment but since I barely moved here I don't qualify for Washington employment. I also applied for unemployment in Arizona last year so that claim is also making me intelligible for Washington unemployment. But because I now have a Washington address I can't get Arizona unemployment. I started a teaching English course to get certified and get teaching English as a foreign language job online. But that will take months to get my certification.

Now here we are to today. My mom just called me out and said that she's convinced that because I don't have a job yet, the only reason for that has to be that I'm not working hard enough to get a job. Regardless of the literal global pandemic happening around us. I've been telling her how I am applying to jobs keeping her up to date with my progress, but she thinks I'm lying to her and I'm making up the work that I'm doing. Not only that but she thinks that I'm doing drugs (not just marijuana) behind her back. It's obvious that she has made up her mind on what she thinks reality is, despite my efforts to correct her view. She also said that she resents me for making my shortcomings and irresponsibility her problem.

Should I just pack my things up and leave now? I feel like I'm just generally resented for being here and considered a hazard to the family. It's obvious that I have lost my mom's trust for whatever reason she has concocted. But if I move back to Arizona and start from square one I'll feel like a failure and probably just give up. I've wanted to move here for 5+ years and been saving for 2+, but ever since I've gotten here I've just been sh*t on and broken down mentally and emotionally.

TL:DR moved across the country for a fresh start and to be closer to family. Moved in with family, got stuck with them because of the pandemic. Turns out my family is super restrictive and paranoid. Struggling to find a job. Now my mom thinks that I'm not working hard enough to get a job and thinks I'm doing drugs behind her back.",22May2020,1
737,"So I’m 14M, and one of my biggest issues is I literally don’t act like it.

Whenever I’m put in a social situation I get tense and just don’t know what to say, and I worry about it too much, and can’t stop thinking about what I did wrong for sometimes weeks or months later. I just had a meeting (virtually) with one of my therapists and she said I should do one thing every day that a kid would do, but I really don’t know what that would be.

738,"I am here asking advice since I cant really get any in real life. Everyone that I know and have to tried to talk about it with always just changes the subject. So here it is:

I am thinking about going to FL for 6 weeks to go to a diving school and becoming a scuba diving instructor. It would take 6 weeks to get all the dives in, and complete all of the training. total cost for the training and equipment would be 12,000. I do have the money so thats not the issue. (I would actually be with drawing it from my retirement account.) I dont have an issue with that because it is a complete change of careers and i would be doing something that I love and always wanted to do. 

I currently live in a small town in Texas and things are starting to get back to normal and places are starting to hire again. However all of the places that are hiring are manufacturing jobs and 12 hour shifts. Dont get me wrong there is nothing wrong with that but I am at the point where i am either going to be doing those manufacturing jobs for the rest of my life (or at least until retirement), other than that I would have to move anyways in order to take a better job and not have my heart into it. 

I cant do the part time training because of where I live and the lack of dive schools and dive locations. I would have to dive every weekend for 10 weekends, then start training which would be another weekend only thing. Not to mention that the dive shops around here really dont teach a lot of instructor courses compared to the other place in FL that teaches them all the time. 

So do i take the plunge and go all or nothing for the diving school or drone on at where I am at? If I drone on at where I am at i would kinda feel defeated because i know i am smarter and better than that.

- Getting stuck on the first letter's sound
- Not being able to say a word even though I know the word, then when I do say the word, it'll be incorrectly. (ex. If I had to say red, accidentally saying rad)
-Most words I mispronounce the mispronunciation is in the vowels. I'll switch vowels on accident.

748,"Good evening, 

I moved back home, following university/living away for around 5 years, after having a mental breakdown- several suicide attempts and severe depression. 

Following moving home, my Mum confiscated my bank card- not sure if it’s still even open in that bank- and moved me to a savings account under her name. 

Following going back into work after several months off recovering personally I am still in this same situation, my mum has full access to my bank account and as it is a savings account she can see when and where the money has been withdrawn. Another side to this is that I can only use my card in one specific bank  and can’t use it for regular transactions i.e. just to buy something at a shop etc...

I’ve tried to address this multiple times with my Mum and every time it’s ‘we’ll sort it another time’ I know full well that I have enough money to pay back my student overdraft to my previous bank account, however whenever I state this it’s always ‘later’.

Following the lockdowns etc I’ve drank a fair bit more out of boredom and nothing else to do, however my Mum thinks this is down to becoming an alcoholic, I have absolutely no need to drink daily nor do I crave a drink.

I’ve thrown up two days in a row, and feel like I have tonsillitis as my tonsils are massively swollen and I keep hiccuping following a (non alcoholic) drink. My mum seems to think this is because of alcohol and has cancelled my card (this isn’t the first time she has done so)

I pay my own phone bill, Xbox subscription, gym membership etc etc and pay towards food each week. 

How do I approach this subject with her to return my bank account to myself, without it becoming an argument? I earn my own money and I have to ask permission for her to transfer my money to the card I can withdraw it from. She also wants to know what I’ve spent it on every time.

I feel like a young child every time and it is humiliating. Please help. (25 years old if that helps the context)",22May2020,1
749,"I am a senior going to college.  I have 4 main college options right now.  

There is a community college that I could go to (for free) and finish up my associates relatively fast (since I got some college credits in HS) and my mother brought up this option to me but we both know my dad wouldn’t approve.  

Second option is a 4 year university (within driving distance of my house) that I could study business at and that my dad wants me to go to.  

Third option is a 4 year university that a recruiter for cross country is trying to get me to go to (where i’d also study business).  
My fourth option is a 4 year university about an hour and a half away from home where I’d study animal science.  

The pros of community college are that it’s free, I could finish my associates fast, and it’s close.  The cons would be that I feel like my work ethic would suffer from the community college and I don’t want to disappoint my parents/dad.  

The pros of the one my dad wants is that he wants me to go there (my parents would pay for my college), and business is a reliable degree, I guess.  The con with this is that while I’m sure I’d be good at business and it’s a reliable degree, I have no sort of passion or desire to do it whatsoever outside of me trying to appeal to my parents.  

The pros of the 4 year university for sports is that I’d still be studying business and also be running in college.  The cons are that it is very expensive and I’m not even sure if the season will continue due to coronavirus.  

Finally, the pros of the Animal Science college are that Animal Science is something I’d enjoy, and a pro/con of my GF also going there and studying the same thing.  I wouldn’t say my girlfriend is a deciding factor in my decision but she is a factor nonetheless I guess.  

Our relationship is healthy, we’ve been happy with each other our entire time together and we have good communication.  I’ve had this discussion with her multiple times and as much as she wants us to go to the same college, she also understands all of the pressures I feel from all of the people around me.  I feel like my mom/dad feel somewhat the same but I know they don’t want my GF do be a deciding factor in my decision because of the usual what ifs and whatnot.  

I feel overwhelmed, and in the end I really just want to be happy.  I know going to study animal science would be technically following my GF but it’s the nearest college that has it (besides A&amp;M which I already turned down due to distance and price) and I feel like I’d enjoy animal science, but the way I’d feel with the way my family/people around us might see me/us just doesn’t evade me.

Now I know and honestly I'm fucking ashamed of how stupid I was and how could I even think that it was ok to do all of that. I want to be better. I want to have a healthy relationship and I want to always be like that because I have a habit of getting back to my old ways after some time and I hate it. I truly and honestly want to be a better person and leave my stupid past self behind.

The boy is the most beautiful person and does not deserve to be controlled like that. He deserves to be his own person with his own tastes and personality.

She started putting more  expectations on me to be better than my sister and would sometimes even curse me out if I didn't fulfill them.

Before the quarantine, when we rode the bus home we would always talk and whenver she said anything I would look into her eyes and couldn't find it in me to even blink. 

After our AP exams and now that school is almost over, we are both about to be free for the summer (we are both some of the smartest kids in our school, I'm barely smarter than her but she likes that about me). We are both athletes, we both love AC-DC, we both love country life, we both love college football, we both want to get into medicine in college, we both love shrimp alfredo.

She is a genius, softabll player, HOT, popular but not in an a\*\*hole way, and an all around awesome and polite person.

My problem comes in the fact that despite the fact that I share those traits now, I stuggled with depression and anxiety in middle school which made me seem very weird and act in extremely bizzare and violent ways. Since then, I have recovered from depression and taken anger management (but I still have anxiety) and have had an absolute glow-up. This past year we have hung out a lot in school, and whenever I had the chance I always was with her. Outside of school, not so much. 

Since quarantine I have been trying to upkeep regular messaging with her and sometimes I think that she enjoys our messages just as much as me. But I need to know:

How can I tell if she cares for me back?

How do I confess to her how much I care about her? Or should I just wait until later?

How do I get her to go out with me? (We live at the beach so I have been considering asking her to a beach walk because we both enjoy them despite never doing them toghther.)

She would invite me out to eat and pitch me these plan to suddenly uproot and move away— once she wanted to move to Australia and wanted a roommate. Another time she wanted to work on a cruise ship for a year and wanted me to come too. She was dead serious and never understood why I wasn’t jumping at the chance to up and leave.

It became anxious for me to hang around Dana so I became distant, not initiating conversations or hangouts, but responding when she would start up a conversation. Then things got weird with her whole family. Both of her parents are diagnosed bipolar, they have seven kids and they blow their money on everything but their well-being. The kids are spoiled rotten and get whatever they want, yet they often couldn’t afford monthly rent. Dana’s parents started asking my parents for money, and were bitter when they declined. Dana’s brother asked my younger sister out, and when she declined he began harassing her, and the other siblings started texting my sister about  how she owed their brother a date because of how much he wanted her. 

They’re just a very un-self aware family who grew up with unstable parents. It’s kind of sad, but their friendship wasn’t healthy. My parents stopped talking altogether to Dana’s parents. My siblings stopped talking to Dana’s siblings. I stopped talking to Dana. 

It’s been almost three years since I’ve said a single word to her but she can NOT take a hint. Every few weeks—- Texts, Facebook messenger, IG messenger, social media comments, she regularly tries to strike up conversation. I feel guilty for not responding. Should I continue not talking? I have zero interest in rekindling a friendship with Dana. I’m worried about formally telling her that, also.",22May2020,1

Watching TV is just fine and even video with subtitles and playing video games is a breeze but when it comes to books, regardless of the content, I can't get more than a sentence or two in before I drift away.

We often joke around in small ways, it's something I do with almost all my regular customers who I know have a sense of humor. It brightens everybody's day. 

Anyway, I noticed for the past two weeks she hadent been herself. She's looks very depressed,  and is very mopey. She walks slowly now,  no more pep in her step.  She's always looking at the floor and I can't seem to get her to joke around like she usually does. 

Today I tried a different approach. When she came to my line instead of trying to make her laugh, I spoke to her in a very calm voice as we went through the transaction process,  and sounding as genuine as I could I told her at the end of the checkout to ""please, try and have a good day"" she looked me dead in the eyes, probably the first eye contact she made with me in days, and I seen just pure sadness. And she gave me an ever so slight  smile. 

Oh my God I wanted to just break down and cry right there. 

I know her parents as they also shop at the store and often come to my line. I wonder if it would be overstepping my boundaries to mention something to them. They are very straight forward people and not very chatty so I don't know how they would react.

I got rejected by her two months ago but that was towards the start of our relationship. we've stayed friends since b/c I've been bored, and I made some lighthearted remarks that she thought were insulting (objectively, they weren't). she sent me a meme two days ago of someone thinking ""wanting to flirt"" but saying ""insults"". I got fed up w her and so I told her that it'd be best if we stopped talking because she was feeling insulted.They said ok, then screenshotted the chat. I said that it wasn't b/c of the first reason I gave, but actually because of reason 2. They ended up typing a paragraph saying they were over a dispute I thought they were still upset about, and that they haven't meant to be hostile, and that they would still respect my decision to not be friends but they wanted to clarify that.

And my family has kinda been mocking me for it as they say I'm overreacting and they just keep joking about it and stressing me out. 

Now it's almost Eid, a religious holiday, and in my country we're allowed to let 4 people visit, it has to be the same people each time tho, and my uncle and his family just came from the other side of the country to stay at my grandmas house. He has twin girls and they're 5 years old and very physically affectionate and my own sister who is 7 also is.

And my siblings just went to visit my grandma to see them. And at Eid my whole family will go to my grandma while my uncle is there too. 

Now I get that quarantine has been messing with everyone. Especially the younger kids. And my uncle lives on the other side of the country so he already doesn't see us a lot. And he obviously missed his mom. And his daughters missed us. And Eid is about family I guess

But like, my uncle's wife is a doctor who works at the hospital with covid patients. Both my uncle's kids and my siblings don't know what personal space is and my anxiety has been getting bad. 

I might have said some harsh things to my mom about how I wished my uncle would just stay home and leave us the hell alone, that there is a chance they're infected and this could even kill people especially my grandma, and me since I'm immunocompromised, etc

I was informed this morning, pictures of me (specifically images only shown to friends and former friends of mine) are being used on a really sketchy website are being used for a profile on a sex chat website.

I am 14 years old, and the page says I'm 21. I didn't even make it.

It also says that I'm ""In constant need of good cock"" in the profile on the website's bio- despite me literally being a child.

I think I might know who have done it. My boyfriend had this really toxic friend. This guy, we'll call him L, would do horrible things to him. L would constantly insult his and I's relationship, would make fun of my boyfriend's appearance and interests, and would do stuff like photoshop my boyfriend into images of Hitler. Eventually, after me and my boyfriend had a talk about how he was being used by L, my boyfriend cut ties with him completely. L thinks because of this that I'm, in his own words, a ""Manipulative whore"". L is 15 or 16.

What do I do? Should I keep evidence for law enforcement? I feel like if my mom knew this is happening, she wouldn't let me show my face online (Which for me helps with my low self confidence).

Is there any specific authorities to contact, should I just ignore it? It doesn't use my real name, and nobody online except my boyfriend knows my full name- and he hasn't shared it.

They gave him her husbands named, buried him in the family plot, and have still not finished grieving, if you ever can. About 6 months later she found out she was pregnant again, she lost the second baby at 12 weeks. They were again devastated and decided to wait before trying again. She’s questioned a lot in life since then, including her religion, and blames her body for both losses. Though doctors still have limited answers.

We actually are playing hookie from work today to go to the beach, I woke up to a frantic call with her hyperventilating because she took a test on a hunch and it was positive. She’s not ready for this, she has negative feelings about the positive result, she isn’t taking any of the medications her doctor told her we’re needed to get pregnant.

Recently he's been coming over every day asking if he can mow. We are in Ohio and its been raining for about two weeks straight. Our yard is very wet and while the grass is a tad bit long its nothing too out of control. But we don't want anyone mowing right now because it will tear up the yard with how wet it is.

When he came over yesterday I told him that the yard should be dry enough by Monday and that I'd message his mom when he could come over. His mom had messaged me eairler that day and I told her the same thing. Today he came over and while he didn't know that my two year old was napping, him knocking on the door almost woke up the baby.

How do I handle this? I'm still fine with him mowing the yard but the constant asking to is making my dogs bark as they don't like random guest. I don't want to be mean to him or to his mom but its just getting a little bit much when its everyday.

tl:dr- had a neighbor boy mow my yard, now he comes over everyday to ask if he can mow even if I've told him it has to wait till the ground dries. How do I ask him to stop coming over everyday without hurting his feelings?

788,"I really hope this post gets more than two upvotes and one bot comment...

I am a student, I guess that most of you might consider me an high school student but in my country it's a bit more complicated. After middle school we have to choose a specialized school. We can either go to a technical school or a lyceum. The first one as the name suggests is very technical and has more labs and activities while the second one is way more abstract and in most cases it doesn't have any labs at all. I was pushed by my parents to go for either abstract or applied science lyceum. Since I need to apply my knowledge in order to learn it I chose applied science, which has IT, Chemistry and Biology labs. And all I must say is that I hated every second of this. Everything the teachers have to say is ""You are at a lyceum, this is normal"" while loading us with absurd amounts of homework and almost a test a day on a very large amount of informations (for example, we had 2 weeks to prepare on a history test that went from the French to the Italian revolution, and that's a LOT of stuff). And that's not the only problem, in order to prepare for all of those tests I have to stay at school 6 hours per day and study 4/5 hours per day. And of course I have to go to the gym one hour per day because of medical reasons so I have no free time whatsoever. And here you might think that this is acceptable, it kinda sounds like a full time 5/7 job. Well, guess what, no. Because teachers load us with so many homework that it is not uncommon for me to spend 6+ hours both days in the weekend to do 4+subjects homework. Plus I have severe anxiety, and although some of my teachers will do their best to help me some of them do their best to make me panic to ""prove"" that I am making it up (my therapist had to literally go and talk to them multiple times to prove I was not making it up). So sometimes I will sit my ass on a chair and work my soul off just to have a panic attack and both cry in front of everyone and fail the test. I figured out that the only way to stop this madness is not giving a fuck about school anymore, but I also have the necessity to move out of my house as soon as possible to get away from a toxic family. I don't know what to do anymore. I know that most of the comments will be ""stop bitching around and do your homework"" but I am a weak anxious piece of crap that can't even stay at school without loosing her mind. Next year will be my last year and I really don't want to go away like a weak pussy, but that's what I am after all...

Long story short: I have anxiety and have to dedicate almost all of my days to school full time just to fail because of it, I can't tell the teacher that they are giving us too many homework because they will just say that this is normal. How can I stop giving a fuck and be happy?",22May2020,2

So I’m 24 female and In January my dad passed away and two weeks later I broke up with my long term boyfriend who’s 33. Since then I’ve been having to sleep on my mums couch because I have no where else to live, my issue however is ALL of my friends live with their partners and I just feel like a bit of a failure at the moment. I won’t have the finances to move out of my mums house anytime soon and she downsized her house when I moved in with my boyfriend hence why I’m having to sleep on her couch. It was my boyfriends house so that’s why I had to move out. I try to remind myself everyday what I should be thankful for. 
Has anyone been through anything similar? Or does anyone have any advice on how to stop feeling like such a failure?",22May2020,2
797,"I know i’m not a child. I’m 19 years old but this has been bothering me as it’s still happening and kind of just started.

Backstory-

My father is my only parent. I do not have a mom or any other family at all. This may be why this hurts so much. We used to have a great relationship. He used to be my best friend. I moved all over the US with him , ( as a single dad, he moved to be with gfs he met online and took me which ended up bad all times :/) but i’ve been there for everything through that. 
Me and him were living in an apartment together, i used to help out cleaning / cooking / grocery shopping while having jobs throughout high school. I just finished hs last Nov. that’s the gist. but here’s the bad stuff 
 



I’ve been with my partner for 3 years, we found out I was pregnant a month ago. Told him and did not expect his reaction to be so horrible. I understand being upset because I’m young but he said I was ruining my life, i’m gonna be like those “welfare” people HE said. worse shit ect. and then from there on out, he doesn’t want to speak to me. Is moving in with his gf he just met a few months ago leaving me finding a place to live during this whole thing. If i call him he hangs up immediately because he’s busy, or he yells at me saying “WHAT DO YOU WANT IM WITH GF”, for instance when i has to go to the hospital due to a complication in pregnancy and he got upset i told him because it wasn’t an emergency he said ( he was at gfs).

I have also tried telling him stuff about the baby, just stuff you’d want to tell a parent. I wanted to show him the stuff i got from free baby boxes since i’m making the most out of those resources. I have a whole tub full already and tried to show him and he says he’s busy and going to shower/get ready for gfs... every time i try and tell him or show him anything at all. Related to baby or not. 

This hurts. We used to be so close. He found someone, which I am so happy for him but he’s left me with no parental support at all not even an ear. I NEVER ask for money. I am not like that so it’s not about that or anything. He would NOT be supporting this baby. I never asked and never would expect that. 


I also lost an amazing job offer i got due to this virus, so this is a horrible time but my partner does have a good job. 


This is it. I’m honestly upset and hurt and i kind of do understand since i am old enough to be without a parent or any support or anything. I get it. It’s pushed me honestly, to get my own place sooner. I am in southern California and it is not easy here. That is why i was living with him past 18.

I’m not sure what to do, this is why i’m asking for advice. 

I’ve tried talking to him. He bribes me with saying he will get a “car seat” and stuff like that, saying he’s not being mean / rude to me and such. But I know he feels bad because after that he tries to be nice/ offer me money. 


This just sucks. But I’m thinking i’ll grow from this all. I’m thinking ill just let him be, do my own things with my life. If he wants to be apart of my life he will, it’s just hard to accept that sadly.",22May2020,1

While I was talking to my boss he said to get a day off I would need to switch shifts, use vacation, or call in sick. Well I then asked “can I call in sick?” As I wasn’t sure what calling in sick would mean during these times of covid-19. He said “well I dont know why you’d tell me you’re calling in sick a week in advance.”


I know dumb of me... but I wasn’t sure if calling in sick was more reserved for coronavirus symptoms. 

But could I still call in sick or would that be really dumb of me? I was thinking of a “mental health day” but we aren’t realy reserved personal days its more divided into Vacation time and Sick time. So not sure that would work. 


I am accepting the fact I probably fucked up but guess Ill see what others think.

800,"     Basically my dads couldn't really take care of me and  he made me stay with his friend who owned a day care I knew very well. I known her for as long as I can remember an I called her aunt because she was like an aunt to me. 

    So staying there was a man she knew from new york who would come to visit so the kids at the day care would call him the New York man. He got us gifts and stuff. He would quiz us on stuff to see how smart we were. He was mostly friendly to me and this other girl patty.  We were close to the same age so he even got us matching clothes from him. He always complimented on being very smart since I got many answers right while he quizzed us. I even remember him taking some kids to 7 eleven and getting us food there. He seemed very nice. 
     One day I was sitting with him talking in my aunts dining room since he was visiting from new york. I remember he put his hand in my pants and I got up because I was very uncomfortable  and him telling me to sit down but I refused. I even think this happened more then once. He never even talk about it so I don't really think anything of it. I liked that he gave me gifts but at the same time even as a kid I always uneasy about him. 

   My aunt always had good things to say about how he was very successful and had alot if money. She always talked about how nice he was. I can't tell anyone about this. I haven't seen my aunt in like 2 years. 


    The last time I saw her was when I was 14 and she asked me about him and she even called me to talk to him. I felt so uneasy about this of course. In her eyes he's a good man and good friend she's know for a long time. I even cause a ton of trouble and lied alot. I doubt 100% she believed me if I were to call her up and ask her about it. 

   The other girl patty I'm afraid it happened to her too. The only person I would tell is probably her since the man really like her too and according to him we were his favorites. I know people will tell me to tell someone but it's not that easy. Knowing my parents they would either not believe me or try to call my aunt about it and I don't want that happening.  I'm not really traumatised by it since I didn't know what really happened at the time. I haven't even thought about it til now.

     What really bothers me is my aunt will probably see this man as a good man not realizing what he did. I'm probably a coward but I probably won't admit it happened to anyone irl even if asked. I'm too ashamed honestly. But I know he has probably done this before and hopefully someone will expose him but I don't want to be the one to do it. I just thought about it today and was disgusted and decided to share.

So if this is a mess I just randomly wrote stuff down. I'm just so scared even posting this online.",22May2020,3

I told him I went to bed early last night (I lied but he gets pissed if I stay up late) and he said “really? Then why does it say you were on the internet until 3 am?” Like wtf seriously? 

I have no privacy now. Absolutely none at all. He can literally see every website I go on. I’m 21 years old I’m a fucking adult I shouldn’t need to be monitored. I should be able to do whatever the fuck I want online and that’s none of his business. Also I have straight A’s in school and almost a 4.0 cumulative GPA so I feel like I deserve some privacy.

820,"So I've been enrolled in German class since around 7th grade. The actual class isn't very informative (we just sort of play games) but nonetheless I became passionate about it and started learning it. I'm now a junior in high school, and since then I have practiced German on and off. Sometimes I get super serious about learning it, sometimes I couldn't care less. I've gotten pretty proficient, but let's just say I couldn't hold a conversation with a native.

I recently started learning Spanish, and I love it. I love how it sounds and I love that the word order is more similar to English, making other more crucial grammar rules take front seat in my learning. It's also an incredibly important language for my intended career path.

I recently had the realization that if I worked hard enough on learning a language, especially with all of this spare time in quarantine, I could really show colleges that I am an intelligent and driven person. 

And I realized that I have all of this foundational knowledge in German, and am just starting to learn Spanish. Would it be wise to put aside this language that I love for German (which is cool too but I don't love learning it), giving a head-start to my learning and making it more likely that I become near-fluent by college? Or do I stick with Spanish, be happy learning all of its awesome sounds, hope that I have something to show for it by college?

829,"I'll preface this by saying I am in therapy and working on fixing myself. I have a general positive view of things, but I've developed some deep-seated PTSD. I'd like some tips on how to better myself and get out of this mindset:

When I was 17, I met a person who was amazing, we dated for three awesome years and had an amicable breakup. After that the only people I've ever been romantically involved with have used me, cheated, manipulated, you name it. I realize this isn't a necessarily uncommon to experience, but that's \*all\* I've romantically experienced from 21 to 27. At first I was ok, I brushed off those experiences and tried to learn from them, however this last year (26-27) I was treated in such a way that really broke me. Long story short she cheated, used me and manipulated me into thinking I was the asshole. Would routinely ghost me and come back loving me, only to do it all over again and acted as if I was the one with the problem. Since then I realized that every person I'd been with had treated me as disposable, and in similar ways. It's always like there's something better around the corner for them, and they're willing to burn me to get what they want. 

I'm entirely willing to admit it's trauma and bad luck. I know for a fact there are considerate, empathetic people out there. However it's gotten so bad that one of my friends recently started dating someone, and she's constantly posting snapchat memories of three years ago when she lived in Hawaii. I realize these are just fond memories, but my mind immediately jumped to ""she doesn't care about him, why is she posting how much better her life was three years ago right after she started dating this guy? Why is she hardly posting about him?"" That's exactly the type of mentality I want to step away from. I'm not even involved in that relationship and my mind is still going into fight or flight mode. In the specific case of Hawaii, my ex went there for school and started essentially cheating on me and blaming me for it last summer; I'm just worried this mentality is bleeding out into my general way of thinking. 

The last woman I was involved with (who wasn't my ex) started fading me out, and then began sending me snaps of her new guy. I was already at the point where I emotionally blocked myself from the situation, and actually laughed when she began doing that. I've since stopped talking to her, but I was still bummed that I once again met someone like that. 

She's one of many cases, but now I look at general romantic prospects and expect the worst from them. It protects me in the way that I don't get hurt if something doesn't work out, but I don't want to be constantly on the defense if I end up meeting someone genuine and cool. I have remained voluntarily single for about a year, but it's only been six months no contact with my most recent ex. I want to get my head sorted before I find someone. During my time alone I experimented with meeting/talking to people, and realize the back of my head is always saying ""they'll fuck you over, don't get too involved."" The sad thing is a lot of them do fuck me over, I'm really hoping it's just confirmation bias, or maybe I'm just being too sensitive. I realize six years of periodic cheating, manipulation, and downright emotional abuse can cause trauma, but I really want to work on fixing that. 

On the surface I give people a chance and I'm still open to meeting people, but the back of my head is always putting up a guard. I want to be able to be more positive and open to giving people chances, rather than just shutting them down before I even know them. Any advice on opening up?",22May2020,1

Now I want to make one thing clear so I am understood. I absolutely love this person. But i am a sexual person. I will not be happy with a sexless relationship.( technically anything less than 6 times a year is sexless). If she is being 100% truthful with me I am willing to wait on anything. 

When we first started dating we waited a little longer to kiss and do anything physical. I think I brought her on five dates and kissed her after the 5th one at her house. By the 6th or 7th date we started getting into non penetration sex. Nothing more. Should would fantasize to me and say she couldn’t wait, but she needed to. A month before we met she had broken up with her first “love” she dated for one month. She slept with him once in two weeks. I kind of figured she had trust issues and I needed to prove myself. 

That wasn’t the case.

After we confused each other’s love I started spending a lot of time with her. Maybe 3-4 nights at her house. After the dates I would expect maybe some sexual activity to occur but it never did. She stated how we should wait to go out for a mini vacation to have sex at a hotel or Airbnb. I thought nothing of it. A few months later (maybe the 3rd month we were dating I had to bring it up) 

Her plan remained until our 3 month came and I mentioned that I apologize if this comes off disrespectful but we haven’t had a sexual connection Since the second week we dated. She absolutely called me out told me her moms at the house most of the time I’m trying to pressure her she made me feel like shit for talking about it and bringing it up, she said “I don’t like talking about this it makes me uncomfortable” so I stopped.  I told her I’m sorry but right now I just feel like we are super close friends. She then left the room and said wow your gonna dump me I know it. 20 minutes later she came in the room. She was dressed in this see through short dress and was clearly trying to seduce me. I immediately told her she is a crazy and if I acted on anything sexual she would have regret it. Then I went to sleep for the night. 


A few weeks later I brought it up again. Maybe she thought about her actions and how she was being disrespectful to me. A topic about my last relationships came up and she called me a pig for having sex when I didn’t love someone. And our values are different. And I’m not pure. And if we have kids she’ll raise them the right way. I stopped and called her out. She then left the room and slept on the couch.

At that point I figured maybe she just doesn’t want to have sex and I wouldn’t be happy. The next day I told I’m gonna spend some time alone at my house and think about this. 2 days later she called me to meet up at a local coffee shop parking lot. I figured it was to break up with me but it wasn’t. 

She explained that like 2-3 months prior to us having the argument she upped her dose on her anxiety/depression medication. But not by a lot. A decent amount im not sure how much. She said that she hasn’t had a sex drive for a long time and she feels guilty for not performing or anything. I said ok whatever.  This was two months ago. 

Now today I was told she just told her therapist when I thought she was going to tell her that day. I was a bit frustrated because now she has to wait 1 month to either lower her dose or switch meds. And then for it to take effect is another story. Whatever not a big deal she can’t control it just would have liked for it to be sooner. I can’t control that so I moved on. 

*End result*

A) So far after hours of arguing with myself I feel like she could be telling the truth and her meds are causing her not to want to have sex (absolutely isn’t a problem) and she wants to feel some drive but it isn’t possible because of meds.

OR 

B) She isn’t a sexual person at all. She has been “brainwashed” by her mom, who was cheated on by her father, who doesn’t like men to much and tells her all these things she shouldn’t do in a relationship. She doesn’t have any sexual drive and when she did the first two weeks it was just early infatuation. Maybe she thinks sex is dirty and if you have sex a lot your a bad person. She fights her feelings for it and makes it such a bigger deal then it really is. She is telling me because she really is in love with me and doesn’t want me to leave because of sex. She may be trying to hold me until I come to terms with it or accept it. Long story short she wants a sexless relationship.

TL;DR 
Either way I respect her opinion. Should I wait and have this head ache for the next two months? Should I try to talk to her more about it? Should I stop trying to get her aroused? Is it fair to accuse her of lying? Should I believe her? What if her mom doesn’t let her change her meds or she does and it doesn’t fix anything?",22May2020,1

I've had an experience like this from before too, another close friend hit on her. Although we are broken up there is no closure and we keep having an on and off thing whenever we meet. We've always blamed distance for the break up.

Ok a little background first.
My husband (38m) and I(36f) have been married for 10 years and have always filed jointly. Every year, I joke durring tax season we should divorce because i used to get fat tax refunds prior to getting married. And now we get very little in comparison. Don't worry, it is very much a joke, we have an awesome marriage. He usually jokes back bring on the alimony!

When we were prepping to get married, he wanted to keep our finances separate. Which i was fine with. So to this day we have our own bank accounts and a joint account we pay bills from.  Our incomes back then were pretty much the same.  He had 2 jobs, I had 1.  As time went on I did very well in my career, and advanced within my company.  He has continued to work for the same employers as well ,however they don't have any room for advancement. This has lead to a 40k gap in our incomes. I have a lot taken out of my paychecks in taxes so its ""saved fo me""  and when i noticed he wasnt having  enough taken out of his paychecks i kept asking him to resumit his tax form with his employers to increase his withholding. (Still hasn't)

My husband has expressed wanting to leave his employers and be self employed. I have always encouraged him to do it. Make a plan and execute  it. But only in the last 4 years had he started working towards it. In the last year and a half he has had some amazing growth on his side hustle.  And has gained a network of common clients. I am so proud of him. I think he will be close to quitting his jobs if this continues on. 

Since we keep our finances separate I don't know exactly what he brought in in 2019 but i know it has to be a lot (5 figures) because I help him figure out pricing for his projects. He has been able to help out more with expenses. (His request not mine) I reminded him, make sure youre putting a chunk of each payment away for taxes throughout the year.  He always would give me the 'i know i know.'

Well bring us to now, time to work on our taxes.
I like to torment myself by seeing what refund i would get filing separately and compare it to filing together.  Filing separately looks VERY good for me. I ask my hubs to get me his paperwork for the side hustle.  He doesnt have any. What? He didnt keep a list. Ok. Easy enough to figure out those deposits. I tell him to go thru his statements and find his mobile deposits. Compare them to his invoice files and make a list. Then i ask what he has put away for taxes.  I ask this because I am seriously considering bringing up the discussion to file separately at this point. He said he didn't, but he will do that for 2020. ... I was shocked.  And i am very frustrated that he would be so irresponsible.

This is where I get into ,would I be an ass if i file separately?

My guess is that he would owe a few hundred in state and  several thousand in federal taxes if we filed separately by the look of things. Which then means hes going to have more expenses each month trying to pay that since he didn't save!

Me on the other hand, I would be owing a small amount in state and getting a fat federal refund that would easily take out his owed taxes. 

I don't feel its fair that if we file together I pretty much get no refund at all. And I don't feel great about filing separately and leaving him with that tax obligation. But i also think he should have kept records and saved. But i am very proud he is coming into so much success and I dont want to deter him from his dreams! 

What are your thoughts?

TLDR: Spouses have large wage gap. Wife wants to file taxes separately to get nice refund but that will leave husband with very large tax obligation .",22May2020,1
841,"Hi.

TLDR: Why can't I get over the past even though I fixed it?

I was diagnosed so much shit (ADHD, Autism, Asperger, fuckn Trauma and more) that the ppl that did the diagnosing started saying this is bogus and gave up when I was lawfully and adult and just sent me back to my mother. I was accordingly broken and it's quite literally a coincidence that I didn't end up in the news for some tragedy I committed. And believe it or not, I have fixed myself. If you'd meet me on the street you'd think I'm just some random everyday twerb and not someone dangerous and broken. I fixed my education, got the job I wanted, got hobbies, quit smoking, don't drink anymore, going to move out next month - far away, I exercise, I read, I had stableish sleep till corona happened. I fucking did it. My family told me I couldn't. My teachers told me I couldn't. My psychiatrists told me I couldn't. I accomplished all that, my way. No help of those fucks needed. 

Even the problems I was convinced I'd need professional help for in the future. I'm not sure how honest I can be with what I think about certain people without just getting locked up for posting it online, but I can look into a mirror and tell myself that I won't go out of my way to harm these people. That's enough for me to think I'm neither endangering myself nor those people (I don't care for their safety - I just say that to not dig my own grave by posting sth on reddit). When I can't suppress my fury about them, my mood will take a dip and I just proceed as usual. To a sound person I probably still sound like a huge mess, but you needed me to tell you all this to make that judgement and compared to a few years ago, this is bliss, I feel incredible gratitude for myself and the world I get to experience. 

That said. Calling myself utterly fucking functional.. I've been feeling utterly miserable for 2 days now bc of a little thought-excersize to cope with my past. 2008 or so I fell for a classmate and couldn't cope with the emotion. I thought I was lovesick for many years but looking back it feels like I just had some mental malfunction with her as focus. Sure it could've just been love sickness, but I was as afraid of her as I was in love with her. I'd start shaking, jerk when she moves and general swing between the same feeling I'd have around moths (phobia) and not keeping myself from staring at her. Anyways. Last time I saw her was 2010 or so and I was pretty convinced I got over her around 2016. So why the fuck do I care? I feel miserable but not lovesick, I feel despair but I fixed the consequences. And in my attempt to fix my situation I just said horrible things to my psychiatrist until he called the police and had me put into a psychiatric ward. 

The next 3 years were easily the worst shit I've ever been through but they are why I can now be an average person and be grateful and happy about it. It literally made me who I am. So I got no reason to be sad about what happened either. Any negative emotion I associate to this has no reason to exist. I didn't give a fuck 4 for years why would I suddenly have fucks to give again. How the can I get over this bogus? Is there some obvious fact I missed bc I'm not normal enough yet? I don't even know what I'm sad about exactly. Yes I think about that lil shit, but I don't really feel longing so I doubt it's love sickness.  And no, I will not talk to a professional. All they do is follow some book anyways, I can read and learn. Did before, will again.

849,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

First of, English is not my first language, so I am sorry for any spelling errors. 

My boyfriend (30M) and I (25F) live together, and work at the same place. I started there first 2,5 years ago in a part-time position, but have since worked my way up to a full time job. He started there last year, and it caused a lot of problems in our relationship, but we did manage to work it out. This may sound petty on my behalf, but it caused problems because I felt like he was invading my workplace, even though he started working in a different ""branch"". 

The company is pretty big, and we work in two different ""branches"", but in the same office. Normally, we don't have anything to do with eachother during the day. A couple of months ago, I learned that he had applied for a new position at the company, which would sort of make him my boss when we have shifts together, and he could then decide what I do and what I don't do at work. 

Then covid-19 happened, and everything was put on hold, until now. He haven't been told that the position is his yet, but he have started training so that he could fill in if the other ""bosses"" are out sick. Because of the coronavirus, the economy is not that good in the company, and I know that they would never invest in him if they didn't plan on offering him the position after the summer.  

I am really conflicted about this. I know I don't own the workplace just because I started there first, but it still feels like ""my place"". It is also really difficult to get a job in this line of work. I am really happy for him to get this opportunity, he deserves to be acknowledged for all his hard work, but this also means that my time at the company is over, and that I most likely will be out of a job after the summer. 

I can't help but feel like he is pushing me out of my job, and it is really taking a toll in our relationship. I have told him that I am struggling with this, and he have said that if it really bothers me this much, he will say no if they offer him the position. I don't want him to say no to this offer, as I know that this is what he wants, and I do really think that he deserves it, but at the same time I don't want him to take it, and I can't help but let it show.

We have gotten to the point where we almost broke up because of this, and things are just not great right now. I really want this to work out, and I have told him that I need time to be okay with it. He is not taking it very well, and gets very defensive (he just repeats that if it bothers me this much, he will say no, and that he is sad that I am not happy for him and this opportunity). 

So, Reddit, I need your advice. How can i handle this situation? Should I just get over myself and be happy for him?

852,"Just to start, I [18 F] have no history with eating disorders. This is the first time I’m feeling body dysmorphia, but I’ve been trying to help myself be better.

Ever since I was little, my mom has put emphasis on everyone’s body weight, especially women. I know this is because her mom did the same thing to her when she was a kid, and now she pushes those insecurities onto her kids. She never would come out and say “You’re fat,” but she would say quietly, “I noticed you gained a little bit of weight. Why don’t you and I work out together.” She wouldn’t use the word “fat” but she would say “chubby.” Anyways, when I turned 13/14, my metabolism really kicked in and she stopped mentioning my weight bc I guess I was up to her standards now. But recently, I’ve been falling into those insecurities again. 

I have been vegan for almost a year now because I started volunteering at an animal sanctuary, and I was feeling ecstatic! I really loved the foods and everything, but my only concern was that I had to start eating more. This is because most vegan foods don’t have as many calories as animal products. After I eat a big vegan meal, I hate that my stomach immediately shows it. I know it’s normal for your stomach to grow after u eat bc the food obviously has to go somewhere, but I just feel so icky when I look down at my body. 

The only time I love my body is in the morning when I haven’t eaten yet and I’m skinny. I’m a healthy weight when I eat, but I just can’t stand the way my stomach looks. I’m stuck at home with my mom because of the quarantine, and I don’t feel comfortable discussing my body issues with her.

I’m eating about 1 small meal in the morning(usually avocado toast), one large meal at night, and a small dessert like two oreos. But when I’m laying in my bed to sleep, I feel my stomach grumbling. I know I should be eating more, especially since I’m still committed to a vegan diet, but I just can’t bring myself to do so.

So, can anyone recommend how I can start eating more without feeling so bad about my body?",22May2020,1

858,"My brother has been married about two years, and for the last year he's been in Colombia with his husband. I've recently found out that his husband has been physically abusive and extremely controlling and, recently, had a psychotic break. After my brother was threatened and strangled, he fled and is in hiding. He has no family or close friends in Colombia that he trusts.

Due to the pandemic, traveling out of the country is incredibly difficult, and even driving a city over to an airport requires government permission. Thankfully, the US State Department has assisted in securing a flight for expats so that he can return in 10 days. 

I'm extremely worried about my brother's health. He is increasingly paranoid and is having delusions of people coming to kill him and us. He will call and be very clear about his goals only to call later convinced that he can't leave, or that he's being followed. He overhears his name in every conversation. Other hotel guests are making him worried to talk above a whisper.

Over the next 10 days, he will be quarantined, alone, in a foreign country with little money and no close support. His thoughts are already erratic and irrational. I'm scared the worst will happen. I don't want him to kill himself. I don't know how to help. 

I'm not sure if he can be committed to a mental hospital in a foreign country, and I'm not sure if that would help with international travel closed off and his support network in the US. At the very least he would miss the expat flight and be forced to stay until quarantine ends. I'd also be worried that his psychotic husband would be responsible for him while he is committed, but I know nothing of Colombia's medical or legal system. I think he needs to be committed for his own safety, preferably in the US and voluntarily, but I'm not sure if he'll be a danger to himself in the 10 days he has left there. 

There's a lot floating right now. I feel pretty useless. My family has done everything we can logistically to ensure he can return to the US, which is a miracle in it's own right. It's all on my brother now. I can see and hear him breaking. What can we do?",22May2020,1

My mom understands but won’t kick them out.  How do I keep a relationship with my mom when I don’t feel comfortable visiting her and I’m experiencing so much emotional turmoil due to the situation?

864,"Now this happened when I was a teenage minor (16-17) over 5 years ago. 
One time, I ordered pizza for me and my friend. When I got the money and the delivery person showed up, before I opened the door I put the money underwear and rubbed against my balls and gooch(however that's spelled) area. 
I take out the money from my pants and the delivery person opens the door and to my surprise  it is an attractive young lady. Before I can stop her she takes the money from my hand and smiles and says thanks. 
I close the door feeling like a horrible person and idiot for a prank that I thought my friend would laugh. 
I still feel bad about that to this day, and I have changed and been a better person since then. I spoke to my therapist about it and she agreed that it was weird but that teenagers do alot of crazy and wild things. 

Karma came back to me when, but worse.

One day, a ""friend"", pranked me by giving me a some bread that I think he rubbed his crotch on and maybe butt. I ate it, and then afterwards I realized what he most likely did. I chalk that up to karma and didnt try to get him back. 

How can I atone for the dollar bill thing, or what should I do? Do you have similar f'd up pranks you've done. Once again this was years ago when I was a teen around 16 or 17, cant remember exactly.",22May2020,1
865,"So about 3 months ago, my girlfriend and I found a dog on the side of a trail next to a busy street. She had a collar but no tags on her and we didn’t see anyone around that might’ve been looking for her. We brought her back to my apartment and posted her picture along with a description of where we found her on a local public lost dogs group on Facebook along with calling both of the vet offices in town and seeing if anyone knew a dog by that description. We also posted on Snapchat stories and urged people to share, many of which did, the Facebook post got over 150 shares. Our original plan was to just hold onto her until someone came around looking for her. 
A couple weeks go by and not a single word from anyone who knew her. We went to a vet to check if she was microchipped (she wasn’t) and she said that usually dogs can be considered yours after the first week but legally, once you take her to the vet yourself she can be considered yours. We take this into consideration and keep holding onto her. A 3 more weeks go by and we still haven’t heard anything. In our minds, we’ve decided that it’s been long enough and if someone was looking for her, we should’ve heard by now. We decide to take her to the vet, microchipping her, getting tags, and investing well over $300 into her to be able to take care of her long term. 
Fast forward to today, over 3 months later. We were walking with the dog on the same trail that we found her when someone comes up to us asking if we found the dog. We say yes and the person describes how she was lost and was able to call to the dog and the dog was very excited to see her and seemed to answer the call. We talked for a while and she said that she had a puppy that had originally been a replacement for the dog we have and that she’d be willing to trade us. She also said that she’d be willing to reimburse us for all of the money we have spent on her thus far. She also mentioned that when she saw us on the sidewalk, she saw that the dog was happy and well taken care of and she was ready to let us have her but that her 6 year old in the backseat saw her right after and immediately wanted to pull over. We told her we would think about it and give her a call back later to see what could be done. 
My girlfriend and I have called both of our parents and her parents both say that legally, she’s ours and that we should just keep her because obviously the dog wasn’t being taken care of well enough. My dad said that the law was on our side and that morally, that six year old seems to pull on the heart strings and that if we gave her back, he wouldn’t blame us but he said that “also if you decided to keep her, I wouldn’t blame you and that if you’re looking for verification, you’ve got it from me.” My mom was a bit more shy about it and said that she doesn’t have an answer for us and that it’s something we will have to figure out for ourselves. 
Personally, I think morally that it would be the right thing to do to give her back but I would also be very hesitant to do so because she had no tags on the collar when we found her, no microchip, and it took 3 months for somebody to find her. She is just over a year old so it seems like all of that stuff should have been in place by now. I’m concerned for the well being of the dog if we were to give her up which makes me want to keep her. I also feel like it would be very mean to keep her. I’m not sure what to do.",22May2020,1
867,"Context: I live with my two parents and my brother. I'm 16 and my brother is 18.
Prior to lockdown, my mom rarely left the house; she'd only go out for shopping and the occasional family meeting. (To give more context, she is unemployed and not extremely social, hence why she hardly had any reason to go out.)

Now, however, she suddenly decided that lockdown can't decide her life, and that she wants to go out, meet up with our family and 'go and see new places'. When we tell her not to for her, and our, safety, she completely snaps, shouting about how we ""aren't human"", ""have no life"" and ""don't love our family"" because we don't want to go and meet up with them face to face. 

For the record, we always face time and call them, so it's not like we just never keep in contact or anything. My mom says that we are letting electronics govern our lives, and that talking on facetime means absolutely nothing in comparison to talking when in eachother's presence. She isn't completely wrong, but it's almost as if she has forgotten that there is a virus and we probably shouldn't be going out to meet our family, who we will inevitably make physically contact with.

In addition, when we tell her not to, she goes on about how she wants to go back to Greece (which is her home country. She moved here years ago but we usually visit our family there every summer) and leave us here because she says that she hates living with us since we don't want to go out so often.

She says that she'd much rather 'live a free life' and die from covid-19 than stay physically alive but with a 'dead spirit' indoors. When we tell her we (obviously) don't want her to die because we care about her and are worried for her, she says things like ""no, you're more worried for yourself than me because if I die you won't have any dinner"" or ""you don't care about me, you just need me to clean the house"". Keep in mind, we actually share chores and I cook for us a lot, so I'm not sure if she's becoming delusional or just finding things to say.

She always talks about how we are the ones holding her back from living her life, that she wishes she stayed in Greece and never met my Dad, that she's trapped etc etc but she never went out and 'lived a free life' when she had a chance; when there WASN'T a VIRUS spreading, when she had the luxury to go and do whatever she wanted to do. She just stayed at home watching netflix/tv or just going on her phone for hours. (Which is very hypocritical because now she talks about how electronics are bad for us, even though that's all she did before lockdown.) 

We can't wake up without feeling anxious about how she's going to act, or do anything without worrying about triggering her. 

My dad stopped trying to talk to her about her behaviour a while ago (they still do argue a lot but it's mostly my mom who ignites the arguments) and has given up, and my brother is getting sick of it too and is looking to move out because of her (he's old enough now). I'm really the only one who keeps trying, but I don't know anymore, I'm sick of getting hit and  shouted at, and being the only one who she singles out because I'm the only one who speaks up. I'm kind of alone in this right now.

Am I being too paranoid about the virus? Should I just let her go and do whatever she would like to do and hope she calms down? She is my mother so maybe I should just listen to her? Is this abuse or am I completely misreading the situation?",22May2020,1

Just now he asked me during TV a question. I misheard and so answered right, but wrong. He comes with new questions wich I can't answer correct. Then he starts insulting me, calling me stupid or some shit. Then I try correct things saying I misheard before and answered something else. Then he accused me of lying and got mad af and brought up the past. My mom as always took his side, got mad and told me to stfu. She always assumes he's right and I'm lying.

About one and a half years ago me and my friends (about ten of them) had a party every few weekends. Then someone brought alcohol for the first time. Everybody drank except me, simply because I didn't want to. Then it went on for about half a year. In the meantime a lot of people started smoking etc...

Since one year my friends party almost every day off, drink, smoke, have fun - and all this without me.I have it very good with everybody and also contact and so on, but at parties I am not invited by anyone...

Do you have any (serious) advice for me on how to get invited to the parties again, because I like to spend time with people?

879,"Honestly, I don't know what to do anymore.

There's this girl I met at work a few months ago. I don't know how I  developed a crush on her, it just happened the first time I heard her  laughing, I guess? I don't even know if she was flirting back then, but  she used to casually joke about some stuff that could be easily taken  out of context and she knew that, and would wink at me or hold eye  contact with me and so on....

So one day, I decided to ask her out in the most obvious way and I'm 99% sure she knew I had a crush on her, yet she inclined to go out with me. However, dumb me confessed to her that I'm bisexual and I am into her. She  didn't respond with anything, however her behavior seemed fine towards  me for a few days and shortly after, kind of out of the blue, she started ignoring me. I was like, okay, I will not bother her anymore. I  tried to avoid her so she doesn't feel uncomfortable, however around a  month after this happened, we met on the way to the station after work  and she was looking at me with a smile. And then she suddenly started  holding eye contact with me again, or would turn around and look at me  when she goes to her place or even come around our desks for literally  no reason.

Dumb me decided to ask her to hang out a second time since she  suggested to me and other colleagues to hang out sometime after work, fully knowing people from her own team won't be able to come.  Nonetheless, she declined.

Then quarantine happened and I told myself I'll try to move on...  Yeah, no. I still keep thinking about her. Things seemed better last 2  weeks but then she suddenly messaged me to help her with work, which happened outside of working hours, but I guess she saw me still online,  even though there are other people who could've helped her, granted it  would have happened the next day. I was, obviously, more than happy to  help, so I even went out of my way. I spent 2 days staying out of  working hours with her just so we could solve something that wasn't even urgent. She did this a few times the past week.

&amp;#x200B;

And here I am again, back to square one. I don't know why she is acting that way and I don't know why it takes me so much time to move on, considering I barely know her. I guess it's just that I secretly hope she likes me back and not knowing why she is acting like this is driving  me crazy.

Yeah, I've been told she is most probably playfully flirting and that's all, but I am stupid.  I guess I am here to see some outside  perspective.... Should I try interacting with her more and eventually ask her straight up if she is into me or just try to move on somehow?",22May2020,1

882,"Okay, hopefully this flows and makes sense. 

At first, I (25F) thought that I just had love for him (26M). But then I started to feel jealous about this girl he started to bring around. The girl and I are different, and probably don’t know her well but her personality isn’t really my cup of tea. 

I’m still unsure if I really have feelings for him or if I’m just attached. I think I’m attached because I feel anxious/uneasy when he’s not home and comfort when he returns. 

I brought the feelings up to him once and he said he views our relationship platonically. In the situation I was confused because I feel attachment/feelings for him but also I was about to start dating another. And when I did date the other guy and brought him around I felt my friend would act different, more mopey. 

My issue is, I believe things are getting more serious with the girl he has been seeing. This makes me feel uneasy and sad. It can make me cry but is it just out of fear of losing a friend? I hate that it’s hard for me to be happy for him in this time. I’m not sure where to go from here. If I try to distance myself and not spend as much time with him I feel bad because I can tell he wants to spend time together. 

I also really do want him in my life for the long run, but at what expense to my feelings? Any ways to change my feelings? Or look at the situation differently?

885,"TLDR; I want to stay with my dad this weekend, my mom thinks I'm somehow gonna get infected because he works in a restaurant. Is it better to just stay with my mom, or should I convince her to let me stay with my dad? 

I'm 18 and I live with my mom, always have. Since this all began, my dad would drive over and we would get takeout and eat in the car, or he'd help me practice my driving, and then bring me back with my mom. I like staying over at his house because he's all around more lax with things. My mom has been expecting me to study and do things with all this free time, and while I honestly haven't been keeping up too well with my studies, I overall still have pretty good grades so I don't think they're too much of an issue considering the school year is almost over.. But every time she comes in my general vicinity and I'm watching YouTube on my phone, she doesn't hide her disappointment and makes me feel awful for just wanting to relax during the day. I still help out around the house because I know my mom is busy working from home, but she acts like I never do anything but chill. 

I'm kind of going off topic, but my point is that my dad is just more relaxed with me, and he's fine with me taking a break because he knows that eventually all my work will get done, and he encourages me to relax in other ways without making me feel like if i'm not productive 24/7 I'm a failure. 

I want to stay over just the weekend, but he works at a restaurant that is still open for take out and delivery. My mom thinks that it's dangerous for me to stay with him considering everything that's going on. But she still lets me see him when we go to grab food, so I'm not sure how it makes too much of a difference. As soon as he gets home, he changes clothes and takes a shower, so I feel like anything that COULD be infected wouldn't even be an issue. They're super clean and efficient where he is, so I feel like they are also taking good precautions to protect the workers as much as the customers...  

But anyway, I'm not sure what I should do. I know I dive into details a bit, but I kind of just needed to explain things a bit so you understand why I want to go over and whether or not she's over exaggerating this whole situation or if truly I'm endangering myself or not.. Thank you.",22May2020,2

When I was like 19 or so, I had a mutual friend who got pregnant and she used to be a good friend and while she's not the smartest cookie in the jar, she used to be humble and down to earth 

She asked me for advice on the most ridiculous things, like teaching her child how to count with blocks because she didn't understand it although her kid had a book for children... this didn't bother me much because she used to be a decent human being back then. Now, I'm a big fan of reading and I have a master's degree. 

For a year or so now she took ONE gig by showing a brand bikini on her insta, now she thinks of herself as a model although she doesn't even work at all or gets any job as a model at all. Her ego has shot up to the moon the last year and I feel like I list a friend. 

I have known this woman for 10+ years but lately she has become an extremely shallow woman, who spends her time shaking her ass twerking with micro shorts stuck in her butt on Instagram everyday. Thinks that's absolutely normal, and that every man has to treat her like a queen and can't take criticism. 

I just can't talk to her anymore and now that she has a bunch of ""model"" friends who are actually escorts with their portfolio online and are rooting for her to do ever more shallow stuff, I wouldn't care if she was a prostitute, she is not my property but she doesn't listen to me one bit anymore and has done really stupid shit.

Things got worse when she got a boyfriend AND some emotionally unstable sugar daddy, the guy is so obsessed and needy he won't leave her no matter what she does, like being semi nude and twerking everyday on Instagram, her life has become men paying for her bills, her doing absolutely nothing but taking care of her daughter and cooking for herself and being a hoe online while complaining she doesn't get paid enough and that she wants a richer BF. 
Mind you that because of Corona &amp; these men not living nearby these guys are not even touching her for the thousands of dollars she gets from them. They don't know about each other, both treat her very well, but it's not enough for her. 

I don't know if I can talk some sense into her I have never dealt with anyone so extremely shallow and dumb.

896,"So, long story short, up until I was around 8, my dad would come into my room and touch me down there. It would mostly happen when he was drunk. I don't remember how long or often it went on, just that I've been sexually aware and masturbating since I was 2. Because I don't remember a lot, I've been telling myself that maybe it wasn't as bad as I thought it was. And even though I used to have mild ptsd symptoms (ie, a flood of guilt and disgust from getting my nipples touched or whenever I orgasmed), I don't feel like I'm traumatized enough or that it affects me enough now to make a big deal out of it and risk ruining our family (he's a good person to everyone else and takes care of our family financially)

I tend to age regress and act naive when he's around. For some reason, I don't think I can hate him no matter how much I want to. I don't feel any love or affection towards that man either. I could probably go through life pretending it never happened and would be fine, but at the same time it just feels wrong to ignore it.

I want to move out but in my family it's tradition to live with your parents until you are married. Since I'm a girl, it would be ""improper"" if I tried to leave and I would probably get shamed and disowned for it.

900,"Hi fellow redditor, 

I need advice on something. Sorry in advance for the super long post, I hope you still read it and help me clear my mind.

A bit of background first. I'm a nurse, on the present time specifically working on a virus focused ward. 
A few month before the beginning of the crisis, we had a new head nurse. She's proven to be quite good. Really caring for us all, fighting to have help, and equipment, and recognition since the crisis. 

And a few month before that, one of my colleagues (M), which I thought as as a friend, went  on a long sick leave for depression and burnout. I thought she was quite distant during that time, not replying to texts, ... but brushed it off, I just thought I reminded her too much of work. 

Then she came back to work. We all think it is too early, and quite relating to a ""I want to be a hero too"" feeling, but I did my best to make the work as easy as possible for her, replying to her questions, guiding her, ...

Then I learned that there has been an incident with her. Another colleague (S), freshly hired, complained to HR for harassment from her. Of course, HR said they'd investigate, and put a blame on her if it was necessary (not sure of the translation, it's something that you get when you're late all the time, or other ""minor"" rules broken, and if you get three you can be fired for it). So they went to the head nurse (the previous one), that told them it was not really true, that it was more of a clique thing, that the new colleague was too sensitive,... and included me and two other nurses in the ""clique"" thing. Without telling any of us, obviously. Soooo ... no write up, but our names were all a bit tarnished without our knowing. 

It was one of the other blamed nurse that told me, and she said our new head nurse found out when she poked around to know why S was so anxious about the return of M. 

All of that just to explain that I am a bit more reticent to claim M as a friend. 

Then tonight, she texted me (it's a translation of course, but I quote:

""Hey, I received a bottle to thank us for our work, we'll open it between us - she cites a few names: myself, herself, the two co-blamed nurses, the head nurse, and another coworker ""

I ask her ""well when? Won't it be difficult with the virus and all?""

And her reply, which is the part that leaves me speechless:
 - lol, well, when we can, head nurse told me ""we'll go eat together at the restaurant one day, between us, implied between us white people. ""

I completely froze, didn't answer to that part. Did my head nurse said that implication, or did M assumed it from what she said? 

I can work with a racist person, it's just one ass, and as long as it doesn't show on how she's treating patients, I'm just going to ignore it, I'm not a confrontational person, and anyway everyone is a little racist. 
But this is not just implications and rude comments, it's just fucking racist bullshit. And I want to know if my head nurse said that, but if she did, what can I fucking do. And if she didn't, how do I ask her without putting M under the train...

It might be silly, but it makes me sick, I can't think of anything else rn ...",22May2020,1
901,"Throwaway, because none of my other friends can know of this. 

Two months ago, my best friend got an amazing job opportunity. Her aunt got her an interview at a firm, where she works as well. She got the job and it was amazing from the start. Great pay, great job experience, especially for someone who is still in college. She would essentially be the right-hand man of some pretty powerful boss of many successful firms. 

Well the initial excitement didn’t last long. It started off mild, with a few comments about how good she looked. Mind you, this was the first week of work and he was already complimenting her ass. But she ignored it, in one ear and out the other. But it’s been escalating ever since and I’m very worried. He started talking more and more about her sex life, asking her how many people she’s slept with, if she’s wet and if he can touch her. Then he started openly fantasizing about sleeping with her, how good it would feel if she’d jerk him off and blow him. She’s 22 and he’s approaching his 60s. 

Last week he confessed his love for her, told her how he’d give her all of his firms after he retires and how she can spend as much of his money as she wants, as long as she can be his. And this was after he bought some business rooms for her that they went to check out and he LOCKED her in. He was touching her while she kept swiping his hand away and tried to kiss her multiple times. Thank god nothing worse happened, but I’m sure that one day it will. Because he never stops, after multiple attempts of hers to tell him how she will never be with him and how he’s getting her in an uncomfortable position. 

The thing is, he knows he repels her. He says it multiple times. He knows what he’s doing is wrong, yet her refuses to accept the fact that she doesn’t want anything to do with him. He always chalks it up to some other excuse that they’re gonna resolve, so they can happily be together after that. He keeps doing these disgusting things, like lifting her skirt up and telling her that he’s only going to caress her a bit, trying to kiss her and touch her to the point she has to push him away. I’m not even going to start with the things she has to hear from him. 

It’s disgusting and she’s devastated, plus he gives her so much work so that she’s basically managing his many firms all on her own. The stress is destroying her, she sometimes jokes that she feels like she’s going crazy, but I know it’s true. 

Yet she refuses to quit. There’s multiple reasons that keep her there. First and probably the most trivial is the pay; it’s ridiculous, especially for someone new to the field. She also is getting so much experience, which she wouldn’t get anywhere else. 

Another problem is that her aunt got her this job. She is very close to the boss and both of them have put so much trust in my friend, that she feels she’d let her down if she’d quit now. Even though the aunt is already so shitty for getting her this job in the first place, when she has *known* him for so long and he does the same things to her. So she knew what she was getting my friend into. But my friend knows none of her family will believe her if she tells them what’s happening, because her aunt will refuse to admit what a hellhole this place is and what she’s willing to do for money. And all of her relatives will be mad at my friend for letting go off such an opportunity, which her aunt tried so hard to get for her. She thinks even her parents won’t understand, because she’s told some small details to her mom and her mom just keeps saying that no job is perfect. 

Lastly, he’s very influential. He can ruin her life by just sending a few emails, destroying any chance of her getting another job. I don’t know if he’d do that, but he’s such a piece of shit that he would, especially with all of the things she knows about him and his illegal business activities. 

Yesterday she had to go to another firm and he followed her there, locked the door and closed the blinds. He kept pushing himself on her, until he got a call from her aunt. She asked him where he is and if my friend is there too. He said no, hung up and told my friend to get the hell away from here because there’s gonna be trouble. Thank god she got to leave but I’m really afraid something bad is going to happen. I know it will. She has another meeting with her boss tomorrow and I have a bad feeling. She is too scared her life is going to fall apart if she quits. She still thinks she can somehow get it through his head that she'll never be with him and that he'll stop. 

 I can’t keep seeing her like this but I have no clue what do to.",22May2020,1

*Some background info* 
He’s liked me for about 7 months but I ignored him and just assumed he was like every other guy who just wanted to hookup and treat me bad. I decided to give him a chance and I’m glad I did. We’ve been together for about 4 months. 

We get along perfectly, he has no red flags, he treats me so good (at first I thought it was a joke because I never had been treated like this). He’s patient, kind and is going to be extremely successful in the future. Our communication is great and we understand each other on a deeper level. I see nothing wrong with him. He has everything I would want in a partner. It’s almost too good to be true.

I can’t see myself with anyone else and can see a future with him. He has told me he can see us long term and would like to marry me one day. Is  this too much coming from a 19 year old guy? Should I believe him?


However.....We are going to different colleges, so technically it would be long distance but we are only 40 minutes away from each other.

908,"23F, I’ve been having issues with my short term memory for about 9 months now; things like remembering quotes from movies I just saw or something a friend told me to check out have been really hard to remember, even when I try to make a point to hold on to that info. I also have had a really hard time getting myself to pay attention to someone talking for more than a minute at a time, example if a friend is explaining something to me I will listen to what they say and without me even realizing it I tuned them out for a few seconds and can’t remember what they said during this time at all.

910,"Hi, if anyone else has siblings and can offer some insight, I want to know if my situation is concerning or if I'm just overreacting.

Since my younger brother (17M) and I (19F) have been self-isolating together, we've been ""play fighting"" like we did when we were younger. However, it's escalated to the point that he's actually hurting me. It was fine in elementary school when we were more evenly matched, but now that he's 7"" taller than me, the games have started to actually hurt.

I have a degenerative condition that affects my joints (think knee buckling due to awkward angle or arm coming out of socket from lifting a pillow) and, although I don't think he means to hurt me, my condition has made it difficult to deal with him cornering me, jabbing, head butting, etc. He knows about my condition but I'm not sure he understands how much it affects my life/how much pain I'm in. I've tried to push him off of me/yelled at him to stop but it's hard to persuade him when he's so much stronger than me and thinks I'm playing along.

Apart from this aspect of our relationship, we have a good friendship and I really love him + my family but I don't know how to address this or if it's even normal for (nearly) adult siblings to still play fight.

912,"Trying to keep this as short as possible, if you need more detail just ask.

I'm a guy in my early 30s.  I had a lot of different jobs from 18 - 29, but haven't worked in ~3 years.  This is largely due to bipolar 1 disorder which wasn't diagnosed until I was 29, and didn't start getting effectively treated (right medication) until about eight months ago.  I've been on disability since the diagnosis and live in a low income building for people with disabilities.  Since things have been going better since the new medication (no involuntary hospitalizations since), I've been looking to improve my life.  I don't want to be on disability forever.

I'm looking at going back to school, but didn't do as well as I could have in high school, so some things I just might not be able to do.  I want to get educated in music as a personal passion, but should mostly learn about computers for a career.  I'm good with computers, however I don't understand the major/minor system of university at all.  I took an admission cost calculator for one course per term, and at the bottom it said most undergraduates take five courses per term.  I don't understand why this is, over focusing more time on doing well on fewer courses you really want to take.  I also don't understand the university system well in general - the undergraduate/graduate thing.

I am looking at university because the colleges I have looked at either have bad reviews, with people saying one year at that college costs as much as a two year full load at a university.  Or the better reviewed colleges having courses I would like, but requiring two years of post-secondary which I don't have right now.  Both combined make it seem like university is the best bet, but I don't really understand that system.  Any insight here would be appreciated.

I'm also wondering about student loans.  I'm on disability so could pay some off each month, but only have $232CDN (I'm in Alberta, Canada if that matters) left over after essentials are covered.  Hence I would probably need a parttime job while attending school, but am not sure how I would explain the gap on my resume.

I don't have a vehicle anymore as I sold it years ago when I realized I would no longer be able to afford it (long story but the short is once I left my parent's I could no longer afford a vehicle), and that causes me some stress as well.

At my age and with my history is school even worth it, or should I just focus on getting an entry level position somewhere and get experience that way?  Most all (if not all) IT positions say they require school and that being the field I want to enter is the main reason I am looking at how to return to school properly.

I'm currently in an employment skills program, and one of the other students has a college degree but is unable to find work in his field and is in the program mostly with people like me, which honestly has given me some doubts about the value of going back to school at my age.

915," **Hello everyone,** 

for a long time now, I've been **fascinated by the world of event organizing** **and management** \- things like city running races, large theatre productions, festivals. I've always loved reading about **backstage details, lighting and sound technology, team management, work delegation,** etc. I like the idea that a huge group of people comes together, and from what was a simple idea in the beginning, they plan over the span of many weeks and then execute a seemingly perfect show. 

Naturally, since I find it really appealing, **I would like to get into this industry.** The field that would interest me the most would be some **general executive organization** (think something like 1st / 2nd AD in the film industry), maybe even lighting department, but I'm afraid that my lack of knowledge of electrical wiring would be a problem.

I believe that from a **theoretical standpoint**, I'm more than **capable of handling an entry-level position,** in order to **get some actual experience** and possibly to move up the ladder after some time. 

**But what are the entry-level positions in this industry and how can I get to them?** 

Again, to use an example, in the film industry, an entry position would be a place runner, basically, a bag holder and a coffee maker guy, who is however in a **close connection to the main crew** and therefore **gets to learn from them** and **sees them in action at work**.

The only entry-level positions in the event industry that I can think I could apply to would be something like a festival security part-time job, but I think that's just a dead-end since these people are often hired by contractors (or am I wrong?) and with my height of 5'7'' I'm not at all a body type to take the role of security. 

**So, if you work in this industry and / or know something about it, would you mind sharing some tips on this?** Also, if there are any books or some other practical resources I should know about, I will be happy to read about them.

In the moment, i agreed and sent a nude mirror photo where you can’t really see much apart from probably some boob and my body but I can’t really remember as i deleted it myself. Not the worse it could have been but still very embarrassing. This person sent the photo around to his own friends so there are a possible 10 people that actually had access to the photo and more that saw it but at the time no one really knew about it apart from a specific group. The person who i sent the photo to has since passed away so without sounding disrespectful, there is no worry about them sharing it again obviously. The friends he sent it to hardly know me so are unlikely to care or remember however there is one person who lives in my town that had the photo saved that told me if i met him he would delete the photo. I did end up meeting him and becoming sexually involved with him (i was young and dumb) which he bragged about and he is one of the notoriously childish and douchey boys in my town and what’s bugging me is that i see him around regularly so i doubt he ever really forgot about that as we were involved with each other for a few months. Ive been with my current boyfriend since a few months after this whole trauma and the only person who would really remember my nude and even still have it had his own dick pic literally posted on snapchat for everyone to see by another girl.

To sum this up: 4 years ago my nude was shared, someone in my town who lives near me and i see around possibly still has it. I am worried it will resurface. It never crossed my mind much until now as i blocked it out at the time",22May2020,1

Earlier today I was talking to an online friend (she is 8 hours behind me) and we got along really well for the past 2 weeks, however earlier today after I had to go to sleep due to having online lessons later that day (it was 1am my time) she msged me saying she hopes to hear from me again sometime and unfriended and blocked me on everything so I can't contact her (just after I fell asleep) and ask why she did it or anything and i have no idea what to do. You help would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: I am 14 and Male she is almost 2 months older.",22May2020,1
927,"I’m (F) a freshman in college and I’ve been dating my boyfriend for a few months now. I didn’t date at all in high school so this problem hasn’t come up before. Before this whole quarantine thing, my bf and I were just starting to have sex and I wanted to go on the pill for extra safety. I told my mom that I needed to (as I’m under their insurance and she’s find out anyway), but she freaked out. She told my dad, and he did too. Big time. My mom grew up in a very Christian household where sex was barely acknowledged, let alone allowed. Because I haven’t been able to see my bf during quarantine, she’s calmed down a bit, but now that it’s looking like it’s coming to an end I’m scared she’s going to freak out all over again. I’ve brought up the fact that I wanted to see him once or twice (just to go on a date! Not to do anything explicit!), but she shuts down all conversation and makes it pretty clear she doesn’t want me to. How can I approach this with her? I’m afraid this might hurt our relationship or that she won’t let me see him at all, neither of which I want.",22May2020,1
928,"I apologize that this is a long post, but there’s a bit of backstory as to why I’m uncomfortable. 

I have a friend who I’ll call Max for this post. Max is my best friend of almost a decade. We are inseparable and (before covid-19) spend every single weekend together. We met in high school, been through hell and high water together, and he’s seen me at my absolute worst when dealing with my mental health issues. Max calls me “Sunshine” and it is a very important/special nickname to me. He started calling me that when I started getting a grip on my mental health and, in his opinion, became brighter and more “me” in my personality. He calls me Sunshine because it’s cute, one of my favorite colors is yellow, and it’s a quiet reminder that I’m me even on my bad mental days. (I hope that makes sense.)

Thus enters my friend who is making me uncomfortable; we’ll call him Jason. He’s been my friend for a few years now and doesn’t really click with Max, and that being said, they don’t hang out together. And to be blunt, it’s obvious that Jason gets jealous/angry at how much time I spend with my literal best friend. I get “of course you are” texts anytime he asks what I’m doing and I say I’m with Max. 

I can ignore all that, but this were I have an issue with Jason: At the beginning of the year, I spent a holiday with Max. And we posted on Facebook about it, with him calling me Sunshine. The following couple of days, Jason was asking me about the nickname and I explained that it was an important thing between Max and I. The following week Jason had started calling me Sunshine. I don’t like it and he didn’t ask if I was okay with it. I’ve told him multiple times to stop calling me that as it makes me uncomfortable.

Anytime I tell him to stop, he gets angry about it and says he doesn’t understand why Max gets to “call me anything” and he doesn’t get to. I’ve never said he couldn’t give me a nickname, just that he isn’t allowed to call me that specific name. He continuously says I’m being too sensitive over something that “doesn’t matter.” I have to repeatedly tell him the reason for my nickname, express my mental health issues over and over again (making me upset), and reiterate that the name has no meaning to him, so he doesn’t get to call me it. Even after every argument about it, he continues to call me Sunshine. It’s making me hate a name that has always made me feel stable. And his attitude about not respecting my wishes is making me hate him/our friendship. 

How do I get Jason to stop?? Why is he doing this to begin with? How do I get him to understand that he is making me hate our friendship because of his disrespectful attitude? Am I actually being too sensitive?",22May2020,1
929,"So I have kind of a long story that I'm going to try to condense. So me and my girlfriend have been helping out one of our friends that got kicked out. We'll call her C. So we have been staying with another one of our friends at his house with his brother and his mom. Friend is M, brother is Z, mom is mom. Well one day while everyone was at work except for C and Z, Z raped C and C came to me and told me about it. We told everyone else and tried to have a discussion about it to see what was going on. Basically, M got into a big fight with his mom and brother and got the shit beaten out of him. We have been staying at another friend's house while Z and mom tried to find somewhere else to go. C is in the process of getting a restraining order on Z. We are trying to work everything out legally but my biggest concern is Z or his mom coming for retaliation. Z and mom know a lot of bad people. They have done a lot of bad things. I'm scared they'll put a hit out on us or something like that. They haven't said anything about it, but I don't think we could go to the cops just for being scared something will happen. The reason I'm not posting this on r/legaladvice is because I don't know if there's a way to handle that legally. I just need advice on what to do or any way to protect ourselves.

936,"Hey everyone, I am a rising sophomore in college and I recently got admitted to NYU Gallatin as a transfer student. At my current college, I'm on the track to graduate a semester early and possibly a year early. I live at home. My college has the worst business curriculum and it's not ranked highly on anything. It has a 90% acceptance rate. NYU has so many opportunities in the city with a better quality education.

I plan on working in the entertainment/music business, hopefully working as a marketing executive at a production company or a record label. 

While this sounds like a stupid question, which path would you recommend I follow? Especially to you college seniors and alumni, what's the best advice can you give regards to this? Is spending the extra money over a better education with prestige better than graduating early from a no-name crappy school? Or vice versa? I know the wiser answer is the state school option, but I'd appreciate gaining some insight. Thank you",22May2020,1

938,"I’m 25 years old 3 years out of college absolutely hating everything about my life. I can’t stand the life i am living. I’ve only been working full time for about 2 and a half years now and it’s absolutely killing me on the inside.

I live everyday with regret thinking about the past 5 years and how I could have done so much different and how other decisions I could’ve made would maybe have led me down a happier path. I really don’t understand how so many people just accept working 40+ hours a week slaving away at work only to come home and use most of the free time on more “work” and chores at home. 

2 and a half years of working at a shitty company has ruined my ambition and desire to ever want to work for a big company again. All I’ve seen are how corrupt the average workplace is and how it seems to just take stupidity and being someone’s friend to move up. Everything seems so backwards in the workplace and it’s really killed my motivation.

I honestly think if I just keep continuing down this road that is the “American Dream” 9-5 job with a mortgage and bills that I’m not going to make it to 30.

My job pays well but all I can think about everyday is how depressed I am when I have to go and how depressed I am while I’m there. I’ve been applying to other stuff for a year and can’t even get an interview.

I have passions in other hobbies but even that passions has severely died since I have started working full time. I don’t have any issues with money; in fact, I am so worried about falling behind like my parents were that I’m afraid to spend money on anything but absolute essentials. 

I feel like I’m trapped in an endless cycle of misery and just need help. Do I try to move somewhere else? A new career? Make money off my true passions?",22May2020,1

I’ve lost friends here because I don’t like to party...Maybe I’ve had enough and I’m just ready to leave Texas.

942,"I was on a website called Omegle last night which is basically an anonymous chatroom where you get paired up with a stranger and talk on Webcam. 

I come across this 19 year old girl who is hysterical, crying, begging me to call 911 as she's holding a knife to her throat. Obviously she could be anywhere in the world so theres nothing I can except try and talk to her, so I do. 

She tells me she's sad because her parents are dead (which she later tells me she killed them when she was younger) and she hates her grandmother who she lives with. It gets really bad and she told me she stabbed her grandmother multiple times tonight (which I'm pretty sure was a lie) and didn't want to go back to the ""hospital"". 

I dont want her to disconnect from the call so I basically just listen to what she has to say and try and comfort her until I can get some information. At the end of the call (about 3 hours of talking) I was lucky enough to get her phone number, snapchat account and her address. 

Fast forward to today, I text her as soon as I wake up and ask if she's okay. She is being very vague but says yes. I ask if she is going to hurt herself and tell me she doesn't know. The last thing I ask is if shes going to hurt her family and all she said was yes and has ignored me sense then. 

I am 100% confident I have her real address and I dont know what to do.

I think she's going to kill someone and herself.

But it’s been slow and she has bad teeth problems, she gets such bad infections where she’s groaning and crying over it and it scares me so much to see and hear her in pain, she has arthritis too and it’s always scared me to see her in such pain since I was a little girl, and I don’t know what to do to help her, it scares me so bad and I don’t have anyone to turn to, I’m alone and it scares me, she scares me.

947,"Here’s a little back story first. My boyfriend (m21) and I (f20) work as managers together, we live together and we have two kitties (f1) (f11). We have these crew members who are also dating but recently they’ve become extremely toxic. About two weeks ago I would say we agreed to take in their kitten who is only 6 months old because they aren’t able to take care of it at the moment since they both live with the boyfriend’s mom who can’t have pets in her apartment. When we agreed, our relationship with our coworkers was a little shaky but I wanted to give the kitten a nice home with a good atmosphere even if it was temporary. Now, here’s the thing. When they brought the kitten over she was skin and bones, absolutely no meat on her and she was a little feisty. They said that’s just how she is. However, only 2 weeks in, their little baby has been starting to get some meat on her bones and she’s been a very gentle and happy cat. I also had found out from the bf last week that the gf had been neglecting her kitty bc she’s been working too much and is depressed which was causing him to have to care for it here and there. 

Here’s the other thing. They’ve become so toxic and has attempted to bring everyone at work, especially my bf and I, into their drama, that nobody really wants much to do with them. They’re now saying that they don’t feel comfortable with us taking care of her kitten since we want nothing to do with them but they have nowhere/no one else to care for her. I’m nervous for the day we have to give them the cat back because of how neglected she was at their place. She’s proven to be such a loving and happy kitten and shouldn’t have to go through all this, so I’m deeply concerned for her wellbeing at this point.

The question remaining is: should I call animal control and report the issue (the kitten being neglected and mistreated) or should I just give the cat back and try to forget about it?",22May2020,2

I ran away from my house to a domestic violence shelter because i wasnt feeling safe. 

I got there and this guy started talking to me. He asked if i meditate and I told him yes and my religious beliefs. He got super confused and ever since has not been able to get the concept of spirituality out of his head.

On top of that, he asked to see my facebook photos. He saw photos of me in the suburbs and my life, and got so mad and insecure with his life at the same time. He basically said that i thought my life/situation was bad, but homelessness in my case was perfectly preventable. Whereas he grew up with close to nothing in a dangerous neighborhood. He spent the rest of the day saying this made him feel super insecure with all of the things he has and now he feels mad and like he doesnt have anything. 

I felt obligated to keep talking to him because i felt sorry for how i messed him up. Then, after he got kicked out of the shelter, I was hoping that we could slowly stop talking, but he said he would he on the street again with very little money. I then felt really rude saying he couldnt live with me once i got an apartment. When he was literally living on the street. Im seeing him again tomorrow and feel like i have to say yes to offering him housing because its rude to be like, no... If i did, i dont know if hes the type to not pay rent, what hes like to live with, and if i didnt like living with him i dont know how id tell him ""i dont like living with you.""

Since i was so rude earlier on and ruined his mind, i feel obligated to be nice and make up for it but really uncomfortable with how to cut it off.

951,"btw I’m not talking responsibility wise but more I guess in general mentality wise!
I rather be 20 tbh since it’s in the middle of 19 and 21.

Ever since I turned 21 a few months ago, I’ve been depressed.
Not that I’m old , I get I’m young. But the idea that I’m 22 end this year and then 23 next year is making me feel overwhelmed!

Now I’m not talking responsibility wise. 
I’m working, I study, Help out around the house (yes I still live with my parents, more a cultural thing and it’s not really common around my area or maybe I just went to a very cultural high school) 
But just to make it clear I’m not living off them! I’m happy to be with them for now and so are they! 

At the same time I’ll miss them allot when I have to leave them in a few years when I’m married!! 
They do so much and I feel so greatful !! 

Marriage is another thing that overwhelms me allot too! I’m in a serious relationship for almost a year and bit and I love him allot and do see us in the future!! But I’m more someone that’s just likes to live at the present than focus allot of on the future ? Is that bad ??? Maybe because he’s my first serious relationship! 
but I’m getting overwhelmed as time goes by!! I’m scared that one day I’ll have to get married and it had nothing to do with my boyfriend it’s literally just the idea of it! Like the idea of bills, work stress, maybe having blood pressure but this time instead of having blood pressure about my favourite show ending, having blood pressure about real situations!! Like what if i end up in divorce ????
The only thing that excites me about marriage if the dress and food Lol! I don’t think I’ll be ready to be married until I’m deadass 27-28 !! 
Btw my boyfriend knows this and he just laughs and tells me “babe we young, why u even stressing about marriage now and that it will be when we both are ready in the future” 
Luckily my boyfriend isn’t the type to focus on that right now as we are young but I’m noticing most people at 20s in relationships are already thinking about marriage or the future future!
The future I can think about is my degree 

My friends are also very similar in mind set as me! Sometimes we think if we even act our age or not lol. I mean I still pretty much act 17/18 ?  Nothing’s changed. Like I’m still studying , working and going out to different places. I pretty much am a living meme and I guess I’m still a bit dumb. My uni environment I’m around I guess is also still very similar to high school in a way (ofcourse it’s also very different) 
which doesn’t bother me at all but is it meant to be that different other than we have more better teachers, flexible classes and study wise. But I’m talking about the environment in general. 

Just last week me and friend heard an odd bird noise, we started making the noise back and then it went back and forth. This went on for 5 mins lol! Later on we paused and were like wtf are we actually immature or are we just thick in the head and retarded! Like there was also this one time not long ago me and my friend literally thought we wanted to start a rap career because of our boyfriends lol. The only difference was we were thinking if we sound half decent and just dressed up all boujie we can be “famous” 
We ended up recording in my boyfriends studio lol. He just laughed and thought it was an adorable phase but surprisingly was encouraging at the same time lol. My friends boyfriend just laughed and face palmed himself lol. 

My boyfriend thinks I’m fine the way I am and said I’m over analysing my self and that to just be my self. He said he finds my phases whether it’s realistic or not adorable and funny. 

When I’m home I relax, Netflix, cry or fan girl over my shows. Vent about random stuff to my boyfriend. Think about my eyebrows and nails half the time. Like is anything else meant to be different ? 

I always thought it wasn’t until 25 or 26-27 when maturity sort of hits but right now i don’t feel different at all !! 

I just wanna be young, maybe start a YouTube channel, I still wanna study more and be a student until I’m 25! I still wanna try new course! 
Tbh I still wanna be a bit dumb, I still hope my friends and I can still be living memes. I still wanna relax and eat my mums food as well as spend time with my family every weekend! I don’t want them to treat me any different when I’m older ! Is this normal ?

I’m “adulting” but I’m scared to be “adulting adulting” if that makes any sense! 

Other than that when I’m at work I’m professional , mature, still a bit of a meme at times I have dumb moments but I manage my self. I study , get good grades ! 
I buy my own stuff, help out, be spontaneous! 

I don’t know if it’s bad I wanna take another course as well after I finish this one ! 
At the Same time I’m conflicted between two things I wanna do in the future 
It’s either beauty or business management! But I also wanna try out a realestate course !!!

I am a 20 yrs old girl.I Just can't seem to like anything. I would like to go to college but I don't like anything and I don't think I can study something I am not interested in. I have tried to study computer engineering but It was too difficult for me (I think I have dyscalculia) and I stopped. Anyway I have chosen it based on the fact that I don't like anything and It would give me good job opportunities+my father could have helped me if I didn't understand some concepts . I can't think of any job I would like to do right now. When I think about a job I tend to Imagine what the environment looks like(Building, fornitures, etc...) and I am afraid that I Will work in an environment that looks squalid to me( I don't think everyone thinks so much about  this when trying to understand if they would like that job, it's weird).I am Also very afraid of studying something that I don't really like+ doesn't pay enough Money for a decent life.
I only have superficial  and swinging interest for a few things(astronomy, for example, but I have never studied It. Mainly because my interest Is not strong enough and because I am not good enough at maths. I Just liked watching documentaries about It while eating my lunch).
I Also have social anxiety and I am very afraid that I Will end up doing jobs that trigger It and I Will look awkward all the time.
I feel like I am waisting my time and that I Will end up without a degree(=no job/ job that I hate and that doesn't pay enough for a dignified Life).
I seem almost convinced to study for a specifical Major sometimes, but then I see that you can't find a(decent) job with It, that the environment looks squallid, that I Will do a job I don't like for the rest of my Life surrounded by collegues Who are passionate about It.
I can't go to a therapist because my parents can't pay for it.
Everyone seems to like something and everyone says that you should study a Major only if you have a passion(which Is even more than an interest).  Then I am doomed to be a roothless I Guess...
I don't hang out  much and I hate the way I look(none has ever asked me out, so I am not the only One to hate the way I look I Guess. I had chosen engineering also because I dreamed of getting a good job to pay for the surgeries I would like to have but I have given up this almost impossible aspiration and now I just want to be independent/ have a dignified existence).
How can I find something I am interested in? Is It possible to have zero interests? Am I depressed?Any personal experience/advice?

I'm really bad at saying no. So much so i will often agree to do things that are impossible if asked by someone. I hate confrontation, And so when my father asked me to help him do some concrete work at my grandpa's house I said I would. Now he's leaving to do it Saturday morning at 8am. 

Unfortunately I just woke up. 4:30 pm. So that means. I would have to either 

A.) Stay up all night. Then work all day the next day (can't say I would be able to do that given my past experiences) 

B.) Go back go sleep and try to force my self to sleep until like 3am or something. After I already slept 10 hours. 

C.) Tell him i can't go. Which I really have a hard time confronting someone after I said I would do something. It sounds obvious to just tell him I can't go but I seriously cant find the courage to do it 

What should I do??

966,"Hey guys, I am a brand-new poster here and just wanted to share my story about what I believe to be my narcissistic mom and need some input. I have a bad habit of writing walls of text, so I apologize for the length of this in advanced, I will summarize as best as I can.

A little backstory: I’m 28 (f) live with my husband 32 (m) and my 63-year-old mom. She is financially dependent upon our living situation after she blew through money from a decent divorce settlement. Throughout my childhood, she never worked, my dad is a successful attorney and made enough money to support his family very nicely.  Mom never worked a day once my older brother was born in 1986. She suffered a mental break when I was 4 years old and was put into a mental institution, she was diagnosed with at least bi-polar disorder and was medicated. She came home and stopped taking the medicine and refused therapy. At the time, she told us kids that dad made her crazy, and it poisoned us against him.

She decided to divorce my dad when I was 20, thinking that she would be awarded a large amount of money and life would be better without him. She told me a few things that made me never really want a relationship with my dad, and I believed her (now I know better). We moved from Oklahoma to Florida to be with her sister, my brother followed us less than a year later. My brother, mom and myself lived in an apartment and made ends meet, it was pretty depressing. I met a guy in 2013 (my eventual husband) and ended up moving to Miami to live with him in 2015 while he worked on yachts, and my brother found another place to live. My mom had a very tough time when I left, she always told me we were best friends and she didn’t know what she was going to do without me. It made me feel a pressing need to move back home and she made me feel guilty that I left. In hindsight, I realize she always treated me like a friend, we never had that parent/child relationship. Husband and I would come to town to visit over the weekend and she would make all these plans that kept us from seeing anybody but her, we thought it was endearing, but we ended up needing to sneak in some weekends to see husband’s mother and my brother/his family. It was tiring and we never got to visit anybody else. 

While I was in Miami, she won a decent amount of money in the divorce settlement but decided she still would not get a job, invest or speak to a financial advisor. I wrongly assumed she would eventually get a job and supplement her money. Since the divorce ended, my dad and I have repaired our relationship, but he is still very much not in the picture. He has his own major faults and seems to have owned up to them.

Husband and I lived in Miami until his mom passed away suddenly in early 2018. We decided it was best to move back home so he could handle his mom’s estate, and it was time for us to get out of Miami. My mom was renting a house and the owner ended up wanting her to move out, so he could move in. We will eventually be buying our own place with the sale of this house, as it’s rather nice and in a very desirable neighborhood. We thought living with mom would work out great in the meantime, and we would save each other some money. 

Early 2019, mom calls me frantically while I’m at work and told me she has overdrawn on her bank account, she is broke and over 70k in debt. We ended up fitting the bill for her for a few months until she could draw social security on my dad. This was a huge financial struggle for us, but she was apparently looking for jobs and I felt sad for her situation. It was around this time that my husband began working from home, and he was able to tell me on a day-to-day basis what my mom was up to… Which was nothing. She had never applied to any jobs, she wasn’t doing anything to try to make any money, she was sitting at home all day, watching TV and napping. I found out that she was securing loans from my 82-year-old grandmother (her mom) who is living on a fixed income. With these loans from grandma, she was buying fancy coffee, cigarettes, nail appointments and still go out to lunch with her friends. Not paying her bills or anything toward rent. All while husband and I are working 45-hour work weeks to float the bills and feed her. I got on her computer and saw that she did not even have a resume, she could not have been applying to jobs. Once my brother typed up a resume for her, she sent it out to a few places. She got a call back from a used car sales lot, and declined the interview because as she said, “I’m better than that”. I saw this all as a way for her to keep living her ‘stay at home, have no job and live off of others’ lifestyle and it really began to sour the relationship VERY fast. I am very non-confrontational, to a fault, and I left the issue once she began paying her portion of rent from the social security that she was able to draw on my dad. 

She developed a rabid fascination with all things metaphysical. I’m not knocking anybody for what they like to spend their time on, but her obsession became unhealthy. She believes she is an oracle, who can speak to spirits and can foresee the future. She thinks she can talk to dolphins, who are vessels to the Lost City of Atlantis. I’m only touching on a few metaphysical subjects here, there are many more. She constantly foretells my dad’s death, upon which she wrongly thinks she would inherit money. She reads horoscopes and thinks that it’s gospel. A horoscope or psychic could say she would have success at her job, so that must mean she would magically get a job she hasn’t applied for. A horoscope or psychic mention she will have a good summer for money? My dad is going to die and all of her financial issues will disappear. It became extremely concerning.

My brother and I would separately sit down to talk with her about her life, and what she plans on doing, we honestly were trying to light a fire under her to get her to start bringing in some money, no matter how much or little. We became concerned with her new obsession and wanted her to get out and make some friends and that she would feel better about herself. We all encouraged her to try to work a job, save money and find a place she can live for when husband and I move out. 

My brother and I began to notice that the invites over to see our Aunt and grandma stopped, and I overheard my mom having a conversation with both my Aunt and grandma about how cruel I was and I put together that she has been twisting conversations we had with her to make it seem like we attacked her. At one point, after mom secured another loan from my grandma, grandma was on speakerphone and told my mom to “not let the kids have any of that money”, implying that mom was loaning US money, when we have taken care of her for months. It dawned on me that my mom had lied to her mom and Aunt about her financial situation and was blaming it on my husband and I to get money from the two of them. This \*really\* hurt me and I will never quite get over it. My mom was talking badly about her children to make herself the victim, now our only living family (other than dad) thought we were using our mom. I rarely see my family anymore when they were a huge part of my support system as a new, young adult, trying to make it in Florida. We sometimes see mom’s family, but we feel like we are outsiders and it’s awkward. Every time I talk to my mom, she makes me feel like shit, like I’m a horrible, cruel person who only wants to hurt her when I really just care about what she’s going to do. Our conversations always end with me feeling like the asshole and she has successfully guilted me into not talking to her about it again or anymore. Constant. Guilt. Trips. 

Fast-forwarding a little more. November 2019, husband and I decide we really want a baby (thank my 2-year-old nephew for this), and by some great luck we got pregnant the same month we made the decision (it’s a boy!). We told my brother and his family because we were babysitting his kids that night, they could tell something was up and we couldn’t hide our excitement. We decided to not tell my mom yet until we had a 2nd and 3rd positive tests, just in case. Mom tends to tell the entire family everything the second it happens and cannot keep a secret. I’d heard horror stories of miscarrying very early after telling loved ones and wanted to avoid that. Once we confirmed we are indeed pregnant, I immediately made plans to tell my mom and have my brother and sister-in-law over so she wouldn’t get jealous that he knew before she did. We told her the news that evening, and she immediately made plans to go over to my Aunt’s house with grandma and said we were not invited. Obviously, she didn’t want me to be able to tell them myself. She rushed to get her makeup on, left nearly 20 minutes after finding out, never told us congratulations, and left the rest of us sitting there, stunned that she was going to go through and tell them. The next morning, she told me how it went and said to the family, “I want you all to congratulate me, because I’m going to be a grandmother again”. My husband was upset on my behalf because she was making our pregnancy all about herself already. I tried to shrug it off, but it stung, you only have your first child once. Husband told her that we may be looking to move out when our lease is up in July 2020, one month before baby is due. My mom gasped and said, “how could you, what about me? Where am I going to live, the ghetto?” We were both taken aback at her comment and stayed quiet. When we didn’t respond to her how she wanted, she began to cry and told me “When you move out, it will be the death of me. You’re my daughter.” This of course made me feel horrible and like I was doing the wrong thing, I talked my husband into staying with her for one more year after July 2020 in hopes that she gets her head on straight.

A few months after this, I try to limit my time around her because she stresses me out, makes me feel like an asshole, and like she deserves a better daughter who will take care of her. One day at work when I was first experiencing vision loss with a migraine (pregnancy things), I called my doctor who told me to immediately go to an eye doctor. Husband was at work (now not working onsite, not at home) and due to unforeseen issues with his car, he had to Uber to work that day. I called my mom crying to see if she would please drive me to the eye doctor, and her response was, “well, I’m not showered and don’t have makeup on, can you see if your husband will do it? Can’t you go tomorrow and have your husband take you?” I told her he would have to Uber to my workplace to get me, and she said with an awkward laugh, “I don’t know the way to the eye doctor…” I was crying so much and so upset, one of my co-workers grabbed the phone hung up on my mom. Husband ended up Ubering to my workplace and he drove me to the eye doctor. Everything was fine with the baby and me, but my mom didn’t even ask about it and it killed me. I just kept thinking about how she was trying to get out of it because she would have been out of her comfort zone.

Fast forward again to COVID-19. I began working from home with my husband, my mom **still** doesn’t have a job after over a year of finding out she is broke, I’m now in my third trimester and my son is treating me very well. While home though, I noticed just exactly how bad my mom’s habits are. Every day this is her routine: Wakes up at about 7:00, she sits outside, chain smokes and drinks coffee while she scrolls Facebook, or shops with money she doesn’t have. She then turns on the news or a TV show and binge watches TV with intermittent breaks to go outside and smoke, or to make coffee for herself. She will binge watch TV until she decides she wants to take a nap, which these naps can happen anywhere between 10:30 am and 5:30 pm. She naps for usually 2.5 to 3 hours. Sometimes she naps twice a day but naps every single day. Then after she wakes up from her naps, she goes outside to chain smoke for another 30 minutes and continues to binge watch whatever show she is on. Husband and I realized a long time ago that she does NOTHING around the house in the way of chores, but actually watching what she does in a day exacerbates the fact that she doesn’t have a job or try to get one. She doesn’t take out trash, she doesn’t do the dishes, she doesn’t clean the litter box for her cats, she doesn’t pick up dog pee from the floor, she won’t check the mail and doesn’t even know what mailbox we have. It’s a huge frustration for husband and I because frankly she is a slob. We have our own trash can and wash our own dishes, so legitimately it is all her chores. I hear her on the phone prophesizing my dad’s death and about how her life will be financially easier and open to her then. 

A couple weeks ago I wanted to sit down and have a talk with her. I am a very calm, even tempered person and wanted to be as passive as possible so she wouldn’t misconstrue anything that happened. I told her that I thought she seemed very depressed, that I’ve witnessed her habits and she doesn’t have the habits of somebody who is happy with themselves. I told her, truthfully, that I am worried about her and what she has in store for her in the future. She began to cry and tell me she was suicidal, that she was depressed, she knew that she was being lazy and taking advantage of everybody. She told me she knew that one day my husband and I would move out and at the rate she is going she will be homeless or be living with my Aunt or grandma. I was shocked when she told me she hears voices at night, it immediately put me on edge. I spoke to her about helping her find a therapist who can help her, told her we would help her with the cost of it. She told me she was going to turn over a new leaf and start trying, that she would stop napping and do more around the house. I even talked her into walking into the grocery store to try to get a job, if even part-time. We had a great, two-hour long conversation and I felt like she was really listening to what was being said and suggested. For the first time since we began living together, I felt like I could breath and like I wasn’t consumed with her future.

The next day, I heard her on the phone, she has my Aunt on speakerphone. She is telling my Aunt that I am a horrible person, that I am cruel and was telling her lies about what we spoke about. My Aunt said, “there’s such controversial energy in that family” and my mom just agreed and blamed my brother and I on our dad. She was saying all these awful things about me, how I’m going to be an awful mom because of how cruel and controlling I am. My mom ended the conversation to go for a nap and that was it. I think I balled my eyes out for 3 hours after this. My mom would rather talk horrible about her children and ruin the relationships they have with their only remaining family aside from our dad, than to own up to her faults. I realized a lot of things that day. My mom had played me the night before, making me think we are on the same page. She likes being taken care of, she likes to lie to her family about her kids so she gets sympathy, she takes zero responsibility for her actions or her life, she blames her kids for all of her issues, she always makes everything about herself. The list goes on, and I truly think that she is suffering from bi-polar disorder (unmedicated), depression, delusion and narcissism. She doesn’t want my husband and I to move out because she is taking advantage of our kindness (and stupidity) so we take care of her financially. I spoke to my dad and he admitted to my brother and I that she was committed to the mental hospital before because of how she was caring for her children, abusive type things like getting drunk and cutting our fingers while trying to trim our nails, locking us in closets. My dad suggested we have her committed to a mental hospital by calling Adult Protective Services. Another option is for us to get out of here after our son is born and leave her to her future and wash our hands of it. I go through the cycle of being sad, angry and disappointed every single day. I don’t think she will ever be capable of caring for herself, but she isn’t outwardly crazy enough (unless you get her talking about how she speaks to dolphins and hears voices at night). I can’t say with certainty that her family would take her in, and I don’t want my mom to be living in her car or on the streets. I don’t know what to do, I feel like I have no help, like she is dangerous to herself, us and especially to my son. She will not seek help. 

I need advice, I don’t know where to turn and I’m nearing the end of my pregnancy. I am considering quietly moving out of here and cutting her off from my life completely. I worry though, that I may hold too much guilt to go through with it. I am so sorry for the long post, I just wanted to provide as much context as possible.

I wanted to do literal gaming reviews. I want to play games on the side and do research, so more research and review focus than gameplay. He wants it to be gameplay focus, playing the game while also talking about the game. Kind of like I want to have pre recorded gameplay in the videos but talk about it, whereas he wants to play while recording and talking.

He wants to do games he loves (Fire Emblem, Pokemon, etc) and makes that our main focus. I want to focus not on specific games, but just games as a whole. Like he wants games he loves to be the only focus, I want to open my horizons to new games and give my thoughts and views on things. 

He wants to do it separately so we can put what we love into focus, but I think it would feel more divided than something we're doing together.

976,"okay so theres a few key points to this story, so i’ll just give backstory first. 

we’re both early 20s, she’s a family friend and i told her a had a crush on her half a year ago, and she politely declined. no problem about that, i didn’t make it awkward afterwards and just act like it never happened and actually lost those feelings, until recently. 

well recently she had a party at her house and she let me sleep over in her room since there were people downstairs and i slept on the ground. i didn’t think anything of it because i had lost my feelings towards her and only saw her as a friend. i woke up the next morning and said goodbye and left. 

she texted me about an hour after i left pretty much showing interest and we flirted a bit and i eventually slept over for 2 days and had sex. 

okay so now there’s the backstory, i feel like all this might be bringing back feelings that i once had for her. but i don’t know if her or i would even want a relationship with each other. 

i think it might be the thought of being in a relationship that calls to me. idk i’m conflicted on this, now i don’t know whether to text her bc she went to visit family for a week and i don’t wanna bother her. 

in a way i feel that i’m just over thinking it, she’s obviously interested but i don’t know if she wants to be more than FWB in the first place. i know simply talking to her would solve all of this but i don’t wanna do it over text and she’s gone for a week. 

also i feel like i’m tricking myself into having feelings for her again, if that makes sense? like i know i used to, and sleeping with her was great but i don’t even think she’s girlfriend material(she’s a good person but maybe not my compatible type for a relationship) 

i pretty much just ranted. please share any thoughts, i’d love to hear a 3rd person perspective in this.",22May2020,1

The stress keeps rising. These kids are crazy, and nothing is Professionally is being done about it. It feels like I'm reliving the same day cause the exact same stuff happens everyday and I'm getting sick of it. Constant cleaning up in the living room. The living is the worst part of the house since its always trashy. God I hate the living room, hence why I'm so quick to grab something out of the kitchen and hurry back in my room.

This been going on for years, discipline is obviously not working and will never work. These children are enabled. We loose a crap ton of food/drinks thanks to them. When 7 year old and 4 year old are together in one area. All hell let's loose. They physically ""abuse"" each other, I talked about this to my mom and she shrugged it off and fussed at me for taking action. Obbiously one day one of them are gonna end up killing the other.

Talked to her about them and that it causes me a immense amount of stressed. Shrugged off and didn't do anything about them. Talked about these problems multiple times and all I get is fussed at and it gotten to the point where I just don't want to leave my room. My blood is boiling with rage as we speak and I'm positive that I'm gonna end up lashing out one day so for the love of god Please some contact CPS or whatever so this family can get the help it needs. I asked for them to get help several times but my mom downplays the situation and ""says it's normal, they're kids"" yea, kids breaking stuff, cursing, making a mess out of the living room everyday, abusing each other, running out of the house into the streets, screaming and whining everyday is normal...right..",22May2020,1
978,"(This is not asking for medical advice). Hello! I’m a 21 year old girl from California, not that it’s super important. I am helping raise my eight-year-old niece after she was abandoned by her mother and I took the role as her guardian at the young age of twelve. My niece and I have been through a lot together, from her mom coming back and deciding she wanted her and exposing her to a drug addict life to the police having to restrain my sister in front of her when my sister was trying to kidnap her. My niece struggles with ADHD and a possible disorder called RAD. 

Her doctor, a very intelligent and kind man, decided it would benefit my niece to put her on ADHD medication because she had been self harming when her anxiety overwhelmed her and her behavior was absolutely out of control. Not just in a way where she wasn’t listening but she physically couldn’t listen. She would get so overwhelmed that she couldn’t learn, she would cry and call herself stupid, she would have meltdowns. I agreed and we’ve had her on medication since. 

The problem is that I feel horrible guilt every single time I give it to her. It eats me up inside because I feel like I’m suppressing her personality. She loses her appetite completely and gets extremely calm but she also is able to listen and learn. A year ago, she couldn’t even read or count but since we started it, she is able to read (not a ton but way more than I could have ever imagined) and she can count, add, and subtract. I feel extremely sad when she tells me she’s not hungry and she just kind of sits there and focuses on one thing for hours. If anyone knows her without her medication, she is constantly wanting to eat and she is super funny and witty. She’s incredibly smart just doesn’t know how to focus on one thing at a time. 

Is it normal for a child to be quiet at eight years old and to not have an appetite? Should I feel guilty about this? If not, how do I cope with the feeling it gives me? Her doctor also wants to start her on melatonin at night. My mom is a nurse and says it’s good for my niece because she will be able to feel more rested and her brain won’t be all over the place. 

I guess I’m just not familiar with her appearing so calm. I just want her to be happy. 


TL;DR: my eight-year-old niece is on ADHD medication to help her with ADHD, panic attacks, self harming, and meltdowns. Should I feel guilty that she loses her appetite for the rest of the day and isn’t as talkative? If not, how do I cope with feeling guilty about this?",22May2020,1

982,"So it was during freshers week last year.

There was a guy who I had matched with on tinder and then unmatched as we didn't click. 

Turns out we were heading to the same uni and living in the same accommodation. 

I bumped into him on a night out and I was being nice to him and I accepted a drink from him. 

After that I don't remember anything at all except waking up next to him with my underwear around my knees and covered in bruises on my face, neck, arms, chest and thighs. 

I asked my flatmates if they remembered anything and they said they saw him  basically carry me out of the club quite early on in the night.

I remember waking up feeling terrible and throwing up which is something I never do and never have done as I'm not a big drinker. 

I saw him around the building recently and the sight of him made me feel sick to my stomach and so uneasy, like my body was trying to tell me something. 

The entirety of it doesn't add up at all but I don't want to start throwing around accusations but it's been playing on my mind alot lately and has been making me feel sick.

985,"I (17F) really wanted to be a history professor for like four years, pretty much all through high school. recently, about halfway through senior year, I took a look at the job market for that field and realized my chances of actually being successfully employed are very low. I asked some people who are currently in that field and they agreed that it is rapidly shrinking and almost no one is getting tenure anymore. so I abandoned that dream and decided to instead pursue law, since it’s a similarly academic field and makes decent money. I was accepted into the College of Arts and Sciences at UVA and I committed to go there.

But recently I’ve realized that, aside from the “prestige,” being a lawyer doesn’t really appeal to me. I want a job where I can choose where I live (I really want to live in the mountains somewhere) and where I can spend a lot of time with my future family, hiking, fishing, camping, etc. But I have no idea what types of jobs fall under that category, especially for someone like me who’s horrible at STEM. I don’t know where to start figuring this out.

I have some time to decide; I’m doing ROTC in college, so after I graduate, I’ll be in the Army for at least four years. But I need to figure out what to major in relatively soon and I have no clue.

I’m interested in majors like English, History, Classics, or maybe Philosophy or Politics, but I have no clue what I would do with a degree like this once out of the Army. Teaching high school has occurred to me, but frankly, dealing with other people’s kids all day doesn’t sound appealing. If I could switch gears and do engineering or something, I would, but a) I’m ass at STEM and b) I’m already accepted into the CAS at UVA and not their engineering school. 

At some point I know I need to just suck it up and pick a career and that lots of people work jobs they don’t like. But I’m frightened of making a choice without my heart behind it and then dreading waking up every day when I’m 40 just because I couldn’t figure things out early on.

TL;DR I need suggestions on careers that allow me to have a decent amount of family time and that also allow me to get a degree in the humanities. I will have military experience, if that makes a difference. thanks in advance",22May2020,1

989,"Sorry in advance for this story being really long. 

My boyfriend (24M) and I (21F) have been together for almost a year. We met at work (we worked at a restaurant) and slowly had feelings for each other. He’s a line cook and I’m a server but I also go to college as well. I was still pretty new to the restaurant and was still learning how the restaurant operated. 

A month after we started dating, he told me that he had an ex (~32F) that also works at the restaurant as well. I was still new so I didn’t know who was who. A week later when I was working, I heard someone call her name and then I knew who she was. In the restaurant, the kitchen is open. Meaning that the guests can see the line cooks as they work. I noticed that whenever I was assigned a section close enough to see the line cooks, she would always stare at me. They were together for about 3 or 4 months about a year before him and I started dating. 

I got really annoyed and told my boyfriend that whenever she saw me, she would always just stare at me. There were times when all three of us worked the closing shifts and my boyfriend would be playing music while he’s cleaning. One time he played Perfect by Ed Sheeran and she out loud said “wow. You must really like this little girl you’re dating. You need to find a woman like me” I heard it and instantly was infuriated. Since we were at work, I just held it in and said nothing. 

Someone then told me that stopped working on weekend nights because she couldn’t stand seeing him and I talk and be near each other. I only worked doubles on weekends so I would usually only see her on Saturday mornings. A while after that, there was a day where I was at school and my boyfriend just clocked in to start working. He was in the back of the restaurant where we keep our bags and belongings changing his shirt. She was on her way out (she just clocked out) and knew he was back there and threw herself on him and tried to make a move. He pushed her away and one of our coworkers who’s his close friend saw. They both asked her why did she do that and some other questions. Her response back was “your girlfriend can’t do shit. She’s just a little girl”. After my class, I decided to swing by the restaurant to pick up my boyfriend. They both told me what happened and I was so pissed where I knew I couldn’t think straight. 

The only thought I had was “why is this woman who is basically 11 years older than me and has 4 kids doing this to me? I’ve done NOTHING to her”

There was also another incident where we were scheduled to work on a Saturday morning shift together. So all 3 of us were working at the same time. He tried to act civil and tried to only stay at his station but since it was really slow, he was talking to other line cooks around him. She was supposed to be at the end station but asked the line cook next to her if they can switch so her and my boyfriend can talk. I tried to keep my cool but it was so hard. The whole time I wanted to just cry in the bathroom because it’s so mentally exhausting having to deal with her and her bullshit. whenever I saw them together, I would see that she was laughing and flirting. I was in the back grabbing drinks for my table and she was grabbing 2 waters and put straws in it. I saw her hand it to my boyfriend and she glared at me with the “I’m a better girlfriend than you are” look. I wanted to punch something so bad just to let out my emotions. I have never felt so awful my entire life. That day truly was the worst work day of my life.

What do I have that she could possibly want?! Like what they HAD was in the past. Get over it. She was the one that fucked up in the relationship. She was married and was still dating around. When my boyfriend found out that she was married, they broke up.

That night when I was closing, my boyfriend asked me if I was okay because I didn’t talk to him as much that day. I told him that I didn’t like how they were talking today. I trust him when he says that he doesn’t have any feelings for her. I explained to him that I just didn’t like how she doesn’t know boundaries and some other things. I ended up running out of the back of the restaurant to cry before I finished my shift because I just felt so shitty the whole entire day. He chased after me and tried to comfort me. I understand that because they work together, he’s trying to act professional but I still don’t like how she acts and feels the need to try and make it seem like they’re an item when they aren’t. 

Random fact; He has my initials, our anniversary date, and my DOB tattooed on him. 

When the virus started to become a bigger problem, the restaurant closed. She kept trying to text him and he would tell me when she would contact him. I got fed up with it so I told him to block her. He did. She then called him from a different number and asked “do you miss me?” To him. Him being confused, he asked who is it and she was like “it’s the love of your life. You really don’t remember my voice?”. He then told her to leave him alone. 

Before the virus, she said some shit and my boyfriend and his friend defended me. I don’t know what she said, but his response for whatever it was, was “my girlfriend now makes me so much happier in ways that you could never. I see myself having a future with her. You just want to use people for your own benefit.” She then told him that she wanted to fight me. Okay? Fight me for what? She is MARRIED and was dating around looking for someone with papers here so she can leave her husband now.

Yesterday, she ordered a pizza to his apartment. The pizza guy called him and said they had a pizza. My boyfriend being confused, said that they probably have the wrong number and address. The pizza guy read out loud the address, phone number, and name for the pizza. This ex had the audacity to put her first name and my boyfriends last name. She then called him asking if he got her surprise. His roommates pretended to have a conversation with me as if I was in the apartment with them. She hung up super quick. They threw away the pizza (waste of food. I know. But she ordered it. So it doesn’t matter). 

He then told me what happened and thoroughly explained to me how they don’t talk and kept swearing up and down to try to reassure me. I believe him because he has never betrayed my trust before. 

I’m fed up with his ex girlfriend doing shit like this and I don’t know what to do. I’ve done nothing to her. I’ve never spoken to her. Nothing. At work when her and I are scheduled the same shifts, I always either keep to myself or talk to other servers. I’ve talked to one of my close friends and they said I should file a harassment report. I honestly don’t know what to do.",22May2020,1

So I 17(f) just found out my mother(38) is hiding cigarettes in my bedroom. I don't smoke those and never will. I think they're absolutely disgusting and I find it hard to be around people who do. I found two packs under my mattress and I just don't even know what to say.

My stepfather(45) doesn't know she smokes. He thinks she quit 10 years ago. I knew she hid cigarettes all over the house. (In her pillows, bras, the kitchen oven mitts, behind bookshelves, and even in pockets of old clothes.) I have no idea how long they have been here and I only found them because I was fixing my bedsheets. How do I even go about this? I cannot have these in my room. I already got into a huge fight with my stepdad after he thought i was smoking weed in our bathroom. (For the record I didn't smoke weed in the bathroom. I've only had one edible in my life at a friend's house and would never bring something to my home.) He claimed it smelled like weed but it really was just an old damp towel that smelled gross in our bathroom. The argument was so bad I almost packed my things and left and he almost put a hole through my door.

What happens if he barges in and ransacks my bedroom and finds these? I don't want to find out. I'm scared to find out. I can't have these here. How can I get this through to my mom so I don't get in major trouble from something that isn't even mine?",22May2020,1

996,"Hi All,

Just after some general advice. 
Bought a house recently on a new estate, all the neighbours are gettin to know each other on a WhatsApp group due to the social distancing so it's set up to help each other out too.

I have a neighbour that lives about 3 doors down and feels it's okay to park her massive range rover in front of my house most nights, she hasn't even asked if it's okay for her to use it? Every house has a drive big enough for 2 cars and because her house faces sideways as it's larger, the driveway space has been sacrificed i guess... not really MY problem!

She's NEVER spoken to me and is not even in the WhatsApp group for me to have her number.. so the fact that she just feels entitled to park where she likes really grates on me. My actual neighbours have a young baby and the couple have a car each, sometimes they have to park on my drive because miss Range Rover has decided to park on theirs! 
Am I being a cow for moaning about this? Or should I just go ahead and tell her how i feel and to find somewhere else?
I guess i'm asking because we're all in lockdown and should be helpin each other out, but should i feel guilty for wantin my OWN drive to be kept clear??",22May2020,1

I also have a small dog, that I don’t let around the husky because I don’t trust it. 

This makes for a really tangled home environment when he is here and I get extra stressed out trying to figure out where the dog is and where my dog is. Also I don’t want to have friends over while the dog is here because I get a short fuse when I’m anxious. It wasn’t so bad when they were casual, but they’ve been pretty serious lately and he’s been over every weekend. They can’t go to his house because he lives in a trailer with no running water, and he can’t leave the dog there because he doesn’t have a fence.

I have expressed my unease at having the dog here previously, and am met with disdain from my roommate and she ignores me and says rude things to me and my dog, seemingly “punishing” us for my anxiety.

Last night we had a great night and drank a little bit, when she said he was coming over for the whole long weekend. In my intoxicated state I just said “oooof” kinda exacerbatedly. He had just been here with the dog on Wednesday. She then got upset about me expressing not wanting the dog there and about how she was going to rent a car and go and stay with her parents for the whole weekend and refused to speak with me or my bf all morning.

I reached out to her to talk about everything and she ignored me. When I finally said my peace, she basically replied that everything was fine and she didn’t need to talk about things “again”. The only time we had previously talked about her bf’s dog being there was to say that I didn’t want to be around it while it was here so let me know when he’s bringing it over.

I really want to talk to her about her expectations of having the dog over, just to be clear that the bf is now coming over to stay every weekend and let her know that it effects me wanting to continue to live there. Is that me being overbearing? Is it unusual to want to y’all about stuff when the situation seems to change?

1027,My husband and I are considering moving to Alaska. He is a mechanical engineer and I am a stay at home mom. We both love wide open spaces and I especially love the ocean. I have had a lot of trauma in my past and so has my husband so I believe that the relative solitude would do us some good.

1028,"I'm sorry if this turns into a bit of a vent but I really don't know what to do... I've been friends with someone for a few months now and it's been a great friendship. But it has so much more load than just being friends. Let's start here: I'm 21M and I've never really had good friends, let alone a best friend or a girlfriend. That abruptly changed when I met this girl. We knew from the start that we liked each other a bit more than normal but we also knew from the start that anything between us was physically impossible for a good while.

Yet we kept talking. And talking more. About deeper topics. More flirting. And that's when she confessed that she had hidden that she's actually currently in a struggling relationship... I felt a little betrayed but I kinda brushed it off because I fully understand her reasons for hiding it. And she confessed it herself feeling bad for it too. Nonetheless, things kept getting more intense between us even though there was now actually 7000+km between us. She vented a lot about her problems to me because I'm apparently a good listener and I helped her through some hard stuff. She did the same for me. But we kept falling in love even though it wasn't possible. We decided to just keep it low for a while.

Some things happened then that I still don't really feel comfortable talking about. Things like venting to me about the sex she just had, and talking about how she feels drained by spending time with her boyfriend. Things like wanting to drunkenly confess her love for me on the day of her anniversary. That was the point we basically said nope, too far. Both of us. It made her feel like a cheater, it made me feel like I had a chance at something I didn't. Even though we said no, we kept talking. A few weeks later it got worse. One week during quarantine I was basically the only person she talked to at all, and she was that to me too. At that point it felt right but it really wasn't. We then decided to stop talking as we did. Less talking, no more late at night, no more topics that are too personal.

For a while it worked. But then my own problems started filling in some gaps. I'm a very dependant person. I'm very scared of abandonment and if I feel like someone is giving me less attention than they used to, I get anxious. If I feel like I'm not their priority anymore, I will feel like they don't want to talk to me at all. And more importantly, also that they don't want *me* to talk to *them*... I get very jealous if someone else gets the attention that I want from someone. I also get jealous of people who are in relationships in general, because it's something I've wanted so badly for so many years.

By now things have changed between her and her boyfriend again. They're on better terms and you can imagine what that means for me. Our friendship is pretty amazing, at its core it's something most people would be jealous of in itself. But god damn if I notice her talking to other people. Especially if ""other people"" is her bf. I know that's wrong and I know that's entirely my own problem. But it's affecting me a lot. And hurting me a lot. 

I don't know what to do now... Lose something that's generally genuinely good, or get rid of it entirely. Part of me screams to just go the easy way and say our final goodbyes. But it's almost unfair. It's like I'm saying fuck off to someone who I'm important to, and who's important to me as well, for the sole reason that I can't handle feelings of over-attachment and jealousy. That would almost be like saying ""hey, if you choose to not bang me I'm not even gonna be your friend."" And because the friendship we have at the core of all this is having such a big positive impact on my life as well, it would even be unfair towards myself... 

Ans then on the other end you have all the objectively toxic things this brings with it. She has pretended to be someone she isn't and emotionally cheated on her boyfriend with me, while I've been possibly manipulating her away from her current relationship through giving her advice and hurting her feelings by ""needing"" her. We'd always deny it being a problem to each other but deep down we know something must be wrong. 

That's... Basically it. I could do with any thoughts on this. I don't really expect a clear-cut piece of advice because that's impossible for some stranger to give, but any ideas are welcome. I'm yet to bring this up with her, the only thing so far I've not felt comfortable talking about. I'll need to have a clearer head to do so though, and I won't be able to get that on my own..",22May2020,2
1029,"A lot of my family thinks that the corona is just the flu, so they think it's safe to meet up with people and even hug them. For mothers day I either had to go with my mom or my dad's mom's house, I did not have a choice to stay home. My mom is making me go to my grandparent's house and I don't seem to have a choice in the matter at the moment. I tried to reason with my mom that the virus is dangerous and has been killing people and that we all should stay inside unless it is essential. But she says that people use scare tactics and that you aren't likely to get it. I told her that it isn't worth the risk and that if you get it, it can be very dangerous. But she only said maybe and that I could go just once a week, which is not helpful. Going once a week to another person's house all through the summer can still seem like a higher risk of getting the virus. But all she said is we can talk about it later and left my room.

1031,"Hello all,

This is a throwaway account. I have a problem with my wages being withheld and wanted to know if I should file a claim. I posted this on r/Legal but it wasn't getting much traction so I'm posting it here.

This is in the state of Maryland.

During the summer of 2018, I worked as an intern (official job title was IT Assistant). I worked Monday-Thursday with a rate of $15/hour for 6 hours each day (24 hours per week). I worked on web development. Although this was an intern/assistant position, there were no other developers, and I had to work on code previously left by another intern. Since I had no progress the first week, my manager stated that I wouldn't get paid for my first week of work and that I might be fired if I didn't start making progress. Fearing that I might lose out on internship experience, I decided to agree with her and worked without pay for a week (to make up for the week I was paid). On my time sheet, I didn't put down the hours I worked for the 4 days to make up for the 4 days I got paid already.

Fast forward approximately 1 year and 11 months later (yesterday), I realize that I had been taken advantage of. I just started a real salaried job now and am given a lot more time to adjust to the work and am given plenty of time to learn. I figured out that the expectations I had during my internship were a bit too high and I should've been payed for the hours I worked (especially since I put so much time and effort outside of work as well to complete my job).

I emailed the company asking if I could be paid, but they are refusing to pay since I had not entered the hours on my time sheet previously during my internship.

My question is: Am I entitled to the pay for the hours I worked even though I didn't enter them on my timesheet?

Thank you all for your help.",22May2020,2
1032,"[English is a second language.]

I find myself awake with a despicable character and a nihilistic world view.

Also I am Bipolar (NOS) and ADHD, I suspect that I might be BPD as well.

I don’t think, I know, there’s no human being in this world that genuinely enjoys my company, I am without a doubt a bore. I am in college now yet people would describe me as immature and childish, and possibly might add, egotistical and insensitive. I didn’t choose to be this way, I could maybe blame nature, but that’s no help, and nurture, too, I had an extremely overprotective father who made all the decisions for me until his death, then, after that, I was lost, I dropped out of school the year following his death, I isolated myself from friends for two years, went on to get my diploma and started college.

Thanks to this pandemic I’ve been on forced introspection, I have been rethinking my life choices, all horrible, truly horrible, like the doings of some lunatic or a man only partially awake; I always from my mid-teens onward had a sense I didn’t belong in this world, even when I most wanted to, I would read stuff from Dostoevsky like: “I swear, gentlemen, that to be too conscious is an illness--a real thorough-going illness,” and would relate to the underground man, and as anyone who has read the Notes from the Underground knows the kind of person Dostoevsky was trying to present to ridicule the socialist projects of his time, in it: the revolting, capricious rationalisation a man does to justify his own miseries and malicious acts to himself, and only to continue to be the same way.

Financially I am blessed, that has been, now I think, instead of a blessing, a curse. I still don’t think I need a job, one to work my way up to more prosperity.

I am incompetent, a man without no talents, even if I tired, I’d only disappointment myself, I won’t and never will achieve what I want to achieve, I will, I have come to think, forever remain stagnant. I really wish I was capable of becoming something I am not, something more virtuous and socially acceptable.

For me now it’s either sublimate or commit suicide.

Am I a creation of this peculiar century? Or has there always been men like me before? 

A very disagreeable loser?

In the words of me shrink, “a dysfunctional individual, whose illnesses in no way would hinder his way to becoming a functioning member of society.” I was disinclined both politically and philosophically, “Function? What function? To be another clog in the capitalist machine to produce shit?” I would say to my mother.
I simply didn’t understand that the whole idea was merely to “live a good life,” in my view, a good life was something beyond my reach, at best I could turn myself into one of those swines, and live a life of mediocrity, that I thoroughly detested. 

I changed my mind and started yearning for a good life, a life of where I’ll perpetually cultivate the virtues and abstain from the sins. I was worried about my ability to function in society, in that effort now I can say I have been fairly successful, unhappily.

I am unhappy. There’s something missing in life but I quite yet do not know what it is. I do not like life actually. Nothing about it pleases me. I can do all the stuff I am expected to do by society half-heartedly. But I’ll live a unhappy life. 

I have no talents or hobbies. I am not very good-looking, I am not intelligent, I am not funny.

How do I not comprise this life to mediocrity and unhappiness? 

How do I embrace the absurd and not look back?

How do I find happiness in the everyday? 

Happiness, of course, is not exactly what I am in the look for, satisfaction maybe, actually, it is a contented life.",22May2020,1

1034," There is one woman who I think I’ve been the closest to ever being in love with. I met her after a mutual friend of ours died. She had moved 40 minutes away and I didn’t have a way of getting to her or her a way of getting to me for the first 3 years of our friendship. She is someone I woke up talking to, fell asleep talking to. She was an angel in my eyes. We would see each other occasionally and it would feel like lightning was surging through my veins. In those moments she was the world, her and her smile. We of course had fights and would stop talking, but comeback days later and be closer than ever. She brought out the best in me and made each other grow a lot. Junior year we began to see each other a lot more since we both had cars, and I felt those feelings getting stronger and I knew I wanted to be with her. I always thought I would be her first kiss, since she never dated or did anything in high school since she switched to online school, hence why I was one of her few friends. I told her all of this last Spring, and she told me she didn’t want to date anybody until later in college. I sucked it up and continues business as usual, planning to make a grand romantic gesture right before we both leave. She didn’t text me for a week until we met up. She told me she had actually been dating a guy for a good part of the summer and they had only broken up because school. I of course still made my romantic gesture and told her how I felt. We embraced and held hands and when I tried to kiss her she rejected me. I swallowed my pride and tried to spend the short time we had that day that would be maybe the last time we would see each other for a while.

When I got home that night laying in bed it was like a glass box had shattered around me. She didn’t want me, she never wanted me, and she would never want me. She lied to spare my feelings. She’s known I’ve had feeling for her for years and that I always want the truth. 

This broke me in a way but I continued into the first few months of college. We still did business as usual talking as much as possible, FaceTiming, venting about our problems, and exchanging college stories. After a while, that pain my heart began to grow. The thought that she was dishonest to me and that the one person in the world that I’ve ever come close to loving, would never love me the same way. 

I began to distance my self overtime. Over Christmas break we did actually meet up closer to her place. We sat outside of Starbucks for an hour and some change talking. Well it was more us asking each other questions and giving short answers back. It was my fault things were so awkward. Seeing her in person, beautiful as ever, it felt like I had been stabbed through the heart and I just felt bitter. My one regret is that I made a passive aggressive comment about her being the personal I was most close to living. Eventually the silence got to heavy and for both our sakes I left. I’m not even sure we hugged goodbye, I kinda ran away. 

Since then, she’s really tried to reach out and try to get back to status quo. She’ll slide up on random things on my snapchat trying to make conversation, and me being cold. I did try to hold a conversation with her on her birthday because I would never miss telling her Happy Birthday. A semi normal conversation like old times was my birthday present to her. 

She’s continued to try and talk and the last time we did and I made an effort was my 19th birthday a few weeks ago. 

It just really hurts to talk to her. Hell everytime we’re back home at the same time her Tinder profile pops up and I feel like I’m getting stabbed repeatedly. The thought of her hurts.

Despite this, I can never truly let her go. We’ve been through a lot together these past 4 and 1/2 years. We agreed that no matter how far we were, if we weren’t talking for a short period or anything like that, we could leave each other and we’d always be there for each other.

Recently I’ve been in a situation with another woman like this but less serious and less emotional baggage. Basically I met a woman that I really hit it off with. We spent 12 hours together on day and cuddled, made out, and several other things bored college students do. Anyways I thought this woman would make a great girlfriend but literally seconds before I was going to officially ask her out, she told me she decided to get serious with some guy she had been seeing for MONTHS and gave a weak apology before asking to be friends. In the heat of the moment said yes. Her whole thing was she thought he was never going to get serious, so she essentially was looking for a back up. I tried her the same way I had been treating my friend. Like my friend, this woman desperately would try and start conversations and be friends. I of course in my infinite pettiness, did the same passive aggressive behaviors and ignored her. After 2 months I realized I was being a dick and sucked it up to be friends. She apologize for not being upfront and I apologized for being a dick. Since then we have been pretty good friends. 

This got me thinking today, she I suck it up and try to be friends with my friend again despite the hurt and the fact that she wasn’t honest with me and that she will never love me the same. I saw how I was hurting the other woman and I feel like I’m hurting my longtime friend the same way. We really aren’t closer to anyone else than we are to each other. 

I’ve been missing her a little extra today because it’s been a bad day and she was my rock and always had something to make feel a little better.

Please any help would be appreciated. I know I’m an immature prick so please don’t pull any punches I want brutal honest. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to help me.",22May2020,1

1036,"I  (25f) was watching a drama series a few hours ago, which revolved around  rich  people but in the background there were ""background actors"" - you  know  the actors playing an instrument or playing a role of a beggar -  when  suddenly I felt really really sad for them. It made me think of  people I  saw when I was in India many years ago. There were people  playing  different musical instruments in a wedding procession, in the  scorching  heat.

1037,"**PLEASE DO NOT SHARE THIS FURTHER (REDDIT OR ELSEWHERE)**

\[For a slight bit of context, I come from an Asian family, so a lot of things that shouldn't really be normal are considered normal here and there isn't much I can realistically do about it, so please reply accordingly\]

I'm 18F and absolutely fed up of my sister (14) who's the most mean, selfish, disgustingly controlling, bratty, narcissistic bit of crap I've ever come across (but then again, I haven't seen many insane people, especially not the kind you hear about on reddit so I might also be blowing things out of proportion).

Her other problematic traits aside, what I'm directly affected by is how she constantly tries to bring me down every single minute she's breathing, and her use of violence when she doesn't get things her way. I think she bullies me as a way to cope with a feeling of living under my shadow. Our parents just tend to be suffocatingly overinvolved when it comes to me, and my sister's achievements etc. kind of always go unnoticed. I mean, it's not like they aren't proud of her or something, but they just aren't too vocal about it. In fact, the few times when they do explicitly appreciate her for something, she makes sure to rub it in my face for so long it gets etched in eternity. The few times when I have actually tried to sort of bring her in the spotlight for my parents, she told me there's no need to be ""great"" by pitying her.

And the mental torment of this situation isn't even the last of it. My sister is a lot more athletic than I am, and is very arrogant about being physically stronger. I have to constantly pretend that nothing she says affects me (which isn't true at all) and when she sees that her verbal abuse isn't breaking me, she resorts to violence, and I'm embarrassed to admit that I'm unable to protect myself against her ""attacks"" (mostly clapperclawing and twisting my fingers/wrist/elbow, and occasionally punches that knock out my glasses). I come from a stereotypically aggressive community, and even in my culture, the use of violence is only justified for self-defence or when used by an elder for disciplining purposes, and that too only until a certain age.

To add to this, my parents do nothing about it except occasionally scolding her and telling her not to hit me. Every now and then, when she tests the last bit of patience they've got, she gets beaten but now we're at a point where that's useless too. There was this one time when our mom was mad at my sister and she hit her with a bathroom wiper. Not a bruise on my sister, but the brand new wiper broke. And things like these reinforce her pride in her physical strength and encourage her to hit me even more.

Sorry for this essay of a post but I just don't know how to deal with this. I know my sister and I know she isn't a hopeless case, and all I want is to get back the nice person I knew her to be.

P.S.: I'm not without fault in this situation either. I'm having severe anger management issues putting up with my sister; any time we fight, I feel like if there was one crime I could commit with zero consequences, it would definitely be murder. Such thoughts are really scary and I don't want to do something (especially something this extreme) in a mad fit of rage that I'll end up regretting, so anger management advice is also greatly appreciated.",22May2020,1

When studying abroad in Italy for four weeks in June 2019, I met this guy and completely fell head over heels for him. We were together every night and got quite intimate. If anything, he was my first love in a short period of time. He made me feel happy and everything in between. We were young and in a new country and it all felt surreal. We said we would keep in contact with each other here and there after but there was no sign of a future relationship. He lives across the country in California. Yet, here I am, almost a year later, still thinking about him everyday. 

The thing is, after studying abroad, we never talked after that.  It was almost as if he ghosted me. How come after almost a year I’m still in this position? How do I get out? I’ve tried everything —meditating, law of attraction, anything you can name, Ive tried. I’m grateful for the present moment but I can’t help but think about the beautiful times we had together. We never ended badly.

I estimated I’ll have made nearly $5000 just during July and August but it’s starting to look like I’m not going to be getting anywhere close because of the unnamed virus.

I don’t qualify for any of those main money assistance programs set up by the government as I didn’t start at the place so I can’t take any unemployment, and I made close to $2000 in the last year so I don’t qualify for anything else.

i'm kind of shook and don't know what to do - belgium 

both of us were sitting in the living room, at our computers which are very close together. my computer has a mechanical keyboard and he does not appreciate at all the fact that the keyboard makes lots of noise when typing. He suddenly starts banging on the table which surprised me, and I let out a couple of swear words. He then says I'm a little brat for saying swear words. I won't go into too much detail but I start calling him out on acts he's done in the past (i.e. push my mother against a door). The argument ended when I called out on the fact he can't use a printer (he is not tech-savvy) at which point he pins me down on my chair and demands I say apologies to him.

1049,"Recently, I have grown more conscious about how little time there is in life and it affects how I do things. Most days, I feel guilty since I wasted the previous day or am wasting the current day away on unproductive stuff such as video games or watching television. I watch each day pass and just feel even worse as it does since I know I haven't grown or gained any new skill or outlook. This has started to affect stuff more often and I need something to help me gain a new outlook. Yesterday, I spent hours on a video game with someone (over a couple days) only to find the end result to be unsatisfying and it has intensified this feeling that I have wasted time. I just really want to forget that time is passing and just be more focused on the moment itself. I guess the reason I might be in this frame of mind is since I spent the previous month doing productive stuff like reading books, learning new things and skills while I have slacked off a lot this month.",22May2020,3
1050,"Hello!

This is an interesting question, as I feel a bit guilty for feeling hurt by this. I have a friend who is there for me when I am going through something (which is important to me) but he disappears during our every day lives. He doesn't respond to text messages or social media and doesn't reach out to hang. And yet he considers us close friends. I'm confused because I feel like in our friendship I can talk about deep stuff with him, but when its time to just do things that are lighthearted and fun, he suddenly pulls away. I want to talk to him about it, but I feel guilty because he's helped through hard times.  There's this weird feeling of betrayal, I opened myself up to him when he said he was willing to listen, and then he closed himself off. I've confirmed with him that he is not upset with me, but I talked to one of my friends and learned that this is a pattern with him in friendships and relationships. Is there something I can do to help him?

Other context: he seems to avoid talking about his emotions.",22May2020,1

Or wait until he gets back around dinner time and tell him literally as he comes through the door cuz he will be looking for the cat.

I'm literally writing while crying. I cannot take it anymore. PLEASE HELP ME THINK STRAIGHT.

My father has been diabetic for years but refuses to take the meds that I buy for him. He spits pills, throws them under his bed, soaks them in water, etc. He claims pills hurt his stomach. As a result of his self-negligence, he now has a serious diabetic foot, and his foot might get amputated if he doesn't go into some type of surgery.

Few months ago he applied for a bank loan of more than $ 23K, he withdrew them on the same day (according to bank statements); however, he doesn't want to pay for his surgery! I don't know where his money is, but I know he has money!

He doesn't ask me to pay, but, at the same time, he doesn't want to pay. Additionally, he hasn't been providing for my siblings for since October. I have been buying food and stuff. I've been spending almost $1K monthly for home expenses).

1062,"My mother is 60 and gradually lost all her money, her home, her family and friends. She is all alone in a foreign country renting a room in cheap housing. She has already overstayed her visa for few years, and cannot even leave or regularize her legal situation. I have not seen her in 3 years and my sister in 10 years. Every time I speak to her, she tells me she will kill herself, as she has nothing to live for. She always says that she will die and they will throw her body in a ditch because nobody will claim it…

Idk why I’m writing this but I do not know what to do, I feel I’m so close to losing her. My very first boyfriend killed himself and it was one of the most horrible painful experiences I went through. Having somebody so close to you and suddenly not there anymore. I do not know what to do to save my mother and I cannot go through this again. I'm F mid- 20's and have been battling depression for years. 

What led to this summarised : *(TL;DR below)*

&gt;When I was a kid, my mother had a very successful business and we had a sweet comfortable life. Both parents with good jobs, a large home with regular family gatherings, friends, parties, travels and everything that make up a nice lifestyle. Unfortunately, after my parents got divorced, her life changed completely. Her entourage started avoiding her, and my mother felt very humiliated as even her closest friends, siblings and family disappeared.  
&gt;  
&gt;My father had an executive job, so a lot of their entourage were people that cared a lot about their reputation and who they mix with. Her family stopped calling her (I don’t understand why ?) …. Not very long after, my father remarried within the same year and cut all ties with us and we never received any financial help from him.  
&gt;  
&gt;Due to this alienation, she decided to move abroad and sell all she had. Along with my sister, both of us still kids, we moved to Europe where we bought a home, a car, and a business. Life seemed to be doing relatively well, all three of us, however her business took a very bad turn during the recession, and little by little we lost all our money, house, car, business etc….  
&gt;  
&gt;After my mother lost her business, her residence status could not be renewed and we had to leave the country. She attempted few jobs but nothing worked out and it was very difficult for her to find any opportunities because of her age (50's). My sister was lucky and got a full-ride scholarship, and I managed with a lot of difficulty to sort out my life while working/studying. Losing everything had a tremendous impact on my mental health, but I worked hard to overcome this. I worked very hard to pay for university but had to drop out to start working. I landed a good job in a large company but was severely underpaid (min. wage) and after persevering for few years to build my experience I decided to leave it and finish my education now.  
&gt;  
&gt;When my mother had nothing left, she returned to her country, but nobody wanted to talk to her as they were ‘embarrassed’ of her situation… she did not have a single $ and was staying at her mother’s house at the age of 55. After few months, her siblings literally threw her to the street so my sister bought her a ticket and she found refuge in Turkey, a country that is safe and with very low cost of living. My sister hereinafter started sending her money every month so she can pay for her room rent and living costs. I also helped when I could.  
&gt;  
&gt;This has been going for few years now and my mother has literally given up on life. She spends all her time in her room as she sees no way out.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am currently not even working, so have no income and I am staying with my boyfriend’s family as I have nowhere to go and no money. This puts me in a very difficult position as I do not know how to help her, and do not even have the funds to attempt anything.  
&gt;  
&gt;This entire situation makes it very hard for me to find the strength and energy to study properly, as given my mental health past my depression takes over me.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is very hard to have had it all and lost everything, and live your life with regret. The worst part is seeing your family, who you were very close with stop answering your calls and ignoring you completely. It is so bad that when my grandmother passed away nobody informed her (not even an email or fb message), nobody from her family or even family friends, and she only found out few months later.

**TL;DR** : ***Riches-to-Rags story***.

&gt;After parents got divorced, my mother was rejected and alienated by her entourage and her family. She moved abroad due to the humiliation and we started a new life. Few years later, due to the recession, she lost her business, her home, car and any asset she had. When she went back to her home country at 55 to stay with her mother her family literally kicked her out and therefore had no choice but leave the country. She is now in Turkey where she has overstayed her visa for few years, she is staying in shared flat and my sister is sending her money every month to cover her rent and food. My mother sees no way out and says she lost everything and wants to end her life.

&amp;#x200B;

The most painful part about my *riches-to-rags* experience is definitely not the money. The worst is being rejected by extended family and losing ourselves as a family. ",22May2020,1
1063,"this might be a long one but i feel like context is necessary.

my boyfriend is 15 and he’s in a bit of a pickle with trying to escape his mom. she’s verbally and mentally abusive to him and his brothers but he gets the worst of it since he’s the oldest. she’s controlling of everything he does and constantly belittles him. she messes with him constantly and does things jus to have a reason to yell at him. it messes with his mental health and i believe might partially be the cause of his depression. two days ago she had been messing with him all day (not in a playful way) but jus doing things to frustrate him. usually when she does something he’ll text me and vent about it jus to let some steam off. she made a mess in their kitchen then blamed it on him, purposely waited for him to finish doing dishes to put in all her dishes, jus a bunch of little things like that along with some smart remarks. they would always be along the lines of “you make me wish i didn’t have kids” “life would be easier with all girls” “you’re the worst of all of them” “you won’t grow up to be anything” “you’ll be just like you’re father”. he felt like he had enough when she kicked the broom while he was sweeping. he yelled “MOM!” and she took it as disrespect and took all his technology from him. without his technology he has no way to “escape” her. she won’t let him leave the house and won’t let his friends come to him. she jus wants him to clean all day and do anything little thing she says. 

he said he’s trying to find a way to go to his friends house but without facing any legal issues. he said he jus wants to stay there for about a week or so to escape her for some time. with the whole global pandemic he’s having to listen to her all day and night. any advice on how he should go about this? or if he should at all? i’ve tried google &amp; asking my parents, reddit has come to be my last resort.

1067,"So my best friends son asked me to cut his hair  at the start of this this week and I got sent a pic of what he wanted. I said yes, without being given a specific time line of when he wanted this hair cut. I was messaging her this evening and mentioned his request and said I am comfortable to do the hair cut in the garden as I was given the impression that they were strictly following the social distancing throughout the lockdown and restrictions have started to be eased. 
She said through messages that she is happy with this and that it needed to be done before Monday as he has a job interview. However the next few messages showed that they are not following the social distancing properly at all.

She is an essential worker, her son (who’s hair I’m supposed to be cutting) is at a house party tonight, he is being picked up by her friend (who is also an essential worker) and he is going to stay at her house tonight. Her partner is currently at his friends house drinking (no idea how many people are there), her step child is living at her house at the moment and I don’t know if he’s being going regularly between house holds and her toddler is attending nursery while she goes to work. So add all those people in just one household and they  have been in contact in one way or another with hundreds of peopleJust in the last few days. 

She  told me her son needs the hair cut before Monday as he has a job interview but she told me this after I knew that the isolation/distancing has been a lot more slack in her household than in mine  and this makes me  uncomfortable.

1074,"This is a throwaway account.

So, Lately I've been stressed and filled with anxiety. I'm(18f) about to graduate from Highschool and this quarantine has been nothing but stressful and making it hard to focus on school work. I have nights where I have a weight on my chest from the stress. Now to the story.

A girl I know(Shes 19 and is in the military) online has been a great friend to me. We are in a chat with other friends and stuff so I get to talk with them a lot. But I started feeling really left out and ignored and this was when the quarantine started. I began getting stressed from school and afraid i won't be able to graduate on time. I get irritable more and I start getting snippy when I'm stressed and tired since i haven't been able to sleep well at all. Well because of this I have ended on being snippy on occasions when I'm venting in our vent chat and I'm just a mess. I know I shouldn't be snippy or rude to my friends when I'm like this. But I wasn't thinking. I do tell them a lot that when I sound snippy just tell me, I'll apologize since I shouldn't be like that. 

But the girl, I'll call her Tri, wasn't talking to me a whole lot and actually started distancing herself from me. I didn't notice because Tri wouldn't tell me or when I do come into the chat to hang out I start getting a bit ignored. I have bad problems with being ignored since it reminds me of when I was in seventh grade.(My class hated me and intentionally ignored me, I got bullied a lot to.) I started getting upset and my attitude comes out more. I started crying in the middle of the night as well. I eventually left the chats that had her in it with my friends encouraging me to do so. After a few days I went to text Tri to see how she was doing and founded out she unfriended me, I couldn't get ahold of her. i felt so betrayed and I cried so hard, I couldn't understand why she unfriended me at the time. She must have hated me. I have told them about my middle school past, everyone hated me and I was an outcast, it was a rough time and was heavily depressed.

I began to think about how she will tell our other friends how i am a horrible person and turn everyone away from me. I was afraid. The next day I texted a mutual friend to see why I was unfriended. It was because of my attitude and how snippy I have been. I will admit again, I shouldn't have been snippy. I was really irritable but that doesn't excuse my snippiness. My stress shouldn't excuse it either. But she didn't try to talk to me about it and instead turned to distancing herself from me. I talked to my mom and she said we were both in the wrong, I shouldn't have been snippy and she shouldn't have unfriended me and not talk to me about it. I talked to friends and my sisters about mending the relationship and a lot have said i shouldn't even try, it wasn't worth it. My sisters didn't really liked Tri but they left me be because they cared about me. I get that Tri is also going through a hard time and because of my snippiness it must have made her feel bad. But I just wished she talked to me. I felt like my trust in her was shattered and I'm afraid to mend this relationship cause I don't want to get hurt, I don't want to cry myself to sleep over it. I said this before and will say this again. I was a bit of a asshole towards Tri, I shouldn't have been snippy. But I really just wished she would have talked to me.

My mom suggested I post on here so here I am. Please give me advice, should I try to mend this? Or should I just let it go and move on. Will it be worth it trying to mend this relationship? Am I bad person for being afraid to try and mend this relationship? i just want to at least apologize to her but. I can't get ahold of her. Please, give me some advice...",22May2020,1
1075,"I have one sister from a similar age, and we both are extremely insecure and barely functioning adults. We excelled academically, but simply seem unable to deal with complexity of real life, jobs and relationships. My sister is diagnosed with depression, I don't have any diagnosis because I never kept therapy long enough.  I'm bringing this up because I start feeling there is common factor in our problems: my mother. 

I never saw my parents as abusive as they always supported my decisions later in life – when I wanted to change my degree in the University, they fully supported me and they were always very nice giving me enough money to live so I didn't need to work and study. I've seen a lot of people with unsupportive parents and struggling to keep up at University, and I lived in a comfortable home, had always money to cover my bills, so I really never thought I was being abused. 

The thing is... as time goes on, I start to feel that my feeling of inadequacy may have some roots related to my parents. At first, I understood the relationship with my father – he always seemed to favor my sister, and I remember once I was like 12 years old and he called me selfish while I was crying when he and my mother were fighting because he cheated her and somehow I always felt distant from him. 

I still somehow always felt like my mom was a good mom. 

However, in past years I started to dig deep in my relationship with my mother and remember and pay attention to some stuff that raise me concern. I'll list some of them:

1) Growing up, I never had any sense of private space. I never closed my room door. I don't remember if it was a rule, or just an habit. If I was at the laptop, and my mother would randomly show up I think it's a normal reaction to get scared and she always would make a drama about it, how it was a sign I was doing something wrong – in fact, I was just distracted and got surprised by someone behind me. This lack of personal space happens until today, even if I don't live with them anymore. If I'm visiting her, or the contrary, she will simply walk in my room whenever she seems fit – even when I'm naked while changing, and more than once she will comment on my body. And even although is not an spoken rule, I always feel like closing my door is wrong. 

2) When she and my father had issues, she would always bring it up to me and my sister. The impression I got, is that she kind of blackmailed my father with exposing him to us – even if it meant traumatizing us. She would go very wild on those fights, in a sort of weird sexual way. Like I remember once I was a kid, she dressed slutty and got drunk and went out to an street party because she had an argument with my father, and then she returned and yelled about all the nasty things she did. I was like 11-12. 

3) Several times, during my teen years, she would make treats of suicide if she had a discussion with me or my sister, or my father. She would show us how she would set up for hang herself, or say she was going to jump the window. Later, she would talk about suicide in a more subtle way – saying she was only waiting us for succeed in life so she could have her 'final rest'. 

4) She keeps asking me about my ex-boyfriend, even though we broke up 4 years ago, and while we still kept good contact I just think this is uncomfortable? She wasn't close to him or anything, they actually never met IRL, she only knows him from Facebook. I have a boyfriend now. She does the same about my sister's ex-boyfriend. 

5) When I was in school, I used to be somehow an hostile person, and I got in trouble a few times for that – she would always make a scene at school defending me, to then get home and be against me sometimes even beating me. School asked several times that I needed to see a psychologist, she used to take a belt and tell me this was the kind of psychologist I needed and spank me. 

6) Later in life, I end up finally going to a psychologist. I was 19 at the time, still living with her. She would all time ask what my psychologist was saying, and I said vague answers and she would criticize the psychologist. Some days, she would just make plans to disturb me going to the therapy – like inviting me to do something nice in the day, and saying I should reschedule it or just saying she would take me there by car and saying on time that she couldn't anymore and then I would have no way to get in time by public transit. I don't know exactly why, but I end up quitting it after 3 months – I won't blame my mom entirely on it, because I somehow feel I have an issue keeping things for long, but she definitely didn't supported me on doing therapy. She also keeps asking and commenting about my sister's psychologist. 

7) She always was a very negative person about everyone. She talked badly about all our relatives, ranging from having a conflict with them or plain saying they were ugly. She would often use them as negative examples, like you shouldn't eat that much because you don't want to end up as ugly as one of my cousins. She would sometimes talk badly about my friends as well, but it was more subtle... but I somehow feel every time I got a group, she would 'push me back'. During University, I had to spent my whole summer in the farm they live and basically couldn't keep much contact with friends, and had to quit my internships. If I didn't, she would just be complaining about it everyday, saying how  much she missed me and just talking about it non-stop. It definitely interfere in my ability of having a good job + friends. 

8) She spoke openly about how she wanted me and my sister going out more, we were both very homey people, but somehow I never felt comfortable to going out? I think one of the reasons of it was that she needed to know everything when we went out, and if there was some spontaneous change (it could be something as simple as deciding to get a different bus to go back home) during the time, it would be a huge drama. She also would obsessed that I used drugs – I didn't even drunk. She would go through my stuff, and once she even found a bleaching powder and accusing me of it being cocaine, then got mad that I was bleaching my arm hair and didn't told her about because I could get hurt or something – I was 18 at this time. 

9) I have a huge interest in cooking, specially baking. I'm not a pro, but I'm confident I'm decent enough and I have many friends and colleagues who are very supportive of my cooking and love to eat my food. She won't speak against it, but every time I cook something to her, I never make it the way she wanted it to be – she often uses demeaning words to describe it like saying the kind of bread I make is hard and dry, and sometimes picking lower quality food to eat instead (for example, eating a stale commercial bread instead of fresh bread I made everyone is eating). It can be only her taste, but it makes me a little sad she don't seem to enjoy what I do while everyone else seems so. 

There is more but I don't know – I just feel extremely insecure, I don't think they ever were strict parents, but somehow I felt they never needed to be because both me and my sister wouldn't do anything at all. Those physical punishments weren't a recurrent thing, it was like 3 times a year or something like that, they weren't like a daily life reality. And I think all this negative influence is rather subtle, specially later in life... so I just wonder if maybe it isn't just my personality and I am projecting it? 

I feel lost about it. I don't know how to categorize the relationship I have with my mom, and I don't even know where to start looking for help to untangle it. I'm just hoping if someone may have a piece of advice on how to understand all this, how to get over, how to be a normal adult? 

TL;DR: I'm not sure if my mom was abusive, but I think yes. How to deal with that now?",22May2020,1
1076,"My other friend (Joyce) recently had a fight with her family when we were calling each other. They were all screaming at each other for 10 minutes before Joyce left the call. When Joyce joined back my friend (May) kept asking what was happening and prying into the situation even though Joyce was obviously uncomfortable talking about it. I told her to stop asking May about it because it's rude to ask about it when she doesn't want to tell you about it. May just said that it was entertaining to watch her fight with her family and that she wanted to know more. I managed to convince May to not ask about Joyce's situation but she still doesn't understand why I told her to not pry and keeps pressing for an explanation on why it's rude.

 I don't know how to explain to her that it's rude but I said that it was Joyce's personal problem and she shouldn't ask about it. She still doesn't understand why it's rude and I still don't know how else to explain it. Help??",22May2020,1

1078,"I am a 17 year old male in New York, US. Because of corona, I am out of school and my parents have taken me up to our camp in the Adirondacks (mountainous area in NY).

 The camp is a medium-sized cabin that is a 1-story with 3 bedrooms that are pretty small and cramped and has two bathrooms. It does have WiFi, but very bad cellular service.

 I used to be a very outdoor-sy kid when I was younger and liked to go fishing. This changed about a couple of years ago when I got more into electronics (as in soldering and programming) and online gaming (mostly because of my friends from school). Ever since we came up here I have been battling my parents over how I stay inside the house instead of going outside and fishing. It isn't that I don't like fishing anymore, it's just now I have other interests that I value more than fishing, along with the fact that I have tons of schoolwork due to online learning and me sleeping in.

 I also am pretty active due to me working out every other day, even though it has been hard to adapt my workout to being at my camp as suppose to my regular home. Therefore it isn't the issue of my being out of shape.

 The other reason I need to be on my computer inside is because of how my friends use discord to communicate in this time, meaning that if I want to speak with them or do something, I use discord and that often times leads to servers being set up and lots of fun. Anyways, my point is I'm not being anti-social.

So, how do I tell them or explain to them why I don't want to go fishing/spend time with them outside?

1079,"Basically, I live at home with my mum, and I get absolutely no financial support from her at all.  

I have to pay for all of my food, all of my cosmetics (like shampoo, toothpaste etc) £45 a week rent, money on the gas, electric and water bill every month, and other small things like money towards the internet, petrol money for lifts etc. I also have piano lessons every week which is completely funded by me, including travel. 

She tells me that I am an adult and I am “paying my way” (I’m 21) but I feel like she is really hindering my future because she makes me spend so much of my money just living at home. I can’t save anything and it makes me feel trapped and really un motivated. I don’t have much of a social life but if I did then I wouldn’t even be able to go out and enjoy myself because i just can’t afford it. I feel like she is stealing my youth from me and that she is putting way to much of her own financial burden on to me. 

I respect that I am an adult and I have no problem with paying towards the rent and stuff but I feel like she’s really not giving me chance in life by being this extreme. 

I should add that my mum does not have a lot of money, but I know she has enough to pay for the rent and stuff and feel like she’s making me pay more so it makes her life easier, but doesn’t think about how it could affect me in return. 

I was wondering if this is common or somewhat normal for people to do while living at home my age? Can anyone else relate, and if so what did you do to help your situation? 

I suppose I’m just a little scared and looking for some help because the more I analyse it the more fucked my head feels... I really appreciate anyone’s opinion and just general advice... thanks in advance. 😊",22May2020,1
1080,"I recently got accepted for grad school to get my MBA. The president of the company had written down a letter of recommendation for me and stated ""we should talk soon about the company helping you with the cost."" And the president asked how much it was and I told him it was between 30 grand. 

I know two other co-workers who are currently getting their masters as well and I know for a fact that the company is paying for most of their tuition which is around 20 grand ( their program is cheaper). 

After a few days, the president comes back and follows up with me and offers me 5 grand to help pay for my education. I'm trying to be thankful because something is better than nothing. But I can't help but feel upset because I know the company offered more money to my other co-workers. I don't understand why I was offered less. And the president doesn't know I know that he offered more to the other two and I can't say anything because it's confidential. I'm a good employee and I really feel like I at least deserved more than 5 grand. I wasn't expecting all of it to be paid. But I feel like shit knowing that my co-workers are getting pretty much all of their tuition paid. And i really hate to say this...but the only difference between those employees and myself is that they're white and I'm a latina. I really hope that has nothing to do with it. Because I'm busting my ass off at work every single day too. 

With that said, how should I cope with this at work? I'm so upset that I have to keep this information to myself and still go to work and perform well knowing the company is being unfair. I wish it was easy finding a job right now but this situation with covid-19 is going to make it difficult to find a job.

1085,"So i got in a fight with my  dad \[18F\], which really was just him saying his piece, me nodding and then heading off in anger. Just gonna copy-paste what happenned. \[Trigger warning-mentions of suicide\]

*"" This academic year I had a very, very severe re-lapse. I was stuck again, and then I just started uni adding more fuel to the fire. Straightforward- I was a mess- I failed my exams (hopefully doing re-takes this year).*

*But dammit during that time I tried my best. I was so severely suicidal that it took everything it had in me to just not do it. All my mental energy was spent trying to rebut the want to die and the hate I felt for myself for doing nothing. And I spent ages getting through the difficulty of trying to get a therapist. I with great damn difficulty managed to get out to see my friends towards the later months, but I didn't WANT to. I just had to do it to get better.*

*And today. Damn. For pre-face I live with my parents whom do not believe in mental illness. My mother found 2 suicide notes of mine but believed it was \*le edgy phase(\*Which is also partly because I tried very very hard to convince her into thinking so ngl on reflection). As such I made the concious decision to wait till I was 18 to get mental health help.*

*Today my dad said to my face that I ignored his advice- he said I should spend at least a Sunday with family and that if I can't manage that I shouldn't even bother with a joint honours degree. It's too much for me. He said I clearly cared more about uni and my friends than family*

*And while I feel a certain degree of hate towards myself- I think part of the journey has been learning to allow my anger to be outward instead of inward.*

*So, I'm fucking pissed. The genuine AUDACITY to think that an 18 year old will have their work-life approach completely balanced when they just started uni. The AUDACITY to think that I was completely ignoring his advice on purpose. The AUDACITY to think I HAVE to take that advice.*

*But most of all, the audacity to think that I do not care about my family, when on my darkest days, on the days where I was staring at myself in the water I was going to drown myself, I thought of them. I thought of how selfish it would be to pass my pain onto all 5 of them. Not my friends, not my uni, them. He may not know this, but the fucking audacity to even assume you don't love your family truly astounds me.*

*He is coming from a good place, I know he is because he loves me. But this was a very very shitty way to approach it. He may have missed me because I was definetely not emotionally present, but THIS? This was not it chief.""*

&amp;#x200B;

So fast-forward to later today where he doubled down on the fact that I must spend Sundays with family. Firstly I have been out 3 times the past year (May-May) beyond 8pm, not on Sundays, by my nature. I'm an introvert, I don't like going out tbh, but I have to do it to help my mental illness. Next I am AT HOME. I was not allowed to move out, which is fine, I have come to terms with that. And finally, I'm not even completely adverse to the idea. Because I did it anyway before the shit storm hit. The fact is though, realistically I am doing a joint honours degree (it's basically 2 degrees) and one of those is law. A lot of the time, I am going to be working on Sunday. A lot of the time, I am going to be dealing with my own mental issues. It's a lovely idea, but the fact it's being forced on me really does not help-especially the way it was put across.

Thing is though, I do not know how to put across my side, without putting across all of my side. Because my parents don't believe in mental illness, nor have I told them anything since I was diagnosed and re-lapsed/also went to therapy, I do not want to tell them. I am not stable enough to hear again that everything I went through was not because of an illness and all the other shit I got for it initially.

I still want to firmly put across my side though. I don't know how to do this when the main crux was that I do not care about my family, and I was angry because I care so much for them that they are the only reason I want to keep getting better. It pissed me off to no end to be told that I don't love them But I don't know how to get that across without it turning into a whole other thing.

1088,"I have been wondering about being in relationships with guys and honestly it would feel so good to be with a guy. This is just my opinion but I'd feel way more secure with a guy and less akward and in general feel more warmth from them. I think since I'm a guy it's easier to share emotions and truly care about them. This is just me though, you ladies are fine.  I've been in no gay relationship, but plenty straight. Only once have I been comfortable with making contact with the other in any way, and I just don't know. The reason I'm worried isn't because of being bullied or being insecure, but for two things. One, I'm worried I won't find anyone to love, and two, my dad. My family couldnt care less if I was gay, just accept it and move on. But my dad, he's done so much for me, he's great, and kind. But there's one major flaw. He doesn't really agree with gays, and I'd hate to break his heart.
