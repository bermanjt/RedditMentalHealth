0,"Hey all!

This isn't particularly serious advice, but I would very much appreciate the thoughts of others.

I personally am not a fan of Christmas traditions (bah humbug indeed!) - I am areligious and observe Christmas due to the national holiday here in the UK and to gratify my family, most of whom put a lot of effort into Christmas.

Don't get me wrong, I will happily partake in the festivities and be a 'good sport' for the entire holiday, I love spending the time with my friends and family, eating good food and a catch-up with everyone (although I have no idea how that is going to happen logistically this year!) but I personally have an extreme dislike for the nature of the holiday - as time goes on it has become more of a holiday of mass consumerism.

I don't particularly enjoy giving gifts and receiving gifts in this context, and I have reached a place in my life now where I have no desire for more material goods - I feel as though the money of family can be put to better use, as I am comfortably self sufficient and I can't help but feel guilty looking at the material possessions I have amassed over the years that I haven't used, or could have been put to better use by someone else. I'm in the process of selling and donating the majority of such things at the moment. In a similar vein, I find Christmas shopping for others very difficult, as I try to get people things I think that will be of use for them, that they will also like, which is always harder than it sounds...

I would happily have all of my presents be donations to charities (or to have no gifts at all!), and I would happily donate to the recipients desired charity for all of the gifts I give. The problem is, I don't want to come across as egotistic or ungrateful, or disrespect the holiday and upset people unnecessarily. Most of my family revel in everyone having things to open on Christmas day - every year I end up with a variety of trinkets, which whilst I am very grateful and thankful for, typically serve little to no supplementary purpose in my life. I can only hold onto so many things for sentimental reasons! I am much more fond of and attached to gifts that people have made for me or spent time on, such as crafts, art or a beautifully worded card, as these aren't mass produced pieces of technology or plastic, but are truly special and individual. I would also love to give these kinds of gifts to all of my family (although I'm not a particularly skilled craftsman), but I don't think that they would appreciate them, and again would likely come across as either cheap or ungrateful.

Anyway - my family typically ask me for a Christmas list at this time of year, as by way of tradition they like me to have things to unwrap, along with everyone else, but I only really would like things I can genuinely make practical use of. I'm sure my family would oblige and donate to a charity of my choosing in lieu of a gift, but my mother in particular will want me to have things to open with my brother and niece, as we live in different parts of the country and Christmas is one of the only times of the year we all get to see each other.

A lot of people will likely suggest things such as clothing and accessories, but I'm also a little overwhelmed by the size of my current wardrobe, and I don't feel as though there are many things in my life that it would be good to get 'a better version of', as I am perfectly content with the things I currently own.

Open to any and all thoughts and suggestions!",12Nov2020,1
1,"Hey all. I have an older car that is mechanically good. I’ve kept up with regular maintenance and have replaced a good chunk of parts to keep it running. This includes, new struts all around, timing belt, water pump, distributor, thermostat, and alternator. 

I’m moving closer to my job and no longer need a gas saving car (I also have a truck). As a result I’m selling my commuter car to make some money for the move. I’ve already put the car ad up and have received a lot of offers for the car since I put it up at a competitive price. Ideally, I want to get rid of it next month. 

Here’s the issue: the car has always had an oil leak. Within the last month it has gotten to the point that it leaks over night. I have to fill up a quart probably every 2 weeks (800 miles of commuting). 

Anyways should I fix this car before selling it or selling it as is? Another option would be to junk it, since Im selling it very cheap ($1000) and I got quoted $500 at a junkyard.",12Nov2020,1
2,"Hello reddit,

Any advice is appreciated, and advice from adults is even better.

I'm 17, I live in a good community, have great grades, have hard working parents, and have really anything anyone can ask for. I go to a school where every year about two thirds of the graduating class of around 300 kids go to a top 20 university (of these kids, the average GPA is 4.0 and average SAT is 1540). I think I also have this potential but the thing is I never worked hard enough during high school to the point where I feel happy with myself.

I'm a senior with a 3.8 GPA and 1510 SAT, but if I did all my homework during the first three years of high school and actually studied for my SAT I could be at 4.1 GPA with a 1570 SAT. My parents worked their whole life to give me the resources I need to achieve but I feel like I'm failing them and myself. The point is that I've always procrastinated and I'm afraid that I'll just regret everything.

On top of feeling terrible at myself for not achieving all that I could've, I feel that there isn't much to look forward to. I'll either get into a good school and drown in work or I wont get into a good school and feel sad for not doing so. I sit down to work every afternoon but I never get anything done. I've never dated and I feel really lonely. I'm afraid of dating because I don't think I could manage a relationship on top of school. One day when I'm finished with school I'll probably get into the dating scene but I'll be a decade behind everyone else in terms of experience.

Yes, I want to get married someday and live a comfortable life with a good job to provide for my own family of four. I tell myself that everything i do today is to be achieve that, because that is what happiness means. But no matter how utopic I can imagine my future, I'll always see something that'll make life seem terrible.

I try not to think too much and just get my work done. I'm not sure what to do. I constantly feel dread for whatever my assignment or failure will be. I'm afraid of the future.

Maybe I'm just too dramatic and an overly hormonal teen. But I would love to hear words of wisdom.",12Nov2020,1
3,"I got anxiety half a year ago like anxiety attacks because a problem that has been on my mind for 2 and a half years. My parents know about that problem but dont take it seriously and they say i worry about stupid things. I feel like i will get a heart attack if this continues and i am that tipe of a preson that does not value life at all.
My anxiety made me think about dying and i even told them once for real how i felt and they got angry and said i should get a life and stop living like this be like other people. It was hard for me to say that it was a cry for help when i really neede it and then i got better on my own as i allweys do and i continued to live but every time i get better on my own i feel like i am more empty in side i dont feel happiness or have any dreams or wishes.
And the source of my problem is a thing that happend in the country i am moving to after i get my visa. I worked as a student there ower sommer and my boss messed my work  permit in that country and legaly it turned out that i worked there for a while withaut the permit wich is not by the law. They fixed it somehow but it stil remaines in the system and when move there it could become a problem even if i did not do anythig wrong nor did i know that there was a mistake as a worker i em partly gilty somehow.
I have been prepering to move there for the last 5 years and i was really looking to it before the problem.
It may not turn into a  problem at all but that turned into a trauma for me and i hate counflikts with law or with people with authority.
I have spent years learning the language and my parents think that i have to do this for my future and i dont want to stay were i live i cant even find a job here and the pay for my profession is toooo small.
The main point of all this (and there ia a lot) is that i dont know what to do with the anxiety that is coused by the problem that keeps following me maybe it is in my head and i really ower think it all like my parents who dont take mental helth seriously think.
So this is the mess that i call life with the killing anxiety, the not so much of a choise to move or not to move and  not soul that gets what i am going throught.",12Nov2020,1
4,"so me and my old best friend recently reconnected, and we made a new mutual friend but we both like him. i don’t think i actually want to be with him because he’s a year younger than me, but i still feel so so jealous that he seems to like her so much. i’m happy for her don’t get me wrong and if they ever started dating i’d be nothing but supportive but i’m still so afraid my jealousy will get the best of me. this isn’t the first time either, we have the same type which is the problem, but they always like her and it’s so hard on me and how i see myself. i just want tips on how to get over jealousy.

5,"I moved to a new state, so I decided to quit my job. I was working full time and made $17 an hour, plus pretty good benefits, sick time, paid holidays off, vacation time, but I HATED it there. I was miserable. Management was awful and the clients were worse. It might’ve been that specific location, but I can tell you it was bad. I worked 12:20-8:50 PM 5 days a week, so my life revolved around the place. Instead of applying for a transfer, I decided to call it quits. However, they just called me for an interview at the location near my house.

Since moving, I have gotten a new job. It’s alright. It’s much better than my last job, though. I work unsupervised and part time. The catch, however, is that part time employees don’t get any health care option, and I also make $15.50 an hour, so less than my last job. I am much happier working here, but I believe I had an undiagnosed medical issue I would like to see a doctor for, which is currently not an option without health insurance.

One last thing I should mention is that I quit my last job just under 90 days ago; after 90 days, you lose your pay, so I would go back to $15 an hour, but I would be getting health insurance again, something my current job doesn’t offer me.

TL;DR: I hated my last job but it has health benefits, my new job is better but doesn’t offer any insurance. What should I do?",12Nov2020,1
6,"I am a 60+ female. I have been working for a sizable company in the entertainment industry for the past 6, almost 7 years. The time I have worked there I have physically and figurately shed blood, sweat, and tears (and broken bones) and remained a steadfast loyal and positive employee for the company. (I even went to work while I was injured.) Before the pandemic hit they increased their starting pay for new hires to $13.00 per hour. Don't get me wrong, I was happy to have a job and welcomed the increase like all my fellow employees. I, also, thought that with my experience and years with the company that I would get a bit more for my dedication, service and loyalty. The company did not think the same way as I did, as I ended up with less than $13.50 per hour. I am not bitching about the pay; I am upset about how much my almost 7 years of service, loyalty, physical and emotional dedication is worth to this multi-billion dollar company. I am only getting pennies more than someone coming in that knows very little in comparison. Am I stupid to be upset? And am I stupid to continue to kill myself for this company?",12Nov2020,1
7,"The title is self-explanatory I suppose. I'm not asking for a miracle cure but a way to cope with celebrating the holidays by myself would be welcome. For as long as I remember, I would celebrate holidays alone. I do have family who I can celebrate it with but we're not particularly close, which always just ends up feeling like  an awkward social gathering than anything. Celebrating with friends is out of the question as many have families, lives of their own.

I'm young and I'm scared I wont utilize my time to have those ""thrills"".

11,"So, you can see from a previous post what the situation is but essentially myself and my ex best friend of 10 years haven’t spoken in about 10 months now.   For context, she is the one who did the bad thing which is what I am referencing in the message. 

I want to text her to talk, is it a bad idea?

This is what I have written so far:

‘I don’t know how to phrase this so I guess I’m just going to ask, I have no idea if you’ll want to but I’ve been thinking it over for weeks now and Idk, I guess it might be a good thing for both of us. 

So, hear me out here. I was wondering if you would like to meet up and speak to me, not about your ex or any of the shit that’s gone on there. I don’t wanna talk to you about that, it isn’t about me and I’m not involved so I don’t want to really talk about it unless you wanted to ask me something about me. I’ve been thinking about the friendship you and I had, and I guess trying to work through what happened even before your breakup or us not speaking any more. 

I want to try to answer some of the things you might be thinking and I want to ask you some too. So, I’d be happy to meet you if you wanted to as well. 

I get that if you don’t reply or whatever you’ve made your decision and that’s cool. I just thought I would ask. And if you wanted to make fun of me for this or think I have an ulterior motive all I can said is I don’t and yeah. What you choose to do is up to you. ‘",12Nov2020,1
12,"Hi there!

I've already asked a friend of mine about this but i would like to hear about others people opinions as well.

So, i'm a french 20 yo a ftm transgender and ive been out to some friends and one of my two brothers (who accepted me and didnt judge me and all). Thing is, everyday, im experiencing intense anxiety and sometimes depressed days cuz i keep getting called by my deadname and i cant fully come out at my school for example without my parents knowing.

My parents are still paying for my school (which is kind of the same thing as college in america) and renting the appartment im living in. The reason i cant come out to my parents is mostly because of my mom. She became more and more religious over the years, to the point where she became really homophobic for example and will keep praying all day (shes a muslim and im an atheist). As for my dad, he will probably not fully agree but wont do much 

I'm a bit scared to come out cause for example, last july, my mom kicked me out of my house because i didnt give her enough attention when she received an operation. (I had to get some backup from my brothers to get back home since i was...half naked in the street yeah)

To be honest, i'm not really sure how she could react to that. I mean, she's super religious and homophobic but keeps watching greys anatomy (which has lesbian characters) and she indeed love these characters.  I'm just wondering how she could react to one of her kids being non cis and non het.

I've been thinkin that maybe i could try to test the ground by asking her why she likes greys anatomy if theres lgbt persons in it. But it wont change the fact that i wont exactly know how she could react to one of her kid being in that case.

If i dont come come out now, ill have to wait at least 3y before i could finally start my transition. It's not...a lot but my mental health has been going south so quickly these last months, mostly because of that. And i just want to feel happy for once, without the anxiety to top it

What are your thoughts on that? Should i dait? What kind of questions could i ask to test the grounds ?

Thank you in advance, and i will answer any questions if theres some",12Nov2020,1

14,"Basically, I walk my new puppy past my neighbors house every day. It’s a necessary road to get to other main roads and I can’t avoid walking by him. For context- he’s older, almost 70 and I am 24. Every time I walk by, he shouts my name and immediately speeds walks to me before I can keep walking. We’re neighbors so I formally introduced myself a while back to be polite. He overshares his entire life with me but it’s mostly in a sexual context. For example: he described to me the other day how because he and his wife are miserable and getting divorced, he has to “take care of himself” but that “everything still works”. Things like that and much worse. I don’t know how to keep my distance and properly tell him to fuck off because 1. He knows where I live and 2. He knows that my boyfriend is very career motivated and can work long hours so I’m afraid he’ll pop by when he isn’t home. Any advice is really appreciated. Thanks.",12Nov2020,1

22,"Myself (USA) and my BF (Ireland) have been together since 2017. It's been a long road with many hills and bumps, but thus far we've made it work despite having the whole ocean between us. We met in real life a year in to our relationship and had been able to consistently meet up about every 3 months or so and it worked well for us. When we weren't together, we still talked daily and enjoyed gaming with each other. 

We were to the point that we had began planning for the future. I was looking for a house and he was and still is committed to leaving Ireland and moving in with me. He had talked to a lawyer and learned his best way in was marriage. Not my first choice, I'm just not religious and not into the idea, but I loved him and I'd do it if it was our best way. (We discussed a work visa but decided that wouldn't work. From what the lawyer told us, if he were to lose his job in any way he'd have to go home and search for a new job and apply again. He couldn't stay with me and figure it out in the US.)

We were supposed to start this all this year. He bought the ring. We were due for a visit again in May and we planned on making the trip to court. And then covid came and closed the border. We haven't seen each other since January and it's really changed everything. I don't want to share all the detail with you guys, but there's been such a huge rip in the relationship I really don't know that it's repairable. I think we need to see each other again for there to be hope for anything, and by the looks of things, it could be clear until next summer before things open up. We talked about meeting up in a country that's allowing travel but I just don't think its safe right now. It'd be entirely different if we could  stay in each other's homes, where we know who and what we're in contact with. 

My question i can't get answered is this, and I'm blindly pulling straws that reddit can even help: 

My mother suggested we do plan one of these trips, even if it's just a few days. We use that time to get married in said country, in hopes he'd be able to travel to meet me in the US. Like does that even count?? I know foreign family members of US residents are being allowed in, so im not sure if my hypothetical husband would fit the criteria.

He said he didn't hold any bad feelings towards me and that it was all in the past. I tried to keep the conversation going but he didn't seem receptive and I haven't talked to him since.

31,"IMPORTANT: I’m 19, unemployed, living with my parents. They don’t want me to contribute to household expenses even though I have money saved up. I can’t move out as here there’s no rentals available, I can’t afford it and *they don’t want me to yet*. I’m not American. 


As mentioned, I’m 19 and it’s time I got a job after my gap-year. I have 2 years of deli experience, brief work experience in admin and a couple certificates in business so I am mostly aiming for an admin job. However my mother is now relentlessly forcing me to apply for my exact old job. I don’t want to because 1. they got rid of the deli 2. There’s this creep who knew I was under 18 and would still make me uncomfortable and try to add me on social media and 3. It would just be awkward. 


I’m trying very hard to get a different job in admin or other seasonal retail but she just won’t stop nagging me to apply there. I mainly don’t want to run into this creep who was a regular there and most likely still goes. If I had to ever see him again I’d die. The store can’t ban him. My mum doesn’t seem to care about this and won’t back off. How should I go about this? Am I being unreasonable? Getting money is *not* a priority right now, it is about not being bored in my summer break. So it’s not like I will die if I don’t get this job.",12Nov2020,1

I have a medical marijuana card for my PTSD from an event that happened to me when I was 16 years old.

33,"The love of my life \[M24\] has confided in me slowly over the course of several years that he beleives he may have schizophrenia, but is too afraid to see a Dr because he fears the diagnosis. I've told him a million times I love him &amp; it's ok, but he's too afraid of being diagnosed, locked up or drugged up. (We live in a place that's very judgemental of mental illnesses especially misunderstood ones like this. Also, the little bit of family he does have, has no idea of any of this.) His best friends brother is severly drugged up because of his schizophrenia, and he doesn't want to end up like that. 

As ableist as it sounds, he seems and acts completly normal on a day to day basis. We laugh &amp; act silly, he cooks all our meals, he does takes care of our paperwork , etc etc.. But he's told me for ex. sometimes he'll wake up and see a face staring back at him, or hear voices, and you'd never be able to tell. 

I've heard testimonies from other schizophrenia patients that they wish they'd gotten treated or dianosed sooner. Although he ""seems fine"" now I am well aware it is a deteriorative disease, and I'd like to keep him healthy and around as long as possible. I am applying for therapy for my own mental illnesses &amp; tried to convince him to apply too. But he says he's ""not ready"", should I push / encourage him to come ?? 

And for those of you who may have a diagnosis or know someone close with one, is there anything I can do to help him? Or any advice at all about the  disorder .

41,"I should preface this by saying that I go on walks often around my local area, usually to listen to music and take my mind off of things. I usually wear clothes that cover myself up as much as possible, because I used to get honked at by cars and stuff when I would wear normal clothes. So I always wear jeans and an oversize hoodie, with my hair braided and tucked into my shirt where I can pull my hoodie up and be basically covered everywhere. I was also wearing a mask (obviously). I just thought I’d include what I was wearing, since some people give advice regarding changing what stuff you wear to avoid being targeted by creeps.

So here’s what happened. Recently I went out for a walk to the local park. It started getting dark earlier than I expected, so it was already dark out when I started going home. I remember vividly that when the song I was listening to ended, I thought I heard someone calling after me behind me. I took out an earbud and looked behind me, and I saw a man (I couldn’t make him out very well at this point) a couple yards behind me who was loudly talking. I thought he was probably just talking on the phone, but still I just picked up the pace to get home.

When I got closer to the crosswalk, I turned again and saw he was not on the phone, but was actually calling after me. I couldn’t make out what he was saying, but I didn’t want to stop and find out, so instead of stopping to wait for the crosswalk light I kept walking down the sidewalk and tried to shake this guy. I didn’t really know what I was doing.

I’m pretty bad at describing my surroundings, but here goes. Basically, on the inside of the sidewalk that I’d been walking down, there’s a parking lot with a short wooden fence around it. When I turned, this man must’ve done some math in his head or something, because I couldn’t see him behind me anymore. Nope, this guy decided to cut across the parking lot to take the fucking hypotenuse in order to cut me off. I just tried to walk as fast as I could but I saw this guy basically run across the parking lot, then slowly get over the wooden fence and end around a yard in front of me. I remember just stopping walking and taking a step back.

Then I finally got a decent look at this guy. He was like 4 inches shorter than I was (I’m 5’10”), he was totally bald, clean-shaven, and at least 35. He had a backpack on that looked like it was completely full. On the backpack, I remember seeing a bunch of large metal key-rings in two big lines on it when he got over the fence. He wasn’t wearing a mask, which I found really odd, because in my area I barely know anyone who doesn’t wear one around. I don't remember exactly what he was wearing, but his clothes did look clean.

He started talking to me, but I could not make out for the life of me what he was trying to say. I kind of just stood there and said nothing though, I didn’t know if I was it was just one of those moments where you don’t know what you’re hearing or the other person is talking too fast or what, really. Eventually, he took out his phone and showed me the screen and smiled. The screen just looked white to me, since he was still not that close to me. If he was trying to show me something I wasn’t sticking around to find out or look closer though, I just shook my head at the guy a lot and took another few steps back. Then he abruptly turned away from me and walked briskly in the other direction.

So that was fucking scary and also confusing. When I got home I told my parents briefly what happened but they didn’t really know what to make of it. I really like going for walks, and I don’t want this experience to ruin or limit them for me. I don’t know how I could avoid being targeted by people like that in the future though. Any advice on what to do differently as to not be followed like this in the first place? Also, if anyone has an idea of what he was trying to do I’d really like to know.

Not just the sex, but I've taken my first acid trip with her and just yesterday drove 7 hours with her to get a dog. As the title states, I've been really feeling good with the chick and we talk literally all day long and have been for like I said a couple weeks now. She's definitely into me and is always wanting to hang but back when we first started talking, she mentioned she was sleeping around with someone and needed some advice because he was basically not giving her the attention she wanted.

I realise we will never understand truely, but isnt a weird coicnidance i experiance different states when around her? 
When i finaly stop listening to my self as much as other people becauae i started to realise iv grown so much , and alot of review has happend , but whats anyone elses take on the impreshion feeling or general mood change or why a five year old said a word he didnt understand and then his mother explained everything to him and even showed him how to tie a nuse ? 
I can totaly be my self away from them , but when i get close or actualy listen to there lessons its all garbage crazy belif systems from  killing puppys with bare hands to how a perception change is really the fult of a demon and the general feeling that you can do bad things untill you cross the line and cant hide your bad emotion anymore the guilt gets to you, 
I grew up without a conshious and its like all i can do is keep it going , id say drugs screw u up , but its less trubblesome then the impact of toxic people . I met a man in his 60s that smoked pot for 40 years and he told me he never got mental issues and he smoked daily. 
But then theres the type who are given amphetamines as a kindergartiner and they will grow to not feel as good as they could be with the pill, so my other question is witch is worst toxic people or non lethal dosages of drugs ? 
Why does one have the power to give u a phacyoactive substance but its wrong of you to find what works for you the best ?

49,"It’s the only insecurity of mine and it haunts me all the time. Most people tell me I have a pretty smile but to me, that’s because they’re not looking closely or they just don’t really say anything/try to be mean to my face. The problem with my teeth are that they’re very small and gummy. And to make it worse I had braces during my preteen phases and idk what happened or how it happened but the braces squeezed on so tight to the left side of my gum that it turned it purple. It looks disturbing. I would also take fault in not being the best of taking care of my teeth when I had braces because my mom didn’t discipline me enough to do so. When it was time to get them off, my orthodontists were disappointed on how the smile turned out. They wanted to see me more to fix my smile, but my mom never took me back. Waste of *her* money. 

We tried to go back a couple of years ago and they told us we would have to be paying $$$ amount just to get everything fixed again because of the reasons I never wore my retainer afterwards and never came back. With the gum surgery and that I’ve created a slight overbite, they wanted to add Invisalign. 

So as of now it’s still not fixed. Thankful we have to wear masks now because it helps cover it when I laugh or smile talking to people. I’m (21f) now and I want to get it fixed so I can clear this insecurity of mine. But here’s also another weird thing about me. I’m afraid to finally get it fixed only to have people bring up a conversation about my smile. I’m afraid people are gonna ask if I’ve gotten them done because then I’ll know they’ve noticed how horrible my teeth/smile was. *that’s just me being dramatic  and overthinking but I just had to add that*


(*´ー｀*) idk. I’m typing this out because I feel like I need to express this insecurity out here to someone. I’ve never told anyone about this because I don’t even want to bring it up. It’s so expensive to get them fixed if I wanted to now because I have bills and other expenses I have to take care of with my money. Oh what do. Anyways, that’s my story.

51,"
When I was 16, I was dating a guy for about a year and a half I met at function for music. We ended up going LDR after about 6 months, we dated for a year and a half, and long story short I was pressured into sex one day while visiting and sexually assaulted by him and it took me about a year to come to terms with it that it was assault, even after talking to my three best friends about it. Me and him dated for about three months after the event, and he ended up leaving me because the assault had thrown me into subconsciously resenting him, and leaving me very depressed. 

When me and this guy first started dating, we went on a double date with my friend and her boyfriend at the time. We will call the friend A. 

A, after this fact, didn’t talk to him at all. They weren’t friends, and the only time either heard of one another was through me. 

As my ex had assaulted me and it left me with a lot to work through (it’s coming up on the two year anniversary of when things happened in about 6 days) and I can’t afford therapy at the moment and honestly it’s been hard, but I’m doing a lot better. It’s still traumatic and makes me uneasy seeing him or his accounts, I had him blocked. But I still had A, and I saw a mutual friend post about my ex and A. 

I asked her if they were friends, and she said this: 

i kind of am but only because i suck at making new friends and he’s friends with [mutual friend] and i’m friends w [mutual friend] yanno
streaming shit

So I responded with: 
 
yeah. i’m personally uncomfortable with that but i’m not here to make decisions for you and i love you as a person, so i’m not sure gonna make you choose friends or anything. i mean it’s not like him and i just broke up, there was some stuff that i’m still dealing with that came from that relationship that intentional or not is still damaging. it’s your life and your choice, and i mean there’s always other people out there but i understand having mutual friends and everything. 

bottom line ig is that some of the stuff that came out of that relationship was traumatic for me and i’ve talked to you ab it, while yes it was two years ago and everything i’m still healing from some aspects. it makes me uncomfortable but i appreciate you being honest with me.

She said this in response: 

i love you so much and i can assure you that i’m not like good friends with him or anything, it’s kinda just a mutual friend thing and i literally have a handful of friends here[college]. i don’t talk to him regularly so you don’t have to worry about any of that :)


Something just doesn’t sit right with me about this. If he really didn’t matter, why would you befriend (and stay friends) with someone that sexually assaulted your best friend, that you knew about before? She also tried to hiding it by not naming him at all when referring to him.

My other two best friends are telling me she doesn’t genuinely care about me, because over all you don’t stay friends with someone’s abuser. Was it out of line for me to ask her, and would I be the asshole if I dropped her?",12Nov2020,1

She had just started a new job and was going through a lot in school and seemed overwhelmed. She never wanted to leave when she had to and that caused her to not get enough sleep for her job/school.

I also like studying. I really love maths, all the theoretical stuff behind it. I actually plan to study some of it audodicactically, I'm a maths student right now but I'd like to go deeper 

And this is a dilemma I'm facing and I see no solution to that. On the one hand, I want to become smarter by increasing my knowledge. But on the other hand, what's the point of spending time on something completely theoretical if you just could spend the time with the people you love?

Why should I bother being an ass smart dude, I mean even if I reach that goal and even if I could become a successful amateur mathematician, what's the point of being one if everything you can say after all those years is that you've spend your life in front of a book, and not with others?

58,"I recently had a mental break down. Biggest factor was my job as a manager and as well issues with my parents. Quick back story my father recently divorced my mother. Bc of her I turned gay and my brother had a baby out of wedlock. Really it was just an excuse to run off with his side hoe that we all knew about. My father and I relationship was always strained. 
Anyways I've had sessions with my counselor and I was telling him how my father was horrified when he found I was gay. I wasn't allowed to come over nor contact the family. After he divorced my mom, she and I have been rebuilding our relationship. 
My counselor is a firm believer if you have a huge thing against gay people it's bc deep down you're gay in someway. 
I told him about a conversation I had with my husband how there were red flags my dad might be.
1) whenever my father and I were alone at home he'd say ""you know you can walk around in your underwear. Even I'll do it!"" 
2) I'm hairy guy I had fluff that would stick out from my butt over the waist band of my shorts. He'd see it and constantly play with it. 
3)We often gave each other back massages. We both have back issues. Once he got hard and when jolted from feeling it he got defensive and never did it again.
4) One of the many times we tried to reconcile he kept holding my hand and even tried kissing me on the lips. (We're mexican and I figured he was just trying to show affection?)
5) his silk shirts. He had tons and tons of shirts. And when I started to go to gay clubs I thought it was really weird everyone was wearing his entire closet lol
Suddenly my counselor stop writing and had a puzzled look. ""You do know none of that is normal?""
Me, ""That's what my husband said. I thought it was...""
""No absolutely not. What does your husband say about it?""
""Well he thinks my father is gay and never came out. But then I did and he's jealous that I'm out now.""
My counselor sighed ""I think your father has some... Questionable actions. And he possibly was hard on you because he had an interest in you.""
I was shocked. Confused. Disgusted. 
""Has he ever molested you?""
""My dad was an asshole but never disgusting like that!"" 
He apologized and decided to end the session early bc I was upset. He asked me to reflect on session and possibly talk to my mother about it. 
Well I talked to my mom and she was horrified and didn't know anything about it. Also found out my Dad had raped her so he's more then capable to do something disgusting as molesting. 
My father recently message me and wants to try to work things out. Again. All I want to do is beat the sh*t out of him. 
Do I meet up with him and publicly call him a child molester? A rapist?
Do I tell his new wife what he really is?
Do I tell my brothers about this shit?
I haven't been to have anymore sessions bc of covid. 
I know it's selfish but I hope my counselor gets better soon just so I can figure out how to handle this.",12Nov2020,1
59,"i’ve been in a rough patch for a while now and it’s leading me to feel really really burned out. i’m in my senior year of highschool and i’m currently balancing 10 classes as well as college applications and other stressful responsibilities. my motivation is at an all time low, although i’m keeping up and getting good grades i have to push myself hard in order to get stuff done. i feel stressed and exhausted all the time and feel like i have nothing left to look forward to. my days just repeat and being at home doing school doesn’t help. i feel so drained and tired all the time and i’m sick of it. 

it’s starting to affect things in my personal life. i have no motivation to do my hobbies as much and even though i have an amazing boyfriend who’s always there for me and amazing friends to support me i just feel so shitty. i don’t know what to do anymore.

do any of you have advice to help me feel less stressed and shitty all the time? i’m really lost :(",12Nov2020,1
60,"I'm writing this hoping that someone might have a suggestion. As I know it is super long and I wouldn't expect anyone to spend the time reading it so i guess its an opportunity for me to just vent before tomorrow comes. But if anyone does read all of this, thankyou.

\---

I am 23. My parents got together at 16 and married at 19/20. For as long as I have been alive they have had a volatile, toxic and violent relationship. They split when I was around 10 and I lived with my mum but stayed with my dad for half of the week.

The arguments and trouble continued even after they split. Both are major depressives, my dad with PTSD and my mum is an alcoholic. My dad would tell me when he  was down and generally got everything off his chest and I supported him through suicide attempts and hospitalization. He currently lives in the middle of nowhere on farmland he has, in a caravan with no running water, no proper toilet/plumbing, gas, electricity ecs. Its a long story but he's essentially semi-homeless and barley sees anyone. So I'm really his only port of call and I'm scared he'll commit suicide or end up dead every day if I stop speaking to him. My mum on the other hand bottled everything up and drank away the problems, which lead to most of my teens resenting and even hating the change in personality she has when she took that first sip. She because abusive, even physically, especially towards my sister (who is now 30). Eventually my sister cut all contact with both parents, moved out and the only person she really speaks to is me. No proper friends ecs. Problem is she's a wreck because of it.

But I learned young that both parents would try to use me and my older sister as weapons and try to win sides. So everything about their relationship from a young age I would take with a pinch of salt and as I grew up. I basically became distanced from any mention of the other parent from either of them. I was too young to understand what was going on at the time. And growing up after the split I didn't want to have to deal with their relationship problems as I didn't ask to be born into this situation.

But apart from their fights, they love me and I love them back. And deep down all I want is a normal calm relationship with them, separately. It is beyond clear that they can't function together and I love my dad as my dad and my mum as my mum.

However, they're now 60 and on the occasion that they do have to interact, they'll be calm and civil for a while but 100% of the time, without fail, the past gets dragged up and its back to square 1.

It seems like my mum is a shell of a person, she hasn't worked since her early 20s, hates meeting new people, cant use technology, hates going outside because that would mean interacting with people and sits around watching reality tv all day to fill in for the life she is or has missed out on. I work and pay £200 to rent and utilites per month but she cooks meals for the both of us and does both of our washing ecs and pays for groceries. However, its not like I don't try to do those for myself. She insists on doing those things. Refuses to take any extra money from me and keeps the cupboards too full for me to fit my own food in. Cooks way too much so I have no real choice but to eat her food before it goes off. Refunds any money for food I send her ecs. And I guess its not something I should complain about but it seems like she does it as a coping mechanism not to lose me like she did my sister. She was really rotten towards her and after my sister left and I came home from university she started to over-mother me which I took tentatively as I could see why she might be doing it. And after several breakdowns recently she has started to open up as it seems like she's aware that she has gotten old and is still stuck in the past and because of that she feels like she, or more accurately, my dad has wasted her life. Now, only recently she has told me that their relationship was more like one sided abuse. She was being mentally and physically abused. She told me she tried to kill herself when she was in her teens to escape. And grew up hating his guts. She has said she regrets ever agreeing to marry him ecs.

At this point I just don't know what to do with that information. She has never accepted any help in the past. And wont accept any help now. So I have been trying to comfort her and help her to open up more and help her try to grow in day to day life and avoid making any contact they both have together. However, it has been so long that I have had a loving relationship with my dad, away from all the trouble it feels like I should be a LOT more mad at him that I am. But after spending my whole life being emotionless and impartial to my parents fights after they split up and trying my best to neutralize the situation, my opinion of my dad has changed but I don't feel a very strong urge to cut him out like I feel like I should. Maybe its because I know I don't understand the real relationship dynamic between them and there is probably more to it than that. And I don't have a time machine to go back and see it with an adults perspective but the part of me that just wants a normal, calm loving relationship with my parents away from each other remains strong and It is just now upsetting her.

Two days ago, it was my grandad's, my mum's dad's funeral. We had a nice service, I carried the coffin and we had some time together with my auntie, cousins and my uncle. And for some reason, at 10pm, after settling down, my mum decided to call my dad from the house phone to let him know how the funeral went. After I refused to let her call him on my phone, stating that I would call him myself tomorrow. Anyway, it inevitably lead to an argument. My Dad's dad's funeral was brought up after some petty comments from both sides and my mum tried to force me to listen in on the conversation without my dad's knowledge to prove to me how bad my dad is. After telling her I don't want any part of the spat I left my room where she was and stayed away until the phone was put down. They continued to text back and forth after the call ended.

My mum got into bed she shouted me into her room, stating that I have to grow up and that she'll be doing nothing for me now. I said that's absolutely fine (as I lived and did just fine whilst living on my own at university for three years). But I asked what has sparked that action and she said ""I'm not sure"". Then immediately went onto talking about the call she just had with my dad. I let her explain what had happened but after she tried to get me to read the texts and kept going on about it I told her I'm not interested. As bad as that sounds, I continued to explain. I told her as long as I've been alive all they've done is fight. And yet she keeps contacting him. It could be because she wants closure. It could be because she wants to cause him pain for what has done. It could be because she just wants to civil for her own sake or everyone else sake but neither of them know when to stop. I've scolded them both in the past for just not being able to walk away from a situation they know wont end well. And broken up more fights than I can count. And I explained to her that I've been done with it for a long time now. I'm 23 years old and under no obligation to be involved with their fighting if they refuse to move on or at least seek help. I told her he is on the other side of the country and is one button click away from shutting up. And yet she can't do that. And believe me I'm not overlooking how difficult it is for an abuse victim dealing with what they've done through and I can understand why she does what she does. But practically If she refuses to put an end to it and try to drag me into the fighting then I'm just going to try to live my life separated from all of that. It has tortured too much of our lives for me not to move on.

So she tells me to get out of her room, then 5 mins later she shouts me back in again to have another go at it and this happens two or three more times. She's trying to show me texts and get me to read them ecs. And I tell her just turn her phone off. Delete the messages and just get rid, block the number and get on with it. Anyway I eventually try to read the messages when she tries to give me the phone but then she snatches it back and says NO just get out. I tell her to go to sleep and not to shout me again. And she says that I should move out if I want, never ask her for anything again because I don't want to be involved in her life because that is all her life is. This struggle. And I refused to leave before I made her understand that I understand why she's saying that but she's wrong, and that I still want her in my life I just refuse to encourage her to make self destructive decisions and continue arguments that she has the power to stop. She keeps telling me to just get out at this point and then the final nail in the coffin she says ""Well you would say that because you fucking pity him (my dad) don't you.""

So I just left.

I'm sat in my room. Typing this up. Just wondering where I should go from here.

Am I in the wrong for not cutting my dad off? Probably. But I've spent a good third of my life being his only lifeline, feeling like if I leave he'll be completely and utterly alone and he'll probably kill himself. And no one wants to feel like that towards their dad. And then to be told as an adult that he was an abuser. The choice to cut contact is like putting a loaded gun in my hand and being told to pull the trigger. I don't want to. I just want to have a dad and a mum I can love but they won't stay away from each other. And maybe they're too stuck in their ways, too damaged or too old to change.

Maybe this will blow over by the morning. Maybe it wont. But those grooves are deep and I worry I'll just fall back into them and the cycle will continue. I need something to change.",12Nov2020,1
61,"Hello everyone. I'm just here to ask for any sort of advice as to how to solve this problem I've had for as long as I can remember. I'm 17 turning 18 next month and I'm worried for my future as my life is crumbling (not even being dramatic here). Sorry if everything isn't in correct order or context but I just need to get this off my chest as this is the main problem in my life and if I were to go into detail it would just be the story of my entire teenage life. So here goes.

I've had a deteriorating and fluctuating relationship with a large group of people in my local area that also changes in members (if you could say that), and now they're all against me again. I was out yesterday after someone in my friend group announcing that they have tested positive for Covid-19, even though I havent been around him in a good while, and someone added me to a group chat and they all made fun of me and said horrible things and it made me feel like this was the point where lifes not even worth it anymore. Well, I mean worse has happened and no one even likes me, but I have one friend that I've known and talked to closely over the last few years, who I know through my second cousin who I'm also close with, and even now our relationship is drastically changing, and last week he told me f off and a few weeks before he said he doesnt like me as much and that I talk about myself too much. On Snapchat I try to talk to girls, and outside and online none seem to show any interest, no matter how confident, flirty or nice I am to them. They only ""get off"" with people that are d-heads towards them, and I'm sick of being jealous of what other people have. I hope to become an actor and I don't know if it's because of my egotistical side but I feel like I deserve this shot because I've put up with enough and I've wanted it for years. I don't like boasting and don't do it often but I'm told to be extremely talented in writing and intelligent in general, and also art (I was told that I was one of the best a teacher had ever seen and people in my class told me that, but I don't have it as a subject anymore because of lack of interest). I'm always fighting with my parents and getting kicked out, disobeying authority and doing crappy things because it's not worth being good anymore, and everything seems to be getting darker. That's why I can easily make my novel series more compelling because I based it loosely on real life and I've had lots of practise. But anyways, I feel like I have no one and I never get taken seriously and it makes me feel completely worthless. I can never keep relationships stable and I can't even stay out with ""friends"" for more than an hour because they slag me off so much I end up leaving or threatening to leave. I know I'm not special but this annoying inflated ego of mine tells me I am. I'm sick of this excuse of a life and it's going nowhere.

Thank you so much if you read all of this, and I'd appreciate it more if I could get any sort of reply.",12Nov2020,1

I know I will be yelled at and I’m scared because my mental health hasn’t been great over the past few months. I have anxiety, insomnia, PTSD from cancer, and honestly I don’t like being seen outside anymore. I feel bald and gained weight from treatment and feel like I will be judged.

He went out with his friends instead and didn’t call me until 11:30pm lol. I was upset because it seemed like he was prioritizing hanging out with his friends over me.

70,"Hey there. Might be above y’all’s pay grade, cause it’s definitely above mine, but if any of you have ideas about next steps, it’d be much appreciated. My boyfriend [24M] has been having some really concerning/weird episodes lately. Some context: He works from home, I have to go out for work. He has depression/anxiety and not amazingly controlled Type 1 diabetes. He made it so that I get updates on his blood sugar should there be an emergency. It’s maybe also worth noting that he sometimes goes long stretches of time (2-3 days) without sleep. He says it’s cool, I’m not so sure. 

Sometimes I’ll come home in the afternoon and he’ll be asleep, and his blood sugar will spike or go low enough where it sends a notification. If he doesn’t get to it himself after a while and it’s bad, I try to wake him and nudge him to give insulin or eat. Other times I just need him to do something urgently. Recently, when I’ve gently woken him (I don’t come in yelling), he’ll be extremely disoriented and afraid. And nothing I can say or do helps. It honestly scares me. This has been happening with both low and high blood sugar.

I literally come in like “hey dude can I get you a snack? You’re a bit low” and he’ll be like “WHAT? Where am I? What’s happening? No, no, no... STOP IT! Please stop!” He will only say those things and it’s impossible to get through to him. He’ll say my name and know it’s me, but is otherwise extremely disoriented. And this wouldn’t concern me as much if it stopped after a few minutes, but we’ll literally go back and forth like this for an hour (if I don’t give up first). I try to be calm and kind to him, gently reminding him where he is, what time it is, that I have his pump here so he take care of himself right away, etc. It’s exasperating on my part. Today he actually yelled at me saying some version of what I wrote above. It scared me enough that I decided to leave him alone. On another occasion he’d locked himself in the bedroom from the inside and and it took me hours to coax him to unlock the door. Later, when he reorients himself or whatever, he does not remember any of what transpired.

We’ve been together for 3 years and this behavior is relatively new. He was sometimes a little slow to fully wake up but never, ever this bad. It’s really cropped up in the last few months and has been getting worse and more frequent. I have a really stressful job and the last thing I want to do is come home and take care of and worry about a helpless adult man for several hours. I don’t know how to deal with him when he’s like that, and I don’t know how to get him to understand that this a serious problem that needs attention.",12Nov2020,1

I’ve come to realize my “game” kind of sucks now. I guess from not hitting on anyone in nearly 6 years has that effect.

Im the type of person who needs their time in class. examples, time to do assignments. Our school system right now is literally -

we have 10 days per class. two classes each semester, 4 semesters. every week we alternate between classes, and every 2 weeks we switch between having 2 days off and 3 days of school, and vice versa. we switch classes each week. which means we have 6 hours a day of just one class. we have no god damn time to do any fucking work. my class ended for good yesterday and I still have an entire project to fix and 50 verb cards to do. due tomorrow, of course.

Our social distancing is a joke, every little cough or sniffle from someone sends me into a panic.

Im seriously questioning my sexuality, which is taking a wicked toll. I was too deep in thought on the walk home today and actually speedwalked face first into a pole. 

and my friends are being absolutely dreadful right now.  I planned on ditching them at the end of this 'semester' honestly. but I'm too much of a fucking coward despite things getting continuously worse. today was just awful with them. 

 my intrusive thoughts make me want to die too, which is excellent.

Im in the midst of writing my first book for nanowrimo, while my laptop is fucking broken. I have to do my classwork but 500 words of a story that should take 20 minutes on a bad day takes 3 hours. I can't send it in for repairs either, because it's needed for school.

Im also useless. I can't get a job until I'm a certain age, which won't be until next month when I'm applying on my birthday. at least working would give me some semblance of being helpful.

For context, my dad has been divorced twice because both of his wives can’t stand his short temper and anger issues.

Am I crazy for not wanting to drive, because to my parents, they thought it was the most exciting thing but to me, I just don’t like it and they’ve said vocally that they’re are disappointed by that.  So I just gotta ask, Am I crazy for not wanting to drive?

(Sidenote: My parents aren’t abusive verbally or physically, they just kinda don’t get certain things sometimes)

Thanks for listening, I just needed to get that off my chest.",12Nov2020,1

85,"I often feel like I must be doing something wrong, or there's something inherently wrong with me that I can't figure out, because several different friendships and friend groups have been characterised by them treating me as lesser, generally having little respect and often subtly removing me from their group.

My best friend once planned to get rid of me before high school. My current friendship group in my uni course has made a separate group chat and slowly stopped talking to me. 

I've definitely also had successful friendships alongside these, but I am having less and less luck with friend groups as I feel like maybe people are... embarrassed by me? Or something? Sadly, because of this, I'm feeling lonely and useless, rather than valuing the close friends I have that DO treat me right.

What can I examine about myself and my behaviour that could be causing this? And if it's just down to not being the right fit, how often would you expect not to ""succeed"" in a friendship?",12Nov2020,1
86,"(This is not a medical advice post; just involves the office where I an my family are regularly seen)  

I had concerns about our local hospital/doctor's office (both part of the same health system) a few months ago when a number of the nurses insisted to me that Covid was 'no worse than the flu' and complained that the hospital's mask rule was somewhere between BS and unconstitutional.  

Both my infant and I have a good number of appointments/follow ups in the next 2-3 months. Today social media recommended a local woman as a follow and I recognized her immediately as both a nurse at the facility where we're treated, and my doctor's wife. Her most recent pic is her and a group of people, taken recently based on the scenery. Curious, I clicked. Her feed is filled with \*tons\* of photos over the last 5 months, many including two other nurses from the hospital/clinic, as well as rotating handfuls of other women or couples (ie, not the same 2 or 3 potentially quarantining together).  They're also traveling distances where they have clearly stopped at gas stations/convenience stores/possibly restaurants and definitely hotels and B&amp;Bs. 

When I called the facility today and asked specifically what their guidance was for staff, since my state is one with record highs and hospitals over capacity, I was told by my doctor (her husband) that some people quarantine in 'small pods' of households that agree to quarantine so they can associate. Otherwise staff are supposed to follow all the same mask guidelines/social distancing/stay at home orders as the rest of us.  

Since these photos were taken in different states/multiple locations with different groups and no masks, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this isn't what's been happening in her case. He emphasized, if not obvious by our state and city falling apart, that the illness is \*not\* the same as the flu. I didn't mention the social media account because while I didn't find it by snooping, I felt ashamed of having looked through her public profile. I like professional things to stay that way superficially so the waters don't get muddied like this :/  

At this point I want to cancel scheduled appointments and as much as we LOVE our doctor, kind of want to see someone else indefinitely. No part of me wants to be closed up in a room with someone who may or may not follow basic preventative measures and two people who definitely don't. Am I overacting by not going to my appointment on Monday? Canceling my infant's appointment next week? Should I cancel, move on all together, or is there something I'm missing and I should just calm TF down?    
TIA!",12Nov2020,1
87,"So this is a painfully insecure question,  but im a painfully insecure person and would benefit from any encouragement and advice.  I'm about five pounds over what a healthy bmi would be for my height.  It isn't a ton but it definitely makes me not super attractive.  I'm nineteen, and up to this point i have avoided all physical touch at all costs.  I haven't even had my first kiss because I've always been waiting to lose weight first.  Anyways, i decided fuck it (literally), i want to have these experiences like any other person and i can still work on myself in the mean time.  But now i have a third date coming up with someone i think is really interesting and the touch barrier will very likely be broken and i am freaking out a tad bit.  I'm very aware that i am not optimally attractive and he could do much better and it takes me out of conversation at times, or prevents me from flirting.  Of course im trying to lose weight, but as it is unlikely that i will lose 30 lbs by the weekend what can i do to feel a bit more comfortable?  It's a stupid question but as a het man if that's what you are, were you to be attracted to a woman by how she looked standing up, would you become unattracted at the way her stomach folded when she sat, or moved during sex?  has that ever happened where your attraction was killed by the way someone moved or seeing them at a particular angle?  I'm very aware of how i move, and i think it could be easier to be relaxed fi i knew whether or not that was actually an issue.  Also would a man ask out a girl he found unattractive just to see where things go and he feels attraction later?  i would definitely do that with a guy if he seemed like a neat individual, but i honestly kind of hope men are, or at least this man is, more shallow (or pragmatic?) as a bit of reassurance of some degree of attraction.

&amp;#x200B;

91,"I don’t even know how to start this. 

I am 17 and I just graduated high school this year, And I chose to do college and not sit home or work straight ahead. But the thing is in my country, they do a test called wizari( taken by seniors only, and if they feel like their grades are low for the profession they want they can add their sophomore and junior year grades to increase it ) but I was in an American system school so we did it by GPA and SATs. and in order for me to apply to any colleges in my country I have to equalize my grade, but due to the pandemic 3 of our SATs got canceled and we were not given any extra time to redo SATs, while wizari ppl not only got a 2 month extension to study but also got the materials included in their tests to be 30% reduced. Due to that the amount of extremely high grades was overwhelming to everyone. And while submitting my equalization for public colleges, they messed up my GPA grade and made it way lower, therefore I didn’t get in to what I truly have been trying to get in. But in the private colleges there are options in the same Field but not really what I want and is not something I’m passionate about at all. Therefor I have to make a very life changing and future based decision. My options are :

( just for clarity, I want medical school, which is available only in public colleges, but my private options are dentistry and pharmacy, I’m really passionate about everything related to medical school and what not, on the other hand I really am not interested in anything dentistry, I’m neutral with pharmacy aka becoming a pharmacist, but again it is not something I’m passionate about) 


1. I suck it up and accept pharmacy and dentistry ( I have a friend in dentistry in one of the colleges I applied to so it wouldn’t be so lonely ig but he is 2 years ahead )

2. I can retake an SAT hopefully get a higher grade and this time they won’t mess up my GPA hopefully and I can apply for medical school next year and get into what I truly desire ( sounds like the most sensible option in my opinion, but I’m not sure if I’ll have the motivation to study for that again since the next subject SAT I can take is in may) (( it also would be while being in one of the private options since I don’t plan on having a gap year ))

3. Travel abroad and do medical school there for a year then transfer back here ( I’m sentimental and extremely emotionally attached to my place and the ppl I love especially my amazing mother and little sister, my adorable boyfriend, our two cats at home, and all my close friends, mind you I’ve become introverted and I’m finding it harder and harder to communicate with others )

101,"I need unbiased opinions. Here's the story: (sorry if there's extra details that aren't exactly important)

My roommate (let's call her R) texted the roommate groupchat (there are 4 of us) at 2 because she wants to ""reserve"" the living room for the day. We just set up a Wii yesterday in the living room and one of the roommate's boyfriends is coming over tonight, so I wanted to see if anyone would want to hang out there and play a game or watch something. The only other hang out spot in the apartment is our individual bedrooms. R says she can't focus on homework in her room because she always ends up going to bed, so she wants to study in the living room. There is a library on campus and it's open 24 hours, but she never chooses to go there, partly because she doesn't want to wear her mask for hours at a time and she has an ESA who she doesn't want to leave behind, even though we could watch her. 

I tried to make a compromise with her and said, how about we get to watch one movie/tv episode or play for an hour on the wii? Since it's a common space, it's not fair we can't even be in it. Turns out, she doesn't even want us to be in there talking with one another. I suggested she wear headphones with chill music to block us out, but her headphones bother her so it's a no. 

She thinks it's fair to occupy it for the night because the last few nights she's been in her room and not out here. She tends to occupy the living room a LOT while doing homework/other things, so for the first time the other two roommates and I watched a movie since the living room was empty. 

&amp;#x200B;

What is fair? Should she get the whole living room to herself without compromise? Is it wrong of me to want compromise or wrong of her to ask us to basically stay in our rooms to hang out with each other? She didn't give us a time or anything and it's almost 6 and she still hasn't started her homework. In my opinion, she could have started homework earlier in the day versus wait till evening when that is they time we like to be in the living room.",12Nov2020,1

Im 19/F. Work for a wireless retailer, and I happen to really enjoy the people, the job, and the location. It's been 6 of us so far, which is more than enough, then my boss decided to bring in 2 new people. They're not there yet, but we get lots of traffic. I'm the least experienced, and youngest person there. I get along really well with cowowkers, and have been ok with my hours. But my boss keeps trying to cut them, because I  guess to him I come off as lazy and unproductive. 

He told me that since we are getting 2 new people in, and they lost someone at this other store, he thinks I'd be a good fit because it's more ""my pace"" 

And I 100% do not understand what he means, because I feel like I'm only just getting comfortable, especially when working with customers. And I feel like for somebody who has little experience in sales, that I've consistently been doing a good job. 

He has had a few talks with me about how we are ""sales people"" and we need to go out and bring customers in, that we aren't clerks who just stand around waiting for people to come in. And sometimes we are slow, I feel like that's just part of the job. That we aren't always going to have people coming in for stuff. 

This just sucks because I've worked at the store hes trying to send me too once or twice before, and it was ok, but the area is highly political and so ""dead"" feeling. Like, there's no energy, no exciting or interesting people really. The customers I've encountered in this area have all been older, paranoid, or young entitled brats.

Which isn't bad, its just it's incredibly intimidating to me. 

And idk what I should do because if I stay at my store, I lose hours and money. If I go to the other, it's pretty slow already and they don't get lots of people. And my current home store just literally began to feel like home.

109,"What are people’s experiences with holiday expectations for in-laws - particularly in the U.S. around Thanksgiving?

I always understood the common courtesy to be if you spend a holiday with one of the spouses families / in laws - on say Thanksgiving - you then alternate and spend the next holiday (Christmas) with the OTHER family / in laws? So one year wife’s family Thanksgiving, husbands family Christmas - then alternate the next year.

My specific situation -

In 2018, we spent Thanksgiving Day with my immediate family. The following day (Friday) we hosted with my wife’s immediate family and “re-did” Thanksgiving. My wife’s brother spent the actual holiday with his wife / in-laws.

In 2019, we spent Thanksgiving alone with our 1 year old. The following day (Friday) we hosted with my wife’s immediate family and did Thanksgiving. My wife’s brother spent the holiday with his wife / in-laws.

It’s 2020 and my wife’s brother is again suggesting we host “Thanksgiving” on Friday. This will be the third year we are being asked to host and being asked to celebrate the holiday a second time on Friday.

Am I unreasonable in saying that this is not normal? For me, normal is having the holiday on the holiday itself and sharing hosting - alternating among the families. And if we can’t have the holiday on the holiday, then you pass on that family for the year - not celebrate the holiday a second time on a different day. My wife is adamant my experience is not normal and most families do this - celebrate the holiday multiple times across several days each year to see everyone. To be clear, this isn’t just seeing my in-laws on Friday - it is hosting and doing all the Thanksgiving meals / cooking you would do on Thursday.

There is also very little trust in the relationship with my mother as she thinks I’m a pathological liar due to miscommunications. I’m disgustingly insecure due to extreme bullying and her thinking it was a lie. I haven’t been able to get proper therapy as she believes I ‘don’t need it’ so I’m left to not only cope with my trauma alone - but also these types of fears.

Let me expand - my mum is Eastern European. She has always been cold , strict , verbal and punishment driven. She has since changed however the trauma still stands. She also has pretty unprogressive views. Racism , homophobia, transphobia ect. These are awful buzzwords I hate to associate with her but they’re the facts. So - I ‘came out’ to my mother when I was around  8 (young Ik lmao) and she didn’t miss a beat In calling me disgusting, unnatural ect. I cried and that was that. It was never spoken about again. Whenever homosexual relations come up she always shows distaste and she has a very ‘ idc as long as it’s not MY KID’ attitude. This scares me for if I end up marrying a woman- I know my entire Eastern European side will disown me.Probably my mother too. And that really hurts and is hard to accept. Furthermore - if I do end up marrying the guy I’m dating (wonderful guy btw) then I’m still fucked. She’s seen pictures of him before under the illusion of him being ‘ a mate’ and each time it’s gross , islamophobic comments. Also fun Pakistani slurs.(quite ironic considering my father is a BROWN Latino man- though she did think he was a white guy in a spray tan) 
This means that whoever I end up with I’m fucked. My mother is insanely judgmental. This has actually been a problem in my current romantic relationship and my previous one - as usually both parties want to be able to have a positive relationship with their ‘in laws’ and be liked by their beloveds family. Also family events , celebrations , fuck even if I consider getting married - none of my family will attend.This causes conflict internally with myself and with my boyfriend - as he’s going to be judged and bad mouthed over something he can’t control. It’s also a main factor in me being so unsure of marrying. How pathetic would the wedding be with his family and only one of my friends? And before anyone asks - yes I do communicate with my father and love him dearly however he is in another country and travel is a struggle and a bad omen within his side - especially considering there is a lot of elderly, disabled and babies. Meaning my fathers side travelling will always be out of the question. I also can’t speak to him about these things as he tends to over-share and can’t keep a secret to save his life.


I cannot cut her out especially considering I’m in debt to her for her immigrating here , raising me alone , working unbelievable hours just to get us out of the working class bracket , dealing with my shit ( not always well but it’s the thought that counts) and always making sure I was well fed and warm. The main reason I yearn for success is to be able to give her the money and spend more time with her. But I feel it is a fruitless endeavour - as she’d hate me regardless. 

In conclusion I don’t know how to move on with my life without some clarity.
What are my options for my next steps? 
I just can’t stop thinking about worst case scenarios.",12Nov2020,1
118,"This is going to be so frivolous to so many people, but I don't have many friends, and I don't have anyone to talk to about it. 

My dad and I used to be really close. But when the Trump presidency happened, he started to change a lot. He started getting aggressively right wing and constantly tried to pick fights with me because I am a liberal. It was tolerable the first couple years, but it has gotten bad this year. Like he would never ever call me names before the presidency and this year he started calling me little things like ""dumbass"" and ""idiot."" Well tonight he and i were discussing Biden's gun policies.

I disagreed with him a lot, and he started saying I had ""no intelligence"" and I ""didn't deserve rights"" because I am ""so stupid."" And that really fucking hurt because my dad is my hero and his approval means a lot to me. He deleted me off of Facebook earlier this year because I started a blog about witchcraft, and I deleted the blog so he would be proud of me again. 

The argument escalated by me just saying okay to end the conversation and it got on to how I don't pay for my phone bill and insurance, my parents do. And I said I would as soon as he wanted  me to. And said okay start tomorrow. And I said okay. I was so hurt by the names, I didn't want him paying for my stuff anymore anyway. We all have family credit cards, and he demanded I hand it over to which my mom said was unnecessary but he demanded. I gave it to him and he cut it in half. 

I really don't care about the card at all. I care about the names. Because I love and respect him so much (or I did). But this hurtful behavior has been going on for so long, and I don't know what to do.

122,"So, yo, this will probably be long af. Be warned. I will try to make it as easy to follow as possible although the whole story spans just a little over 20 years.

This friend... We met when we were both still teenagers. He was a friend of a guy I went out with for a while. He has always been super funny, but as a defense mechanism because he had been bullied most of his life. I considered him a good, steadfast friend. And this went on like this for about 3 years.

Then, things at home with my narcissistic dad came to a head and I ran. I went to live in another city (I had already graduated college). My friend surprised me by replying to the mass email I sent to my friends to explain the situation. He was all at once disbelieving, distraught and hilarious. In a nutshell, he expressed that he did not want me to leave. This was my first ever hint that he had other kinds of feelings for me.

I lived in that city for almost a year. I visited over winter break and that's when everything went to shit. I guess I should mention that this was a very dark time in my life. I did not know how to set up boundaries with people or delay any gratification, so i just kinda went with anything that showed up in my path that looked like it might be fun. In this way I smoked pot, slept with a friend's boyfriend, drank WAY too much, etc.

I had a bf at the other city where I lived, but I didn't want to be with him anymore. I got in way too deep and too fast with him though, but he was 9 years older than me and would force himself on me (in more than one way). So when I visited my home town I thought nothing of sleeping with my friend's bf again (I know this is bad, I cringe and feel awful just remembering this).

Now, this guy... THE guy... I confided in him what I had done. I pored my heart out and cried and told him I felt like shit for my behavior. Days later I went on a bender at a small gathering at his place. I blacked out. Only time in my life it has ever happened.

But when I went back to the city where I was living I realized I had feelings for him. Now I don't know exactly how this happened but about 2 months after winter break he finally told me everything in an email. He said he had had feelings for me but that his perfect idea of who I was was crushed when I told him about what I was doing, playing my friend and my boyfriend. Then he told me that night at his house we had kissed, but he felt nothing loving about it, that it was just lust. And that the cincher was that I started screaming out my friend's boyfriend's name.

He never believed I blacked out. He says I was lucid during the whole thing.

Someone hacked into my email account and sent that email to everyone on my contact list. Some posit that he could have done it himself, but since I was working at a middle school back then, I have always suspected it was one of the students who did it.

I did try to make things right with him after my return home, even tried to have a relationship briefly some years later, but he always stood fast by his assertion that he would never be able to look past what had happened. It's still not clear which part he meant. But I did clean up my act and became more responsible in my relationships after that. I never cheated again, and I pretty much allowed myself to believe I was able to love forever thanks to what I had experienced with him.

That's how I managed to compartmentalize this experience and move on. We remained friends. Years later i met the guy who would become my husband.

We lost touch about a year after I got married.

I have been married now for 14 years. I have two kids. I have a home, and two years ago I finally got the job of my dreams. But the cracks in my marriage are starting to deepen and covid just makes it that much worse.

So I find my mind trailing back to the memory of my friend. Then, almost like I had summoned him, I met him in the street, said hi, did a 5-minute catch-up and I mean... People were staring. Said bye, hugged, held hands for a second longer than should have been comfortable.

About a month into quarantine I started RELENTLESSLY dreaming about him. Nothing sexual, I am just very emotionally starved. I have been to therapy over this.

This guy and I connected again over a funeral, of all things. A mutual friend passed away. I organized a zoom meeting with all the old friends and he was as funny as ever, seemed very animated, I was happy to see him and get back in touch.

But ever since then, as I tried to just strike up casual online conversation, I feel like he's distancing himself again. I don't want to impose myself on him, but I do want him back in my life.

Now with all this at once, I find myself falling into a depression. Part of me wants to die. Part of me wants to go back in time and fix things. Part of me just wants my friend back. Most of me does not know what the hell I want.

But the big question is, although he's acting aloof, should I try to keep in touch with him? I want to know if he still thinks I was lying all those years ago. I have no idea what the f*ck for, but I do.

I also wanna know if anyone with psych experience could posit if this is just honest and straight forward, or if I'm using him as a diversion from the mental load and floundering relationship with my husband, as it currently stands.

123,"My little brother is 17, a senior in HS, and is depressed and very anxious. To lay ground work, he is youngest of 4 and home alone (the rest of us have graduated college and are living far away), my parents are....much to say the least. Our mom knows no boundaries and he gets yelled at all the time to do chores, stop playing his video games, etc. He has friends but he’s not the most popular person. I know that’s irrelevant, especially when you get older, but at that age it feels like everything. Because of all of this, he also has low self esteem. He is very very smart, so creative, handsome, and funny. Our home town is very cliquey and if you’re not incredibly loaded your deemed a “loser”, we are a middle class family. Applying to colleges on top of it is a lot of stress, my parents aren’t really the most helpful with navigating that. He and his first girlfriend just broke up as well..she broke up with him and it hit him hard. 

I check in with him, I make sure I tell him he’s loved and I’m here for him. I have been helping him with college (had him make a list of schools he wants to go to, app deadlines, essay requirements, cost for apps, etc). And I follow up with him on it and set deadlines. I went home and hung out with him and talked to him through his break up and check in. I reassure him his feelings are validated and it sucks being in the position that he’s in right now. I remind him he’s strong and things will get better and even though the journey is tough, he’s not alone. I am not sure what else to do. I see him post the most heartbreaking and depressing things and I am so scared he’s going to take his life. I know how emotionally taxing it is to be 17...let alone in pandemic.

127,"My SA got so bad during these recent years to the point where even going outside my house gave me panic attacks. I can't hold jobs because of it. I eventually had enough of dealing with it myself and I went to therapy. I have been seeing this therapist for three months now, once every two weeks for 15-20 mins and I'm so incredibly disappointed with my decision. For one, this therapist doesn't quite recognize my social anxiety and blames it on depression and low self-esteem because of my weight. I do agree that my weight has an influence on my mental health but it isn't the sole instigator of my SA. Plus, I don't think I have depression at all. 

For my treatment, my therapist has me journaling and she's very insistent on me talking to my family about my feelings despite me telling her that this doesn't do anything for me. I have been journaling since I was nine years old and while it does help calm me down, it doesn't do shit for my social anxiety. Neither does talking to my family about it. We haven't done any more kinds of therapy. I leave the sessions really frustrated because it's always the same thing and I haven't made any progress at all. I still deal with severe social anxiety. I still have panic attacks. I still can't answer the phone or pay for groceries to the cashier.

Hey, [F17] I’ve been in a really toxic relationship before. The other person was really manipulative and toxic. At first, he didn’t seem like that at all. He was genuine and nice, but then suddenly after a few months everything about his personality changed. He changed. He called me out and insulted me, he couldn’t control his anger, he even touched me in particular places without asking and when i told him to stop, he didn’t listen, he never did. This happened more than once. He eventually also ‘raped’ me while we were still in the relationship (i clearly said no over and over again and pushed him away but he kept going and i froze out of anxiety). But that’s not even the main problem. My problem is, right now i am in a new relationship with this amazing guy (for abt 6months now), and i really love him, but the damage the last guy left hasn’t been fixed yet. I don’t even know what a healthy relationship is supposed to be and feel like. I still got issues with commitment, trust and showing love, because i’m scared things are gonna end up like they did before. I know this guy is a completely different person, but still. The first guy also didn’t seem to be like this in the beginning, but after a few months it turned out he was. What if it’s gonna be the same? I feel and think all of these things, but i know it’s not fair towards this guy i’m dating rn. 

Also, before the relationship with the guy who ‘raped’ me, i was in another one with someone who eventually also touched me without consent and made me feel very anxious...

136,"**PREFACE/HISTORY**

I handed in my resignation today at a company I've been employed with for 3 years.

In the course of my employment with this company, I have taken on the responsibilities of two other employees that resigned, with no commensurate improvements to pay or other working conditions to match.

I work a position that involves managing a SQL database, and software development work for multiple different programs used by the company. This includes supporting users who have difficulty with the applications we code for.

When I applied to this job they promised I wouldn't be working any general helpdesk cases, I would only be supporting matters tied to the software I was working on, which was a step up from my prior job that had me spread thin over a bunch of users for every little issue. With the drop of two other employees, helpdesk responsibilities were transferred to me and left for me to handle for 2.5 years.

As is typical with a helpdesk experience, the users have not been the best to work with.

More responsibilities were also heaped on along with these workload growths, and my boss constantly pressured me to meet deadlines that seemed impossible for the sheer amount of things I was being asked to keep track of.

I expressed this issue over my time with this company on multiple occasions, but on each occasion the boss would say ""Well that's just how it is working in IT"" and it would be brushed aside. Today I felt I'd had enough, and handed in my resignation.

**TODAY**

I received a call from the company owner after turning in my resignation offering to (eventually) onboard someone to handle the helpdesk, and to (eventually) shift me to responsibilities more in keeping with what I originally got hired on for once we have the new person. He also promised an eventual pay increase with that change in responsibilities.

He also said during the conversation, ""You don't know what you're getting with another company or its promises. You know us, and should stay here to continue your career's growth"".

I've been given until tomorrow to decide on whether or not to take the offer.

I'm torn on whether to leave this work environment that has been toxic, or to stay in the hopes that all the promises come to pass before I've had more than I can stomach again.

&amp;#x200B;

138,"So my entire life (24 yrs) people have mistakenly believed me to be black due to a dark complexion and my hair texture/appearance. The first instance was when I was 4 or 5 and my mom took me to my dads work for some reason and he got a call from a co-worker saying his wife and ""some black kid"" were in the lobby wanting to see him. It continued throughout my childhood. Teachers asking me for my take on different black issues etc. I always just kind of laughed it off and didn't correct them because I assumed the vast majority of people thought I was white. It was only in the last year that I really started to question this. First I got a job in a new state and it became clear within 2 weeks due to a variety of comments/incidents (nothing negative) that all my co-workers thought I was black. Second when I got laid off due to COVID and went back to my hometown for a bit, I was hanging out with someone who I went to high school with. I wasn't super close with him back then but I did play football with him all through middle and high school and he didn't know I was white until I told him just 5 months ago. That was kind of the lightbulb moment where I realized this was way more an issue than I thought it was.

I started seeing  a new girl, from a different state. We've already visited each other multiple times. She's offered for me to love with her rent-free. Problem is, she's in another state. So I don't know if I'd be able to make money in time. I don't want her to resent me if I somehow couldn't find a job in reasonable time.


I have the option of staying where I live, no commute, living alone, in a small apodment making enough money to save every month. But risk my relationship with someone I do love who loves me as well.

Or, move in with my new girlfriend, who is in a completely different city and state, rent-free.I'd have no job, only 3k in savings, with bills that still need to be paid. I'd be with someone who loves and supports me though, who already has a stable living situation. And has acknowledged the realities of my situation. 

What would you do? I'm torn.

One path sounds very safe, secure but an awful, lonely grind. The other path sounds exciting, a new start, but risky as fuck.",12Nov2020,1
142,"I hate sucking up to teachers. But right now I feel like I really should. We had 3 tests and 3 Homeworks in quarter 1. Our next test/homework submission is the schoolday after the quarter ends. He is a traditional teacher (a catholic brother) who sticks to his 80% test weighting. However, I have an 89.17% in the class and I need to get 0.28% up to get an A- (big difference between a 3.5 and a 3.75). Should I ask him to count the homework due in quarter 2 to count for quarter 1 (grades don't have to be finalized until 7 days after the quarter closes)? This would likely give me an A- in the class. I just worry about the repercussions of asking him this (embarrassment, he changes it for everyone, i seem petty, i seem like I'm treating his class like a game, etc)",12Nov2020,1
143,"Hi all, a little back story: I spent a good portion of my formative years and adulthood drinking and partying (15 years approx. since I was sixteen). As a result, this lead to a significant portion of my identity being defined by those habits, which also meant being in an inebriated state was and is the only way I feel comfortable enough to socialise with people. 

Cut to where I’m at now: I’ve put that lifestyle behind me, in my 30s and focusing on my health and aiming to take another shot at my education part-time. I’m excited for the most part, but also quite worried, as I have nothing to offer in the way of intellectually stimulating or humorous conversation when sober. I’d like to be able to engage with my prospective class mates in a meaningful way, but fear that I may turn to drink and whatever else to compensate for a lack of substance/wit. 

My friends have long since out grown me, starting families and what not, so I don’t really have a non-judgemental social circle within which I can practice my socialisation skills free of alcohol and drugs; reconnecting with them is also not an option as I fear the combination of nostalgia and seeing them living the kind of life I wish I had will have me stumbling back to old habits. 

I know that, ultimately, my only choice is to man up, take the dive, and use will power to fend off old demons. Nevertheless, any advice - or even anecdotes if you’ve gone through something similar - would go a long towards helping me develop a foundation for me to build on. 

I apologise for prattling on (it’s my first time posting on this sub) and thank you in advance for taking the time to respond. Hope you’re all staying safe out there during these crazy times :)

TLDR: I’m looking to rebuild my personality after over a decade of hindering myself with alcohol and drugs.",12Nov2020,1

I was really drunk last night at a “party” and I think I was assaulted but idk what it was? I opened up to a few friends about it and they said it was and said they wanted to take me to the police but I didn’t ...

I was drunk and the guy wasn’t but he said he wanted to hook up and I went along with it and then not long after he got my clothes off I changed my mind and asked if we could stop and he said no not until I’m finished and tried to push him off of me ... then he kept going for a while but I agreed at first to do it . It doesn’t seem like it was although it sounds like it but I gave consent at first .. please help 

My other friend that was there last night said it wasn’t and that I am ruining his life and she said to forget about it ....

147,"Excuse my English please, I’m not a native speaker. 

I’m 22 and he is 21. We have been friends for like 6 years and our friendship means a lot to me. 

He was always drinking a bit more than he should, but I never noticed how serious it is. Every social event became an opportunity to drink for him, it didn’t matter what kind of event it was. When we went on a night out he would get so drunk, he couldn’t remember much and had long blackouts. He also had bad hangovers, so he would drink the other day after a night out, so he wouldn’t get sober. I’ve never noticed these things until now. 

It became more serious when he started drinking alone at home. He started feeling ashamed for drinking and he was hiding bottles from me our friends. For example he started drinking tea, but only because he was putting rum in it. This way he could drink and nobody noticed. One time we went on a trip and he asked me to stop at a gas station. I thought he needs to use the toilet, but he bought a small bottle and quickly drank it before he got back to us (we never noticed he got drunk, he admitted to it later). He also lost his driving license because he was driving drunk. He also hid bottles in his room, so his roommate wouldn’t find out. 

Right now it’s pretty serious and he’s drinking like every other day. He admitted it and knows he has a problem, but refuses to do something about it.  I never noticed how serious it is, because he is doing well at his job and overall he’s pretty productive. We are also really young and I never thought you can be an alcoholic at this age. I’d really like to help him but I don’t know how. I doubt he would give up alcohol completely and that he would attend some therapy sessions or something like that. How can I help him?",12Nov2020,1

It began as I was heading into middle school and since then, i've totally changed because of it.  I consider myself a clean person, I shower everyday,  I brush my teeth daily,  and as a whole if you were to see me you would think im a clean person. On the other hand, I suffer from an extremely sweaty butt and it reeks.  It can be smelled \[no joke\] from like 20 feet away and I don't know how that's possible lol.  I am 5'6 and around 150 pounds, a bit overweight, but not obese or anything.  my diet is not too good, and i've become not physically active whatsoever.

Personally, I use toilet paper and gold bond powder every time i go out to keep it somewhat regulated and it somewhat works, but its still easily noticeable and the smell could be smelled by other people easily.  I wipe my ass well, and usually over-wipe since when i was younger i was never taught how to properly wipe.  I went to a doctor and said that my back had been way more sweaty than usual, but they just said ok and didn't care.  I really dont know what to do and this sucks a lot.

155,"Fairly new to reddit, so let me know if I need to add anything/did something wrong. TL;DR at bottom because I realized I made this way longer than I expected to.

My first name is Anastasia (pronounced a-nuh-STAY-zhuh), but since birth I have gone by Ana, and honestly most of my life I've only even had to correct people on the spelling (Ana vs Anna). However, starting around when I graduated high school (I'm early 20s now) I've had to deal with more people pronouncing or spelling my name wrong.

The majority of the time it's the common Ana/Anna issue (both spelling and pronouncing it ah-nah), but I've also been called Anne, Annie, Hannah, and other variations. Now, I'm not the assertive type, so normally if someone makes a mistake with my name, I politely correct them maybe once or twice and then I guess I expect them to care enough to remember? This, while is annoying, doesn't bother me as long as it's overcome and they remember my name correctly.

My main issue is with people who I've corrected, and who have known me for awhile, and STILL either misspell or mispronounce my name. One of my grandparents addresses my cards as ""Anna"". Sometimes my friends or people I text spell it that way too, and sometimes my name is in the text they're replying to! Literally, one person said that they like ah-nuh better because it sounds ""so much prettier than **ANN**\-uh"". At my last job, two of my coworkers would always switch back and forth between pronunciations because they kept forgetting which I go by (granted, there was an 'ah-nuh' that worked there sometime before me and she was even more anal about her name). Frankly, I'm tired of having to correct people Every. Single. Time. And I've begun to resent my name.

But! I absolutely love my middle name. It is also a little different with the spelling than the ""standard"" version (just one less letter because my mom doesn't like double consonants) so I would still have to correct spelling sometimes, but I love how it's spelled either way so I don't really mind.

**My question is though:** **is it worth it to try to change the name I go by when I'm already in my 20s?**

Thankfully we just moved to a different area, so it is possible for any new acquaintances to call me that, but it would be a hassle to get all the people who already know me to call me differently. And I'm not actually too worried about that as long as they say my name right! (Which, is it too much to expect that from people? I know I make a pointed effort to remember how to spell/pronounce other peoples' names, but maybe that stems from my own pet peeve about my name). My mom says I shouldn't worry about it and pointed out how many people DO say/spell my name right, but honestly I'm just so done at this point and I've started hating my name and I cringe every time it's said or spelled wrong.

**So, should I find better ways to handle my first name, or should I start going by my middle name, which I love but could also potentially end me up in the same spelling issues, as well as confusion and more hassle, and how should I go about doing either?**

**TL;DR** Tired of people mispronouncing and misspelling my name (Ana 'a-nuh'), should I starting going by my middle name (which has its own possible spelling issue and could cause confusion in the future) or just deal with it the rest of my life?

156,"Hi all,

Full disclosure: I was browsing the top posts here, and saw the one about the interview of the grandfather who was about to pass away for the father. One of my girlfriend's relatives recently passed away, and seeing this post inspired me: why not do one of these interviews with her relatives now? Unfortunately, they're not getting any younger, and I could hold onto them until it's time to give them to her (which is hopefully a long way off).

My first question is: how on Earth do I go about bringing something like this up? Do I just tell them ""I want this for Sage once it's time?"" Should I be more vague, or come up with an alternative story? Would this request seem weird and morbid, or sweet?

Secondly is logistics. I currently probably wouldn't want to see them in person, given COVID. Should I do the interview over Zoom and just record it, or wait? Also, in the offchance that we break up (god forbid), I would still want her to have the recordings, but maybe a version where I can't be heard. Is it a good idea to make two recordings?

157,"TL;DR: I don’t really like BM and BW as a BM. And I hate that I feel that way. I think it’s bc of my past experience with BM (harassment, cat calling, etc.) and my retail job (since a lot of retailers or lowkey racist)

And I don’t want to feel this way. I hate feeling this way! There was a point in time (relatively recently) that my main preference were black men (since I’m a black woman) all of my friends are POC (including black guys, I love them to death though). 

I think I feel this way because a lot of my most traumatic/annoying cat calling experiences have all been with black men. I’ve been followed, harassed, etc. all by my own people, even at my job. It’s even reached a point where I look at a black guy coming in at work and think “oh yeah he’s definitely gonna cause me trouble by trying to flirt with me” and usually I’m right. I sometimes get these thoughts about black women (such as myself) and I don’t like it!! Like “Look at this black woman coming up here, ugh go away”. I think it’s because there’s a lot of racism in the retail business, and it’s lowkey rubbed off on me because before I got my job I never acted like this.

What makes me most angry at myself is because... I’m a firm supporter in BLM (ironic right?) and I really do believe that police officers do hold a prejudice against us black folk and a lot of people try to knock our culture by calling it ghetto but then try to copy it? SMH

I’m a 21 year old female and my boyfriend is 23 years old. He lives with two roommates, both of who almost never leave the house because they work from home and they might not have friends. Either that or they don’t like to hang out with their friends. I don’t judge. I used to be like that in high school.

Recently, one roommate, “Peter”, told my bf that the thought of my bf and I sleeping in the same bed made him super horny and he wanted to watch porn. He’s religious and thinks porn is sinful. That comment made my bf uncomfortable and when my bf told me about it, I became uncomfortable. 

I still live with my parents and my dad hates my bf, so every time we hang out, it’s either at the mall or some store or his house. When we don’t wanna risk being exposed to the virus, he hang at his house.

Today my bf told me that his roommates don’t want me at their house without my bf being there because it’s “uncomfortable.” On very few occasions, my bf made a quick trip to the store while I stayed behind because I was too tired to go to the store. I was kinda annoyed and angry they implied I made things uncomfortable. Especially after what Peter said. Maybe I’m being selfish but I feel like I should be the only one uncomfortable. I don’t go out of my way to annoy his roommates, and if I do they never talk to me about it. Any problems they have with me, they just tell my bf about it. Whenever I’m there I keep to myself and stay out of their way. If they say something to me, I answer. I don’t wanna be mean or rude since it’s partly their house and I’m a guest. 

I just want to spend time with my bf but at the same time I don’t wanna be around his roommates. I’ve been thinking of possible alternatives for places to hang out. I’m currently still upset and I wanna calm down and have some ideas before I bring this up to my bf.

I thought about hanging in a hotel/motel room. No too expensive.

I thought about hanging at the store.
Not expensive but I don’t wanna keep being around strangers who may have covid.

\-stick to the text given (but only the text against homosexuality was given)

i cried and went to the counselor (Mrs. M). she was upset, and took my reading to the dean of student life. Mr. H was talked to and told to tread carefully. There are 4 queer kids in the class including myself, with 9 kids in the class. Mr. H knows this.

Tuesday, we discussed. Again, he took lead of the discussion and went on his ""gay is not ok"" tangent. I believe this was unacceptable behavior and went with another girl in the class to Mrs. M. She brought in the head of the upper school (Mr. S) and we talked over what happened with him. He was mad and said it was a terrible thing to do, and that the school will look into it. Long story short, Dr. Howard is being investigated and in deep trouble. All of the other teachers are mad triggered, and the student body is aflame with this.

Today he came to class with a fake apology, playing the victim. In it, he addresses the tension and gives some sort of “apology”, but it wasn’t really seeming to be a real one. He says he was hurt by people not coming directly to him for the controversies, yet seems to not realize we feel uncomfortable going to someone who disagrees with our entire existence. He also said although he doesn’t agree, he tries to vouch for us and wouldn’t let anyone use slurs or be hurtful- but he compared us to ad\*lterers and inc\*st. I sent Mrs. M an email with a recording of the apology/class today **(she asked me to)** and a *long* statement of the situation, stating I believe this is hypocritical, offensive, and unacceptable for the director of diversity to do. However, I feel bad since he genuinely believes he didn't do anything hurtful and he shouldn't have to apologize for his opinion.

177,"Hello,

I’ve unfortunately been suspended from my university course for a year as a form of disciplinary action. However, I would like to become a solicitor which consists of further study in the UK (either LPC or SQE). Does anyone know whether this would be jeopardised at all?

178,"This is long and full of probably unnecessary info so there's a TLDR at the bottom cause my brain is like a squirrel on cocaine lol...

I'm in my late 20's I have 3 kids and my husband became disabled a few years ago, when he was working we lived in a rather affordable area and husband had a good job so we were pretty comfortable, nothing fantastic but comfortable. I have lots of mental b.s. so I was just the stay at home mom and would sometimes watch other kids or do seasonal jobs to help with money.
Well his disability got worse and he lost his good paying job and then a few jobs after that, we agreed I was going to have to try and find a job and he woukd stay home. My first job fired me because i had to keep taking days to take care of him my second job was more understanding but I had to deal with a lot of sexual harrassment there, then I lost our house, because even working every extra hour there was I just couldnt keep up with bills. 
We moved to another state at my husbands doc's suggestion saying he needed to try marijuana, so we moved in with my inlaws, that was like...3 years ago 😬 
I cant afford our own place, I couldnt in an affordable area, but this quadruple parenting is draining my soul and its not an understanding enviroment to 'talk it out' 

So heres the thing I want to do better, I want to take care of my family and not rely on every person around me to prop us up, buuut I am an imbecile. I have tried college 3 times 
the first time I got repressed memories back, became borderline agoraphobic, and refused to leave my bedroom for 3 months aside from when I snuck into the shower at 3am
The second time there was a nursing course homework I did pretty decent but when it came to memorizing like the codes and stuff I failed every single time no matter how hard I tried. I eventually had a breakdown and left after I was told my scores were going to get me kicked from the program.
Then this last time, ugh this last time. I had teachers that mocked my mental illnesses, a class that left me sobbing each day because I just couldnt understand the lessons, then I was told that the program helping me pay was out of funding and I had to leave again. I found that I love psychology but that was really the only plus.

Right now I work at an awful store where the manager keeps playing with my hours and throwing me into panic attacks, constantly implying I'm going to be fired but never intending to according to my other manager. I want more but all I can ever seem to get are cashier jobs that wont go anywhere. I know there are things you can get certified for but idk what I Should go for we live like an hour from any certifying school so I wanna make sure I'm not wasting more money. 
Idk what I want to do, dont really know what I like, all ive been for the last 11 years is a mom and I guess I just dont know anything about myself as stupid as that sounds lol
All I do know is I suck at math and I am horribly socially awkward, not...super helpful when looking for a future 😅 

TLDR 
I'm an idiot who wants advice on what I should do with my future and all I got to go on is I'm bad at math and bad with people🙃",12Nov2020,1
179,"This requires some backstory, but I'll try to keep it short. About two and a half months ago, I started school again. This was completely in person, full-time, and I had been having tons of arguments with my parents about it (and other things as well). Basically, with the pandemic going on, my parents were at their wit's end and just wanted my sister and me out of the house. I got to the point where I was trying really hard not to cry in school, and there was the final straw where the only friend I had at lunch requested to get moved out of my lunch section. 

At this point, I was doing really badly. Like, I just was not handling it well. So I decided to reach out to my favorite teacher from last year because he was the only adult I trusted enough to talk to about this stuff. This was my first time reaching out to anyone, and it was the scariest thing I had ever done. I never expressed anything crazy, just that I was feeling super frustrated and I was having a hard time dealing with everything. My teacher was super understanding, and talking to him really helped while I was able to.

But four days later, on Monday, August 31st, I got called down to the office. Someone from last year had reported me for saying (before the pandemic) that I was going to commit su*cide if I didn't get a response from this particular teacher. (The report also consisted of the notion that I thought of this teacher as more of a friend than a superior.) This was an absolute lie; I never said or thought any of that. But during that week, because I had reached out to this teacher, they decided that this was a problem and they went through a huge investigation, the results of which I was never privy to. I know that they never found anything ""bad"" on my or my teacher's end because ultimately the report was false, but the ""friend"" who had switched lunches decided that because she was also friends with the person who reported me, that she would back her up and confirm the report. 

Basically, in this time that I had needed to reach out to someone the most, and finally did so for the first time, I was immediately told that doing so was a bad thing, that reaching out to this teacher was ""inappropriate"", and that I should have reached out to someone I had never known or talked to before (my counselor). The first day that this happened, I was absolutely humiliated. They read what I had written to my teacher reaching out to him *in front of me*. I hadn't meant for a complete stranger to read that, and that was the most I had ever shared with anyone. 

My counselor continued to humiliate me through making me tell him about everything going on at home (all stuff I wasn't willing to share). Too much happened for me to explain, but he kept comparing my relationships (not just with my teacher) to abusive ones, which he was way outside of his rights to do. What was probably the most humiliating of all, is that I had texted my best friend (not the lunch person) to meet with me to talk to me, and they saw me texting her and told me I needed to stop. ""You shouldn't be reaching out to your teachers or your friends, you should be reaching out to me."" That's what my counselor said. At the end of the day, instead of letting me meet with my friend, he *escorted me to my dad's car* to make sure I couldn't contact my friend. At this point, I had been crying nonstop, and I hadn't been able to eat.

For over a week, I went to school and couldn't eat because my stomach was so upset. For the past two and a half months, I haven't had a single day where I didn't break down and cry at the end of it before I go to sleep. I have been moved to distance learning, and my parents have been surprisingly supportive through this situation, but my focus and motivation are almost completely gone. Every time someone mentions the situation, I freeze up and start shaking, especially if my counselor's name is mentioned. I just can't hold it together. I've never felt this way before, and things are way worse than when I reached out the first time. I don't trust my parents enough to tell them I want to start therapy, and I'm literally never alone enough to make a call without them knowing. I'm not allowed to reach out to my teachers about this (and they wouldn't be able to know about the situation anyway). My only support is from that one friend I have, but I can't put everything on her. I don't know how I can reach out even though I literally start *shaking* when this situation is mentioned. 

How do I reach out without my parents knowing, and to someone I can actually trust?",12Nov2020,1

181,"This post got removed from r/AITA for appearing to “ask for advice”, and then it got removed from r/relationship_advice for appearing to “ask for moral judgment.” Well. It will probably not last long on here either but ... 

(My boyfriend has been super nice for the last week, so I’m really upset about this. This fight occurred as I was giving him a nighttime massage. I got so annoyed partway through that I stopped massaging him.)

The conversation from earlier, that I apparently misremembered, was about my plans for the next day. I’m pretty sure I said something else, and I tried to explain that that’s what happened (which is kinda like arguing I guess), but I admitted that guess I miscommunicated, or we both misunderstood, and I eventually apologized. But he was still angry because he says Im “fucked up”, I always confuse him and “fuck with his head” and “pretend I don’t remember saying something.” I got annoyed at this because if he says I’m pretending, that means he’s accusing me of lying. He then kind of backed up on that and said he doesn’t think I’m lying .... so i guess it’s just that my memory is just really shitty and he’s mad about that. I was not deliberately messing with him, or pretending, or anything ... I just have a shit memory. He also claimed later that he never said I was “fucked up”, just my memory.

But then I listened to the recording I secretly took. He says it right at 3:17 of this clip. https://vocaroo.com/1byklM2U5mC2
(I’m in a one-party consent state) 

In the clip, if you listen to the end, he also denies calling me crazy for another moment of confusion a few hours ago (in a serious way, not the other, joking “crazy” he said right before bed). But.... I *remember* that he called me crazy — I specifically remember him using that word because I felt a little insulted by it.  This was an earlier incident. He said with a serious face “you’re crazy” because I didn’t understand something he meant, and got confused. (And apparently that means I’m crazy.) 

In the style of AITA, I think I may be the asshole because of his frustration at feeling like I “flipped the switch” on him and said I said something that was different from what he remembered. No wonder he felt like I was going back on what I’d said and messing with his head. I can see why he would be angry. 

On the other hand, I think I may not be the asshole because, essentially, he was mad at me for being confused and forgetting, and that’s not really within my control, is it? Or should I take more steps to see if my memory is damaged, and go to the doctor? (He suggested this). AITA for resisting slightly and saying I shouldn’t have to go? And AITA for secretly recording our conversation? I haven’t told him I recorded it, and I don’t think I will.",12Nov2020,1
182,"TLDR at the bottom!! 

Hello!! This situation is a little tricky for me because I think he thought of out first meet up was a date. 

I met this guy on a dating site and I recognized him from my elementary school years. I swiped right and we matched! We reminisced about our school years and I really enjoyed talking to him. Things went relatively well. We have a lot in common and very similar taste music and views. 

Our first meet up and it was great. **But** afterwards when we set up another meet up he flaked out on me :/. I can understand. This sort of thing happens and perhaps it was situational so I suggested another day. He said “okay” and I thought we’d meet again. But he missed the day again....

He said “my bad” and I told him it was fine But if he wanted to meet, he would have to set it up. Since then he stopped talking to me. 

I’m wondering if he thought I was trying to pursue him romantically eventhough our conversations were completely platonic.

This happened roughly 2 months ago but I still see him pop up on social media. I thought we had a good time and I want to be his friend. I’m thinking about asking him why he stopped talking to me, and telling him I want to be friends. Possibly hang out soon. 

Is this a good idea? If so how should I go about talking to him? Or should I just move on like I have been :( 

TLDR: Elementary friend I met again on a dating site ghosted me 2 months ago. Is it because he thought it was a date? I just wanted to be friends and am wondering if I should reach out and talk things out.

184,"Sorry for it being so long part of me is just venting aswell

So I've been with this girl for nearing 3 years now. At first it was fun and cool. But a year passed an I realized how unhealthy our relationship was. We both had completely dropped all relations with any friends essentially. I had shorted my family big time and pretty much dedicated 100% of time and efforts and dare I say all my money 😩 towards her. Weve had very big ups and downs.


Her: if you interested in who she it to understand my perspective

She has very unstable and very unhealthy home life her mother has raised her, her entire life to depend on her and nobody else and practically let her make her own decisions as a kid she went and hang out with 28 year old meth heads and learn from your decisions as a 13 year old what a fantastic mother no foot down ever. They have no family other than her sister who's a piece of work as well I dont even wanna get into. Shes raised by her mother essentially no unconditional love, shell drop you and treat you like shit if you dont give back for ever step she takes. Always makes deals like I'll cook dinner if you clean the house but if not starve. Her mother drinks very often hammered drunk blasting music from 10pm to 4 in the morning, she tells her to turn it down and she says it's her house no. Been dealing with this since she was a small child. Nowhere to turn or anything. 

So I cant stand being there with her anymore everytime I show up there it's always feels like I'm doing something wrong constantly shes always digging into everything i do searching for something to argue with me about to make me solidify I love her. Childish love still, always trying to fucking cuddle, constant I love yous, do you love me, come lay with me. Jesus it's annoying. Over time I've become a support figure for her while I try to take care of myself in such unstable household I take of her. She depends on me, and literally cant live without me and its scary and I dont like it. Shes talked about killing herself If I'm gone cause she hates her mother and has no career path or anything no ability to take care of herself which I also cant stand shes made 0 progress since our time in high school till now 2 years later. I argued with her today and literally mentioned leaving because I didnt wanna argue with her about her ""feelings"" anymore and she starts shuddering and shaking because shes scared I'm gonna leave and cant handle it. I'm always being digged into after a long day at work she makes everything about herself. 



-----

 She needs to be around me every single day. I barely see my friends anymore, i barely see my family anymore, i dont even tell anybody i ever got back with her because I've broken up with her so many times I just leave it out because its honestly embarrassing to be in such a childishly possessive relationship. 

Weve spent so much close time together that even I have grown to ""need"" her around, but I wouldnt extend myself to her ends of making threats of killing herself and such. She recently cut herself and stabbed herself after her mother abused her new puppy and kicked her out of the house and threatened to call the cops after she tried to yell at her about it. Which worries me more I couldnt live with myself knowing she did soemthing like that because of me. 

I feel so damn stuck, I'm fucking 19 and I should be living it up with all my friends, saving money in my awesome paying job, throwing parts at my project car being a damn young adult with minimal responsibilities. Instead I'm held back to the highest extent due to her and leaving seems to be so god damn hard I cant do that to her I'm literally all she has and after spending almost 3 years almsot every single day with her idk how I'd hold up personally. I hate it when I'm with her but I hate it when were broken up.",12Nov2020,1

And today, she mentioned that she spent the day with her boyfriend. To be honest, I was talking with her to try to start a relationship; I never said I wanted to be friends, but she probably assumed. So where do I go from here? I kind of want to explain it and let her take it from there, but my brother says that's a bad idea and to go silent until she replies back.

A couple things that's stand out in my mind was sometimes when I was screwing the gutter to the facia board, I woild miss the flashing, and then have to screw another hole. I remember my britehr catching me do that a couole times, and he just put some caulking on the hole. I think that's what I did too when he wasn't around. Maybe It didn't even happen when he wasnt around idk. 

Also, before you put the downspouts on, you have to screw the straps onto the siding. If you dont hold the strap tight enough when you drill it in, it will spin around  like a propeller. That happened to me a few times. It just terrifies me, because im afraid  I damaged fhe siding, and somehow water got into the house. I vaguely remember making a tiny scratch on the siding, but i could be wrong. I know i often scratched fje downspouts itself, so i could be confusing the 2.

197,"**TL;DR:** My mom believes she knows better than experts on COVID-related countermeasures. I've written a 1700-word ""essay"" e-mail designed to refute the opinions she's stated over the past 6 months, focusing on the effects on mortality rates, healthcare systems, and the economy. I'm torn over whether to shut my mouth and let it lie or say something, as her comments are making me uncomfortable and anxious. She is otherwise fairly sane: hates Trump, appreciates Biden, loves logic and reasoning, worships the Four Horseman of Atheism, has come to see my reasons for my hatred of Jordan Peterson, etc. Should I send the e-mail, or should I just nut up, suppress my anxiety in the small moments where she expresses these odd opinions, and continue on?  
&amp;nbsp;     

My mom is firmly in the camp of ""let the older people die, so that younger people can live."" She thinks the 10 week full shutdown and staged opening that we've had here in Ontario, Canada was drastic as it was, and the fact that experts were calling for an even longer shutdown appalling. I could go on but the gist is, her opinion is ""experts don't know what they're talking about, the healthcare industry is struggling really hard, and a shutdown will only increase the struggle overall.""  

This is against all the data I've been able to find. I've spent the last 3 hours researching and everything points to a longer shutdown being good for the economy, and being good for the overall health of society as well as healthcare support systems. I have sources for everything. I'm even willing to have a recourse, a back and forth on her concerns, and I've said as much in the e-mail I have sitting in my Drafts. But the meat of the e-mail is discussing points she's brought up over the 6 months that I just straight don't agree with.  

However, the e-mail is long. **1700 words** to explain why I believe her opinion to be wrong. That's a lot, even by my long-winded standards.  

The reason I want to send it is because her comments make me genuinely uncomfortable, for one main reason: she expects me to agree with her. Her body language and tone of voice every time she says stuff like this (weekly basis) indicate that she believes her opinion is correct, and that she expects me to agree. In the rare case (2-3 times) where I've disagreed, she gets distraught.  

So, I try my best to avoid the argument: smile, nod, and change the subject. BUT, I fucking *hate it* when people do that to me. I even ghosted a friend over his irritating ability to avoid every conversation he found even remotely unpleasant (among other things). So I feel like a giant hypocrite if I don't reach out, and there is *nothing* worse than a hypocrite (in my worldview, anyway).

198,"I’m a 16 yo male. I was deprived of love from my father and verbally assaulted by him as a young boy, so I now crave love. To the point that I’ll constantly daydream about being in a relationship with someone who truly cares. However, as I am slightly overweight, have skin conditions, and a not so good personality, I don’t see that happening anytime soon. 

My friends, however, seem to be just fine. They’ll come up to me and gush about their S/O. Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad to hear them speak. But whenever they talk about their love, I get depressed and jealous. Sometimes I’ve even broke down and cried cause I felt so sorry for myself. For example, just about an hour ago, I jokingly told my female friend “fuck you” and she said “I have [boyfriend’s name] for that”. And for some reason that killed my mood. I just got so damn sad that I haven’t experienced that bond with someone and everyday it pains me so. 

I fucking hate how I have to come ask for help on this. It’s embarrassing that I just can’t get over it, but since I’m here, what can I do? I need to stop craving love so much and I want to be able to talk to my friends without getting jealous",12Nov2020,1
199,I live with my aunt in a small apartment and her son has been staying with us due to losing his job because of covid. Recently his sister had been staying over with her child. She is having relationship issues with her boyfriend and they are currently in court for custody of the child. It started with her getting a restraining order against him for choking her. Shes been staying with us for several months since then. The whole time sitting around buying shit off amazon for herself with her boyfriend's money. She does not pay to feed the child. She does not contribute anything. Everyone else is paying to feed her and her kid. She does not even watch her own kid and goes off to party with friends almost every day. She even took a personal vacation two months ago and left the child with us to watch for two weeks. This last week she got into an argument with her brother because she was verbally abusing my aunt. The next morning after the argument she beat my aunt while she was sleeping with a bag full of groceries from the refrigerator then she left for a few days. Two nights ago she came back like nothing ever happened and nobody said anything. She went to court the next day and her bf went and got a good lawyer. I came home from work that day and she was in my room waiting to beg me to pay for her lawyer. I told her no. The next day I got home from work and my aunt was sitting in the couch and my cousin was gone. She told me she was shoved onto the floor today by her. Then my cousin came back later that evening and everyone sat around and pretended like nothing happened once again. I couldn't help but to give her death stare. I'm so fucking angry at her I can't stand it. Her abusive behavior is not unknown either. She used to abuse me when I was a teenager. She was super jealous of me because my aunt took me in. When I graduated my aunt left to take care of her mother. My cousin kicked me out to the street. That was years ago though. But yeah shes been a complete terror and I can't stand it or want to watch it continue anymore. Something needs to be done. I don't wan her to live in this house at my expense and everyone else's any longer. I don't want to come home to my aunt being beaten up by her. I am so unhappy that she is hurting my aunt I want do something but I don't know what to do about it.,12Nov2020,1

alright so this is a little long and complicated. So i’ve been best friends with this girl since i was literally born. her mom and my mom were friends when they were pregnant and then me and her became best friends. we recently got into this argument. it started over her asking me something about trans ppl and how they can’t just be the sex they were born. and i explained it to her by saying that that’s not it works, and although they were born male, they feel female. she went on to say she didn’t agree and doesn’t understand. so i let it be. then the next day i get a giant text from her saying how she doesn’t understand how i’m gay, and she doesn’t get it and how it’s against her personal morals. and she kept saying things like how she  would never be gay, but then saying she supports me being gay. anyways i felt super angry about that because for one gay ppl were never brought up in our original argument, and secondly it hurt my feelings  for her to say she doesn’t understand how someone is gay, when literally me her best friend is and shes know for a long time. when i came out to her about a year ago she acted like it didn’t phase her. side note- Her family is a little homophobic and I never rly wanted them to know, bc i obvs still loved them bc of how close our families were. so anyways back to the text she sent, after she sent it, me and her got into an argument about all that, and in the end she semi apologized and we decided to drop it. then she tells me how she outed me to her family. which i obviously got extremely angry about bc it was NOT her place to tell them, and because i knew how they felt about gay ppl. when she told me this, i got very upset and started repeating things she had told me about her family, and how she told me they didn’t agree with gay ppl, and how she said her mom told her she wasn’t allowed to be friends w gay ppl. i said things like u shouldn’t have told them bc they don’t like gay ppl. i never said anything offensive, i was just trying to make her realize she should not have done that. Even i realize now that i maybe should not have said it like that, but i was just trying to get my point across. after i realized i kind of apologized bc i knew i should not have necessarily reacted that way. anyways she was not accepting of my apology and went off on me bc in her mind i “disrespected her parents”. after that we didn’t talk for a few days, and just the other day i get a text from her going off on me again for that and other things. i can post a pic of the text if you want to see it just let me know. long story short- what do i do?? what would u do in this situation??s should i try to repair the friendship or is it too long gone? by the way- i hav not responded to her most recent text. so like i said let me know if u want to see it. i’m sorry for how long this is. i really need some friendship advice.",12Nov2020,1

202,"TW: mention of rape

I \[F19\] was really close with a friend \[M21\] of mine, but after being manipulated and pushed around by him, I went to talk to another friend about him. I've been thinking about cutting him out of my life. I've been really torn on this because he's been a major support figure in my life and has been someone I really care about, however, he can get a bit *close* sometimes (resting one of his hands on one of my thighs during car rides, trying to kiss the top of my head when comforting me during a break down) and sometimes gives me pretty unpleasant vibes. During this conversation, she told me that he admitted to her and her boyfriend that he had raped a girl after drugging her (he wasn't charged with anything as they couldn't find evidence). She told this to me but also mentioned she might be remembering stuff incorrectly because she's in a field where she has to research cases like that and the people that commit them, but also said she's pretty sure she remembers that correctly. I'm not sure how to process this information, I'm very close to this guy, and I don't want to lose him as a friend, however, I know I would be in danger around him if that's the case. I need advice on how to deal with such a complicated situation.

205,"I have a classmate (22F), let's call her H, who started talking to me about her anxiety and depression for about 4 months. At first, I was really open to listening to her, especially since she tells me that she feels comfortable telling me this stuff. She also tells me she has no one else to say this too. This is kinda weird to me because while I know it sounds harsh, I wouldn't call us friends or anything close to that. I have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact out of all the people, she chose me to say these things to. I mean as far as I know, she has no friends in campus, so maybe she was desperate for someone to listen and she saw me as trustworthy or something. 

Anyway, about a month ago she told me she has suicidal thoughts which slowly turned into her contacting me in the middle of the night, telling me that she's about to kill herself or that she almost did it. This is where I started feeling that this was something I can't really handle or know how to respond to. Even though I've been encouraging her to get help since the beginning, I started pushing her toward that even more. She won't do it. She always has excuses for not getting help. Either she can't pay or her parents will find out (they are against therapy). Unfortunately, she lives with her parents who are very abusive and the cause of her problems. She has no where to go or even any intention to get out of that environment.

I mentioned on campus help to her and she was extremely against it because her mom's friend works their. She then asked me to not tell them about her, she made me promise. So I did. I honestly feel like the things about her mom's friend working there is a lie, but I have no way of really knowing. I just don't want disrespect her wishes, but this is really taking a toll on me. The only way I feel I can help is by listening to her, but the constant suicidal talks are terrifying me and causing me anxiety. She even sometimes texts me that she is gonna do it and ignore me for a whole day before responding to my frantic texts and calls. 

I'm really starting to resent her for telling me all this, not allowing me to help her or helping herself, and just getting worse and more needy. I know she's suffering, but I'm suffering too because of this. She dragged me into this and whatever decision I make regarding her will make me feel guilty and somewhat responsible. I just want out of all this without having to carry this guilt with me if things go horrible for her, which to be honest seems like the likely result. I hate feeling this way toward her and how this has become more about me than her real suffering, but I can't really help feeling this way.

Isn't this what I loved?

I don't know what to do. Is it a phase? Because I don't know what else to do as a career that can give me joy in life. This has made me question my purpose in life for some time now.

I feel like I have no goals/ambitions for my career other than make enough money to live a comfortable lifestyle and save for retirement.

My main idea is to work two part times related to this passion (neither pays enough to earn a full time salary until I get more certifications) but I’m worried my parents won’t approve and they’ll talk me out of it. 

I guess I kind of just got to the real root of my worries... I’m worried people will judge me for my somewhat unconventional path. Also worried it will be hard to make enough to get by.

210," I'm a freshman in college, and my last day of first semester is this Friday. I still don't know *anyone*, which tbh makes for a very lonely existence :(.

Most of my classes are online. In one of my classes, we have a group chat that we're supposed to use for groupwork, but we ended up not really doing any so everyone uses it for general banter about school and life and such. No one really knows anyone in person (... or maybe it's just me).

Anyhow, I've tried dropping an open invitation to get lunch/dinner (we're allowed to gather in groups of up to 3 in designated eating areas for under an hour) a few times (like, 3 or 4 now) but no one ever responds :(. I'm not sure if people are just shy, or if it's just that no one wants to hang out with me :/.

So, there's one kid in the chat, which I've never talked to directly, but he seems to share some of my interests and comes off as nice. I was thinking about just messaging him directly, but I don't want to come off as weird or make him uncomfortable. Would that be weird? What do I say?

I have been working hard the last few months and have been put in a position where my superiors are pushing me higher and higher in the company, with more responsibility, but not the pay. Currently I am the lowest paid manager by far in my position in our Zone despite the added responsibilities I’ve taken over to show that I am looking to move up. I am close with the person who’s job I am taking over know that they were making $5.00 more an hour than me for the same job.


*** Here’s where it gets interesting. I have been keeping my options open, as I love what I am currently doing, but I  also have a degree in business that I would like to make use of. This along with a desire of having a set schedule/hours each week is extremely appealing to me.

I was interviewed about a month ago (before I knew I was getting this promotion) and was offered a City job in finance with INCREDIBLE benefits, less stress, and a more stable schedule. The City job is offering what I make currently. However, I have never done this type of work before and it is a complete change of pace from what I am doing right now. 

I have two main questions I need help with:
 
1. Do I take the job at the new company with the same pay as I’m currently making, great benefits, a set schedule, room for growth, and less stress. With the knowledge that I may not like what I’m doing? My biggest fear is being filled with regret from leaving the company I didn’t mind working for, and will be in a shitty situation.

2. Do I talk to my manager and tell them I am being offered another position at another company, and will stay if I get a raise to bring myself up to where the previous manager was? (Without saying that) I have heard that they think very highly of me, so I feel like I do have a good chance at getting a significant raise.

224,"I’m turning to reddit with a major problem in my life. If you could read through this and comment, it would mean a lot to me. So, I’m now a 24 year old male..

A had a reemergence of a memory that I had not really thought about since it happened. It involves my mom- so while this wasn’t necessarily a violent event, I’m warning you that, at least to me, it is deeply disturbing. 

When I was a young child, me and my mom had a very tight bond. We were quite simply 2 pees in a pod. Even now, we share a lot of personality traits. 

The memory is; I’m guessing when I was ~10 years old, my mom molested me. She told me that she needed to examine my testicles... she told me that the doctors believed my testicles had not yet dropped (I’ve done research on the matter, if this was the case, they would have known at birth.. this story was complete bullshit). She instructed me to spread my legs wide while I was on the floor, and while she was touching me, she told me that she was on the phone with her nurse friend, I guess who would be helping her identify if there was an issue. 

Looking back, I’m positive that there was no one on the line, because I remember her faking like she was having a conversation, and not really ending the conversation.. she kind of just quit talking midway. Perhaps the most disturbing part of this was the way she was looking at me. I’ll never forget her eyes.. they were wide, like she was fully attentive, and she was staring directly into my eyes. It makes my stomach hurt thinking about it. 

A little side note before I continue my story, this really F’s me up, because I’m a heterosexual male, and I like girls a lot, but when I think about my mom, it almost makes me want to be asexual. I’m not sure if that makes sense, but basically, It repulses me. 

My parents were divorced since before I was 1 year old. So I would be with my dad for a few days, then my mom for a few days, and this arrangement is how life was from my very earliest memories. Like I said, I was very close with my mom despite this event growing up until the age of about 13, when I decided almost on a whim that I’d had enough of living with my mom, and I moved in full time with my dad. 

The molestation memory really had nothing directly to do with it, like I said, I just remembered that happened probably within the past 2 years, but in a way, I guess the umbrella of her not respecting my boundaries led to that decision. I didn’t speak to her until I was ~20... 

Basically my question is.. I know my mom loves me. I think she’s mentally ill, and selfish. But she’s still a person. And honestly, the irony is, she gave me a great early childhood. She was very good in my very early years. It’s very odd how my life is just ebbs and flows of different extremes. 

My question is, should I cut her off completely? I have a partial communication with her now.. see her every few months. But she wants to talk to me more. 

Any thoughts are appreciated, thanks for reading. 

Edit: I confronted her about the memory, and she did not put any effort into talking about it. She just side stepped the conversation. I’m honestly concerned that if i were to really get in her face about it, that she may commit suicide. And I don’t want that to happen.. i’m just really F’ed up about the whole thing.",12Nov2020,1
225,"I have a lot of hobbies. Just like any other person, some are expensive and some are not. The hobbies I have that are expensive are generally one-time expenses.

I just feel like I need to be doing something productive all the time. I like to write books, and I have complex ideas. The thing is, I'll be writing and just feel like it isn't good enough to be read or that I've messed it up somehow, and the fun is taken out of it. I'm very critical of my writing, and I always have been, so I'd like to stop being so critical of myself, too. I've tried looking at other people's work and going, ""Well, do I think they're inadequete and their material is terrible?"" And the answer is no, but I guess I hold myself to different standards.

I also like playing video games. I feel like I stop myself a lot though, a.) because quality gaming is quite expensive, and b.) because I'm not being productive. I've thought about making a YouTube channel because then I might feel productive and like it's going towards something that could be, but I dunno.

228,"Context: On March 11th, I was a graduate student finishing up my last semester of coursework. On that same day, one of my old professors (from the previous semester) wanted to have a lunch potlock with our old class. At the end of the potluck, my professor got a group picture with all of us. My cohort is small and we all had all of the same classes together, so after the potluck, we all went straight to our last class of the day.

March 11th ended up being my last day of in-person classes ever. Hours after my last class, my university made the announcement that they would transition to online classes because of COVID.

My professor never ended up sending that group picture to us. Since that was my last day of in-person classes ever and my last day with my cohort, it would mean a lot to me if I had that picture.

**TLDR: The day before my university transitioned to online classes, my cohort got a group picture together, but we never got the picture sent to us. I graduated, but I want the picture if it still exists.**

Would it be weird if I emailed my professor and asked her to send that picture if she still has it? I have since graduated, and I'm not sure if it would be especially weird to ask since it's been eight months.",12Nov2020,1
229,We’ve been dating for over a year now I’m currently 16 and she’s currently 15. It all started when I discovered about her eating disorder. At first I didn’t even think she had that (right now she’s currently underweight). At first I really didn’t think it was a very bad deal. Until she started telling me about her parents getting mad at her for not eating. She told me the main reason was because they made fun of her for being “fat” and ngl I got mad at her because she basically just started to starve herself. I try to help her starting to eat again and helping her for her depression. It’s been like a year doing that. I sacrificed so many things for her (like quitting sports for school) just to spend more time with her. I literally ruined my relationship with my parents because they didn’t like her. I just felt a bit happy because she feels so happy around me. I got sadder ever since I started helping her. Recently she went on the scale and she lost even more weight. At that point I just wanted to kill myself. I love her so much but her eating disorder and depression is making me lose my feelings for her. I really don’t know what to do now. If I just break up with her she’ll basically kill herself (she has told me that) and if I stay with her I’ll just stay unhappy in this relationship.,12Nov2020,1

231,"Hey, Reddit. I spent a good while looking around for a sub to post this in, and I hope this was the right place. I'm not sure what to specifically warn about in this post, but it includes nsfw actions taking place between a teen and a small child. I don't know if I'd consider this sexual assault, but if you're triggered by pedophilia, sexual assault, or anything of the sort, I'd advise not to read this. Thanks.

I'm very close with my family on my mother's side. We have occasional family gatherings and celebrates every holiday together. I'm the youngest in my family, and still am. For reference, I'm around 13-16 at the moment; I don't feel like revealing my age or the names of my family members to keep them and myself safe. I also find it worth mentioning I'm transgender, female to male, and identified as female at the time, and looking back at this causes a lot of dysphoria. However, since I can't stop thinking about it, I'll press on to hopefully get help.

I'm unsure of the occasion or why I was at my grandma's house, though it was common for us to visit. Me and my cousin, who is male, liked to play on his Xbox in his room whenever we saw each other. I remember he played GTA with me many times, and his background was of hot girls in bikinis. I asked about it once, but he didn't give me much of an answer as I recall. Also, sorry if my memory is bad, I have problems remembering things sometimes.

As I'm writing this an image just popped into my mind; a memory. I think he showed me porn once. We watched it together, casually, and I didn't ask any questions. I think I was about 7 at the time, I didn't know any better, and he was 15. A huge age gap, that's for sure. He was a horny teen, much like most young boys his age I'd guess. Though I wouldn't know the normal age to be into sex as I've had many accounts with pedophiles on the internet, too many to count. That's what happens when you aren't monitored. 

Anyway, back to the situation at hand, though it's pretty short. We're sitting on his bed while he watches what I think is porn or something as I beg for him to switch back to Minecraft. He says no, and me being the awkward little kid I was didn't argue. Soon he asks if I want to see his dick. I didn't know what it was, for all I knew it could have been a Minecraft skin. I said yes. Yeah, I know I shouldn't have, but what do you expect a 7 year old to do? He pulls it out on the bed and I look at it. Then he puts it away. He may have asked me to touch it, if he did I probably went along with it, but I really don't know. I didn't tell anyone, until I started sharing it on the internet right now.

I'm really not sure what to do right now. He hasn't done anything remotely sexual with me since, which is good. I could find his Instagram and confront him via dms, god knows I'm too awkward to confront him face to face. It seemed consensual at the time and ""normal,"" but now I know a 7 year old can't consent to something like that. It wasn't a very traumatic experience, either, so I'm not sure if I should bring it up at all. Though I know if I don't try to solve it it'll be on my mind constantly. What do you think I should do, reddit? Really need some help here.

Thanks for reading, and have a good day.

BUT due to how lonely I’ve been the past few months I reached out to her just to catch up. She obliged and we ended up talking till 2am and all day the next day. We talked about simple things, past memories, and current feelings. It’s been so nice to talk to someone and they actually respond back to me like they’re interested in my life. 

Due to our past tho I know if anyone found out I was talking with her again that they would judge me heavily. So I’m scared to continue a friendship with her but also really enjoy the talks and feelings I get from it. So I’d love to here others opinions while I contemplate what to do.",12Nov2020,1

There’s also a lot of habits I do with objects. For example, if I’m writing something down and it doesn’t look right to me, I’ll go to fix it but it just won’t satisfy, so I’ll keep rewriting over and over again, while getting frustrated aha. I also have to rub/scratch (also hard to explain what I’m doing) random objects.

I (18F) was at home all day today in my classes and doing homework. My mom(48F) had been out of work for a couple of weeks because of her having surgery for her cancer) went to work today for the first time. When she came back from work she went to the grocery store and was there for a long time so I decided to take a shower and then a little while after she got home she texted me to help with the bags while I was in the shower. 

I hurried up and finished my shower to help her and she came with immediate attitude saying ‘Didn’t you get my text?!’ And I replied ‘I was in the shower and I was sorry.’ 

I then went back in my room after helping and started doing my homework which included watching a video with my headphones. My mom then came in my room explaining how my Great Grandma was sick with COVID.  Now mind you I don’t really have contact with her because she has dementia, lives in another state, and I rarely if ever see her. 

 I asked my mom if that was the same Grandma who had the dementia and she immediately got an attitude with me saying I was a fucking idiot for asking that. It then escalated and I was planning on leaving the house to help her relax and myself. She blocked my way and started getting aggressive and ran toward me with her fist. I threw my arm out while covering my face and I accidentally bust my mom’s lip. She got really pissed and pushed me on the ground.

239,"Sorry if this post is out of order and weird, this is my first time posting and i never thought i would ever post. So a little backstory, a few weeks ago my mom and her (now ex) fiance had a huge argument. When i (18M) tried to step in to diffuse the situation the fiance (52M) tried to fight me. It basically went downhill from there. They moved into different rooms and shortly after he moved out completely and they tried just to be friends.

Now onto the main thing i need advice with;

Two nights ago my mother brought him back to the house to stay the night because he lived far away and she didn't want him to drive that late at night (or so i'm told.) When she told me the next morning i was livid to say the least. The fiance has already brought back to memory one of my darkest moments in life and he was in the house again, I stayed calm and thought that he would leave the next day. He did not. I tried to tell my mother that he needs to go and it didn't go so well. 

Today we had a huge argument that spanned over the entire day. I tried to explain to her that I didn't feel comfortable with him here and that he should leave, she felt differently. Tonight it boiled over, We were sitting downstairs talking about him and he overheard us and tried to leave. My mother brought him back into the house and left us alone to try to ""talk things out."" I told him that it wasn't because i hated him but because i didn't feel comfortable due to something that happened in the past that he knew about. He understood and then told me to ""stay out of your mothers and i business."" I responded ""you tried to fight me, that makes it my business."" (I know I sound like a smartass there) he then tried to tell me to remember my place and that's where i blew up, I told him (and quite loudly) that he needed to leave. He looked at me looked at my mother who came into to see what was going on and said ""strike two"" and left. Now my mother is pissed at me because she felt like i was out of line talking to him that way. I told her that i felt hurt that she went after him instead of even checking/looking at me. We currently aren't talking. Advice?

I'm sorry if this out of order i will give info whenever i get back on and check comments thank you.",12Nov2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been a shy person, I suffer from severe anxiety. Things as small as waiting in a line for more than 5 minutes in a grocery store make me feel like the world is closing in on me. I live at home with my parents, I have a great job and make pretty good money. But for the life of me, I can't seem to feel connected to anything or anyone. When I try to talk to anyone, I feel like I'm annoying them, or they don't care to get to know me. So I tend to shut off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to preface by saying, I got out of a toxic 5 year relationship about 3 years ago. Our ""friends"" were really her friends, and I realized that when everything was over. So I cut off contact with everyone. I deleted all social media and changed my phone number, and threw myself into work to try to have something to focus on. It worked enough to get a great promotion. But after so many days of going from work to home. I felt like everything reset for me and I just can't get over feeling like a loser.

I've been working from home since COVID back in March, and I've spent almost every single day staring at the same 4 walls in my room. I don't have a single friend to talk to, and I spend my weekends playing video games. I try to spend time with family, but I don't connect to them in any sort of way.

I’m on mobile btw. Hi the title is exactly how it sounds, so for a basic rundown on a discord server I made a (very) edgy joke (with no intention of hurting people).

So it was a couple days ago and I was getting ready to do school work, and on a discord server I was on, someone said “I’m going to post a meme in general” So personally I have a very dark and edgy sense of humor. And this reflects in my youtube recommendations as I get these discord mods be like videos. The run down of the format is, don’t post a meme in general anyways back to the topic of discussion, *insert edgy joke here*

So I was copying this but took it way to far, my edgy joke was “*a crime* should be legal”. And understandably I offended people. I was being told to stop talking, to shut up, leave, no one feels comfortable talking to you, and it was inexcusable no matter what, rightfully so.

I can acknowledge that the joke was made in poor taste and they were completely right to be mad at me. But as stated earlier I did it with no intention to hurt anybody 

I apologized and left, in my apology I said I’d come back when I felt like I had grown (I’m pretty sure), so I put 2 alts on (which got kicked, after someone I felt comfortable revealing to snitched, one was only temporary) I’d never lose access (just Incase something happened to the invite I created)

The reason I’m making this post is too see if what I said was inexcusable, and I’ve permanently lost my place on that server, no matter if I ever feel like I’m mentally mature enough to come back

My original plans were to attend college but unfortunately I've had to drop out and sell a majority of my possessions, move to a cheaper part of my city and make do. The first few months were going swimmingly - I managed to grab a job as a waitress. I was making a low but manageable salary, and I had a small glimmer of hope that I hadn't seen in a long time. Less than a month later I was laid off because of Covid-19 and told that I'd get a call back when they were ""reopening."" This was back in February and I still haven't gotten a call back.

For the next few months I had worked two temporary jobs, both 12 hours, 4-6 days a week. These jobs were a nice fallback but it didn't last long. One of these jobs actually had given be a cardiac problem and a permanent arrhythmia because of the stress it caused me. I know that I had to find a more permanent job, but living in my small and overcrowded town, there are very little open positions.

I started getting into doordash about 4-5 months ago and it's been a great semi-permanent job to do to make ends meet while I search for a better one. Recently though, my account had a weird problem where it logged me out on my phone. Support wasn't able to give me any more information on the issue besides being able to elevate the problem to the ""elevation team."" Additionally, it won't let me start a new account because they're ""not looking for new dashers in my area right now.""

Long story short, I recently had some breakthroughs in my life, and I realized as soon as I graduate high school, I want to go to NYC for a little bit and travel where the wind takes me. As an artist, I obviously want to continue to create and keep pushing my photography/videography abilities.

Then high school hit, and i lost all motivation to do work. I decided id try harder to be the class clown.
I graduated yesterday and the only awarf i got was my Diploma. 11 year old me would have been disappointed.

I struggle to stay focused, and am unable to think without a cloudiness in my brain. It may be due to my depression, but ive heard of people overcoming this.

The truth is, i feel like ive wasted my life away. So much potential, was a born leader, and now I'm just here, no aspirations. No goals. Nothing.

256,"Let me clarify that I have never asked for money or help before, so I’m not sure it’s even something I want to do. However, many of my friends are suggesting a GoFund Me to help me cover dental costs. I kinda figured it was for people with more serious issues like funerals, cancer treatments, or surgeries, etc. I have an autoimmune disorder and it weakens everything, including my bones and teeth; therefore, causing my teeth to decay rapidly within a year and a half from breaking and being so brittle. I talked to my dentist about getting them all removed and getting dental implants or dentures. However, this is going to be $5,000 (dental insurance covers half and it’s going to be a bit over $10,000). I don’t qualify for care credit or a personal loan because I had to take a loan out previously for school and my credit is maxed between that and my vehicle. So, is this a valid reason to ask for help on GoFund Me? Or are there other options that I’m missing? Thanks everyone.",12Nov2020,1
257,"Hello I am 20(m) and I've been dating this girl for over 5 years who is also 20. I have known her since elementary school and me and her extremely love each other and we've been really close throughout our whole life. This is just to give context to how much I love this girl. However since we've been dating she's told be about this guy who's been a creep ever since she was underaged. What he does is he'll usually send pics of her and her sister to random people through Ig and try and have sexually charged and provocative conversations with them. Usually the people who received the messages from the creep will dm me or my girlfriend the screenshots of the chat letting us both know even if the person who sent us the screenshots don't even know us making it extremely alarming. I have messaged him numerous times to stop with no results except him blocking me. He's always changing accounts and will go periods of times where me and my GF don't get any news from him, but eventually he just keeps on doing it. This guy is way older than us by like 4 years, and If i had his address I would have done something a while ago. I've told my girlfriend to try and get legal advice or law enforcement to try and stop this however she says nothing can be done, and Im not sure if this is true. Overtime I didn't hear anything from him until today when my GF earlier in the day messaged me super frustrated and sad saying he had made another account and was doing the same thing because some guy had messaged her to let her know. Every-time this happens I always feel super shitty because I feel as if there is nothing I can do, however this time I felt as if the last straw had been broken. What I did was made a fake account and got someone who follows him to send me all of his followers. Then using copy and paste I anonymously messaged a group of people about what he had been doing and made sure to keep me and my GF and any other girl he had been doing this anonymous with evidence. I wanted to make this post asking if what I was doing was the correct thing to do and if I should continue it, at this point I don't know what else to do.",12Nov2020,1
258,"I wake up in the middle of the night and feeling these emotions, and I would hurry and write them down because I know they are facts. Things like this person is actually using me vs. being friendly. Or I need to leave vs. staying. Or this person should be stayed away from vs. keeping in contact. And it feels real and genuine and I feel struck with understanding. And then the day rolls around and some things still feel the same way but not as true, and then I try to follow through, but it doesn't feel right. Could go from totally believing something, to then realizing I was looking at it too negatively-- or was I?

Music helps me but sometimes something is eating away at me, so I stop the music and I sit in quiet and try to wrestle and dig into what is bothering me.",12Nov2020,1
259,"Hello, throwaway here, i need some advice regarding my friends, im using a throwaway because they know my real username. First im a shy person, i have severe social anxiety and i stutter a lot in tense situations, because of that im very easily picked on by these my friends, we are in the last year of highschool and i plan to stop talking to them in a few weeks after our graduation. The thing is i don't know how to stop talking with them, i\`ve tried ghosting them or inventing excuses and it doesn't work, they have a habit of talking pictures of me when im distracted and uploading in our school chat, making fun of me, and they have done several Whatsapp stickers of my face and uploading in several groups across our hometown, they have come to my house multiple times without me accepting the invite and basically obligating me to go out, i fear if i don't go they will upload even more images of me. The hard thing is, and i deeply regret it, i went to my first birthday party last year, i was 17, they were smoking weed and they offer me a very small amount, i had never tried anything like that before, and i accept it, i didn't realize until the next morning that, they recorded a video of me smoking, they upload it to a group of about 14 people. I had to beg for them to delete it. When monday arrived everyone in my class had seen it, i was casted aside by everyone during that day because of what i did. At home i purposely fell down the stairs so i could skip school for a few days. 

Recently they have been uploading pictures of that day in several groups and they joke that they could sent it to my parents, i live with very strict parents and my grandparents, if they found out of what i did i don't know what coukd happen to me. I fear that a lot. I fear that if i stop talking to them, they will send the video to my parents which will cause me inmense issues in my live, i don't know what to do, i think about every day, any minute they could sent the video to my parents or someone related to me. Everytime my mom calls me i fear that they sent her the video, everyday i can't live like this for the rest of my life. Please i beg, what can i do, i want to stop being with them but fear that i can't.",12Nov2020,1

I have been hanging out with friends, real friends, I am in good shape for the first time in my life, and I feel like I should be happier. I think what I am missing someone to share it with.

261,"So recently iv been trying to get put of my bubble a little more. If that be making plans with people ,wear a dress I thought I looked terrible in or even just pushing myself to compliment a stranger. This has lead to me joining a basketball team. Now, I have always wanted to join soccer, volleyball or do some sort of gymnastics thing, but iv been to shy or just every time I go to do it I think "" naw they dont need me and I don't feel like doing this "" but somehow I pushed myself and I joined, but joining and getting accepted are only half of the battle. See I have 3 main reasons for taking part in this basketball team 1) to push my self 2) to make new friends and 3) get in my PE hours in before it's too late. And the thing is befor this pandemic I was ok at socializing, I had realized that no one cares about what I do as much as I thought they did (in a good way) and I was just over thinking it all. But now that I get back into the world I still understand that but I can shake the feeling that I going to throw up or stop my legs from shaking in a crowd of potential new friends. I dont even know why it is, my mind is thinking ""befor practice starts go shoot some hoops with that girl, she looks nice and said hi to you, get off your ass and talk to someone, what's the worst they can do say no thanks and walk away?"" But my body won't move, my legs won't stop shaking and my stomach in trying to leap out my belly button.
So after all this I guess my question is ""How do I force myself to make friends and engage with people?""

263,"I have five siblings. I'll call them Dan, Tamira, Finn, Paul, and Eric. I'm the youngest and never really got to bond with any of them. Dan and Paul were the oldest. One went to the military and the other shipped off to the army. Both married young in their twenties but it didn't work out. I barely knew Tamira and rarely saw her. Finn was in jail but I had fond early memories of him. Eric however being the second youngest, I had the most memories of. The only good memories I have are playing hide and seek, us rough housing a tiny bit, and us on a walk playing pokemon go when we were older at one of my mom's boyfriend's house. Most of my life he bullied me and just distanced himself. Currently, I'm not in xontact with any of my brothers. I despise Dan and want nothing to do with him but my niece and nephew are very important to me. Finn isn't the brother I used to have since jail, we don't talk. Eric disappested off the face of the Earth and Tamira is stuck with three kids, a deadbeat husband, and a nursing job. Meanwhile, I can't even drive yet. Which leaves Paul. 

Paul is the second oldest. He went into the army and had an amazing life. An adorable husky, a caring wife, hell I scolded him for drinking too much and smoking. But we never consistently talked. I only ever remember visiting him once and he partied the weekend before I left. That visit though was the happiest moment amongst all my brothers. He introduced me to anime and diablo, comforted me when his dog accidentally scratched me, and was all around the best brother I could ever ask for. We didn't stay in touch. I attended his wonderful wedding though. From what my mom tells me, we're pretty similar in how we dress and music tastes but with the age gap and us both being introverts (me with severe anxiety) its hard to talk. 

This year for visitation he's driving my mom out to pick me up. 7-12 hours I'll be in the car with him, plus any additional time he comes over to visit. I don't know what to say or do because he's the only shot I have at having a decent brother. I tried to connect with all of them earlier but Paul was still enlisted, Dan was discharged on medical leave but brushed me off saying he had his own life, Finn was even more introverted than me and Paul combined. He lived with us for a bit but stayed in his room all day and was in jail before that. Eric like I said disappeared and bullied me and Tamira I honest to god didn't know existed for years. Or at least, didn't remember. 

Paul is all I got but we don't know how to talk to each other. He's in his thirties and I'm in my early teens. What the hell am I supposed to even say? He visited for Christmas one year and I was a nervous wreck while he actually *tried* to make small talk. He commented on my room color at my mom's house and I tried to respond but all that came out was a choked squeak that he luckily didn't hear. I remember pulling mom aside and crying for a moment because I didn't know what to do. I just want to say I have one good brother since all my other siblings were failed attempts. Eric hated me before I was even born, Dan always caused family drama, Paul I never got a chance to talk to, Finn ignored me and I was scared to bother him, and Tamira (my only sister) is top busy with her life to make me apart of it. What the hell should I do?",12Nov2020,1

Studying in the room is impossible, and my is tiny and most quite places fill up quick.

This is very embarrassing and imextrememy ashamed of it but I need advice on how to stop this. I'm 17 and I still pick at my nose, a lot. 
I have ADHD and anxiety so I often fidget a lot and do things to distract myself, like bite my nails and jitter my legs, pick at my face (I have acne and it bothers me) or constantly sway. One of these strange habits for me has always been picking my nose. Obviously I dont do this near people, but I do it a LOT when im alone. I've never talked to anyone about it because it's super embarrassing but it has started to become really bad for me because my nose bleeds alot. And when it bleeds, it causes a scab of blood clot and then it bothers me so much that I remove it and then form another scar. My nose bleeds almost daily now and I cant remember the last time I haveng had a scabby nose.

267,"I want to apologise in advance for the length of this post and different directions that it goes.  I am currently studying nursing but I'm having some doubts about it. 

The reason why I picked nursing was because I didn't really have that experience of being drawn to a degree, when it came down to it, I chose by process of elimination and chose what I disliked the idea of the least, if that makes sense. I enjoy working with people, I'm interested in science, I'd like to work in a flexible field, and those factors directed me to nursing. The response I get when I tell others what I'm studying is usually something about how I'm so well suited for that (I don't necessarily disagree but it's something that has only added to my dilemma).

So far I've completed around 100 hours of clinical placement for my first semester, it was difficult but I  loved it, however, it's possible that I lucked out. Going into my second semester, I found that I'm struggling a bit more which is expected but I don't think I'm enjoying it as much as I should be and that's what is fuelling my concern. When I express to people I know that I'm feeling unsure about this career choice, the response I get is pretty much that it's still early on so I haven't given this degree a chance, that I'll never know unless I see it through and that I'm only feeling like this because I'm young. My problem is I'm scared about sticking to this choice that I'm not 100% about because I'm trying to think about how it'll pan out later on in life but others are telling me that I'm worrying too much.  I can picture myself working as a nurse and at the same time, I can't. I tried to look into articles and posts to read about similar situations to mine which lead me down this rabbit-hole of the negative experience of nurses, nursing graduate dropout rates, career changes for nurses, etc., which I think has made it a little worse for myself and now I'm stuck with many different thoughts.

Other points that may help:

* All the friends I've made in nursing either feel the same way I do, are indifferent to it, or are doing it to be able to go into other career paths (like medicine). I have yet to meet a person who is super passionate and considers it 'their calling' after doing our first round of placement. So talking to others in my course hasn't given me any peace of mind ahah.
* I did a careers test a few years ago and I hated most of the results for myself. Let me know if this could still be relevant today.
* I was recently working part-time in an admin job that was slightly toxic (that's a whole other story) but also was great job experience and helped me develop professional skills. I recently made the choice to leave because it was terrible for my mental health. I bring that up because it's very well known that nursing is a job where things such as compassion fatigue and burnout are super prevalent and maybe my issue is I'm not prepared to potentially face that.
* I don't particularly like the idea of being in one job forever which is why the flexibility of nursing appealed to me but I also don't know if I'd last in clinical environment long-term. I know there are other nursing careers not in clinical settings but most require at least 2-4 years experience in a clinic (typically emergency or ICU). So there's also that.

My options would be to see this degree through or try to find something I'd enjoy more (this option seems difficult, I may be mistaken though).  It's very possible that I am overthinking this whole thing so I think I'm in need of a bit of direction. If you have questions or require clarity, I'm happy to answer. Any relevant advice or resources you think may help would be greatly appreciated :-)",12Nov2020,1
268,"My partner &amp; I broke up recently, and we were best friends. This is my first breakup, we were together for 8 months. We left on good but sad (obviously) terms. Still, it's so hard to get over him/move on, and it makes it harder without support from friends.

I kind of drifted from all my other friends unintentionally while I was with my partner, and now I realize how much I want to get back in touch with my friends. I try to reach out but I feel I'm always the one reaching out and trying to set up hangouts/calls. All of my friends are either with someone or just got into relationships so I feel like they wouldn't want to deal with my whining/sobbing. 

I'm still isolating for covid and a lot of my friends aren't, so I feel like it's not as big a deal for them to cancel as it is for me. Also it's hard to blame them because I hadn't been reaching out for so long. :^(

273,"So here is my “story” it goes back 5 years.. I had this best friend He we amazing, funny, introverted, quiet. He had friends and a girlfriend of then nearly 4 years. We met in high school senior year before the girlfriend -I don’t remember what it was but we clicked I don’t know how it happened but I wish I did we became great friends. People thought he was so quiet but when we talked it was like magic. He couldn’t stop talking no one would believe me when I told them he never shuts up, I thought it was funny and I absolutely loved it. forward to him meeting the girlfriend I actually took part in the set up, I thought they would be a great match I even said he should take her to prom.. they made it and shortly after we graduated. We talked nearly every day for the next 4 years most nights he would be the last person I’d talk to and when we woke up it was like the conversation never ended. We hung out often just he and I. we’d go out to eat and to movies sometimes with his other friends and the girlfriend.. mostly just the two of us. During that 4 year span I had feelings for him on and off but never saying it as to not spoil our friendship and knowing he had a girlfriend whom I was also friendly with. One night it was late (we were night owls) always talking into the late hours of the night/early morning. I was telling him a fantasy I wanted to fulfill on my bucket list. We had always been comfortable with conversations like this.. when I finish telling him he replied to me saying he wanted to help me fulfill it.. I was completely caught of guard and quickly asked what he meant. He explained to me that he was in love with me and I was shocked I had asked him for how long and he said always... my eyes began to tear up and I was shocked and surprised and didn’t know how to respond.. this was my best friend telling me his his deepest secret revealing is love for me. I wondered how he could love me if he had a girlfriend and a long term one at that and how he could pretend to “love” her. He had no response he fell asleep on me as I sat there in my dark room wondering how could I have not seen this coming or any of the signs. A couple months passed and I distanced myself from him because I was confused and overwhelmed. I had replayed so many of our conversations and hangouts over and over in my head realizing I may have known all along. I let so much distance grow I stopped responding to him. Until one day he msgd me to say “some friend you turned out to be. It was the most crushing thing I’ve ever read. I had realized I loved him had told my sister and a close girl friend of mine at the time. I had realized too late that I too was in love with him. 
Forward to the present day.. I have this person and his message burned into me, my heart aches for him. I think about him and often dream about him every single day.. I feel like I have made a huge mistake and am now living with such regret that I have lost the one person who I truly loved -my only “real” friend. I now realize he was probably my soulmate. It’s been 5 long years of anxiety and regret. I wonder everyday if I should talk to him and apologize. Has the damage been done? Could he ever forgive me? Does he ever think about me like I do if him? It’s 2020 the world feels like it’s ending do I take my chance, or has it been missed?",12Nov2020,1

277,"Not sure if this is too long of a story but would love advice on some things I have been experiencing (&amp; exaggerated due to quarantine). Any thoughts are appreciated! 

I (22F) was in a toxic + mentally &amp; (somewhat) physically abusive relationship for 2 years around 5 years ago. The person I was with was misogynistic &amp; controlling in terms of my career (didn’t want me to make more) and actions (wouldn’t want me to message other people). He had severe anger issues, and would throw things at me and not let me leave the car when he was angry. Eventually, he cheated on me &amp; I ended the relationship (thank god!). To top it off, a few months after that I was sexually harassed at a mall, which still subtly haunts me to this day. 

After that, I spent two years being single &amp; really building myself, trying to dig myself out of the hole of not feeling worthy and being passive. I was depressed but eventually worked it out &amp; found things I was passionate about &amp; began living life again. I even eventually got into a relationship in college with a person I was really happy with for 2 years. 

However this year, the relationship ended &amp; I graduated from college (with no graduation + a remote school year). I started a job virtually &amp; pretty much had all my 2020 milestone moments scrapped. 

I guess my question is, I’ve been spending a lot of time at home and I realize my sense of pessimism &amp; fear of abandonment &amp; waste of time is extremely heightened. I’ve been seeing a guy who is super great &amp; transparent but needs more time before committing,  yet I sometimes spiral into low trust &amp; have a fear that nothing is going to work out &amp; wanting to leave. I know in adult dating, being exclusive is something that happens when you commit but I don’t know how to bring myself to be okay with the “talking stage” where I feel like I’m being compared &amp; contrasted &amp; scared of eventually leading to being cheated on. 

If anyone has any advice on managing these fears or stories of how they managed to trust &amp; things worked out, that would be super great. Thank you!!",12Nov2020,1
278,"So I've been dating this guy for 3 years now and it's a long distance relationship he lives in the United Kingdom and I live in the United States. I'm super confused because I'm not sure if I am being selfish a manipulative without knowing ( I know that might sound stupid ) or if he's manipulating me because every time I get upset with him over something he does he always flips it back around on me as if I'm the bad guy. Recently my brother passed away and you was there for me for the most part but that was like two days maybe and then he started to just be a jerk in my opinion. In 2018 he promised to come visit me and I was so excited I was shopping I was saving money and I told my grandma and everything and then about a week before he was going to visit me he said all these awful things to me and he broke up with me. And the reason for that was because we were playing around and I told him to shut up but we always play like that but for some reason in that moment he took it so serious and broke up but I honestly think that it was an excuse for him to not come and visit me, and I'm telling the story because during the time my brother passed away he was talking to me about his cousin that broke up with her boyfriend. Her boyfriend broke up with her and they had a holiday vacation planned and when my boyfriend was telling me this he was calling him a jerk for breaking up with her a while before their holiday vacation, and I was Furious because I was like isn't that the exact same thing that you did to me and he was saying that it was different but I don't see how it was different, So then he went on his whole rant how about I'm comparing him to an awful person, but that's not what I'm doing.. I'm just saying he did the same exact thing to me, and it torn me apart for weeks.. And then i told him I really don't feel like talking about his cousin, or arguing because I already felt bad enough dealing with my brother. . . and he said I was selfish for that ( which i don't think I was..

He kept hanging up on me , or arguing with me, and blocking me. . he tested positive for covid-19 a little while after and he said he didn't have it that bad... I mean were long distance .. What can I do??... I did my best, I asked him everyday if he was okay, I spent time with him but he always made it like i was bothering him..

And I was trying to talk to him about it and he said I was being depressing.. Hes usually there for me but lately i just feel like hes such a jerk and I'm honestly so fed up of this, and I do want to leave him Because I think he does manipulate me..

280,"I'll write a bit about myself so it can be a easier to understand where I'm coming from.

I'm a 27 year old male university student in his masters course. I have never dated anyone in my life as I grew up around a gaming life and I stream on twitch. My family is quite traditional and they want me to get married well before I get in my 30's and I have personally been feeling lonely too, so I thought I might as well try dating or something.

My hobbies include Hollywood, Anime, Manga/Manhua, Bollywood, Asian movies/series/music, Gaming, Sports, etc.

Now, unto the main problem:-

My family wants me to get together with someone related to us, as in, arranged marriage, since they are very traditional. I do not see anything wrong with their wanting but I do not thing I'll be very happy with a decision like that, especially the ones I know are not into any of the hobbies I mentioned (except Hollywood and Bollywood). 

I'd prefer the type of girl to take that has some sort of interest in anime or gaming at the least (sports is pretty much given, nothing hardcore but I'd love to have some sort of activity with the one I would care about) or may be even cosplay (since I always wanted to do cosplay events but could not due to my family's beliefs and thoughts being a highly cultured traditional family).

TL;DR

To sum it up:-

a) Get together with someone from the same race and kin and live a mediocre life to keep everyone happy

b) Get together with someone that shares the same interests as me and live much happier while everyone else is disappointed in me, my traditional family loses respect in their society and most people will cut off their ties with me

281,"Hello, I have a friend that I think needs a lot of advice and help, but I feel like I'm not sure how I can help them. If anyone kind of has gone through a similar situation or understands how to deal with this sort of thing, pls let me know (I'm going to change a couple of details just to be safe).

So I'm really good friends with this guy in my grade. We are entering a really stressful period now as we are in the college admission process and we go to a really hard school which adds a lot to the stress. I already feel like I'm getting really unmotivated really fast because of the insane levels of work and lack of extrinsic factors, so I'm having trouble giving advice to this friend. 

He has a lot of external stress on top of school and college because of his parents and home life. His parents are ridiculously strict, don't let him leave the house and monitor him 24/7. Last year, he made a couple of bad decisions that strongly affected his grades, and his parents literally yell at him about it 20 or more times a day, calling him 'useless' and 'a waste of money'. He worked really hard since then to pick himself back up and get back on track, but his parents can't let go of the past. He feels nothing he does is ever going to be good enough and it's seriously affecting his mental health to the point where he will call me every day panicking because he doesn't know what to do. His parents are the type that 'don't believe in therapy' and are not willing to seek external help. He can't leave his house and is not even allowed to talk to people on the phone, listen to music, watch TV or do anything that will help him relax. His parents watch him constantly and make him study non-stop. He can only call friends in secret and can't even have full conversations without his parents swinging the door open and interrogating him. He is not allowed to leave his house at all (corona is making this worse) so he can't get away from anything and is practically trapped in this awful environment, constantly walking on eggshells to get through each day. 

All the stress is causing him to literally go crazy and I don't know what advice to give. I keep saying that he has to believe in himself, but 1) he can't believe it when his parents are telling him he's trash constantly and 2) it's really elitist for me to do so because I'm not in this situation. I really want to help this person but I can't physically think about any advice to give that will genuinely help him get through the next few months. I feel absolutely awful that I can't go do anything and I really need to help him get through this because I'm seriously worried about his health. 

If anyone knows someone who went through this kind of situation or has gone through it themselves, please let me know. 

Thank you!",12Nov2020,1

A little while ago at around 10:00 PM I got a phone call from a number I didnt recognize, so I ignored it like I always do (if it's important they'll leave a message), and a couple seconds later they called again, same number. It had an area code from a county near my hometown, so I answered.

Some angry dude on the other line said ""Do you know why I'm calling?"" 

I was feeling like this was some dumb scam call given how late it was so I said ""Have at it""

""There was an older guy at your door earlier and you pissed him off""

""Was there now""

""You made a mistake and now were sending feds your way to arrest you""

""Is that right""

""Yep.""

""Aiight cool. Later.""

Or something to that effect. It should be noted that even if this was legit, ive been in my apartment all day and nobody has even knocked on my door. I hung up on him and immediately afterwards I got three texts from the same number reading:
- Two guys coming your way
- You messed with the wrong people 
- Sorry
(I didnt open these texts because I dont know if LG phones can get malware from those or anything and it seemed like a complicated scam)

Its been a few hours and obviously, there are no ""feds at my door to arrest me"". Still, im an easily paranoid person and this kind of shit will keep me awake at night if it doesnt just make me angry. The call was from an area code over six hours from where I currently live so i get the feeling it was one of those automatically generated numbers thats supposed to be from your area so you're more likely to answer it. But I've never gotten one with a live person on the other line and this call was just so... Specifically stupid and weird. 

Has anybody ever seen a phone scam like this? Ive been looking it up and trying to look up the number online and I'm finding nothing even close. Should I call the cops or report the number or something? Any advice is appreciated!

Id post the number but I dont know if that goes against Reddit TOS or anything. If it isn't, or if anyone might know how to figure out if the number is legit or generated, I'll gladly share it",12Nov2020,1

So I’ve been battling severe depression for about 6 years now. The last couple of years I’ve been able to fight the constant need to mutilate my body and pray for death. 

Recently I’ve received a promotion at work. Truthfully I would have stayed at my position if I could but I accepted the promotion because I need money. This week marks the first full month of work in my new position. 

Thus far I’ve found out that the position I accepted is extremely stressful. I’ve been praised for how well I handle pressure. But most honestly once I get home from work I cry my eyes out from how much that day took a toll on me mentally and physically. Now most recently this week I’ve had my thoughts of self harm  resurface and Im back to thinking of all the reasons I would be better off dead. I can’t stop myself from thinking about the worst possible outcome as I’m trying to actively push these thoughts out of my brain. 

I want to quit but I’m not sure how to. Do I quit and find a new job even though I’ve only been doing this new job for a month? Do I stay with it and maybe it will get better? If I do quit what do i say?

I'm 19 and am a popular loner. I haven't hung out with someone in my town in over a year and am super lonely. I also still live with my parents and currently don't have a job because I got fired from a really solid job on my 18th birthday last year and just haven't had any motivation to find a new one. I used to pay my insurance and gas using my savings but when my back account got really low I sold my truck off and currently ride around in my dad's old truck and just pay gas for where I go. 

My drinking:
I recently started drinking but I've been wanting to drink for the last year now to just pass time and make life better. I don't drink everyday but i want to the only thing stopping me is the cashier asking for an id. However when I last visited my brother in the military we drank every single day. In the morning we'd crack one open and then at night we'd go to a party and just get hammered. It was the best week of my life. His friends are all just great people and they quickly accepted me in and told me I'm welcome anytime. I loved drinking with them and hanging out with them. When I drink by myself back home I get flashbacks of them and it makes me smile knowing that I at least have some people in my life that want me around. I don't get hangovers which is great because when I drink I binge drink. This makes me worry that if I keep it up I might become an alcoholic but at the same time drinking is the only thing that makes me smile nowadays. I guess I use alcohol to void my loneliness, hide the fact that I serve no purpose in this world, and mute the reality that life sucks when you have no one you know you can count on and have nothing going for you. 

To sum it up:
I don't want to stop drinking, like come on it's fun I'm not gonna stop. I just want a productive life, good friends, and a solid income again. I really need to start making moves in my life soon because I might be homeless in 6 months as my family wants to move to another state but I really wanna stay in my state.

307," Warning: Long Post.

I am 23 years old, and I'm dealing with a rather serious issue that I need some help figuring out. I'm a bit nervous posting here, so please, go easy on me.

After I graduated high school, I immediately followed up with going to college as many people do, but found I was making no progress with the it because I had zero idea what path I should be following to reach my end goal.

After putting that on hold, I spent the next year working for The Home Depot, and while I had no issue with the company or store itself or even the work I was doing, it felt impossible to train for a promotion because of their system, so I left respectfully. I then spent the next couple months with no job, no school and instead decided to focus on my artwork and trying to build myself a larger presence and community on the internet. 

And then it happened.  
I received a ad for a trade school where I joined on December 17 2019 with an academy known as NTMA (good place) where I am studying the profession of a CNC Machinist trade.

I provide this background because the reason I started this string of events post Graduation is because I have an interest in working in the field of Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering, and my end goal is to work towards being a Prosthetics Engineer... preferably an independent however so I can create my own company too.  
So I started with the Community College route hoping it would get me started. Then I realized I had no idea what I was doing, and out of a need to earn money and not be just laying about, I joined the NTMA academy. And despite the pandemic making me endure the course even longer than I was meant to (it went from a 7th month program to one whole year), I had high hopes for this because I felt it'd be a good stepping stone for the path I wanted to go on.

... now I realize I think I was mistaken.

I have come to understand that the work that would come with being part of a company is not as in depth as I wanted it to be, and I also do not relish the idea of working on a 9 to 5 schedule as most do... you may call that childish, but here me out.

For me personally, I have always been a person who enjoys his freedom and a great length of free time to invest outside of a job and on his own interest, hobbies and talents. I especially want to continue with my freelance illustrating to the point where I can eventually acquire a stable income off my art. I also want to invest in enough equipment to start fully working as a streamer and video maker (something I've always wanted to do since middle school). I won't lie, a big motivator for both of those is the idea that over time I may be able to make that my job, and while I'm not in it purely because of money, I want to pursue it because it's something I enjoy doing and working on my own time is perfect for me... I also need the free time so I can work on publishing my own novels. Those won't happen for a while, but time is the big requirement.

  
All of this would benefit me in the long run of my pursuit for the Mechanical and Computer Science path I want to put myself on, especially since many engineers can and have worked on their own time rather than in a company. I guess I'm more interested in being an inventor than working for a company, but even if I go for a company, working that kind life while in college would be 10x better for me than having to even work part time while in school.

But my concern is that if I continue on this current path and accept working in a company with a 9 to 5 career, I'll never find the time, energy or motivation to pursue those goals, and I'll suffer even more stress, unhappiness and again, a lack of motivation/energy. I've been told by others that it would be better if I stuck with a part time job like I did with The Home Depot, as I'll be earning money, but also have plenty of free time to spend investing in those talents and pursuits I'm willing to put the time and dedication into to make work.

So, I'm asking for advice... what should I do? Am I inflicting this Stress on me all by myself? Am I overthinking it? Should I complete my stay at the academy, but get in a part time job instead of the 9 to 5 and continue expanding on my talent trees? Should I be worrying less about the consequences?

I know this was a long post, so if you're reading this far, thank you. And whether you have advice to share or just upvote this on your way with your own path, I thank you for taking the time to read my ramblings.",12Nov2020,2

last week i got to know a girl, we talked for a little bit, and it could be something that would make me happy, since i was struggling for so long over the years i was with anxiety,

suddenly that girl just started ignoring me(we only talked about normal stuff hobbies/job etc..) and now i´m feeling sad and my head doesn´t stop thinking about what i could have done wrong.

311,"God I feel pretty pathetic asking reddit of all places for help, but I really have no idea what else to do at this point. 

So I am in college right now and I have no idea what I am doing with my life. I feel constant stress and also a gigantic lack of motivation to do anything right now. It just feels like everything in my life is getting out of my control, and rather than reach out for help, I am stubborn and never ask for anything. With all that, I keep having thoughts of why I shouldn't just kill myself.

That's the thing though, I don't want to kill myself. Every time I even think of it, it makes me sick. Not because I am scared of it or don't want to, but because I think of how horrible it would be for everyone who cares about me. I see the faces of all my loved ones, and imagine them hearing the news, and it is such a painful thought I get headaches from thinking it. I could never do something like that to them, they don't deserve it.

But that is just it, I feel like I want to end things, but I don't only because others don't want me to. It feels like everything I do, all the way down to simply continuing to live is for other people and not for myself. When I see life that way, it makes it hard to get anything done that improves myself or my situation, because it just feels like a waste. The only reason I do anything for myself at all is because of people I love who want to see me get better. 

So how do I stop this way of thinking? What can I do to actually want to live, not just for the sake of the pain me going might cause others, but because I genuinely want to?",12Nov2020,1
312,"I can feel myself falling out with my best friend and im not really sure what to do about it. Thinking about it, it all seems so petty and childish and small, but maybe it just adds up.
My friend will only do what he wants to do. If i suggest something, even something i know he likes and wants to do, he wont. Its a repeating pattern of years of friendship where all my suggestions or idea get dicounted. Its happened many times where he has suggested watching a certain film at some point and then when ive later sugested it, he has suddenly chamged his mind, its of no interest to him and im in the wrong the trying to get to watch a film he doesnt want to. It seems so bizzard and hurtful to me. Ive geown up with the attitude that you can do things you dont like because its the company and friendship that is more valuable. It feels like my company is worthless when all that matters is the actual activity.
Especially now, when we cant meet up and are trying to do things online together, its such a drag trying to pick what to do. He acts like he wants me to choose, like he wants my approval of the activity, but then completely disregards it. 
When we get into a discussion where i ask why he doesnt want to do a certain thing (especially if its something i know he would normally suggest himself), he gets himself into this state. He doesnt seem to be able to control his emotions and i then have to spend, sometimes hours, talking him down. Theres been times when my own mental health has been struggling and he has been particularly hurtful in his words and i just shut down, all i want to do is end the call and have some alone time, but i cant. Whether he means to or not, he becomes pretty manipulative and guilts me. He makes it all my fault like its this big horrible thing that im pressuring him into things, when all ive done is as if he wants to watch a thing i know he likes. Im at my witts end and i dont know what i can do. When i have tried to talk to him about it, he twists it all onto me, or even worse he hits himself (which i really cant handle) and spirals that way. 
I dont understand why its such a big deal. I watch things i dont particularly have a strong interest in all the time because 1) thats how you find out if youll like it and 2) what does it matter? Its an hour or two of good company, the film/show/game/activity is less important.",12Nov2020,1

I know the risk factor of a two-second hug is very low, particularly because we'll be wearing masks, but I'm still not sure if I should go with it or refuse. If I do refuse, I don't know how to tell her no politely.

314,"Title says it all but basically I have a 15 yr old high functioning autistic brother, 11 year old brother (born female now identifying as male). Both are depressed as hell. Parents are wonderful and loving but handling two pretty significantly mentally ill kids is not easy for them. Mom has depression and adhd, same with dad. Both medicated.

Youngest brother got hospitalized for several weeks after getting caught cutting himself and having severe depressive episodes that were getting dangerously close to psychosis (mild hallucinations and extremely unstable and mismatched emotional reactions). Laughed and smiled while talking about killing himself, basically fought the nurses for a while too, got discharged a while later. Hes continuing to self harm on occasion and is being spontaneously friendly and happy, then very cruel and distant from everyone. CONSTANT negative attention seeking. Also has severe body image issues.

Older brother is failing a bunch of classes because of severe executive functioning and my parents don’t know what to do; he’s way too smart for “special” classes (college level math / reading) but too challenged with functioning to survive normal homework loads. He wants to work for nasa but is so severely stunted with basic independent function (time management and self motivation), I think he’s losing hope. He told the school counselor he’s having suicidal thoughts and was put into an inpatient hospital two days ago.

My dad blames himself and is falling in and out of depression despite his meds and my mother is working a full time job while trying to manage two very much mentally ill kids. 

I don’t know what to do or say to help really. I search my younger brother’s room every day for razors and sharp objects. I helped my dad collect and lock up every dangerous item in the house (alcohol, medication, scissors, razors, etc) and I’ve been helping them supervise my siblings when I can. But honestly they’re so overwhelmed and I’m so clueless. They don’t know what specialists to see or what’s wrong or how to help EITHER of my siblings. And I don’t know how to be there for them. My youngest sibling keeps lashing out or faking shit for attention. I try and spend more time with him like going out to lunch, taking him shopping with me, etc, but as soon as we get home and there’s an adult or other authority figure around he goes back to being unstable as hell totally unpredictably. He’s secretive and won’t tell us what’s going on and therapy seems to be absolutely useless for him. My older brother... he’s in the hospital right now. I’m not sure what the hell im going to do when he gets out.

I’m 18. I am literally the ONLY mentally stable person in this household. I go to school two nights a week and have hours of homework daily, I have to go to the gym daily to fix some back and leg issues, and I work 4-5 days a week, 6-10 hours a day as a delivery driver just to make enough to pay for things I need that my parents won’t cover and save money for school and someday moving out.

How can I make myself useful? Less of a burden? How do I show my siblings I love them when they push me away? How do I make this easier for my parents? What kind of doctors should we be taking them to? 

Most importantly, would moving out be a horrible thing to do? I wanted to get my own apartment closer to school and my future job within the next 6 months because driving 1.5 hours there and back every day after 12 hr shifts is going to be very, very hard. Is that abandonment? Will it ruin my relationship with my siblings? Should I pull out of the job contract and find something closer?

I need a car to maintain my sanity. It’s only been 2 days but I’m the most suicidal I’ve ever been. I can’t take much more of this. If I don’t get my car back I don’t know what I’ll do to myself.

I have slightly over $1k saved. I swerved into a car dealership coincidentally in the crash, and that same dealership is selling my exact car at not a bad price. Much cheaper than I originally bought it for. I want it. And I think even on top of what I’m paying now, at least until this insurance thing gets figured out, I can afford it. I want to go there tomorrow and I want to leave with it.

328,"Hello everyone,

I have $2000, spendable is $1000. I am not an American to talk about paying debts. I do not have any debt or loan. I am working as a freelancer, make mostly artwork and music, with a not so well income, because I am suck at advertising and do not do it.

&amp;#x200B;

With $2000 in hand to profit, I am thinking about making fast-food breakfast, or buying a laptop (I am using a desktop). Of course are many options out there, but I hate to compete, so I prefer to do things that only I can do. So options like selling sparkling things before Christmas will be passed, because there are people who are way better than me at selling them. Put my head in this industry will only make me headless, so, I'll pass it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, back to selling fast food breakfast. In my town there is no Shawarma, Russian fast food. I had been in Russia for years so there is only me in my town who knows how to make Russian fast food. The downside, I do not have a car, truck, but a scooter. I will have to buy a popup screen tent to have a portable booth, one or two different grill machines, food ingredients. Move to a place near the school at dawn. I am not sure that Asian people will eat Russian fast food. But that can be experimented in the beginning days, I think. I am Asian yet I love Russian fast food.

&amp;#x200B;

About buying a laptop. That is what I want for a long time. But it is not a good option for making money. Just to satisfy myself, for ideas, for working anywhere with the not-so-well-income freelance job.

&amp;#x200B;

Both are nice with which I can do my job while waiting for the next fast food customer, but it will be over the spendable money. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I think about forex, stock, or some investing, trading stuff. But the risk is too high. I once lost $1000 in forex and still scared of putting any penny in it.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides those options, can you please give some advice?

333,"Hi. Im a 20 year old in the middle of a situation I'd rather not deal with. I have been in a relationship with a wonderful, understanding, and intelligent man for about three years now. I love him with all my heart and we've very rarely had a disagreement. 

I'm also part of a wonderful supporting and loving family. There are four of us at home, and we're close as can be. My parents are open minded and caring, and my sister is the smartest person I know. I adore them all, and I know they would never do anything to hurt me. 

Here's where the situation comes in...

My family...doesn't like my boyfriend. At all. My parents firmly believe he's holding me back. My sister used to be friends with him, but grew to dislike him when we started dating. 

Several situations have painted him in a poor light that I fear he'll never be able to fix. For example, my family was pushing him to join the military, only for that to fall through catastrophically. For a few months last year he was staying with me because situations left him essentially homeless. 

Understandably my parents hated the arrangement, and kicked him out when after months he still had nowhere to stay.

I know he's not going to sound like a winner. He was arrested for possession, and served his sentence without issue. The charge was for an arrest before we met...and he's genuinely done allot to pull his life together to be with me. 

He's been gainfully employed for over a year, he's been living on his own, and he's been actively saving so he can go with me when my family moves next year. 

I'm terrified that for the sake of the people I love, I'm going to have to make a choice. 

My boyfriend is one of the reasons I'm still here, as a few years ago, he talked me down from a suicidal edge. He convinced me to seek therapy. He's also made more of an effort than anyone to support my attempts to transition (FtM.) My transition has been a point of struggle in my family, as they're all waiting for the ""phase"" to end. 

My boyfriend is my best friend in the whole world...we talk and write stories constantly. Before quarantine we did everything together. Even now we talk all the time. 

Please...what do I do? I don't want to disappoint my family...but I dont want to lose my best friend.

We talked about how he doesn’t know what else to call us because he doesn’t want us falling out over something stupid (with lockdowns and that too the risk is higher) I agreed but I said it’s not simple enough to put a label on.

To set the story, I live with my single parent, and younger sibling. 

I am the legal age (18) to move out and financially stable enough to, and I really, really want to. I want to start my own life, make my own decisions, have my own space, and focus on my mental health. However, my parent has recently fallen (maybe permanently?) ill. Since I am the oldest child still living at home, all responsibility has fallen onto my shoulders. I make meals, I do the majority of the house/yardwork, I do the vehicle maintenance, take car of my 15 year old sibling, drive them where they need to go, I do most of the grocery shopping. Almost everything a parent should be doing, I am doing.

My parent is always going on about how I am so mature for my age. In front of other people, they always say how much I help out, but when we're alone, I'm told I'm not doing enough to help out, that I need to ""step it up."" I work a full time job that is physically demanding, and I recently quit my second job because it's wearing me out, and I literally have no time for myself. I'm living this repeat of caregiving for other people, and it's destroying me.

Since my parent is going through something quite traumatic, their focus is on their own self. I can't remember the last time they asked me how I was doing mentally. The only time they kind of did, was about my response to them going to the emergency at the beginning of their illness, months ago. I feel as if they expect my full support and sympathy, while only giving the minimum.

I constantly feel tired, frustrated,  and possibly depressed. I've lost sight of what I want to do with my life, and I feel so unmotivated to do the things I love doing. I'm so worn out, that by the time I have time for myself, I don't feel like doing anything.

I had a bit of an interesting upbringing, and went through some things that kids shouldn't really have too. Because of what I went through growing up, I don't feel much sympathy for my parent or what they're going through, and I feel like a horrible person for it. And I'd feel even worse if I left and their illness got worse and they died or something. I'd feel worse, because I know I won't react in a sympathetic way, and in my mind that makes me a bad person (does it?).

One of my issues is, if I move out, all responsibility will fall on my younger sibling's shoulders. They'd have to deal with things no 15 year old should have to deal with and I don't want to do that to them, but I also don't want to stay.

My sibling and parent don't always get along, so I'd also feel bad leaving my sibling with my parent, as my parent is very controlling.

So my moral issue is, do I move out, and leave my parent and sibling on their own? Or, do I stay, because I am their child and it's my duty to take care of them? Is me wanting to leave selfish?

Advice from someone who's gone through a similar situation would be greatly appreciated.",12Nov2020,1
345,"hey! so I (20F) currently live in an apartment with three other girls. it’s a two bedroom, and we’re two to a room. the living room/kitchen is, obviously, a common space.

one of my housemates brings her boyfriend over a lot. like, it is rare to see her home without him. and this wouldn’t bother me, but the thing is, they always sleep in the living room. my housemate has a twin bed, and our couch in the living room is a pullout that’s, well, bigger than a twin. so they sleep there. this used to not bother me as much, but it’s at least once a week they do this now. at least. normally it’s 2-3x per week. on top of that, i’m usually a night owl and go to bed around 2 am, but my roommate goes to bed around 10-11 pm. so naturally, i want to hang out in the living room when I’m finishing up homework, doing extra studying, basically so i can be up and not bother my roommate.

but my housemate and her boyfriend go to sleep, in the living room, at like. midnight. so from 12-2, i’m basically in my room trying my hardest to not wake my roommate up while I finish up work.

i feel like it should register with my housemate that once in a while is fine, but having him sleep over so often in a shared space is a bit rude, considering it’s communal and she has her personal space already. it feels like she’s unknowingly commandeering it.

am i being too sensitive about this? should i bring it up or get over it? i want to bring it up, but i’m worried she’ll get offended, and i’m friends with both her and her boyfriend. but at the same time, her boyfriend has a queen bed at his house, so I don’t understand why they don’t just go there when they want to sleep together (not sex for clarification lmao).",12Nov2020,1

You see this is really hard to explain but ive heard my mom talk about it to her friends and it made me realize something, lets say, for example, a kid at my school beats the living shit out of me and makes me feel awful mentally, you see a normal person would hold a grudge, move on or get revenge but fir me the anger lasts for the day and then when I go to sleep and wake up its like *flick* now im as happy as can be and dont get two fucks and try to become buddies with that kid and then it just repeats, I just reset, I cant explain it and I wanna know if this is something I should be concerned about

348,"The biggest complication in my situation is I’m a hetero male 26 and she’s a lesbian 29. We’ve known each other for a few months and it’s been platonic until a few weeks ago. We were hanging and decide to candy flip(take acid and ecstasy). Somewhere along the line, we talked about exes and she mentions that she’s dated and slept with guys before. We both black out and when we came too, we realized we were cuddling, our legs wrapped around each other, and we were kissing. It wasn’t awkward for either of us. We both decide “fuck it, we’re on ecstasy” and resume kissing and cuddling until we both fall asleep. We didn’t talk about what happened the next morning, but the week after that she invited me over to hang out and says I can crash the night. I wasn’t expecting anything to come up again, I assumed it was a heat of the moment thing since we were both rolling hard. But while we’re hanging out we ended up cuddling and kissing again, this time both of us sober(I should have also mentioned, that she’s not really a physically intimate person in general). Since then, whenever we text or are hanging out in a group, we act like nothing happened but when we’re alone, we end up being intimate again. Should I bring up how I feel right now? Is it too soon and should I let things play out a little longer? Or maybe this whole thing is one sided on my end?",12Nov2020,1

350,"Hey. I'm a student right now and I need help. Not that I need help with doing my assignments it's just that I can't seem to bring myself to do my work. My procrastination has hit bad ever since I got my online classes and I haven't been doing my homework. I always tell myself that I will get it done tonight but I never do. I know that lazy ass doesn't want to get up and do it. Now I have assignments that I haven't turned in that were due a few weeks ago. From all of my classes. I don't know why but I just feel like crying. I have a problem with myself where I think to much about problems. Whenever I think about this problem at first glance I just think that it will only ever affect my grades and that's it. But I lay awake until 4 or 5 in the morning thinking and crying about how teachers work their butts off to be able to help kids with education and I'm just here not doing the most littlest thing like homework. I know it's stupid that I can just use that time to do my work but I over think and continue to over think about it. I think about how my parents work really hard to afford an education for my siblings and I and can't do my work and I'm going to fail. I'm a native Spanish speaker and I'm going to fail my Spanish class and parents are going to see and be disappointed in me. This quarantine as affected me and I got sick, not from Covid-19 but from anemia. My body feels tired all of the time and I stay awake super late until early sunrise and have to wake up at around 9 for my classes. I feel tired. I want to do my work but even if I turn it in I know it won't be graded since it's late. I know that. But I want to finish every assignment I have. Even if it won't be graded. But I'm scared to be confronted by my teachers saying why I'm turning in all of my stuff late and that it won't be graded. I don't like confrontations. I don't want to tell them about how I'm sick because I think I will sound like I want sympathy. I don't. I just want to complete my work. Right now it's 11:51 pm and I'm doing my work. I have a lot of assignments that are really hard but it's ok. I just don't want my teachers to tell me about my assignments and how they are late. I just want to finish them. I don't want to get yelled at. It's fine if they don't grade it I just don't want to be left feeling guilty that I never tried to do my work. I want to email them saying all of this but I can't. I don't want to say any of this to my teachers because I don't want them to think that I'm all boo hoo over here and just an excuse for not doing my work. Please any advice is helpful. If I need a slap in the face or a reality check that's fine too. Even if you just say that everything will be okay at the end.

353,"Two years ago, I met someone I really liked. We hung out together just enough that I got to see his bright side, but not enough for me to see anything that wasn't perfect about him.

Maybe it was subconsciously on purpose that I didn't make the effort to get to know him more. A couple times, he asked if I wanted to hang out, but I didn't want to hang out two night in a row. That's not my style AND maybe I was afraid I'd get to know more about him than I wanted to know.

I think everyone would agree that having a crush is a really good feeling. It's almost takes you out of reality and sends you into a fantasyland where everything is happy and beautiful. A relationship kind of pulls you back into reality, and you realize that there are some things you don't love about your partner because he's a human.

So for more than two years, I have been in that fantasyland for hours everyday thinking about this guy.

Nothing's really wrong with that, I guess. It hasn't caused me any emotional distress. It hasn't hurt my ability to study or my ability to hang out with friends.

The only issue it might have caused is that I haven't made any romantic efforts outside of him. I haven't wanted to anyway, so maybe it's not an issue?

Even today, it feels good whenever I think of him. It's not a case of ""I'm really sad I didn't get him."" It's more like ""he's incredible and even just hearing his name gets me excited.""

I still think I should move on from this and move back into reality... if not now, eventually. His ship sailed two years ago, and there's plenty of fish in the sea. I don't really want to live the rest of my life with a crush on someone who might have even forgotten about me by now, even though the crush feels really euphoric.

In a relationship, you kind of have no option but to get to know someone well, and that kind of pulls you back into reality. You realize that there are some things you don't love about your partner because he's a human.

359,"Hi, I'm new to Reddit, and this is my second post, as I'm posting this in two sub-reddits. So I doubt it will really do well. Regardless, I've just come to this conclusion, and I need to get it out.

I have recently, after doing some research (a lot of research), found that I have met my Twin Flame.

Here's an excerpt from an article I read, that really solidified it for me; ""'There’s a sense of homecoming,' explains Vallejos. 'There’s a sense of merging energy where you can’t really tell where you start and they end.' Additionally, she says that often your twin flame will have experienced similar childhood trauma. While a twin flame isn't a soul split in two, as we are whole on our own, twin flames do act as a reflection. It's like looking in a mirror, and not only is your unprocessed trauma reflected back at you, but so is past life or ancestral work. 'It can be really intense.'"" (Link to article will be at the bottom.)

When I read this specific section, I felt this deep pang in my chest. I can't really put words to it. It just felt like a ""knowing"", I guess? All I know is it was this strong feeling in my rib cage, my heart... something just clicked.

I had known upon meeting my Twin that something was different about them, about our connection. So when reading that section, it only affirmed my beliefs. Chronologically, this is how it went. We met, and my Twin was almost immediately the pursuer. He told me that when he met me, he just ""knew"". Keep in mind, my Twin is not a spiritual person like I am. He rarely describes emotions with anything like that, like something being explained only as a ""feeling"". But he immediately knew I was the right person for him, and pursued me. I was hesitant, as I had been burned quite badly very recently in the romance area. So it was, initially, a game of cat and mouse. Before too long though, I gave in. The attraction was too magnetic, too strong, to ignore. So I put my fears aside, and jumped.

Our relationship took off. At first, we weren't able to see each other at all in real life due to Coronavirus. We both were incredibly affected by it. Our desire for each other only grew, and it became almost unbearable. Neither of us had experienced anything like it. Our relationship began so quickly, yet it just as speedily became the most comfortable, low stress connection I've ever had, and the same for my Twin. Our arguments were short, and neither of us held grudges. We made each other feel happier than we had ever felt before. My Twin said, shortly after meeting him, that every time I texted him he'd just feel overwhelmed with happiness. It was a new feeling for us both, and it was scary, but wonderful. We got to know each other in this time, and, as mentioned in the article, we have incredibly similar childhood trauma. We both have abusive mothers, good dads that are overburdened and unintentionally hurt us, struggle/have struggled with self-harm, with substance abuse, with depression/anxiety, and with past relationships that had scarred us. The similarity was immediately noticed, and insane to hear. He told me his life story so soon after meeting him, and he even noted they were things he'd never said to anyone before, but it just felt right to tell me. When he learned more, and that we had experienced so many of the same things, he was astonished. He told me how amazing it felt to be connected with someone who finally understood.

Finally, we met in person. The most influential of these meetings was one of the very first handful of meetings, and it was the longest that we were left alone, and had a considerable amount of time. He had stopped by after getting off work, and we were able to cuddle and hold each other for the first time. We sat on the swing on my porch together, in the dark. We both said the same thing about this experience; it's like time stopped. Suddenly everything was slower, calmer. Our heart rates both slowed, and we immediately felt what can only be described as coming home. It was the most ethereal thing I have ever experienced. Our bodies, and energies, fit together perfectly. It was like a puzzle piece sliding into place that you never knew was missing. (That's how I described our relationship to him, once.)

In the past month or two, we have been able to meet in real life much more often. In the beginning, it was more of that energy. Of completion, lack of worry, perfect calm. But as TF's often do, we began to bring out the unprocessed trauma in each other. As I struggled with all that weighed me down, he struggled with his, too. We fought, and argued, but only because both of us were so down, so exhausted, we didn't have the energy to help one another. I realized soon that this relationship wasn't going to work, not right now. As much as we both loved each other, I knew a break was necessary. I, however, was scared to say anything about it. And I soon found out my Twin was as well, and eventually he spoke up. He said that we should break up, and said over and over it appeared to be ""right person, wrong time"". He knew, and I knew, that we need growth before we can be together. We both need to work on the karmic lessons, that we, as TF's bring out in each other.

Here's where the issue lies: my twin is incredibly paranoid, hurt, and influenced by his past relationships. In the past, nothing ever turned out the way he wanted. He was either used, and cheated on, or something ended when he truly thought it was going somewhere. Due to this, anytime I'd do tarot readings on his feelings during the relationship, I felt this overwhelming sense of fear and dread. Even though he was happy with me, he was scared to death of me leaving, or cheating. Scared to death of the same thing happening to him again. Now, after this break up, we had some complications because of this. It took me a while to figure out what was going on, as he veiled it. But he's my Twin, and I can read how he's feeling, even when he tries to hide it from me. He told me that he still loves me, still wants to be with me, but he refused (despite my attempts) to go on a break, rather than call it a break up. He also told me he didn't plan on flirting/talking to anyone else, and I agreed that I'd do the same. I was terribly confused. If all of those things are there, why not take a break? But when I remembered the aforementioned parts of him, it clicked. He's terribly pessimistic, when it comes to love. Despite the fact that he loves me, and still wants me, it doesn't feel right to him to promise a reunion. He doesn't believe it's possible, because of the past. No matter the desire.

I decided to take a break from texting him, in order to work on myself, and give him the space he needed to work through those fears. As I was leaving, he told me he was terrified I would talk to another guy, while I was without contact with him. This frustrated me, again, because he has no claim to me, not with his decision to call it a break up rather than a break. His only response to me calling this out, was ""I know"". That's when I realized why he was doing it. As he repeated to me during our discussion, ""if you hope for something, it'll just bite you in the a\*\*"". He thinks hoping is too optimistic, too unrealistic, in fact. It honest to goodness breaks my heart to see.

Because of this, I ordered two spells off of Etsy. Both with positive intent to increase the thoughts about me in his head, and to trust that the Universe will guide us back together. I made sure to work with light magic, and am following the caster's instructions to protect his free will. I simply wanted to ease him of his fear, as this TF connection can be the most powerful, beautiful thing, if we are able to work past our trauma and egos.

Beyond casting spells, manifesting, and affirmations, I was looking for some advice. How else can I help my Twin during our separation period? I'm also beyond shocked to my core that I've found mine! This is such an intensely strange feeling and I'd love to hear someone tell me it's normal lol. Any help and advice is worth mentioning, and if you have any questions please ask! Shocked and looking for insight.

360,"I'm pretty good at following other people's plans if they are clear and do not include things I do not want to or am unable to do, but I suck at making my own coherent plans (which result in a desired outcome).

For example, if someone were to tell me to list the ingredients in a food or the steps needed to cook it, I would definitely either forget an ingredient or skip a step, remember it was necessary, and try to reinsert it and cause chaos. This would happen at the exact moment that the ingredient or step was needed.

364,"I'll try to make this as short as possible. I'm a high school student, I often play video games.

I've noticed that as the time went on, from middle school to the present, my studying performance has been going down the hill.

Every time I HAVE to focus on reading, studying, concentrating on something important, I always find myself distracted from what seems to be nothing in my head whithin the first 5 seconds. 5 Seconds, I'm not even kidding. I can't read a single line of text (that is, if I need to study it, remember or whatever's important) without having a headache in 5 seconds.

Now this is concerning me because it also happens in video games, and I'm talking about CS:GO, if you're familiar with it then you'll know that at a certain level (I'm not very good at the game but I take it rather seriously) you need to start focusing and thinking about everything you do, what to do and so on... It's not stressfull for me to play, but I often find myself starting at the void (and letting my muscle memory take control, which is basically the same thing that happens to me while I'm reading to study. I may be reading yeah but I'm not studying at all) for more than 5 seconds because of a sudden unfocus.

Some additional info, my sleep schedule is... eh... I always try to sleep at least 7 or 8 hours a day, I drink very often, while I'm playing or when I do anything else, the only thing I think I should work on is my food health, I don't think I eat garbage, but I'm not eating ""entirely"" healthy either even though well I basically eat pasta and other normal things for lunch and still normal things for dinner like fish and meat every once in a while.

So... what can I do about this? How do I force myself to focus on one thing and one thing only, removing all distractions? Is there a way? Thank you.",12Nov2020,1

366,"Lately I've been noticing that I have been craving physical contact and I don't know why. Whenever I hug my female friends goodbye or something, (it doesn't really happen with my guy friends, we don't really hug anyway) I get a really warm and comforting feeling and I try not to make it weird by keeping it short and sweet even though I want to hug tighter or longer. Soon after I'll sometimes get a sad or empty feeling that I honestly hate wish I didn't feel. Probably sounds dumb but it feels like my heart gets cold and heavy and I start feeling dull. Once in a while, one of my friends will go in for a tighter hug and it feels great but, once again, it doesn't last long after.

I know I probably sound like a creeper when describing this but I don't really know where else to talk about it. 

I want to ask a friend of mine if she wants to have cuddle sessions or something like that and yes I know that sounds childish. It wouldn't be for sex or anything because I don't want it to be more awkward than it would already be. I would just want it to be completely platonic just to see how it'd feel to hold someone and be held. Idk, maybe I'm weird and I should find an outlet to just get this thought out of my head.

I'd just like to know: Is it weird to want or ask for unnecessary hugs/cuddles (such as hugs that aren't a greeting or a farewell) and if it's not, how can I ask my friends if it's ok to cuddle or hug?

368,"Dear people of Reddit, here’s my long post.
I used to be a pretty good student (I’m 14), I just started the new grade and my grades are extremely low, around 1/2 of what it used to be, even lower sometimes. My parents will be extremely disappointed because they will soon find out. My only way to impress them, would be to earn money online. Now, I am money obsessed, I know that I will become a millionaire in the future. And I’ve tried many methods to earn, but none of them seem to work. I will study harder but not to the point where I’ll get amazing grades, bc it’s a waste of time. Can I please have some advice?
Thanks, in advance.",12Nov2020,1

370,"Okay, this is linked to a post I made yesterday but I will explain what you need to know for this post. I was a sugar baby (prostitute, whatever you want to call it, it’s irrelevant) and my ex-roommate told one of her friends about it. The ex-roommate also stole things like my vibrator, and lied to this friend about it. Let’s not focus on ex-roommate, she has apologized to me. This about her friend. I’m gonna break down what she has said and the background around her statements . Her friend, who I barely know, reached out to me and said I was a prostitute and she heard rumors. First of all, there is no evidence *anywhere* that this is true. Second of all, she told my friend (current roommate) that I was better off dead. Third, she claimed I tried to pay my ex-roommate to have sex with her (baseless claim) and said that I put out a lot. I also have been harrassed on anonymous accounts, and I’m pretty sure it’s her. I want to bring it to the Dean of Students. I told mutual friend (not my roommate) about this, and the bully said she wanted to talk to me. I was like eh I don’t know about this but sure. She apologized for calling me a prostitute and said she knew it wasn’t true and I like okay cool. But she then said my ex boyfriend told her, but he and I are really good terms. I talked to him about it, he said it wasn’t true. I asked her when he said that, and said it was in *December.* It doesn’t fit the timeline at all. At that point I knew it was a complete lie and I called her out on it. She then said, “are you trying to coherce me?” Mind you, I accepted her wanting to talk to me because I thought she wanted to apologize. At that point I was pretty mad and I stopped talking to her. I think I have somewhat of a strong case to bring to the Dean of Students. I think she is a butthead, but does she deserve to be expelled? I talked to my current roommate and we both think she’s a butthead, but she bought up how if she was expelled it would essentially ruin her academic career. I was like yeah, I am not sure if she deserves that. Does she ?",12Nov2020,1

375,"Hello everyone, this is my first topic about this, I'll try to explain everything, starting from some context:

I've been working in the small company (15people) of my uncle for 4 years, with my sister and my mother, too. I'm basically the project manager, since I talk to the clients, project (with 3D software), give assignments to people about what to do, and test the new stuff before it moves forward to the definitive production.

Everything started around May when he started yelling at me because I was ""disturbing"" an employee (I asked where the paper's trash can was); and when I said to him to stop insulting me he replayed something like: ""I pay you, I can insult you as much as I want"".

Around September we had another discussion when he said right into my face that, since he feeds more than 15 families, he can do whatever he wants, even being dishonest with people like me.

Both of these accidents happened when there was no one else around.

Unfortunately, Tuesday, after a problem of communication between me, my uncle, a client, and another office employee, my uncle started yelling at me in front of 6 people that I'm a D\*\*\*head and an A\*\*hole multiple times, and that I backstab people and that the only job I can do is to go apply stamps on the postal office as a state employee without responsibilities.

So the reason why I'm typing here is that I don't know what to do; move on with it, sue him, try to find another job (it's not easy due to the whole covid pandemic)... Is this mobbing? I don't know. I feel sick every morning when I walk into the office.

**TLDR**: I (31M) got bullied and insulted by my uncle (the boss of the company) very hard in front of other employees, and know I don't know what to do.",12Nov2020,1

377,"Hello!
I’m sorry if this becomes a ramble. I’m also pretty bad with grammar and this post will be rather long so a heads up.

Im currently a f. college junior at one of the top colleges that is very heavily STEM and research focused, and am declared in Mathematics and Art. My school does not have many resources in regards to design/art. I will also say that my college doesn’t have a toxic environment or at least I’ve only met nice ppl.

I been feeling rather stuck and anxious (possibly even panicked) about my future for a long time now where sometimes I would cry every day for a week, have chest pains, and think of suicidal thoughts at times (I know is really problematic).


MAIN (stuck part indicated with “***”):
I decided on being a math major with the intent of pursuing academia. I’ve never really been interested in any STEM subject tbh and really hate the idea of doing a typical office job/a job where I’ll be stuck in one room. Subject-wise, I really like history and art, however, I come from a low-income family where my parents are immigrants so getting a good paying job where I can be financially independent and help support my parents have always been top priority to me. Another reason why I’m in STEM is because I was lucky enough to get a full ride scholarship, so I feel pressured to make the most of it.

I decided in being a math major the summer before sophomore year by process of elimination. I was on track to be an environmentally engineer my freshmen year but after taking chemistry and physics, I realized I didn’t find the subjects interesting enough and rather painful to get through (a very strong dislike). I also tried out CS but that was also very painful for me. So practically the sciences were out and I was pretty much left with math.

I was good in my math classes (which changed once I went into proof classes) but never found them interesting, BUT I really enjoyed helping others on their math HW and helping with exam prep where I would stop my own work to help out. So I came to the conclusion of being a math professor (I found professors rather cool and liked the thought of helping ppl a lot). I also chose the Professor route instead of being a teacher because of pay and professors can teach different courses and are able to interact with a larger variety of ppl.
So in the fall of sophomore year, I took my first proof classes and somehow survived. I did stress out a lot and was the most sleep deprived yet at the time, but I still found it better than freshmen year. Spring of math classes came around and I pretty much performed the same (below average) but my confidence got worse because of comparing myself to others more (also bad). 
Not many students major in math at my college and only a handful have interest in going to grad school for math. Most students in my classes are mainly CS majors, a couple of neuro and on a pre-med track, and were taking high level math classes purely for fun and interest. They understood math jokes that profs would say, they followed lecture rather easily since they would be able to answer questions and even ask good questions, like to write their HW/Exam answers in LATEX, and actually found HW as a fun challenge. But none of those clicked for me. Only once I finished the course did I look back and think the content were interesting, but sometimes I wonder if I just mix that feeling with being proud I got through the class. 
In my mind and googling, if I want to be in academia, I had to at least perform average but I even struggle to get there and sometimes miss the mark (more with exams). Also whenever I look up math related advice pursuing math or not, many ppl say they are performing well or really love math, I’m neither.

The summer after sophomore year, a miracle happened (imo). I was able to get a research opportunity under a professor I enjoyed the most. I consider myself very lucky and think I got it because he’s very nice. From the experience I was able to get the gist of what math research was like and gained new skills: a lot of self-learning, going through a lot books and papers, narrowing focus, coding algorithms (new, had to go through codacademy before starting the research and watched a lot of YouTube vids and googling), LATEX (new, a lot of doc readings), and most importantly experiencing research disappointments and having to start at a new point (at least my prof said it was a great thing to get used to in academia). I’m still doing this over this semester and we’re hoping to have a paper out soon. I don’t dislike research but I also don’t quite enjoy it either. Research rn is a middle ground for me.

Currently in fall, still very much struggling in math but sticking it out. Initially fall was going well but after my first math midterm grade, my confidence really plummeted since I was expecting to be performing better. I just ended up having a below average score like past semesters. I will say that my previous math classes really hit my self esteem and confidence where looking at a textbook gives me stress and exams scare me. The research opportunity made me feel slightly better but the score made me feel as though I didn’t improve at all from last year and I think reverted me back to being pessimistic.

Ive also been taking art classes and done designs for my peers and college clubs. So in my periods of distress over math, I often think of if I ended in an art/design career. I considered UX design, since it looks the most stable and pay is good, but because math have been my main focus and takes up most of my time, I don’t have any experience with research over users and technical skills in that department. I also don’t really know how to use anything Adobe. Most of my time with designs was done by using an old Wacom tablet that I got in middle school and got procreate last summer since I was able to get an iPad and an Apple Pencil during that time.
Art is one of the few things I’m actually confident in. In one of my low math periods, I decided to look up design internships. One of them looked good (visual designer) and was actually the first time in a very long time where I was actually excited about something. But my portfolio content I recently rounded up based on impulse isn’t very impressive and rather random since I never done actual projects or spent actual time on building a cohesive portfolio. All of my time has been spent on math and I never actually considered an art/design career until recently.

*** I feel stuck because I spent a lot of time, pain and tears on math and going in an art career isn’t very stable or as well paying. My parents want me to do I want but they don’t sound very happy/encouraging when I mention art because they worry about my future stability. I want to graduate on time and get my life on one path I can focus on but I keep going in between the two and I feel incompetent in both. My mom said a few times that I’m just interested in the arts because it’s my comfort zone and a part of me believes that. I feel as though I’m not making the best of what’s given to me at all because I do recognize where I’m at is a great place to take advantage of that most ppl don’t have. 
I believe that opportunities in math opened rather easily for me despite my performance (I think it’s because I’m one of a few females thinking of math grad school, very honest with where I’m at and how I include that I want to help other students get math easier than me) and worry if just leaving them behind is a bad move. I’ve looked into other math jobs in the case grad school doesn’t work, but found that I don’t like them at all despite the good pay and stability. Another reason why I’m hesitant on switching to design is because I don’t think I’m good enough even though I get compliments on what I do and my art profs have reached out to me about being an actual artist (ok this sounds like a flex but I think this should help out on why I drifted to art even though I never seriously considered it before and I’m being very honest on I don’t feel like it’s true: a part of me believes they don’t have any weight because I’m still declared as an art major and the art department at my college is very very small).


Hmm that’s all I got left in me really. Typing this out rather calmed me down lol. I guess I never quite asked a real question but I would really appreciate any advice on what I can do on choosing a path or any advice on both fields (math academia and design).",12Nov2020,1

[Bridged version]
What is some advice you’d give to a young girl wanting to protect herself at night when jogging?

[Unabridged version]
I (Latina, 18 y/o female) live close to my college and was walking my dog tonight on campus at around 9:45 pm. My dog (Leo) is about 7 months old, male, weighs around 50 lbs, and is very smart. He’s a very good guard dog and I feel very safe when I’m with him. Throughout my walk I was extra aware of my surroundings because I knew it was late and not a soul was in sight. Towards the end of my walk, I spot a man walking diagonally ahead of me about to intersect with where I was walking. I felt generally safe because I was with my dog and I knew there were security cameras all over campus. I still was preparing myself for all possible scenarios in the slim chance something happened. Leo had not yet spotted the man and upon closer inspection, I realized it was a campus police officer on patrol. I was immediately relieved and relaxed because, hey, its a police officer (white, male, around 30 years old). Let’s call him Bob. When our paths did intersect, he commented “Someone’s having fun on their walk,” about my dog in a very nice, polite way. I smiled and made a little laugh and tried to continue walking. Bob turned in the same direction as me and started saying things to my dog like “Hi baby,” “How are you, baby?” in that baby voice you talk to puppies in. I got the impression that the things he was saying weren’t aimed at my dog. I was starting to feel very uncomfortable and had no clue what to do. All of a sudden Bob took a step towards me and Leo growled at him and bared his teeth. Then he said something to my dog like “Whoa, calm down, I’m not going to hurt you,” but the energy I was feeling from him said something entirely different. I could feel in my core that man was an opportunist. Every signal coming off of my body was letting him know I was extremely uncomfortable with the situation. I knew that he knew he was making me uncomfortable, and I was just trying to get the hell out of there and back to my car. I turned away from him and kept walking and luckily, Bob sped up, walked ahead of me, and turned down a different path.

It wasn’t until Bob was in front of me that I looked at his belt. He had a taser, a gun, handcuffs, etc., all of the standard tools necessary in his line of work. I started thinking that if he really wanted to, he could have maybe pulled his weapon and forced me to follow him to God knows where. Watching Blacklist has made me realize how people in positions of authority have the ability to manipulate others “below” them into doing their bidding. It’s also made me more aware in general. That man could have been an imposter dressed as a cop to get me to lower my guard, and then kidnapped me. He could have been an actual cop who just used his position of authority to kidnap me as well. You get my train of thought here. I was just overall relieved that I saw him walk away. 

Bottom line is this. If he had tried something, I wouldn’t have the slightest idea on how to fight back. I truly believe that if I had been alone or if my dog hadn’t growled at him, he might have attempted something. I got back to my car, locked the doors, drove home, and cried my eyes out. I hated the feeling of being powerless. I had the sudden urge to lose 10 pounds and take up kickboxing as a result of this incident. I even considered painting my air soft gun black and keeping it in the waistband of my leggings on future trips to make me feel safer (something I am strongly considering). I wouldn’t wish my experience upon anybody, and at the same time, I’m sure I’m not the first or only person to experience something like this. 

So, my fellow Redditors, what is some advice you could offer that would allow me to be able to defend and protect myself in the event something like this ever happens again?",12Nov2020,1
380,"My friend and I have been friends for 1 year now and we met on a course last year. Since that time we have grown very close, she has texted me practically everyday and checks up on me to see how she's doing. Calls me weekly. However, she is sometimes an argumentative/defensive person and if I or someone else doesn't agree with her she gets defensive and does not manage her anger well. She has also complained that she is losing a lot of friendships, saying her friends ""use her"" or get angry at her for causing arguments. In addition to that she's very pessimistic at times or a litter sarcastic about things and jokes a bit about my interests. Last week everything was fine and she was talking to me and responded to my texts but then all of a sudden she stopped talking to me for 5 days, but posts on social media.

383,"Girl has 4 dogs and is looking to give one away. She mentions this to her friend Sack and he says he is interested in getting a new dog since his old one passed away. Sack takes the dog home and has it for 2 days. Sack's friend bill comes over and notices the new dog. Bill and the dog get along really well and bill says that he wants to take the dog home with him. Since Sack isn't really attached to the dog just yet, and bill seems to be really bonding with the dog, Sack agrees to let bill have the dog. He tells Girl about the transfer the next day. Girl is upset that Sack gave the dog away to someone she didn't know and said that he should have just given the dog back to her if he didn't want it.

After 3 days with the dog, bill and his roommates realize that the needs of the dog cant be properly addressed with their unstable work schedules. Bill calls Sack, explains the situation, and asks if it would be possible to give the dog back to Sack. Sack tells bill that he isn't sure because he was worried about paying the pet fee at his apartment complex anyway and its been kinda nice not having to worry about getting that done. Bill understands this, so he tells Sack that if he will take the dog back, he will give Sack $100 to cover the pet fee so Sack doesn't have to worry. Sack agrees to this deal and takes the dog back with $100. 10 days later, Sack decides that he really cant afford a dog right now anyway and remembers what Girl told him about taking the dog back. He calls Girl up, gives the dog back to her, and then uses the $100 that bill gave him for the pet fee to pay his internet and phone.

3 weeks later, Sack and bill are talking on the phone and bill asks how the dog is doing. Sack tells bill ""oh I gave it back to its original owner because he wasn't well behaved and I cant afford him anyway.""

So here is the big question. Is it OK for bill to ask Sack for the $100 to be returned since the money was supposed to be used for the pet fee, but Sack just gave the dog away instead and never paid the pet fee OR should the money just be considered a sunk cost and Sack had the right to use it for whatever he wanted at that point, and giving the dog away doesn't matter.",12Nov2020,1

390,"I feel so cruel writing this, but I'm in a quandry and I hate watching my friend suffer when men constantly ghost her, especially when I'm 99% sure I know why. 

My friend Mel (30) is incredibly kind, loyal and lovely. She keeps meeting men on dating apps but they always ghost her after the first date. I think there are several reasons for this, but I would say it mainly hinges on the fact that she has the table manners of a 2-year-old. 

She literally cannot eat anything without getting food all over her face, she talks with her mouth open. She has a generic condition which affects her breathing, so couple this with her breathing really loudly to almost the point of snorting with her mouth wide open and food in it and...it's interesting. She also has a habit of screeching plates with cutlery. There have been times I've refused to sit and eat with her on account of the plate noises (should note, we're Brits and table manners is a bigger thing than it needs to be here). 

The other thing is that she is a bit of a conversation hog. She is so intense when you first meet her and I know it's nerves, but I've had to explain that to every partner I've ever had, who haven't particularly enjoyed her company on the first couple of meets.

And the last thing about Mel - the part I feel most awful about writing is that Mel's genetic condition means she has unique features. She has tons of friends and people love her, but part of me wonders if these men are just shallow arse holes. 

Now, the reason I even mention this is two-fold. Firstly, she is incredibly sensitive, as to be expected. People have made tons of comments about the way she looks and even the lightest criticism can really upset her. So I have no idea how to broach the above as I know she'll take it to heart and it'll upset her. 

Secondly, if I do broach the above and it doesn't change things, it's likely because she is meeting hideously shallow men - the pictures she shares on dating sites don't highlight her features fully and I think men are often surprised when they meet her. Again, I feel horrible saying it, but that's just the way it is. 

I genuinely wish I could help and I know it starts with addressing her table manners and conversational intensity but I just don't want her to hate me. Her family are understandably protective and very much believe 'be the person you are', which I wholeheartedly agree with but I do think you need to somewhat subscribe to certain societal norms and that includes eating politely and having two-way conversations. I worry that if she gets upset, she'll say something to them and they'll also react negatively.

The alternative is I don't say anything but i have visions of this pattern just continuing and I know it's affecting her deeply.",12Nov2020,1

I sure as hell am not having kids; with climate change, increasing entry barriers for the most basic of careers, and the amount of suffering you have to go through just to be successful, it honestly feels unethical to me. I'm a political science major because it seems like the most important thing I can study, and yet I still don't feel passionate enough about it to go out and protest or petition to make a meaningful change in the world.",12Nov2020,1
393,"So there’s more to the title and a story. I am a 17 year old male. What happened was that the power had went out, so I went to the living room cause there was still power there. I took my blanket, iPad, and extension cord (for my heater and a charger). As I’m getting everything plugged in my sister (who’s 14 yrs old) who’s on the opposite side (on the bigger couch) starts yelling at me giving attitude for a battery for the remote tv, which I had took cause the power had come back on  and I needed one for the tv in my room but the power went out so that’s why I decided just to go to the living room. As she’s yelling me each time I continuously asked her to wait (because I’m plugging things in) and to stop yelling at me she continued to yell at me and around the 4 or 5 time of me asking her to stop yelling at me I ended up yelling her once, my mom 
Starts yelling at me and she was there the whole time my sister was yelling at me and not once said anything to her. As I’m trying to explain to her what happened she just completely ignores me. I ended yelling at her because I got fed up because she constantly yells at me. She came at me and started hitting me multiple times. At first I didn’t do anything, I was abused by one her bf in the past when I was younger as well. I didn’t like being hit so I started telling her to stop hitting me. She keeps going, slapping my face and my head and my body. It was a good about of time before I started grabbing her arms, even so she tried to still hit me as I was grabbing her arm. Soon where I had stared grabbing her from the small couch she struggled herself on the big one while she trying to hit me (as I say to stop trying to hit me) and called for her bf. She finally stops trying to hit so I let go and step back. Now that her bf is there they both start to corner me (where the small couch is) and she starts hitting me again and I start trying to block her hits and I manage to grab her arm and once I do her bf grabs me by my neck and starts choking me and he pins me in the small couch and I manage to push him off of me with my leg. After that he starts going at me again. I was going to try and fight him but my mom gets in between us and whiles she in between us he takes multiple swings at me and I keep moving my head over dodging them till he overpowers my mom and ends up push us into the front door and my mom stops him by because the kids who are 5 (b) and 2(f) are present and he goes back in to the room.

am I in the wrong?

395,"Thank you for clicking on this post. 

Background: I (M/20) work in a start-up company where it’s just my boss, me, and a few other employees. I’ve recently stopped working at home and moved back into our office. My boss, being an entrepreneur at heart, gives me intensive coaching throughout the day. Today, we focused on committing to and achieving goals that I set for the day.

When discussing these goals, I first gave him my list of what I wanted to achieve today, which looked like:

Task 1: finish by 12pm
Task 2: finish by 2pm
Task 3: finish half by 5pm (where I finish at 5pm)

My boss immediately assumes I’m not pushing myself hard enough and proposes that I finish Task 3 in full by 4.30pm. 

Now, these goals were already extremely ambitious even before my boss proposed his change. The change to Task 3 meant it was physically impossible to achieve it in the allocated time. He would not take no for an answer when I told him it was not feasible to complete Task 3 in full today. 

On top of this, Task 1 ended up being pushed out to around 1.30pm, which naturally means the second two tasks will be pushed back also. This means I didn’t have time to even start on Task 3, so around 30 minutes before the end of the day I let him know I’m not able to complete Task 3 by the end of the day. 

I finish up for the day and reaffirm that I’ll complete Task 3 tomorrow. He immediately turns around and grills me about how I have a lack of integrity and character for not meeting my goals. This goes on for around 30 minutes after my shift has already ended, eating into my commitments outside of work, and I can’t get a word in to tell him I have to leave. Everything I say gets rebutted, and my character gets attacked because I’m just “making excuses”. He is implying that I should stay back to finish the task, which means I finish over 2 hours later, all of which would be unpaid. I have no intention of ever staying back this late for unpaid work. 

I’m on the verge of quitting because of issues like this. I bend my back over for a job that pays minimum wage, only to get told day in day out that my character is weak and everything I do is flawed. Is there anything I can do to stand up better for myself and/or tell him that he is having a laugh with his impossible standards? I feel so hopeless trying to debate with my boss, who is a master manipulator and is so incredibly stubborn.",12Nov2020,1
396,"I'm an 18 year old college freshman and I'm currently getting my ass kicked with online classes. I'm usually a pretty good student, I was initially attending CSUN and I was eligible for their honors program which I intended to be in. But I withdrew my admission from the university like many students in my grade because paying money for online classes wasn't worth it. I'm getting free tuition for 2 years at city college and I planned to aim higher than CSUN and transfer to a better school like USC or UCLA. But I really underestimated college. I've been struggling with ADHD and depression and it's difficult staying motivated and on top of everything when its all online and living in the middle of a fucking pandemic. I also felt like I was thrown into college without any idea of how anything works. I met with my Academic Counselor to plan classes but now I cant meet with her again cause she's fully booked for the rest of the year. I didn't even know there was a deadline to withdraw from classes (which has passed btw) and I'm drowning in missing work and finals are in December. I'm panicking. I guess USC or UCLA is out of the question. But now I don't know what my options are and if I'll ever be able to transfer to a good school because of how much I fucked up my first semester. I have an A in my freshman seminar class, a B in my english class, and I'm months behind in my history and philosophy class so you can probably guess what grade I have in those classes. The cherry on top of it all is I'm taking this history class for the 2nd time now cause I failed it the first time when I tried to take it in high school. I'm too scared to meet with my professors because of how far behind I am. I wish I could've just taken a gap semester or something so I could've figured out what I really wanted to major in and what I career I wanted to pursue. Now I don't know if I'll ever be able to succeed in life now that I'm gonna have this on my permanent record. I plan to work harder next semester and stay on top of everything now that I understand what college is like and how seriously I'm supposed to take it. But what can I do now???

398,"Here’s the situation: over the years, a person in my college friend group has exhibited a pattern of violence when drunk. The violence is rarely provoked, he typically does not remember his actions upon waking the next morning, and while he may show mild remorse, he makes no serious lifestyle changes to fix this erratic behavior. The incidents—including shoving his girlfriend, punching an acquaintance, and strangling his friends—have been ramping up in both frequency and intensity over the past months.

Most recently, he got drunk, snuck into my friend’s room at 3AM, woke him up to screw with him, and wound up strangling him to the point where my friend had four distinctly visible finger marks on his neck for days. My roommate and I had to take him to the ER twice (at the advice of a neurologist in the family who was concerned he may have a stroke), and he has brain damage and neurological symptoms akin to those of a bad concussion.

The strangler has shown little remorse, considering the severity of the incident. My roommate and I have already made it clear to this person that he is not allowed in our lives for the foreseeable future. 

After reporting the incident (and the pattern) to our university, we were essentially presented with three options: legal action (police), disciplinary action (university), and mandatory counseling (uni wellness services). Our friend, the victim, is afraid to take serious action at the risk of losing his friendship with this person. My roommate and I feel strongly that this person will only become more dangerous without some kind of serious intervention. Every adult we’ve spoken to has agreed with us: this is no joke.

401,"First of all, we're both virgins, but we both know how pregnancy normally happens. Man ejaculates inside woman, woman gets pregnant. Don't get me wrong, a child wouldn't be a problem to us if the timing was right, but it isn't.

Getting to the point, we were making out for a while until she decided she wanted to do it with me. I told her that we shouldn't, but I eventually gave in after a while. Thankfully, I stopped myself when I was in the middle of pushing myself in, so basically only my tip entered her. 

After that, she gave head, I finished in her mouth, and she swallowed everything before making out with me again. A little while after that, I ate her out.

So, here's my question. Can she get pregnant from my cum that travelled from her mouth, to my mouth, to her vag? Also, is it possible to get pregnant from the precum I had when I pushed the tip in?

We're stupid and now we've learned from this that we should only have safe sex. We wouldn't really care if it weren't for google search results telling us about there being a possibility of pregnancy. I'm pretty chill about it because I don't think it would get her pregnant but she gets sad a lot and she's scared that she might've ruined our lives. As much as I keep on telling her that everything will be fine, I become influenced by her and I end up thinking negatively too.

405,"My older brother passed away from a heart attack in August…it was unexpected! He was somewhat young being in his early 40s. My brother was my parent’s favorite in the family compared to my sister and I. While we were all treated well, it was very clear that my brother was their favorite…especially with my mother. Even though I am the youngest, she would always refer to him as her “baby boy”.

Either way, my mother has been having an especially hard time coping with his death. Outwardly, she is doing okay. She is going to work, having conversations, laughing here and there. However, during those brief moments when she opens up…she is very broken up about it.

This past week, my parents visited my husband and I. They stayed at our house in our guestroom for 5 days. During their stay, my mother started up a new book…it was about life after death. She finished the book in 2 days. I was standing in front of her when she finished it and she asked me if I could go into the guestroom and grab a specific book from her luggage. When I opened her luggage, she had 8 other books about life after death with her. Since my brother has died, she has been reading one life after death book after another. If she has any free time, all she does is read these books. I asked my dad about it and he said she has been reading them non-stop since my brother passed. My dad shrugged it off.

I am really worried about this. If she reading these books non-stop, she is constantly thinking about him, his death, the whole situation!  I know she loved him, and I know he was her favorite. Losing him has devastated her but I know reading these books, constantly thinking about him all the time, cannot be healthy for her!

I know it has only been 3 months…and I know people grieve in their own ways, but I am scared this will severely prolonging her grieving process. Honestly, I am unsure what to do. Should I allow my mother to continue reading these books and let her grieving process organically progress, should I approach her about it and tell her she needs to take some time off from reading these type of books, or should I not even worry about it?   


I am at a loss. I know if I were to tell my mother to stop, or at least to slow down on the books she will get mad at me…that is the last thing I want.  She is an emotional wreck and I do not want to push her.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my best friends have been a solid group for about a year and a half, I have other friends but they aren’t as close and we are all fri ends with them.

Yesterday P and K randomly approached me and M and they basically told us that they no longer trusted me or wanted to be my friend. Apparently I had said something a few weeks ago (when I asked they wouldn‘t tell me) that made them reevaluate the time that we had been friends and they now felt uncomfortable around me. P then proceeded to set ground rules so that we could still coexist together. They basically went like this

1. No longer seeing each other outside of school
2. Not sitting next to them in class or at lunch and recess
3. Once the group project is done not talking to them unless the teachers make us

Then they left me and M by ourselves. We were both quite confused becabuse everything seemed fine the day before. What’s worse is that they expected M to go along with it but M didn’t really understand why. I don’t really have any other friends to sit with because P and K convinced them all to hang out with them instead of me. M said they they are still my friend but I know that M wants to hang out with P and K still. At my school the friendship groups are very defined and its a bit too late to try and fit in anywhere else. I’m very hurt and pissed off because out of all three P was the closest to me, we would often tell our deepest darkest secretes and she would be there for me no matter what and visa versa. P and K are now ignoring me but I have a strong feeling its mainly P that feels this way but K is just going along with it.

411,"Hi everyone. This is a long post and if you can't help, I understand. Before you all read all of this, know that my mom is one of the best persons in my life. She has been one of the most caring persons in my life. 

My mom has been depressed for a very long time and my family has been trying to help her out, but she refuses to receive any sort of help like therapy. She believes therapy is bad and for insane people, though we keep telling her that it is totally safe and normal and that it will help her out. My sibling has gone to therapy, yet my mom refuses to believe it will help her. Additionally, she cannot express herself well in English as she speaks Bangla primarily, and she feels that going to a therapist who speaks mostly in English might not be the best for her. 

To explain more of my mom's depression, at one point during the year, my mom gets seriously depressed, almost to the point where she doesn't want to live or just wants to leave the country to live with her mom in Bangladesh. This has been the case for many, many years. Ever since 2016, when her dad died, things have gotten worse, though she was always quite depressed before then. She will have moments every single month where she is very upset. However, for 2 or 3 weeks, she'll be completely normal. She will be happy and she'll speak with everyone normally. This happens throughout the entire year until at one point, she goes through a very bad moment or episode. 

Her relationship with my dad hasn't been consistently good. She will talk with my dad very normally during her happy weeks, but then think my dad is the worst person in the world during her sadder moments. I know it might seem that my dad may be the sole reason for why she is depressed, but the thing is, ever since I can remember, my dad has been the most supportive person in my life. And not only for me, but for my sibling and my mom too. He does a lot for us, and apart from the stress from work, he is very happy around us and is always there for us. He will play games with us, spends time with us, and is almost never away from us. Ever since I can remember, I have never seen him be abusive to my mom. He has never hit me or my sibling either. He has yelled at us probably fewer times than there are fingers on my hands. He is seriously my best friend and I can't imagine a life without my dad. 

For a very long time, my mom believed that my dad was cheating on her with someone else. We have moved countries twice and moved cities 4 times, yet my mom believes that everywhere he goes, my dad is doing something suspicious. The thing is, my dad used to come home from work at a regular time, like 5pm, everyday. He used to always drop us at school and pick us up when we were done with our school activities. He has been able to help us anytime throughout the day nearly every single day of our lives. Apart from this, neither my sibling nor my mom nor I have been able to come up with any evidence of my dad cheating, yet my mom used to believe all the time that he would cheat. My dad even asked her to hire a detective to investigate him, though my mom never did. Recently, like the past year out of probably the last 10 years, she has stopped believing that my dad is cheating. Maybe because of covid and that my dad has been at home she thinks my dad isn't cheating, but she still thinks my dad did bad things before. 

My mom is also very materialistic. Ever since she was little, she was brought up into a large house, and even until now, she desires things that are completely unreasonable. Things that are unnecessary and unaffordable, such as a big car or a big house, are things that she wants and every single time she realizes my dad doesn't have that and can't afford that reasonably (given that he has to pay for things like our college tuition), she will get upset and say that we live horrible lives. I notice that when my mom has money, as in when she has a job or when she has money with her, she is much more happy. My mom has good education, a master's degree in finance, and she has had many decent salary jobs in her lifetime. However, she has never been able to keep those jobs for very long. When she's not working, she uses the money to either support her mom living in Bangladesh, buy food for our family, or buy a lot of expensive things for herself like jewelry or clothes. Spending money keeps her happy but it's a very temporary thing. She doesn't save money at all and she has a bad spending habit that has existed for a very long time. 
 
My mom's relationship with my sister isn't the best either. My sister has never been great academically, and as a lot of Asian families are about academics, my mom has always been a little harsh with her about school work. She has helped my sister a lot, but the past 4 years, she has slowly stopped. Recently, she frequently gets upset about how we aren't the ""smartest"" individuals and that we won't be able to do anything successful in our lives because we are not like those kids who go to the prestigious schools that she wanted us to be in. She gets more upset at my sister because she has always been worse at academics (noticeably worse but due to health conditions that I was fortunate enough not to have), and my mom believes she will be useless in the future. This is usually how she thinks when she is in her sad state, though she believes in us when she feels happier and normal. 

Anyways, just these past 2 weeks, my mom has been incredibly sad. For some days, she will be happier, but she has stated once again that we will be better off if she didn't live. She believes she is worthless and that she hasn't been a good parent. I've always been the one to bring her out of this sadness, and quite frankly, I've only ever cried in my life for her, but I just can't do it any longer. I've been able to prevent her from committing suicide and have brought her into happiness, but she will inevitably get depressed again and again. She refuses help no matter how many times my dad, my sister, and I have asked her to get help, but there is nothing that will change her mind. She does not want help but knows that she is sad. We just don't know what to do. Everytime she feels happy again, it feels as if everything is fine, but then she gets sad and nothing is good. I constantly tell her she means so much to us, and she always changes her mind and believes we need her, but she reverts back and says she is useless. She will most likely be happier the next few months as this is usually one of the times during the entire year she is this sad, but I want to get rid of this problem. I know it's late and I'm so guilty for waiting this long, but I have been scared to do anything before. I'm finally in college (studying from home) and I realize that soon I will not be there to help my mom. I just want to help before I leave. I know my dad will try to help, but I don't think my mom will be able to live with my dad or even my sister happily. Constantly seeing her happy then sad then happy has made it difficult to act on this problem. I know it's my fault for not doing anything, but I realize I have to do something soon.",12Nov2020,1

I don't know where to start. I guess I should let you know why this all became possible since you might wonder why I let it happen knowing so many things.  To be honest I left high school with no real friendships.  I came to the university to start over and meet new people; to have friends that cared about me for the first time. Sadly the first guy I met was the unnamed sociopath and boy I must have been easy pickings.  All I needed was someone to vent to and act as though they understood.  I was way too messed up in my own head to be able to worry about others especially when he was being so ""nice"".  What made it worse was nearly failing school every semester and the growing anxiety from all of this.  I would eventually be diagnosed with ADHD in the summer this year and the medication would help me study and have fixed all my anxieties and boosted my confidence.  Now that I am able to look outside instead of in I have the confidence to leave toxic people but also to see this deception.

&amp;#x200B;

 First off my reasons for believing this.

*   I remember one time talking to him about my dream to start a business and telling him that I was probably too ethical to really make it big since I don't like screwing people over.  He told me that the only way you can get anywhere in life was by using people and that he uses people all the time to get what he wants. He said that's why he got into psychology, so he could understand people better to use them.
*   Another time he said something that was odd to me was when I was trying to get a job and wanted to get some advice.  He told me to go in and lie to them; he said to tell them whatever you need to; to get the job. I didn't believe in any of this, it went very much against my morals.  He then told me that he lied to his boss about having 6 months of bartending experience to get a job (He had never had a bartending job before ) and about a time he walked into a restaurant saying that he was told to come in for an interview that day whilst having no communication prior.  He got the job both times and this is only what I know of.
*   He is also very smooth with his words; appears confident at first.  He has no apparent anxieties about what people think of him which is more apparent in public settings around strangers; he can't conceptualize that his actions might make people uncomfortable.
*   I also realize I don't know anything about this guy but he knows a lot of my insecurities and life stories.   I know very broad stories about where he grew up but nothing that really means anything, nothing that would show he trusts me. For all, I know it's fabricated. Plus he has told everyone these stories.
*   There have been 2 situations where I have been filled with dread while in his presence an unexplainable dread where I felt if necessary to him I would be dead.  It sounds over the top but to best explain why it was such a scary feeling was because I could not read or predict any of the sound and body language he presented and it made my body freeze with fear. Both times this happened I had brought him into a situation where he did not have power over me. One time was when I came home to him cheating on his girlfriend and the second was not too long ago when I finally had become a confident person.  I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and the medication has improved all parts of life, one being my confidence.  Anyways this entire night he got drunk and he was trying to berate me like never before in front of some friends (which has never happened) I wouldn't take any of it and it made him look crazy.  We go home and he wants my vape but I just wanted to sleep and I wouldn't unlock my door since he had been treating me like crap all night.  Basically, I refused to submit to his demands and he explodes into a fit of rage trying to kick my door down.  I jumped up open the door and hand him the vape and almost instantly his demeanor calms and he walks away
* He changes his personality depending on the people he talks to. It's like he doesn't have an identity.  It's actually bizarre to see how good he is.  He acts differently when flirting when talking to the guys, to the girls (friends), to me, to strangers, to my parents.  You name it if he thinks he needs to he will change and adapt.  I remember he once told me that he changes his accent when speaking to those of different ethnicities in English when they present an accent.  So let's say a Chinese person; he is saying he will change his voice to mimic theirs so they better understand him.  Now it makes sense logically the concept but that is offensive right ?? 
* I have noticed that in many group situations he never picks aside and never starts an argument.  He literally will not ever say something controversial and never argue with our close friends. 
* But he argues with me, I remember always bringing up opinions when I was with him and he would berate me with counter-arguments constantly even those that were so minuscule in relation.   I remember I would question why he had to put me down all the time and he would say it was for the sake of argument.  It always felt like a competition and I don't think I ever won.
* He views people as objects.  I kind of touched over this earlier.  He would go after the easiest girls in this large social group we had constantly.  I remember I would ask him why he did that since it was well known that those girls got around and were easy targets.  He would tell me that using people for pleasure is a perfectly normal activity since they do the same.  I would argue that it seems like viewing them as a route for pleasure dehumanizes them blah blah blah.  No matter the argument I'd feel like less a person.  How does this happen in this situation?
* He used me to become friends with these girls.  If you want an example of manipulation this is it.  I was so convinced that he was insecure and damaged as a person that I convinced them to open up to him.  He has used me multiple times to help him get into friend groups and to get him out of trouble for bad behavior with friends of mine using my empathy for him.

 Anyways I moved home to save money since school went online and I've now come to realize all of this manipulation and gaslighting that has gone on ever since I met him.  It was so hard for me to wrap my head around the idea that someone I shared so much with could do this, I felt like a lunatic to believe it was possible but now I am 100% sure.  I know I can not diagnose him as a sociopath too or an ASPD person but whatever he is it must be close.  

# The advice I am searching for is how to deal with this.  While I was closest to him we still have a larger group that we would hang out with regularly.  I fear that any form of confrontation will ruin my image and that trying to convince someone else of his deceit will look as though I am spreading rumors.  I hope that there is a better solution than just leaving and having to start over again but I also want nothing to do with this man.  Any advice is appreciated thank you.

***I also had one more question:***

  ***Why do you think he would tell me so many things that would reveal him as an immoral person.  Was it as bait, was it the shit test that they say they do? Did he think he had so much control over me it wouldn't matter?  I'd love it if there is an answer for him being so open with me.***",12Nov2020,1
415,"So a bit of context before I start downright ranting. Tldr at the bottom.

Both of them teach people of all ages, but mostly younger children and even toddlers (kindergarden music ed). They're a private business, but recently they started pinning sheets on the wall in the waiting room. One I noticed now that breaks my tolerance for bs is a claim that masks can lead to death in children.

I don't know how long it's been up there but it's simply wrong. I know from before that they are sliding into conspiracies.

Background: 
My employer (piano teacher, as am I) and I recently got into a small discussions about mask as one of my students had an encounter with someone who was infected with covid. Ling story short that prompted my employer to start sending and forwarding me messages with out of context quotes from scientists and super conspiratorial, almost Q-anon territory. I argued against it and was threatened my job in return.

Today with her husband I spoke out against pinning those fear mongering sheets in their waiting room, cuz it's nothing but bullshit and was told to ""fuck off, asshole"" after I didn't take the petty, disrespectful insults after I spoke up.

I know that those two are a bit of a lost cause at this point. My parents (students of theirs) also receive the same messages, and if they do that to my parents, I'm 90% sure that others who get similar stuff.

Now the question:

What do I do? I don't want them to spread disinformation and possibly cause parents to fall for the same crap (they also anti vaxxers). This is fearmongering in the waiting room with young children, most of whom can already read and for sure would he terrified to read that wearing a mask could cause them to die. 
I'm going to sit down with my parents, but what are dome of your ideas?

Tldr: employers are anti maskers, anti vaxx and slowly slip into Q-anon territory. They threaten my job, be petty, and downright insult me when I say anything against them. I can't just switch employers either. For the rest, read the question right above.

416,"I have been struggling with keeping myself together for long before quarantine, i feel lonely even when surrounded by friends, i feel sad even when i laugh at a joke, i just feel bad overall, i dont want to burden my close friends with my bullshit because quarantine has takes a toll on all of them.

I tried talking woth my parents like a year ago but its like they dont want to understand, my dad just keep repeating the same like he is stuck on a time loop “when i was younger i had it way worse, i honestly dont know why you are feeling bad, i had to take care of my brothers and sisters and bla bla bla...” he just dismissed anything i say, but then he keeps repeating that mental health is important and to talk with him if needed.

My mom is a similar case, she just says “i hust cant understand, just do what you are supposed to do, if you have to study then study, if you have to do this the do it” she says she cant understand and will refuse to listen to me for more that a minute or two at a time.

I dont have the will to do anything anymore, i cant force myself to study, i do homework like half an our before its due, my sleep schedule is completely fucked up (its 5AM rn and i wake up at 7AM, i have an exam tomorrow) and i end up sleeping the whole day away, there is nothing good going on and there has never been anything good going one since 4 years ago when i was  15 i feel like i will blow at any second now.

417,"So I've been having a really nasty infection for the past few weeks and nothing really makes it easier. I haven't been able to sleep for a few nights now because of the itchiness. After not having been to a gynecologist for almost 10 years (I'll be 24 in a few weeks), I have finally decided to bring up the courage to book an appointment. I kept postponing it because I was scared and ashamed and anxious about it but I'm finally going to do it. Anyway, my mother is an absolute satanic hellspawn and she has been controlling my every single action ever since I was a kid. She gets to know where I go, who I go with, how much I'm gonna stay, etc. When I was a teenager she used to read my texts without me knowing and she even stalked me when I went out at times. She always questions me about every single thing and gets extremely pissed if she doesn't know every single detail of my life. I will not go into specifics as to why I haven't move out (mainly financial reasons) but this is how things are for now.
I really wouldn't be comfortable sharing aspects of my intimate life with her so I'm trying to hide this from her. In case she finds out she's going to give me a speech probably about how she thinks I sleep around with random men (when in reality I haven't had sex ever since I was 19) or guilt trip me and make me feel guilty for it. I know her and I know I am going to get bombarded by questions once she finds out I'm seeing a gynecologist. It's not her business and I don't want her to know about it. I don't feel comfortable sharing intimate stuff with her because I know what kind of person she is.

&amp;nbsp;

Any idea how I could hide this appointment from her? What could I tell her? The 'going out with friends' excuse isn't working because I have no IRL friends and the only people I get on well with are online friends. She also knows I rarely go out and whenever I do it's usually for serious business such as work-related issues (but my country is in lockdown because of the pandemic so I don't work for now). I can't think of anything that would work. Any ideas?",12Nov2020,1

Also, I feel like I've been forgetting things more, like leaving my keys in my flat because I thought they were in my bag, forgetting to lock my door, forgetting whether I brushed my teeth, washed my face. Small things that I pretty much do every day. And then me and a friend are looking at getting a house and I couldn't figure out which building it was that we were looking at despite the building we were looking at having a TO LET sign out the front. I'm worried something is seriously wrong and I need advice on what to do.",12Nov2020,1
421,"I never thought I would have to write something like this as I hate drama. I am 30F, Fiancé (F) is 26M. We’ve been together 5 years. Other Bride (OB) is 33F, Fiancé’s Cousin (FC) is 24M. They’ve been together 1 year. I don’t want this story shared or published or made into videos or anything like that. 

F&amp;I have had date X booked since July, and this has been common knowledge since before OB&amp;FC set their wedding date. OB was aware of my exact wedding plans as I thought she was my friend. 

My wedding is going to be a ‘corona’ wedding. Legal ceremony only so my fiancé and I are married, and that’s it. It’s only a 30 minute ceremony, but it’s still considered my day. 

OB and FC have got two wedding days. One two days before my day (legal bit) and one on Day X (they also want a religious thing). I know it’s selfish but I’m so annoyed as that’s my wedding day which they were aware of. I’m not having anything after this, even when corona is gone, whereas they’re planning other wedding party celebrations on top of that. So I foolishly hoped I could have that one day to be mine. 

FC and his side of the family were unaware of the dates until they were booked as it was OB planning and booking everything. OB has had issues with most of the family before, but never before with me. 

However it was announced in a group chat about their dates and they had the two dates written but in a confusing way so it looked like a typo. So we clarified and they said it was just the legal date, two days before ours. Which is fine, and so it seemed like maybe it was just a misunderstanding. 

Me and F saw FC and his family for a bit like a week ago and they apologised for the misunderstanding and said they didn’t know and they were so apologetic. They implied the thing on date X (my day) was a consideration, not a done deal, as it was only a religious thing. I should have double-checked properly, since they’d also apologised so much which I guess I was confused about if it wasn’t a done deal it’s fine right? So that’s on me for not checking. Maybe I could’ve asked them then if there was any chance they could change it? I don’t know. That would’ve probably been my only chance to do anything about the situation without drama. 

A couple of days ago, OB messaged me asking me how wedding planning was going. I told her it was all going good, and clarified my wedding date X. I also made a point of saying I heard you’re getting married on day L (two days before) and congratulated her. She glossed over and ignored where I mentioned my wedding date and went into how it was confirmed about the date X for herself. She showed no acknowledgment of it being my day as well or anything and didn’t offer any kind of apology like ‘oh sorry I didn’t realise, my bad’. Even if insincere, it would’ve been decent to do so (though booking her day on mine wasn’t exactly decent either, and even if she forgot my date she could’ve checked with me again). If it’s booked, I can’t REALLY expect her to change it to be honest (as nice as it would be) but an acknowledgment and apology would’ve gone a long way with me as I would’ve felt at least like ‘okay you’re acknowledging the situation and that what you’ve done isn’t right’. 

Then, because I wanted to check if it was a case of ‘slim pickings’ due to the pandemic, which I would’ve understood, I asked her why she chose X for her religious thing and I also said in the nicest way that I found it a bit awkward she was doing this on the same day as me (though since her legal thing would’ve been two days before, I personally feel she could’ve waited as she would’ve been married technically for two days already) and she didn’t say anything about it being a lack of choice and again didn’t acknowledge anything about my wedding. She just said she wanted it close to date L and she wanted a weekend. Which means she had other choices. Again, no acknowledgment of my wedding. She then asked me why I picked the date X in sort of a ‘well why did YOU pick it’ tone -which rubbed me the wrong way as I’ve had this date booked a lot longer than her and it felt like she was trying to feign ignorance. She only booked it two weeks ago, whereas I’ve had it since July. And I explained very nicely that we’ve had it since July, and we picked it purposely not to clash with anything else. She then responded being like ‘yeah we checked too and it didn’t clash with anything so it worked out perfectly’. I felt this was rude as obviously they didn’t care about clashing. At this point I was so angry I took screenshots so I have evidence it she ever tries to turn this on me, but I deleted the conversation and have been ignoring her since. I want nothing to do with her. I showed the conversation to my fiancé, my housemate and my sisters as they are always brutally honest with me since I don’t always realise it if I’ve been too blunt or aggressive and they are always brutal enough to bring it to my attention if I have, but even they said I was calm and polite while still getting my point across and OB was being horrible and rude about this. They said it’s very clear how badly she came across, but they’ve also told me that what’s done is done and I need to forget about it. Easier said than done. 

So the advice part. I love my F’s family and have no desire to cause drama for them as they are peaceful and loving people, and they’ve never had family drama before. Like ever. I know they would back me as I’m in the right and have been around a LOT longer than OB in the family, but FC and his parents would be in a tough spot since FC loves her and is going to marry her. I already know what my options are if I do want to fight fire with fire, and it wouldn’t be hard for me, and I also know that while F would support me unconditionally he would be upset inside as it would be drama for just one day (no matter how important to me and him, it’s not to anyone else really). 

I have decided to be the better person with how I deal with the situation, and just go the ‘being civil but not nice when I ever see OB’ route which will hopefully be only once a year at most. F was about to contact FC and create the drama himself, but I told him not to as I know he’d be so hurt doing it in the long run as it would ruin his relationship with FC -but he wanted to do it for me as he wanted to protect my feelings. I just felt it wasn’t worth unleashing drama in a usually dramaless family over this. 

The advice I need is how to deal with my anger. I’m trying to deal with this as best as I can but I feel angry at how she spoke to me and her lack of acknowledgment of the situation, I obviously have wounded pride as I have never before allowed people to treat or speak to me like that (my normal response has always been to give a scathing shut-down reply and cut all ties because who has time for people like that?), and the fact that I feel she’s taking advantage of my love for my ILs, that she’s (quite frankly) being a b*tch and trying to strong-arm me even though I could fight back very easily if I wasn’t concerned for my ILs being put on the spot. I mean in all honesty there’s nothing they could even do as they’ve had no say in OB’s wedding planning decisions anyway, and it would just taint the entire wedding for everyone anyway. Plus I’m trying to be reasonable about it being one day and I do know realistically it will not take away from my actual wedding. I’m trying to be reasonable and considerate, but I am so so angry. 

I do have diagnosed mental health disorders and no means or money for immediate therapy. I’m still on a waiting list for free therapy through our healthcare system in my country. How do I cope with my anger and hurt pride? I also want to know if I’m being unreasonable. I also would love any advice on how to be civil when I see her because I wear my heart on my sleeve and I find it hard to control my facial expressions or body language around people I don’t like. If people ask me about the tension, do I tell them the full story or a cryptic ‘she was rude to me so I’m keeping my distance’ one? I’m very bad at this kind of stuff, so advice would be great. 

Please be honest but not rude. I’m also going to delete this after a few days as I am paranoid about discovery even though I’m using a throwaway. Thank you for reading and for your help. :)",12Nov2020,1
422,I recently met this guy I really like and have been getting closer to him over the past couple of months. I wanna date him but always feel like I'm not ready to get into despite him being a great guy and meets all the traits I want in a partner. The problem is that I have this HUGE fear of being cheated on despite never being in a relationship or ever dated someone. I feel like this mainly stems from how my parents both cheated on each other and both held grudges and projected that on to me how relationships are bad and a waste of time and growing up I think I subconsciously took that as the truth.  It didn't help to know that outside of my family like relatives and friends also had a problem with cheating whether that was being cheated on or cheating on someone. So I was hoping if someone knows what I could to help this problem and overcome it?? I REALLY like this guy and wanna make this work.,12Nov2020,1

I just bought my first house and will be moving in in the next few weeks. I met one of the neighbors briefly after my first viewing of the house and she seemed like a nice, older lady who likes to keep to herself. I have not met the neighbors on the other side but I think they are an older family (as in, parents with older teens/early 20's kids). 

I want to introduce myself formally to both, as I will probably be living beside them for a few years at least. I am not the kind of neighbor who wants to be social all the time, I actually prefer keeping to myself mostly, but I would like to put my best foot forward, and also make sure they have my contact details (this can be a lifesaver in case something was wrong with the house if I'm away). Without sounding like an antisocial bitch: I'm a little antisocial and like to come home without having to have a 20 minute conversation in my front garden. 

Normally I would probably bake some muffins or something to bring over, but we're in lockdown and I don't feel comfortable giving people food I made (as those are high-contact items) during this time. I also don't want to splash out on something expensive as that would feel ridiculous to me. 

Tl;dr: What is an appropriate gift to give to a new neighbor so that I'm not just moving in without so much as introducing myself? I'm not looking to be best friends with them, as I like to keep to myself, but I want them to have a good impression of me. What would you think is appropriate?

425,"So i’ve been a transformer fan since 2016, and well recently i realised that no matter what i do i’ll never be liked there. 

I’m primarily a fantasy fan and a lover of mythical creatures like dragons etc, so of course i would incorporate that into tf in my own ways. And also a huge love for evolution topics so that also was included. 

But when i showed these ideas to my friends in the fandom, or god forbid the fandom itself, every idea was laughed at out of the room. Even my friends had no hesitation in calling it cringe and stupid. 

Transformers truly helped me through the darkest time in my life and i still truly love it, but it’s not fun anymore when i can’t share things i made without been laughed out of the room. I’m sad without it, but even sadder when i’m interacting with fellow fans. Infact the only time it brought me pure joy was when i was 16 and had no real interaction with the fandom yet.

427,"I’m really scared I’ve upset my best friend of nine years. She’s been so good to me, she’s always there for me, and I feel like I’m letting her down. 

I moved out for my first year of university. I had good flatmates, good friends, yet I hated being away for home. I acted self destructive, and cut myself off from all my flatmates, to the point I’m not even in contact with them anymore. I wasn’t really to I’ve put. 

So for second year, I moved back home. I only moved out first year for the full experience, and can commute relatively easily, so this isn’t an issue for me. This was a good decision for me, especially with Covid and everything being online. I feel a little lonely, but I think everyone does at the minute. 

Once lockdown lifted for the first time, we met up and talked about our third years. She hasn’t moved out of home yet, to save money, and was interested I moving out for her last year. 

At first this seemed like a great plan. I could be near my university friends, close to the clubs, and near university for doing my third year dissertation. However, we decided not too, as we want to save money to eventually open a far when we are older (but random, I know, but it’s a dream we have). 

However, she’s now interested again in moving out. I said I was wary, because of university potentially being online again next year (Covid is really bad in the UK), and being isolated due to this. I said I was open to talking about it, but my experience last year really scared me. 

It hasn’t been that long since I sent the message, and she normally doesn’t answer my texts for hours. However, I’m scared I’ve upset her. I just feel like I’m letting her down, and I hate that.

429,"Background:  


19, UK.  
I was kicked out of the house in mid 2019 when I was 17, I was then taken into supported housing via the ymca where I was taught some basic stuff and given shelter. After turning 18 I was transported to something for adults which is basically just an apartment but more leniant financially.  
My only source of income is PIP, 500 pounds a month I get for my combination of anxiety, autism and possibly (the following are not diagnosed, but I am unable to seek diagnosis at this time) ocd and something that prevents me from concentrating on tasks normally, like add as I find myself unable to consistently do even things I want to do. Unfortunately because of this I lack any skills beyond the absolute necessities.  


My family was kind of insane, doing things like putting me in homeschool where I wasn't taught anything for over three years. Because of this when i finally got back into highschool I was severely socially stunted and developed a form of agoraphobia. In addition I found it difficult to study for even minutes at a time, and lacked any previous knowledge of the topics and had trouble memorizing information. Because of this I failed in every course. I then spent a year in college re-doing those and got a B in English and a C in Math and Science.  


  
I study games design in college, not because I have any interest in creating games as a career (Though I'd do it in my own time if I could) but because I wanted the skills it taught and didn't have the qualifications to pursue computer science. I hope to re-take the Math test necessary to pursue computer science someday (The minimum grade is a B).

  
Quarantine:  


My flat has yet to get wifi installed, this wouldn't be an issue if it weren't for quarantine. I was relying on mobile internet, which cost a lot of money per gigabyte and thus made me extremely anxious everytime I used it. I also lacked anything else in the house, so any entertainment or any studying came with the knowledge that I was using a limited, expensive resource. I ended up missing almost all of my online classes, becoming more and more aware of my slipping grades. And unable to do anything about it without freaking out over my lost time, I ended up developping an even worse than before habit of procrastination, using my limited resource of gb for things like entertainment. (Partly because there wasn't anything else to do besides sleep)   


Eventually I managed to obtain an unlimited plan, but this was several months too late. At some point in quarantine this all cascaded and I went from sleeping 10 hours a day to sleeping 12-14 hours a day, just doing nothing when I was awake except procrastinate, dread what would happen when quarantine was over and also I developed a habit of obsessively thinking about my mortality. Now that quarantine is over, I am not only severely behind on everything, I am also next to incapable of doing additional work. My attendance has dropped to below 50%, I find myself wholely unable to concentrate on, well, anything. The fact that I have over half a year of missed work AND I can't even make myself do something about it is incredibly frustrating. I just don't know what to do anymore and I feel like a loser. Like I have no future at all.

430,"So I’d like to start off by saying that the only issue I have with him being gay is that I am very much into him. To be quite honest I just want to know if I should move on or not.
So I (F18) have been living with my roommate “Justin” (M21) for the past few months. He took me in a little after lockdown started when I was kicked out and things have been smooth sailing since. We spend a lot of time together and we have never had an issue with each other (I supposed this isn’t entirely relevant I just thought I’d give some backstory).
Anyway, we came home at the same time today and he had his friend “Mark” with him (who I have met before, we’ve even gone out as a group multiple times before). We sit in the lounge room and chat for a bit before I say goodbye and head off to an appointment leaving them alone watching tv. I end up sitting on the phone in my car for about 10 minutes before heading back inside to grab something I forgot. When I go back inside, the movie they are watching is paused (where it was when I left) and they are in Justin’s room with the door closed. This in itself is a little strange as Justin NEVER sits in his room. We always sit in the lounge room as it has the only tv in the house. The weird things of note are:
1. Literally the only thing in his room (apart from clothes) is his bed. He has no other furniture, not even a bed frame)
2. His phone was in the lounge room so his only other source of entertainment was in another room
3. We have previously discussed the possibility of Mark being gay
4. It was weirdly quiet (I thought it was weird that they were in the room so I made a little noise to let them know I was home and they didn’t come out or make so much as a peep)
I know it’s likely I’m overthinking this but I just know that this behaviour is so out of character for both of them and I want to know if I am barking up the wrong tree. 
TLDR: I came home to my roommate and his friend in his room (that he never goes in and only holds a bed and no other furniture or entertainment) and they made no noise at all while I was home.",12Nov2020,1
431,"Hi yall

So I have a virtual presentation on a scientiffic paper I need to finish for my college class. We’re supposed to record the presentation and upload it. I unfortunately have never been very good with presentations, they make me extremely nervous and I frequently freeze up. Unfortunately even though this one isn’t even live, I can’t seem to get through it. I thought it would only take a few hours, but now I’ve been at it for a full day. I know what I’m talking about, I just can’t seem to get the right words out, so I’ve been constantly filming takes piecemeal all night and have already cut countless failed takes.

434,"My ex girlfriend broke up with me and moved out 8 months ago. She moved to another state even. Well she left some nice things with me that she won't get and she refuses to talk to me. I am being nothing but civil but she just is done and im sure she's avoiding all the feelings that might come rushing back if we did talk again. Anyway. 

She left a brand new mountain bike which was worth about 900 dollars and she used it once. 

She left an older model van that she bought for like 3k 

I could really use the money if I sold these things because I lost my job due to corona. 

Or I could sell for what I can get out of them and venmo her the money. 

What I want to do is say ""fuck you, you left, you won't answer my emails or texts, I'm keeping the money"" 

I don't know what to do and it hurts. Not over her yet but I know there's no chance again... She won't care that I did the right thing... She probably already assumes that I just got rid of her stuff anyway.

436,"I’ve been spending almost everyday in my uni’s library for the past three months. And 50 or so days ago, I started to noticing the girl who sits near me everyday. I soon had a crush on her, even though I can tell she’s like super straight(I am gay). I really tried not to look at her so that I wouldn’t weird her out. But she was always in my sight and every time I look up, there she was and I really can’t help it. But I never stare at her more than 1 second. Every time I bump into her in the hall or really anywhere, I would avoid her and look elsewhere even when she was looking at me. There was one time when she sit just next to me, and I felt that my heart is gonna explode and I had to hide my smile so hard. I soon realized how sick and immoral this obsession was and decided not to look at her again, but in vain. I did told myself that I had to stop this obsession, so I may have or have not sometimes looked at her like I hated her. Few days after the day she sit next to me, I felt like she had noticed my obsession for she would stop “fighting”with her friends when I pass by and no longer sit on her regular area. I have no idea whether she thinks that I hate her or that I have a very immoral obsession with her. (I am such a sick person, but I do feel bad.)
Now, every time I bumped into her( somehow, I bumped into her a lot lately), I would just be overwhelmed by guilt and shame. This shame is so overwhelming that I don’t think I even like her anymore. I just feel sorry. From the very beginning, i never wanna annoy her or cause her discomfort. Bright now, it became ridiculously stupid.
I really wanna tell her that I am sorry so that I would alleviate this guilt.
Can I write a little note to her? Even though there’s a good chance that I would be too chicken out to give it to her.",12Nov2020,1

our last session she asked if i wanted to stop seeing her or continue because of my progress and i was kind of taken aback cause i wasn’t expecting to stop any time soon and asked if we could continue which she said was all good and booked me in for our next session. as i was making my way home i couldn’t stop crying. i know she’s paid to hear me blab on about my problems but i genuinely see her as a mother figure and i guess i never thought that there would be a definite end to our relationship, which i know is stupid of me.

440,"Sorry for the long post..

Background: I was with my ex for 5 years, we had some good times but during those 5 years he cheated on me multiple times and had no remorse. He would make fun of my appearance and weight (i'm 5'4 and 59KG) calling me fat and unattractive. 

He would police my emotions and towards the end he would refuse to see me if I had eaten too much or not exercised. He would also get offended when I wouldn't want to have sex just after he would tell me i'm fat and unattractive.

Around a year ago I had enough and broke up with him during a phone call where he was shaming me for not working out that day. He refused to meet so we could finalise things in person. Whatever life goes on.

In December last year I sent a message for my own closure saying I wanted to forget the bad and i'll think of him fondly as he was my best friend for 5 years. He replied saying he'd like to try and be friends. We tried and he continued his old manipulative ways. As I had a new job that paid well he would demand I buy him gift and presents. I didn't and in April it all bubbled up and I said we could no long be friends.

Since then he has continuously text, called, emailed, and dm'd me. The general jist of these are: asking for forgiveness a second chance and that he's changed and that he never did anything wrong anyway and he deserves my presence in his life and we're meant to be together.

I keep telling him no to leave me alone and move on. I block him and then he will make a new account or get a new number or find some way to reach me. I'm so sick of it all and every time he messages it make me so angry as he claims he is the victim and I broke his heart. I'm lost I don't know what to do anymore..",12Nov2020,1

443,"Recently I got into an intense argument with three of my friends about what they had said during a movie night. I am completely aware that, as a male, I have privileges and that men are responsible for sexism on a daily basis. Most of the time when someone I know says ""I hate men"" I can understand and usually see it as a way of expressing frustration. 

However, this night I could not discard it as frustration and I let it upset me. So I am the only guy in this situation which might been a factor to why I felt so attacked. The topics they brought up were:

1. Men are useless, they do not carry a child, they do not breastfeed the child they, they do not contribute to society.
2. The usual frustration towards men, where they just express their dislike towards men. (Which I can understand)
3. How society leaves no pressure on men regarding performance, looks etc. (I acknowledge that it is not as much as it is on women, however, I have felt a lot of pressure personally and I just felt like my problems are not real problems.)
4. They also justified and laughed about how one of them had undressed a guy who was sleeping to show off his body. Note that they were not friends and barely knew each other. (This one really got to me because two of them have done similar things multiple times yet they talk about it with pride?).
5. Generally talking down on men (intelligence, dating skills, talking skills, behaving skills etc).

This is however only one example of days which have been similar, and usually I just laugh it off because I feel as a guy I do not have a lot of saying in it. However, after staying silent for the entirety of their rant I said something along ""I think it is quite weird how you can joke/laugh about it"" (referring to topic 4). Do not get me wrong, I consider myself to have dark humor and think that depending on the setting and audience, that most things can be joked about (including stereotypes). But they are so fast to judge a guy or call out on a guy who does something wrong (which is good) but so forgiving when it comes to themselves or other girls doing similar actions. It ended in a discussion where they could not see it from my perspective at all which really surprised me because I expected them to understand a glimpse of it. We discussed most of the topics and they simply said that they do not believe what they have said is wrong. They would have only understood if they had directed it personally to me.

 I called them ignorant and narrow minded, and going to personal attack is usually not the solution but I was really frustrated. Now as we live together the tension is really bad, two of them are not as upset but they still hold a grudge towards me. One of them is completely ignoring me and I tried to converse but either she pretends not to hear what I say or answers very short and concise.  I ended up telling them that I am sorry I got frustrated which really did not help. I just feel like the atmosphere is garbage and that it is my fault.

What I guess I am asking for is am I wrong for getting upset after such a rant? Should I practice not taking things personally? Did I read too much into it? Do I try to say that I was completely wrong? What do I do?",12Nov2020,1

449,"This is going to be a long read, 

During the quarantine period, my skin condition has worsened a lot out of nowhere. After quarantine is over ive been going to school for about 5 months now, everyone has to wear a mask as it is required by law. 

I saw this as a chance to hide my face skin condition. I stopped eating outside because i would have to remove my mask, i stopped attending PE lessons and gave fake excuses like my leg hurts because id have to remove my mask to attend the activites. I quit my club photoshoot in fear of revealing my skin. Im having full day camps at school from 6am to 6pm in a few days and i told the teachers that i wont be eating there for the whole day. 

It just feels devastating, ive been hiding my face for 5 months, i cant just simply take off my mask anywhere now, itd be too shocking to others. Ive been very suicidal sometimes about my skin. Even if i made a derm appointment, it can take up to 4 months before i can meet one(yes its that long) and perhaps another few months of useless antibiotic treatment since they will not give me the most effective stuff at first. 

I dont know what to do with life now. Im getting more and more anxious about the nearing of the day where masks are not mandatory anymore. Im helpless, ive never felt this helpless in my life before. I havent told anyone about this because i dont want my friends to know, i also find it embarrassing to tell my parents that im insecure about my skin. Ive been hiding this in silence for so long. 

Ive tried to love and appreciate myself but i just cant do it, i cannot handle it when people stare at my face in disbelief when i take off my mask and ask what happened. Ive tried to think it out many times and tell myself people wont care about it as much as i do, but theyll still at least be bothered by a bit right? 

I dont know what to do anymore. Its ok if you have no advice for me because ive been hiding this for so long and i need to finally tell someone about it so that people can understand. Ive been suffering in silence for months and i cant take it anymore. Im feeling so sad. I lost so many opportunities because of my skin. Im not living the life at all.

I’m 19F and I’m in a business course which  to get in needing to achieve (60% in all your exams ) I was never academically great with me trying my best and that bieng as well as I could do and I’m happy there I have a Bf who is 19M and is also in a business course though it’s easier to get into than mine we have been dating for 1.5 years with me having several bf before him 

My sister is 18F she is pretty cute though socially she isn’t great but she is smart in her entrance exams she got an average of 97% in her exams and got into medecine in university like she never had a bf and since we went to the same school I knew most guys didn’t like her and thought she was a wierdo plus a nerd she didn’t help herself by just not giving a crap about the country’s culture refusing to engage with it staying more Ukrainian than me 

Quick info about my dad we are Ukrainian he spent 5 years in prison in the USSR is a very built heavily tattooed guy he is a very scary person to see as well as that having served in the army too he’s a caring dad who is raising us alone he however values academic accomplishment and brains the most 

My dad treats me like dirt he always tell my sister he’s so proud of her and that she’s his gem of a daughter and usually gets her whatever she wants like giving her more money than me to spend while he never says these things to me often not bieng happy when I dress the way everyone dresses in this country and not even letting me buy certain kinds of make up even though the one my sister buys costs 40% more 

recently she brought over her first bf a guy in medecine as well he’s decent looking from Russia with them bieng together for about 4 months when they came over she was wearing his hoodie/hat/gloves because it was cold and windy outside and she was wearing a very light outfit while he was just wearing a shirt after he came in he gave my dad a bootleg vodka/moonshine as a present for having him over after which my dad took her bf into the living room and locked the door idk what was said in there but when they walked out 10mins later they both looked like they actually had an enjoyable conversion and throughout the 10 min I heard my dad laughing even throughout the meal my dad was pretty respectful to him with the two of them even parts of dinner speaking in Russian when her bfs Ukrainian wasn’t good enough to make a certain point and after which he let the two of them go off to her room alone and even gave them a bottle of vodka that they could drink upstairs 

For example when I brought my bf over he didn’t get a gift for my dad cause it’s not customary here as well as that when my dad locked himself in the room with him he walked looking very scarred and he told me that my dad had said “you mess with my daughter I will rip off ur head I’ve been to prison and army I know how to hide a body so nobody finds ur corpse” as well as moving towards my bf in an intimidating way he then got my bf to say he will treat me well while on his knees and during dinner he was hostile to him referring to this country and the people from here as dumb/dumpster/uneducated and calling their customs akin to those u find in mental hospitals 

Plus my dad doesn’t let me go over to my bf saying if ur gonna meet that foreign garbage ur gonna bring it here and have it sit waste the space in my house because of this I never see my bf during the night as my bf is afraid of stepping foot in my house 

Idk why he does this why he treats so differently I don’t think it’s just cause of grades but idk why and how to make him treat me and my bf better

Anyway, my boyfriend (M19) noticed this +6500 in the achievement leaderboard of October and has signed in on my account, loaded up the game and switched back to his account to play the games for free to get all the achievements so he can stay 30k ahead of me. He also said he didn't want to be 'beaten by a woman'. He also offered to buy me what he's already promised to get me if I do it for him. 

I've told him to stop this and that I hate him being this competitive because I'm not trying to compete with him at all but every time I load up a game he asks repeatedly if I'm doing it to beat him in Gamerscore or if I buy a new game or play a game I basically haven't 100% completed.

I’ve already posted a cute announcement photo and the maternity photos, since I don’t post anything else really, I didn’t think it would be a big deal.

Well now I’ve been asked in the comments on my maternity pictures about when my due date is. I’ve never disclosed the actual date on social media, just that i’m due in January. I really don’t want to divulge information like that because in my opinion, it’s really no one’s business, especially when the person who asked is someone who i haven’t talked to or seen in about 4-5 years.

I know this sounds trivial and like not a big deal, but I’m super weary about telling people exact dates online, and also I might not actually give birth on the date that i’m actually due, since that’s relatively common.

So how should I go about this? Just not reply to the comment asking when i’m due? Should I pm the person asking and still divulge that information to someone i hardly even know anymore? to be honest I don’t want to tell them or anyone else, but if they asked a question then I feel bad for not answering, even though i feel like it’s a personal choice to not share that.

I couldn’t have predicted that but we’re here now. I asked her to delete her onlyfans because it’s making me weird and she seemed absolutely against making couples content at which point she told me that she needed some time to think about it and went to bed before we could finish talking.

I don’t know what to do. I know I already said it was ok but it’s making me feel weird now so I asked her to delete it and now I feel wrong for standing up for my feelings",12Nov2020,1
467,"My fiancé recently got a new job in his agency that is over four hours away from me. He really wants me to move down there sooner than later. A few key points.

I feel that financially it makes no sense for me to move down there before having a job lined up. I was recently promoted and I now make 13k more than he does. I feel like our future and standard of living depends on my career. I’m worried if I move now I will ruin our financial health forever. It is probably worth noting that this is my first career job after college. I’ve only been working here for a year.

My job can be pretty stressful and demanding. It’s not abnormal for me to have to stay late. On top of that, I commute over an hour one way (I live with my mother to save money for a future house). I am usually very tired and pretty stressed. Up to now, my fiancé has lived and worked about 2 hours away from me. So I’ve visited him every weekend. I will not be able to visit him weekly anymore because I do not think my car can handle the drive that often. 

I try to apply to as many jobs as I can but I honestly do not have a whole lot of time during the week. I love my fiancé very much and I cry everyday thinking about how far he will be from me. I’m even more stressed than usual because of this. 

I estimate that it could take months for me to find a job down there. I have enough saved up to cover my expenses for a good amount of time, at least a year. I know we would both be happier if I just took the leap with him and moved. But is this a horrible financial mistake? There are a lot of jobs in my field in the new city. But I’m just so worried that if I create a gap on my resume I will permanently ruin my career.",12Nov2020,1
468,"I'm 32f, single mother to two young children. 

I have a very small income. It just about covers my costs with very careful and tight budgeting. I'm in a very fortunate position in that I own my own home so that is secure. I have no debts apart from a loan to a family member which I pay bit by bit with no interest.

 We have a modest but comfortable life. Living expenses are low where I live. But I am unable to save towards big things like the kids' college funds or my retirement. I don't have life insurance. (I'm in Europe so we have free health care.) 

It has been my dream for many years to become a nurse. However since separating from my ex husband I've really thought about it and realised I just can't achieve that dream as a single parent with no family support. The night shifts required during training are just not feasible for me. So as a compromise I've thought about dental nursing. It's a two year course and much more stable working hours once graduated. It's not something I'm overly excited about but it seems to be a good career option for me. 

Currently my life is very low stress. I am able to collect the children from school, work on homework with them, cook, clean and do afternoon activities with them. I have time to go to the gym and do whatever I feel like. I get overwhelmed easily by being too busy and find it hard to keep all the balls in the air.

I never wanted my children to spend all day at childcare but I'm starting to accept that I am eventually going to have to work full time. I know my current lifestyle isn't sustainable long term. I have nothing set aside for the future (apart from emergency fund and modest savings) and that feels unfair to the children. But I like the way things currently are. I'm happy, the kids are happy, we have a peaceful and calm home. 

Tl;dr Should I go back to college for a career I'm not very passionate about in order to have more financial stability?",12Nov2020,1

470,"Throwaway account here,

I am a senior in high school and I have really bad issues with a lot of people in my class because of past experiences, as well as the teachers. It leaves me with such bad anxiety that sometimes I have a meltdown when I have to join even a zoom call with them. I take orchestra, and I have never been too fond of it. My teacher is making us choose a solo etude and wants us to perform it with our cameras on to the whole class. In class, I had sent him a private message saying ""Hi (name)! I was wondering if you could let me submit a recording instead? I'm really not comfortable doing this, I understand if you won't let me but I would really appreciate it."" To which my teacher responded by unmuting his mic and blasting me in front of the whole class. I had a meltdown and cried so much my mom emailed him the documentation that lets me do things a little differently from everyone else (it would let me submit a recording). So, finally, he sent an email to me saying I could submit a recording. I have another performance today and I might be forced to present or I can fail, I don't know if he will want to let me record again. Am I just being entitled?",12Nov2020,1
471,"So the title practically explains it.

I, My BFF(Vert) and My Ex(Noir) were mutual friends.

Recently I found out about the truth of How Noir ended becoming my Boyfriend. He was talking to some other guy on his phone completely unaware that I was listening to him. He was telling him How he must get rid of the competition and How only the results matter, not the methods. And he basically began narrating about how he betrayed Vert and got me.

I always thought Noir was a romantic, I mean he wrote me a long poem to ask me to prom and How he was always very protective of me. I felt good. I felt loved.

Apparently he was not. He had a bet with the cool kids that he'd be the first one to sleep with me and take my virginity. How he used Vert's poems and told him how I wouldn't be interested in going to prom with him.

Then he slowly began poisoning me against him, About he was a creep and a problem to our relationship and How I should break off any contact with him.

I was popular in Highschool and later College and word basically spread about How Vert was a creep.

Vert never showed up at the Prom. He exited all of my classes. I began avoiding him because I thought he was a creepy stalker and I shouldn't want anything to do with a guy like him.

When I learnt about this last week, I immediately cut off my ex and All I could think of was I wanted to apologize to Vert. I always had a little crush on him but I feel it is too late now...

I fucked up too bad this time, Vert always was there to stop me before, I feel terrible about what I have done.

Vert basically dipped in the college Social life. He used to be so bubbly. I have tried contacting him but he hasn't replied. I tried sending him a friend request on facebook and Instagram.

I couldn't even recognise him on his profile, he has lost a lot of weight and he's written some pretty philosophical stuff about life and death and How life is meaningless which tbh scared me.

I hope I am not too late.",12Nov2020,1
473,"I'm 23 years old, I have a brain damage that I've got for taking to much LSD, I have a lot of trust issues because of my shitty girlfriend who cheated on me with a lot of my friends and also with my family because any of them never told me on my face that I have a brain damage (I heard them talk a lot about on my back/when they were thinking I couldn't hear them)
All of that shit happened 5 years ago, I tried to move on and ignore all of that stuff hoping that someday all of these thoughts would fade away but they are exactly the same of 5 years ago.

I've already look for help with psychologists and psychiatrists, did that for a whole year and I didn't get any better.

Now life for me it's pretty much pointless. 
I'll never have a nice job or a degree on something that I like cause I'm constantly loosing focus and can't fix information in my head. 

I'll never have friends cause It's pretty much impossible to talk with me for more then a minute cause I'll say something out of context and thinking it's totally ok (it's something like ""do you like sports ?"" ""Yeah, I love strawberry ice cream !"")
 
And the only life I see for me it's work on a shitty job, getting home, playing video games and laughing of memes, cause I don't have a single person that cares about me (and don't get me wrong, I don't blame then for doing that, I'm not angry, I'm just feeling bad because I really fucked up with my life really quick) which it's not worth it to live (let's be real)

I'm already tried to kill myself 3 times and woke up on a hospital bed twice and now I don't have the guts to do that anymore cause the last time I've done it the doctor said to me that I could be on coma or in a vegetative state if I continue trying to do that (I tried to kill my self taking A LOT of medicines with booze)


I'm thinking about on just focus on work, saving some money and going for one of this countries where euthanasia it's legalized. It's that such a bad choice ? I'm from Brazil, could I get to another countrie just to die ?

I don't need advices like ""don't give up/be strong"" And things like that. I just wanna know if I could do something like in the ""me before you"" movie

The next day she gets a call from her friend saying her brother and his daughter tested positive for covid. My mom is a RN so I would normally trust whatever judgement she has on these sort of things, but I feel like she’s being completely ridiculous right now. 

First of all, she hasn’t tried to distance herself from me. I was at a friends house when she found out and still decided to bring me home. Second, this morning she got mad at me for not wanting to go to school because of it, saying she’s gonna arrange for me to get tested if I don’t go to school.

481,"My (23f) sister (25f), we’ll call her A, has been with her fiancé (22m), we’ll call him B, for almost two years. He’s always been a little weird. Anyways, I’m currently pregnant with my first child and B makes me extremely uncomfortable for a multitude of reasons. Just to name a few, he has called myself and my friends “sexy” as well as other inappropriate remarks, cheated on A multiple times, wouldn’t come home from his moms when A was receiving scary text messages that made her scared to be home alone, yells at her when he’s upset, cannot hold a job for more than a few weeks, was on probation for theft and unlawful possession of a firearm which he claims was planted on him, and as of recently was fired from his job and is under investigation (I do not know why, but he was fired the same day it happened, he worked in a psychiatric hospital). 

All of this screams red flags to me. So I’ve told A that he’s not allowed around my child unless myself and his father (21m) are there, can’t hold him, touch him, none of that. Well she flipped out on me. She said things like “you act like he’s going to do something to your son” and “you’re not even giving him a chance”. Mind you, I’ve given him plenty of chances and he always manages to ruin it somehow, I gave him the benefit of the doubt that maybe something had just gone wrong at his work the numerous times he was fired in the past, I’ve helped them with food when only A was working and covering the bills, buying his cigarettes, etc. Ive told her I made my decision, this is my child, and she needs to respect that. Her idea is that I’m saying he can’t be around my child at all, not what I said clearly, and said that it’s unfair that she’s not going to have a relationship with her nephew because of that, also untrue I just won’t allow my son to stay the night there. 

My family agrees with me. Especially since he’s currently under investigation. My step-dad got him that job and had asked superiors if it was something bad but they refuse to answer because they legally can’t. My mom is ready to cut A and B off because of the numerous times she’s helped both of them get jobs, helped with money, rides, food, etc. and they honestly seem very ungrateful for it. Not even a thank you. (But that’s besides the point) 

I can’t help but feel guilty. I feel like I’m basically cutting my son off from his Aunt but I do not trust her fiancé and cannot keep trying to forget the things he’s done. I’ve tried and tried to see past everything but after being fired from a job my step-dad worked very hard to get for him, and being under investigation no less, I just can’t keep looking past all of the things.

However, since the middle of last year, I've all the sudden developed stuttering here and there. It has even popped up here and there during the current school year, while I'm a fully remote student. 

I don't really have any friends these days, well I did, but they were a bunch of assholes so I dumped them. However despite my lack of social support I wouldn't really consider myself a shy person. I don't have a problem with looking stupid in front of people, because at the end of the day school is for learning, not impressing classmates. 

But sometimes while I answer questions the teacher is asking, or asking a question about an assignment, all of a sudden I can't get my words out and my stutter appears. It's not an every day thing, but it does pop up every now and then and it's really frustrating.

We actually used to date but broke up about 2 months ago because my mom wouldn’t let me see him because he has autism, although that particular reason he does not know. We’ve managed to stay friends for all that time and continue to talk every day despite the fact that we haven’t seen each other in person in 3 months..

We haven’t been able to hang out because my school schedule has been so hectic. But we were hoping to make plans to hang out sometime during my Thanksgiving break since we only live like 12 minutes from each other anyway.

Yesterday evening though, my friend texted me and said that his mother told him that he can’t hang out with me anymore at all because she hates my parents. He clarified that she doesn’t hate me, just my parents, and honestly I don’t blame her. My mother is emotionally abusive and since my father is not around a majority of the time, he just agrees with her on most things and moves on. 

Tbh, it doesn’t feel fair to either one of us. My mother may be a huge jerk, but that doesn’t mean that we should be barred from hanging out with each other, my mom wouldn’t even be involved and I could probably get one of my friends to drive me if need be.

I’m planning on moving out of parent’s house sometime before the next year rolls around, as well as getting my driver’s license so maybe I won’t have to deal with all this. I would’ve gotten it years ago but there were a lot of complicated issues keeping me from doing so.

It was then that my other best friend and I hatched a plan to get the toy from my brother (who works in the industry and can get it at a discounted price), split the cost between us, and give it to him for Christmas. 

I looped his girlfriend in on the plan, and had her make sure he didn't go and buy it for himself. Well, lo-and-behold, he went and bought it for himself a month and a half before we could give it to him. Now the three of us are sitting here thinking what the hell we're gonna do...

My brother tells me that these will likely sell in the aftermarket for 3-4x their retail price, so flipping it is certainly an option.

498,"sorry this is really long. there’s a tl;dr at the bottom. 

my best friend is basically homeless so i’ve been letting her live with me while she gets on her feet. i always expected it to take longer than she said originally. she’s not doing great financially so she gives me like $100 a month, buys groceries sometimes, and drives me to work a few days a week when i go in. we’ve always been really close and the dynamic has worked so far. it’s a studio apartment so we’re in one room with no privacy.

i’m somebody that needs like, 10-14 hours of sleep on the regular, and i don’t get it because i work constantly/am in school, so on days off i like to sleep in. i’m also not a nice person in the morning; i don’t like talking, i can be snippy. i know these aren’t ok things but these are things she knows about me and for the last few months i’ve been pretty good about not saying anything nasty in the mornings. 

yesterday we were off of work (we have the same job). she got up at 8am and started doing stuff. i think she was trying to be quiet but she kept waking me up over and over. i didn’t say anything cus i figured she was trying to be quiet. then around 12pm she put the toaster oven back on the shelf, which was insanely loud and not important to do, and in my half asleep state i said “yo why are you so loud” with a lot of attitude. she just said sorry, and at that point i gave up on sleeping. 

after like ten minutes, i tried to talk to her about a dream i had. she had noise cancelling headphones on. so idk if she didn’t hear me or if she ignored me, but she got all her stuff, left the house, and slammed the doors. she came back again, i tried to talk to her again, still didn’t hear me. so i got up and went to my friends house (which i had already planned to do that day). i said bye but she also didn’t respond to me. 

she texted me later asking if i was ok, i said yes, sorry if i spoke with attitude, i’m not myself in the mornings. she proceeded to say i’ve been “off” for the last few weeks and she feels like everything she does annoys me. i asked her for examples but she wouldn’t give me any. so i told her that’s not the case, things have been fine, that it’s been an adjustment for me too so i make mistakes sometimes because i’m not a good person in the mornings, but that i am sorry for speaking to her that way and do actively try to be nicer in the mornings. i said that i love her and we should talk in person cus stuff gets misconstrued over text. she kept saying she put the toaster back because she had a job interview and didn’t want the toaster out (which i honestly don’t understand because it wouldn’t be in the background of her interview based on its placement, and it could’ve waited until i woke up since it’s a really loud thing) and saying i was being “spicy” in the morning. i feel like she knew she was being passive aggressive by ignoring me and then tried to turn the situation around on me. 

when i came home that night she just talked to me about her day like nothing happened, but it felt really awkward, like there was an elephant in the room.  now everything just feels stupid and weird.

tl;dr i yelled at my friend in the morning for waking me up and she got passive aggressive and ignored me after, though it’s hard to tell because she had noise cancelling headphones on. she texted me later accusing me of being annoyed by her for weeks, couldn’t tell me why she felt that way, at which point i apologized.

Recently, (let's say the past 2 months) I've felt incredibly stupid as though I've lost half of my IQ. I'm unable to concentrate at lectures or recall on what I have learned, feeling like a fool when I speak as my confidence on my ability to talk about subjects dissolves. I feel overwhelmed as three large essays sit ahead of me with vast amounts of reading required for each one. Yet I find myself unable to get through a single page. I have zero motivation.

 I have no interest in learning and even if I did, my inability to concentrate leaves me with the knowledge holding capacity of a sieve. Im spending my days in bed wanting to sleep all the time, as the little enjoyment I find is playing on xbox or dreaming, as both provide me with an escape from reality. 

Am I just to stupid for my course &amp; lazy? Or do I need to admit that I'm not okay and need to focus on my mental health. If that is the situation what do I do? Dropping out of uni seems drastic but maybe it's too demanding for me right now. Is there a way I can get myself out of this slump and start enjoying my subjects, learning to my maximum capacity again?

I've never opened up by my mental health so hopefully I haven't been to vague, any advice would be greatly appreciated.",12Nov2020,1

And every evening we sat down together and talked, he constantly gently touched me.  but one evening I asked: ""am i interesting to you"" and he answered yes ""and kissed me.

The next month when I arrived he became very cold and I understood why, in short, he had a that he liked.  I saw from his computer, but judging by the correspondence, this girl was not interested in him (I know that this is not possible, but I needed confirmation that I was not interesting to him) and after that I felt very offended and tried to forget him but.. In september he started back  roll up and now sometimes even writes (before that we did not correspond), I noticed that he deleted her from friends on Facebook, I think that they either broke up or stopped communicating.I still love him, but it seems to me that this is a bad act, even though we are  were not in a relationship.

Long story short he did something horrible in the end. The worst part is after the breakup last year, one of his friends messaged me while I was vulnerable and I overshared for months, trying to prove myself. But I didnt get what I wanted. According to him and his friend he did nothing wrong and i'm a prude. 

I've tried talking to people, it doesnt work. And i'm at a point now where i'm comfortable with myself and being alone. One of the ways I cope is by daydreaming, or just engrossing myself in my favorite videogame. And in my mind i'm in a relationship with one of the characters.

My examiner will be the one moderating the session. He is a pretty tough guy.

Little toddler boy has full access to several escape routes in the yard, including the busy street with tractor trailers. He loves dogs, and can see them from our driveway walking across the busy road. 
Little toddler boy was standing right in front of an open second story window from his room with the screen all the way up, alone, getting ready to catch a ball from his sister who was outside in the yard throwing it to him. I ran inside to alert their mom of the potential death of her son about to happen and she couldn’t hear me since she has ear buds in. It took me several tries, but once I told her she didn’t budge only sending her little girl up to close the screen leaving toddler boy alone in front of the window again. I spoke to dad later in the day and expressed my extreme concern and suggested they keep those windows closed and locked, but that never happened. 
Lastly so far, toddler boy was playing out back alone with a large glass cup, barefoot. He then starts banging the cup against the concrete in order to empty the dirt out if it. At that point I ran outside and took it from him.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure weather this goes here or r/medical_advice but I figure I'm asking for advice dealing with people rather than medical stuff. 

so here's the sitch

im an 18 year old male... and I'm tired - always... its daytime? - tired, woke up from a 17 hour nap? - tired, tired tired tired.

I have an inexplicably inconsistent sleep schedule, from the amount of time I sleep to when i wake up and go to bed

i average going to bed at 6:00AM and waking up at 5:00 but that varies by about 3-4 hours every other day and ill take 3-4 naps in between. i constantly feel sluggish and drowsy - makes having a job a real pain so much so that I got fired (my job schedule was sleep at 4am wake up at 2pm for work and I was always late) I've done the research and this definitely isn't normal and I'm convinced this is some sort of sleep disorder - or multiple.

however my parents immensely disagree and believe I'm just faking or lying. as much as i would love to go have a doc help me out that stuffs expensive and sleeping through my job or being to tired to function properly isn't helping me do that.

what should i do? pardon the but - I'm tired of living like this, i have since i was 5 . constantly sleeping through classes at school - taking naps at friends houses - falling asleep on break at work.

how do i make them see this is negatively affecting me and its not a joke?

519,"I work in the fashion industry, so for the last 8 months work for me has changed drastically. 

I was furloughed from the start of April until end of June. This for me was a hidden heaven. It meant that my normal anxieties disappeared. I had control of my day and I could decide what and when I wanted to do things. It meant I didn't have to deal with people and was able to just enjoy all the things I don't normally have time to do like hobbies and watching tv. Even though I was furloughed I would occasionally have to jump on and do half a day or so of work at the end of each month. Each time this happened I would feel nervous and a little sick, but just put it down to me being out of action and just needing to get back to ""normality"" (whatever that might be now).  

Cut to  the start of July to the end of October I was part time/furlough, meaning I was only working 2 days a week. This for me felt like more than enough. It was kind of a phased return to work so I could build up my confidence again with work, and also meant I was able to adjust to new living circumstances. Through lockdown I moved in with my partner in to our new house, so adjusting to that has been big. 

Start of November lockdown 2.0 began in the UK which meant my part time/furlough terms changed to working 8 hours throughout the working week. In theory this is 96 minutes a day of checking emails, communicating with colleagues and making sure things are ticking over smoothly. 

NOW TO MY PROBLEM: Every time it comes to logging on or going in to the office since start of July, I feel sick, anxious and shake with nerves of having to go in. A lot has changed in the way in which my department works, and a lot of restructuring has happened in the time I was fully furloughed. It's meant that I apparently ""need to get more organised... need to be running things smoothly"" and ""need to sort myself out"". Despite me thinking I was improving, it seems after a couple of positive weeks, there is what I have started calling a dumping week, in which EVERYTHING seems to go to shit, and somehow the fingers get pointed to me. In the dumping week, this can be everything from orders being delayed, to customers taking their anger out on me, to superiors coming and questioning me about projects I'm not involved in, and the best of all, my new sort of manager coming and having a go at me for not fully understanding how things now work. 

With the reorganising and restructuring, the way in which we carry out orders seems to chop and change with every new order. It means that just as I seem to understand a little thing, we've changed it to work a different way in the hopes it runs smoother and works better for us and the customers. With this, I am struggling to get my head around how I am meant to be working, what my work actually entails anymore and how the F\*&amp;% I am meant to be ""organising myself"".

I don't know whether it is just my anxieties getting in the way, or if there is something actually wrong with the way I am working. Whenever I ask for feedback it gets pushed to the side. I am constantly getting the comments from other people of ""we need to show we are doing our best and not making mistakes... there could be a 2nd round of redundancies so we need to put our best foot forward"" and with that constantly in the back of my head I don't know whether I am coming or going. 

Any advice or questions please comment as I know this might be a little choppy BUT I just don't know what else to do.

526,"Hi (this is my first time posting and I’m on mobile so bear with me) so I (17) had this friend let’s call her (17) T. Me and T were close friends until we fell out over a year ago due to her leaving my birthday party unexpectedly and making my friend who just arrived leave with her, about a week later me and some friends were walking to a park to hangout and my friend suggested a short cut down this road. 

I was hesitant as T lived on that road and I wanted to avoid her at all costs but my friend said you’re not doing anything wrong and they didn’t want to walk an extra 20 minutes so, I agreed and we took the short cut. We walked down the road and was near the park when a car pulled up in front of the crossing and T’s parents jumped out the car shouting my name screaming at me. I walked away as I had just turned 16 and didn’t want full grow adults screaming at me. 

Her dad followed me screaming in my as face about how I’ve upset his daughter and I replied “I was the only person who stuck up for her” as T had fallen out with her old friends and they were being mean to her.  I kept backing away and her dad continued to get in my face screaming he only stopped when my friend shouted “F*ck off before we call the police). 

They got in their car and left, we didn’t call the police because I didn’t want to cause a load of fuss and I was shocked at how her parents followed me in their car for 30 minutes. 

Now fast forward to a couple weeks ago T and her dad came into my work (I work in a shop and have been throughout the pandemic) they saw me I told my manager and at the end of my shift her and her dad had made a complaint about me saying I was “laughing with another employee” when I was actually telling my manager about her dad following me. 

My manager understood and nothing else was brought up about the complaint but, recently T has been coming in a lot more frequently and had been staring at me, looking at me disgusted. I even tried smiling at her. At this point I’m concerned as she’s had her parents follow me and made me feel threatened. I often do closing shifts and I’m worried something similar may happen again.

My managers suggested filing a harassment report to the police as they’re worried for when I travel home as I walk and it gets dark very early and I’m very small and I wouldn’t really be able to defend myself if something did happen.

The thing holding the screen and computer together is a bit broken on the left edge, and the black edges around the screen are breaking a bit off, leaving the edge of the screen unprotected. It's been like that for about a month, I put tape on it, it hasn't gotten worse.

545,"Hi Reddit. I need advice on my situation, please bear with me while I explain everything. 

So I am in my early 20s right now, and I've been lying to my parents about what I do and who I talk to on the internet for the past 10 years. I'm not proud of it at all. 

It all started with a stupid blog about video games on which I made a few friends 10 years ago. To be frank... I knew my parents wouldn't approve of me creating this blog in the first place, but I the appeal of it made me do it anyway. I was able to hide it for a few months, until my parents discovered it when they checked my browser history. They were furious, so I decided to erase everything before they could even read anything on it. They were strict and insisted on the fact that I should not speak to strangers on the internet.
Eventually, my mom let me get a Facebook account, on which I could only accept people I knew, which I did, but my mom made a scene once when I accepted a girl who was in my grade and with who I got along well, just because I never asked for permission and never talked to her about this girl anyway. 
I eventually created a Facebook page a year later, without my parent's consent, which allowed me to meet lots of people who shared my passion : it was an amazing experience for young me, I could finally speak about my interests with people who understood. I then decided to open a fake Facebook account using a fake identity to manage my page and meet new people, which allowed me to do so without my parents noticing. I knew they would blow up at me if they knew about it, which is why I kept concealing. That's when I met my first ""lover"". My parents never knew about them. Neither did they know about the ones that followed. After all, if my parents had blown up at me for a blog and a girl I did know, they'd blow up if I told them I had friends on the internet. They'd kill me if I told them I had a lover. 
Well, I guess y'all get the situation I was in. Eventually, I moved to other social media, had a very bad heartbreak which made me want to kms at 16, met pretty bad people that way too. My parents think I've been single since birth. 
Now, on to my current situation. I am now an adult, still living at my parents since it's close to where I work. I've been feeling better.Most of my closest friends are also online friends, to say the truth I must have no more than 3 irl friends, with whom I don't let myself be myself for fear they would abandon me.  I've been with my current lover, who lives very far from my town, for more than three years. I don't feel like my parents consider me an adult at all. I'm still pretty much afraid of their reaction if/when I'd tell them about it.  I don't want to tell them about my previous lovers as it almost always ended badly, but my current lover means the world to me and I've always been feeling bad for concealing their existence from my parents. Telling my parents would mean that they'd realise I lied to them for more than 3 years. I'm very scared of their reaction, even moreso since I've not been getting along well with my mom since lockdown started. But I really want to tell them, especially since my lover wants to send me a present and I just can't bring myself to say no again after all these years, and I wouldn't be able to say ""well, I ordered it, duh"".
All of this makes me feel like an horrible person, an horrible lover, and an horrible child. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't bring myself to feel anything more than self loathing and guilt. Everything's been weighing on my shoulders for the past 10 years, and I feel like I could break any instant. 
What could I do? 

Thank you for reading this far. If you need any other piece of information, I'll try to answer as much as I can.",12Nov2020,1
546,"I(23M) got into a crash the night before Halloween. Other guy was 100% at fault. I had to be cut out of the car and brought to the hospital. I sustained a minor back injury which has caused me a good amount of pain but its healing slowly. I do need a cane to walk around the grocery store for the time being. My car is totaled and I also had personal property that was damaged but is currently being appraised by an independent repair tech that I chose.

They called me today and I'm getting $1300 for my car which is 500 more than I expected. They also said they would cover my medical bills and they gave me a rental car on monday but I have to return it by this upcoming monday. I'm relatively happy with how I'm being compensated as of now and dont really see much issue. It's annoying that i have to go buy and register a new car but whatever, i wanted a new one anyways. My mother on the other hand says that because the crash was so bad and i could have been killed, i should lawyer up and get more compensation. I dont really see a point because the lawyer will take half of it anyways. I'm not a money hungry person but my mom says it's not being money hungry, it's about getting the compensation I deserve for all the trouble I've been put through.

My wife and i are in the middle of moving and because of the back injury i cant lift anything and will have to hire movers. It's an expense that we really cant afford and I'm likely going to have to forgo my Christmas bonus from my work to go to movers. I also did have to miss 3 days of work but I had sick time.

-Google Photos has had been acting strange lately, by keeping pics in the same folders they were downloading in even after moving them with an app like Google Files, only updating the directory of the picture.

My grandparents are very traditional Alabama Republican Christians and have been critical of my life decisions. 

My wife and I have been discussing not celebrating Thanksgiving for three years. We have let my mother know this many times too. I had not spoken with my grandparents before this email. This, due to my mother saying, ""don't cause any trouble. "" 

The meat of the email I sent:

 ***""It is coming from a moral standpoint as to why we will not be celebrating. I'm not here to preach or tell you what to believe. The decision to not celebrate Thanksgiving is just a personal decision.""***

I **love** getting together with family, just not under the context of Thanksgiving. My cousins, brother, and uncle, and aunt are cool. 

That all said, my email was short. It was a group email, and I didn't feel I needed to explain it too deeply. Just stated it is coming from a moral standpoint.

I am a caretaker for my mom. She has had several strokes that have left her cognitive function fucked. I get her email to make sure past bills aren't getting missed out (She made a series of terrible credit decisions before realizing she had strokes, then she had a significant stroke, and we realized this). 

My mom received an email from her mom this morning. 

***""has &lt;OP&gt; lost his mind?? What is going on with him? It scares me that you have to live in the same house with him.*** 

***I am very disturbed that he has this attitude. Love, Mom""***

That is my grandma. I'm a bit perturbed and unsure of where to go. Every email I write doesn't seem to come out right, and I think that's because I'm torn on how to respond. I want to respond in light and love. But have no idea how. 

My grandparents and I haven't been on favorable terms for seven years. We do not see eye to eye with care for my mom, but they help very little. I drop my mom off with them for a few hours every other week. 

How do I respond to that email? I want to respond with love and light. This email isn't a personal attack on them. I didn't get ugly. I will continue not to get ugly.

I (M20) have been talking to my best friends housemate (F19) for the past couple of months. Although she is usually very shy and can be a bit awkward, we got on really well and share some common interests and it doesn’t feel awkward with her at all. I feel there is a bit of sexual tension between us, with a lot of intense eye contact (something I normally struggle with), physical contact (mainly when drinking) as well as our friends making jokes about the situation in front of us. We have also spoke with each other online, despite her saying that she finds it difficult talking to people online, the conversation flows and she also keeps the conversation going. 

Her best friend, who also lives in the same house, spoke to me privately and told me that I should ‘make a move with her’ and ‘she’s been expecting me to make a move’ as well as ‘you won’t get anywhere just talking to her’. 

I haven’t really had a chance to ‘make a move’ apart from the first night we met, when after a party it was just me and her chilling on the sofa at 3am talking, but I was far too drunk and it’s not really my style anyway (on the first night). The other time we have spent together has been in social settings with other people around, and the times we have spent together alone is usually just the day after a party and we’ll sit on the sofa talking to each other but it’s not really the right vibe or place (with everyone in the house etc) to ‘make a move’. 

Due to new lockdown rules in my country we’re not going to be able to see each other for a month, so I thought I’d see if she would want to go out for a drink together when it was all over, and I joked that her friend might stop pressuring me then. She seemed oblivious to the fact her friend had spoke to me about it and said ‘yeah maybe, I’m just worried it’ll be awkward as you’re around our house a lot’. I understood where she was coming from, although I personally don’t think it’ll be awkward. She told me to message her nearer the date and then we’ll see. 

I’m just confused because I really thought this girl liked me. Do you think that she is genuinely worried that it’ll be awkward or was that just a polite way of saying no? As I said, she can be quite shy so that might be why.

So the problem I have, when they designed my room, they decided to only build the walls only 3/4 the way up because the ceiling is a slope (top floor) and is like 12 feet tall. But another reason they did this is so they could hear everything from my room. I can't even play games on my pc cuz it's ""too loud"" from the downstairs. 

Basically, all I'm asking is that is there any way to suppress noise from my room without rebuilding my room? I'm tired of them listening to my calls and stuff like that. Plus I wanna start podcasting and all the downstairs noise can be heard by my microphone.

He's very shy and doesn't really speak to many people in our year, and he now lives alone.

Due to unfortunate circumstances, I am going to be paying for my healthcare in about a years time. I’m currently on my fathers plan but as I’ve cut contact, that will be changing soon. Over the next 12 months, what should I do to ensure I have health insurance and I’m not committing insurance fraud.

I only know of three options and I have questions for each. 1) Employer/private health insurance. If I were to theoretically accept health insurance from an employer, how would it function? Does it work the same as buying insurance from a company directly? Would I need to cancel my old insurance plan prior or is there an ‘overlap’ period in which I can ensure everything is working fine.

2) Buy from insurance company? This option is the most expensive, correct? It also requires you to cancel your old plan before applying, right? Are there any specific things I should look for within the offers? (18, poor college student getting a plan for myself).

3) Government aide??? I’m not 100% knowledgeable about how this works, but it basically boils down to the government helping pay for insurance plans provided by insurance companies, correct? Is this option realistic? I think the application closes in December for next year but I could do the year after.


Just some more info, if relevant. I’m a poor college student. I make 24k (taxes already counted) a year but the current cost of living for me is about 20k a year if everything were to go perfect (this is an estimate).

Bit of background, I’ve been working at my company for 2 years. Every other colleague is pretty nice and we have a friendly but distant relationship. I’ve never spoken to them about my boss and don’t intend to, so I’m unaware of this is how she acts around everyone.  My boss, let’s call her “Kate” is a very overbearing boss. Despite this I’ve always received good performance reviews from her and she says that I work hard, so I don’t think her behaviour is justified or motivated by my performance. 

However on the flip side, she’ll have moments of outburst of random accusing behaviour that really bother me and I’m wondering if they happen again how I can manage her behaviour. 

Here are several incidences that will illustrate what I mean by accusing behaviour. When we used to work in the office, there was at least a buffer with everyone else so I wouldn’t have to see so much of Kate. Our office is quite large, one day she came in and greeted everyone, I said hello from the other side of the room. She had her head turned slightly but I still assumed that she heard me; since she heard the people next to me. 

She apparently did not; and then proceeded to come to my desk; to ask why I hadn’t said hello to her. I couldn’t be bothered to explain that I’d already said hello, and she hasn’t heard me. I just said, sorry I was distracted. 

That was in the office, now that we are working remotely sadly I have to have more 1:1 meetings with her, and now there are no colleagues to filter the situation. Now that we are remote Kate seems to be obsessed with the idea of checking that we are working. She will call often, multiple times a day, and if I don’t answer right away, she will call my personal number. 

I have been diagnosed with IBS earlier this year and have disclosed this to her, explaining how it may affect me and that I may be going to the bathroom more often, but also how I’m managing it. After disclosing this, a few months later she called me in for a performance meeting, stating that a few times she has tried to call, I’ve not answered with the “excuse” of going to the bathroom. She said it was suspicious and asked if there was another issue going on, and suggested that I might be outside having fun and not working. I felt quite annoyed, and just reiterated that I have IBS and I do not slack off. She didn’t seem that happy with my answer and said that I seem like I am “angry with her.” I remained calm and just explained my IBS situation, and how whenever she calls, I always message her to explain if I can’t take the call because of going to the bathroom, and usually call her back within 5 mins. 

However she also said in the same performance meeting that I work hard and always hand my work in on time; which is a total contradiction to her accusation that I’m not working. 

Because of covid, I have moved back home and live  and my boyfriend and his family. There is not much space, and we often are working in the kitchen together because of lack of space. I have also explained my living situation to her. One time she called me, and my boyfriend and his siblings were talking in the background. She asked me if I was secretly watching TV and not doing work, I was really quite annoyed at this one. Since it was obvious that there were people behind me talking. I had to reassure her that I wasn’t secretly watching television that I’m just in a cramped living space and there is naturally background noise. 

Another time she called me, she said that the last few times we spoke I seemed off and asked if i had an issue with her that I’d like to discuss. I’ll admit I was probably just tired, however she asked me to explain my behaviour, to which I had to reassure that nothing is wrong and I don’t have a problem with her. It is getting exhausting having to be aware constantly of your movements in case she might take offence.

I do have a bit of sympathy for her, she must clearly have a lot of personal issues going on, and clearly she has trust issues. I have heard on the grapevine that her relationship with her family and husband isn’t so good, to which I can only sympathise- however this behaviour is starting to stress me out and I’m finding it harder to muster the energy to go to work. 

I feel very watched and monitored and it’s starting to cause me a lot of stress eating. I’ve already had a look about filling out applications to other jobs. However in the meantime until I find another one, any tips on how to manage her and her behaviours? My boyfriend suggested that if she asks again, I should just confront her and say about how I feel micromanaged. I said I didn’t feel this was a good idea, since it might blow up in my face. She is clearly a very sensitive person and I don’t want to burn any bridges or make my life harder by irritating her.",12Nov2020,1
583,"So lately, theres been a repeated issue of my brother disrespecting me and cussing me out and threatening me and all that in my own apartment, and my moms been backing him up. Whenever I try to talk to her about it she pins it on me and acts like it's my fault for his behavior. I keep trying to discuss it with them but they will not listen to my side.

584,"My best friend of 5 years has always had anger management problems. He used to go to therapy, but I dont think he does anymore. A couple of days ago we were at another friends house and in the kitchen I made a joke about my best friends bracelets while we were talking with other friends step mom. He doesn't say anything till we go downstairs when his tone changes and me and other friend can clearly see he is angry. He pushes me and I tell him to chill out it was a joke but that makes him angrier and he pushes me more aggressively ino the wall and tries to grab me. I defend myself by putting my arms around his neck and punching him a couple of times. If other friend hadn't been there to break it up someone would have gotten hurt.

It amazes me that he gets so emotional over a joke about bracelets. Right before I told that joke he was picking on other friends little sister(who is 12) about being an emo kid. She didn't react childish at all about something more offensive than bracelets, but he(who is 17) tried to fight me over a meaningless joke. 

Also whenever he was leaving to walk home(we all live in the same neighborhood), he threatened to hick and mess up my car. Other friend saw him out to make sure nothing happened.

I haven't talked to him yet because I dont know what to say. He's my best friend like i said. I dont want to lose him as a friend but he clearly has some underlying issues that are contributing to some inner rage.

585,"So a few weeks ago I bought a new induction hob because my old one was getting a but worse for wear, and when it arrived I installed it in my kitchen only to find that this £1000 pound hob didn't do what the adverts said it did - it was advertised as being able to heat any size of pan, but when I tried to use my super large (35cm or smth I cba to go measure it) frying pan, it heated unevenly and us basically unusable... On these grounds, I contacted both the company who made the hob and the store I bought it from (bosch and currys respectively) and neither would accept the return. When I looked up the law it said that if an item is unfit for purpose then I have to be allowed to return it, and looking up the definition, this hob is deffinetly not fit for purpose.

588,"Hi all,

Long story short, I was falsely accused of sexual assault my first year of college. It ended up being investigated by the university, and they found me not guilty. After that, I struggle with mental health and image issues to this day. My degree program is small, so I was forced to sit in discussion classes with friends of the person who accused me, while they treated me poorly and rudely. I let everything drip off my back, as to not bring more attention to it.

I am in my last year of university now, and I need to open up to some of my mentors about this. I'd like to have my scholarship extended another semester if possible for me to finish my degree, as some coursework fell short during the time where I was focused on the legality of the whole issue, rather than my studies. I didn't feel comfortable opening up about it before but I need to face it and seek help if I am to move forward.

The university offered me nothing after the case, aside from offering free counseling opened to all students that ended up being a horrible expirence. I was told to ""man up"" and ""just move on."" Obviously they had no sympathy for me and it hurt. Walking down the halls knowing and thinking that everyone has a different image than you really does a number on you. Thankfully I still remained successful in my field, but the image of myself that I have haunts me every day.

My question is, I need to open up and explain my situation to my close mentors and advisors at the university, but I fear ridicule given the context. Any advice on how to bring up the situation, to whom, and perhaps words of encouragement might help too. 

I feel lost. 

Thank you all.",12Nov2020,1
589,"I like a boy, a lot. And he would like to like me too. But he's in a phase of his life where 'emotions' don't come naturally, or seem appealing, or just something he feels right now. But there is still an understand from both sides that if things weren't so, we'd have something so special.

While attending high-school, I was offered the ability to attend a Technical school for three years. While orientation day happened, I was thrilled to get into the program I chose because of my small background with image manipulation software. After getting into the program the first couple weeks went smoothly, however I started to notice little things that the instructor was doing that didn't make him so perfect.. These events got worse too throughout my 2 years of attending the program. After graduating from the program I began to contact my classmates to talk about these problems. It turns out, I wasn't the only one experiencing these issues, in fact a lot of the students had similar challenges they were met with from thee instructor. Students from over 5 years ago in the program said they faced similar problems. Additionally, after graduating I am still in contact with some of the students at the school who are saying it's only getting worse. Challenges of the instructor being judgmental, controlling, homophobic, and misconduct.. I have never felt closer to my peers before by talking about these experiences.

I don't know where to go.. I don't know who to talk to.. But I want to talk to someone about this. Within that environment, creativity is limited.. Freedom is restricted.. learning isn't tangible. My previous instructor does not have a teaching license/qualifications to be an instructor, yet he is allowed to be around young teenagers. He lies about the program, saying they do this and that, yet they don't.. He drags out assignments that he created from well over 5+ years ago that are outdated, and have no curriculum backing them..

I’m at my wit’s end. This applies to his entire side of the family, TBH. But I’m focusing on his mother for this post.

Im constantly feeling as if my husband humors me by saying he agrees with parenting decisions, but will not stand up to his mother, even when it’s risking making things harder for us.

Some core examples:

When our son was 7 months old he developed GERD, our PCP warned us to never bottle feed him lying down. Whenever I picked him up after work, she would have him lying supine in a basket, with a bottle propped up. I told my husband this, and he never confronted her about it, and told me it’s probably not that bad.

With both children, I had c-sections. My husband implored and insisted we live close with his mother for help, but she only showed up once those first six weeks, never showed up at all with the second baby. She told him she could only help if I would bring the children myself. I was walking down three flights of stairs and walking 4 blocks 3 weeks postpartum just for her for to watch the kids for no more than 2-3 hours. Needless to say, recovery took longer. He told me since she doesn’t speak English, she doesn’t feel comfortable coming to the house. My mom would drive an hour out 3 times a week to help out.

(By the way, I’ve personally made a point to study Spanish long term, to be able to comfortably talk to her.)

Most recently, our youngest was diagnosed with autism. His sleep patterns are TERRIBLE. We’ve agreed that he should never nap past two,  but she has consistently let him fall asleep around 5 pm, and then he’s up until 11. I work at a hospital and I’m getting up at 5 am, and so is he. You would think he would bring this up, but nope.

He makes a lot of excuses for her, and it’s one of many things eroding my respect for him because he won’t even stand up to her, even when it comes down to the kid’s well being. We’ve been married 7 years and I’m tired of feeling I’m just nagging and looking ungrateful. I shouldn’t be made to feel because I’m the mom, I do all thing child-related on my own. (We had a fight and he said that in his culture, men work, women care for the kids alone, and his mother has a hard time breaking away from these norms.) These may seems like stupid, minor examples, but I’ve tried everything to make sure I’m not forcing him to choose between us and his mother.",12Nov2020,1

624,"To set the premise, I’m 16 years old (she/her) and I have a younger brother who’s 12. My parents have been married for the past 20 years. I’d say I have an average relationship w them as would any teen, love them and hate them. But to be 100 percent honest I’ve always liked my mom more. 
They aren’t in a physically abusive relationship and never have been but it’s pretty obvious they’ve fallen out of love and are just together because I guess they don’t mind it. We live together with my fathers parents, which is the norm where I live, India.
My dad, however much he tries to play it off has anger issues and he’s super dramatic. Loves shouting, loves being right but isn’t a fundamentally bad person (kinda?) but I’ve always sort of hated that about him. He loves his alcohol and as I’m typing this is at a bar with a friend (more on that later).
Today morning I had his phone with his outlook app open for a password reset email for our account that we share of The Economist. I couldn’t find that email so I opened up his other emails (he has a few, work/personal) and I saw one that had like a weird abbreviation of his name with my birthdate and month so I opened it out of curiosity. I found emails that linked that email id to his accounts on sites like SeekingArrangement.com, AsianDating.com and another one with escorts. The weirdest part is all his usernames were abbreviation of either mine or my moms name, or my brothers. 
To my knowledge they weren’t spam emails. They were password resets, payment or membership confirmations and stuff. A few were open. 
I have confronted my parents about divorce a few times because he can get emotionally abusive and controlling w my mom when he’s drunk. They’ve been to relationship therapy. My dad has mentioned stuff like “your mom is the one I want to grow old with, girlfriends are temporary” in passing and I’ve always assumed that was a random thing that didn’t mean anything. 
Obviously my parents relationship w each other is their private business, but before anyone says anything I’m not sorry I snooped on my dads phone. If my mom and him are in an agreement of some sort of open marriage then I don’t give 2 shits. If not, that’s troublesome. 
There are a few things I’ve thought of. 
For some reason my brain decided to note down his username for each website he was on. Somehow if I can confirm he is having some sort of extra marital affair without him knowing I’m going to my mom first and asking her if she knows. If it’s a yes, then the matter ends. If not, it’s her choice how she wants to deal w it.
I don’t want to confront him, especially right now with no proof. 

PS- my mom (in my opinion and also I think it’s obvious) has lost feelings for him, he’s still “in love” or whatever.
A divorce would 100 percent impact my family not in the best way. Both of them are working and earn their own separate income but according to my knowledge my dad does earn more and pays our school fees. Not that my mom doesn’t have the capacity to
At the end of the day this isn’t my decision, but I feel like I have to at least talk to my mom about it if not my dad. 
She is not the kind who openly shows her emotions and has remarkable control over them. An extremely strong woman. My dad has no chill.

626,"I graduated from college 3 years ago with a degree. The jobs that I could find with my degree that paid livable wages were in sales and customer service positions which meant calling people all day. 

I tried working in these jobs and living on my own, but the nature of being on the phone all day, talking with people who most of the time didn’t want to talk to you, or didn’t ask to be called, made me really depressed. I could tolerate the job for 3-4 months and then around 6 months it became unbearable for me, or my mental health felt so bad and I ended up resigning. I tried several of these jobs thinking the next one may be different. 

Not finding professional stability, I moved home in my rural hometown and worked a part-time warehouse job. The company said they had full-time work but really the part-time work was so physical that it was impossible to go full time. 

Now I’m 25 and living at home with my mom. And not sure what’s next. After another phone job not working out ( became depressed and resigned), I am thinking that I should apply back to a warehouse FedEx job and work there again part-time, and try to either get another degree or find another way to develop professionally. 

I’m at a weird place in my life. I’m still living in my hometown, working at a local warehouse job. I believe I am a good person and have good traits.

628,"Hello there people,

Firstly I want to introduce myself and give some background information. I'm 23M living in Germany. I come from a financially stable, christian, working class family but I'm atheist and am the first in my family to visit a University. I've completed my A-Level, I'm currently in University studying physics and I would consider myself as an extremely rational thinking person and science driven person.

So to begin with: I haven't feeling myself in the last 2 years. It's been a process in which my positivity towards things and the joy of doing things has been spiraling downwards gradually. I don't feel any joy, I don't enjoy things I enjoyed in the past and I just don't care about my surroundings and myself anymore. I see anything as a chore whereas in the past I would enjoy things. My sleep schedule is messed up, I can't motivate myself to study (I am in the process of dropping out of University) or even just do daily tasks.   
I just don't care.  
I wouldn't consider myself to be depressed or anything because I don't feel sad or angry, I just don't feel anything particularly. There are some things that bring short term joy but in the end I end up feeling nothing.   
I haven't showered in probably 3 weeks, I haven't shaved/cut my hair in a months, I sleep with my clothes on because I can't even go through the hassle of changing clothes. I sit in front of the computer and browse the internet and play games I used to enjoy all night long to just let time pass. I don't go out as much with my friends (I'm using Covid as an excuse to not go out for a smoke or whatever) and I'm at a point where I view going out with my friends more of a chore than something I generally would enjoy. My family isn't noticing any of this because we're all overworked and struggling because of the whole Covid thing and I really don't want to talk to them about it or to get them involved.

I'm at a point where I'm seriously asking myself what the hell is wrong with me. I've had a supportive family, great friends, no childhood or adolescent trauma or anything that might contribute to the way I'm feeling lately. I don't think that I need professional help but I'm weirdly starting to worry about myself because I'm starting to feel guilt and starting to dislike myself because of the way I currently am.  


I don't know what to do because I'm really really struggling to sit myself down and start to fix this.  
Can anybody, maybe with a similar experience, tell me how to get out of this hole I put myself in.

631,"I feel conflicted. I have dropped my friends for the similar reason above. The big event was with this one friend. ""A"" the friend I dropped, ""O"" my online bff and bf my boyfriend.

Friend A I have known since primary school but I wasn't close until high school. I practically became family and so was she. I was invited to her home and her family loved me especially her little sister and mum.

Friend A was in a bad relationship and had family issues. Her ex was mentally and physically abusive that would manipulate and gaslight her. She was blinded by love. At times she was done with him but came back and convince he had changed when he was sweet. I was her bff. I was also her ex friend. I encouraged her to break up with him as he has so many red flags. I became involved with their relationship when I didn't ask to. She would bring up my name in their arguments or beg me to show up to his house with her to mediate their argument. I didn't know what was going on at the time as she didn't tell me anything much. I went over and ended up having a busted lip.

Friend A is selfish and tends to make me worry alot. At a birthday party she disappeared from the friend group and went missing and we had to search for her everywhere only to find her at the library, crying and eating a cake.

I stopped talking to her because of her reckless actions. I became friends with her again when she told  me about the severe abuse that her ex had done. Including the following; taking a picture of her and blackmailing, videotaping her and laughing at her while sending  it to his friends. I was distraught and I came to her care.

We had agreed to never fight ever again over men and to value our friendship. Before we get a partner we would test them for any red flags. Basically girl code stuff. I then introduced her to O my online bff and the trio became inseparable.

A and I got off bad relationship but I insist that we chose the wrong bunch and men aren't all bad. Swiping through Tinder I noticed that she had a type. That was her ex. Blonde, blue eyes, nice teeth, etc. I told her to explore her options. Tinder became a joke until I found love and I now have my current bf. As prior to girl code I tested him and he was approved. Soon he became part of the group.

Me and my bf have a healthy relationship. A has admitted she was lonely and wanted a bf. She met a guy on Tinder and spied and followed to keep her safe, of course to her agreeing.

On the day of the date she exposed me and my spying was ruined and she asked me to join her date. I was livid but agreed. Soon I then realised she asked me to come over and lead the date for her and she walked ahead from us. I called out to her to escort the poor guy only to have her say that she is bored and I had to end things for them.

She complains about male attention but refuses to block them even when I offered to do it for her. I soon realised she like the attention.

I get pissed as I feel like I am being used to do things for her. She is dependent and can't do anything for herself.

Few months later she meets a new guy on Tinder she supposedly likes. I told her to not let him drive her home so he doesn't know her address. I later found out He goes to a private Catholic school, the same as my ex.

We later found out that he is transphobic, homophobic and dishonest. A refused to acknowledge the red flags and proceeded to see him and the relationship was moving very fast. A's mum believes that me and my bf relationship made her want a partner. In the end he drove her home because she was lazy.

O, me and my bf discussed the issues with the guy she is seeing but she is in denial. In the end we supported her regardless. We voiced our concerns that the relationship was moving too fast and already she is meeting his whole family line.

A's family has a gambling issue especially her mum. The issue cannot be solved as A's mum uses another friend's membership to gamble. A was upset and went outside alone in the middle of the night leaving her sister at home and went to the Tinder guys home and told her family situation to them. 

I was livid yelling at her for being irresponsible and selfish for leaving her little sister at home with no one and she could have gone to my house. She told me I was being to insensitive and it wouldn't hurt to be nice. I was distraught at her behaviour. 

A few days after A and her mum got into a fight as I was told by O. Her mum was upset at her Tinder date for giving mooncake after Moon Festival which is cheaper. In our culture it means that you look down on someone. Her mum hit her and destroyed her phone. She bit her and threatened to wear a ring and scar her face. Swore in front of Buddha to disown A. A packed her luggage and I took her to my place. A's dad and lil sister went to grandma.

A's used my laptop to contact Tinder Guy and she begged to give him my address to talk to him. My bf came over to observe them. They talked and A asked Tinder Guy to drive her. I assumed it was a short drive but it was an hour. They came back to my place and he took her luggage and drove her back home where he apologized to his mother. Me, O and my bf found it very manipulative. 

I was angry that a guy she barely knows can convince her to do anything but her bff for years she won't listen to me. She and Tinder guy are officially a couple. But the thing is Tinder guy declared it himself and immediately started to post pics, add initials etc but she went along with it still confused with her feelings. I sensed it was one-sided. 

I dropped her and stopped being friends with her and she still doesn't know the reason why even know I told her countless of times. Not because of the guy she is currently dating but her toxic behaviour. I recommended her therapy as it helped me but she refused.

I felt that being around her made me toxic and I was taken for granted and  didn't feel like her bff. She was dependent on me and used my name to excuse herself out of bad situations or to get what she wants.

I later heard that Tinder guy lied to her saying to have dinner at his place to only be confronted by his parents. Saying that they don't like her dating their son as she is from a toxic household but will accept because their son loves her. I find it ironic saying that they don't judge as they are Catholic but judge her and assume that her and her family are the same.

I feel alone and question my thoughts whether it was a good decision for me to stop being friends with her. Was I being a bitch? Was I insensitive? Was it wrong of me to feel this way?",12Nov2020,1

So I’m like wth , I try everything I’m not even thinking straight I’m just trying to get my computer back on. So after 45 min I notice the power cord plug was out so I’m like damn, I restart my computer and it takes a sec so it comes back on slowly but surely. And I get a message from my irritating ass boss. “Is everything okay I noticed you are still signed in the meeting and we are done. What’s going on?” Just a whole lot of bs so I tell him. 


Then he yesterday he asks me to go into a meeting with him and I’m like obviously it’s about what happened. So he he starts bringing up bs and is like well I also wanted to talk about what happened yesterday. I swear I hate being bothered with bs I already explained to him what happened so why go over it again . Anyways he gives me a write up to sign and I’m like ok I guess that’s fair for what happened. Wasn’t my fault but I’m not about to argue with him. So he asks me to sign it and send it to him. 


So I try to sign it but the file wouldn’t open up it won’t let me sign, I’m like I’ll deal with it later I had so many calls coming in.

Due to COVID we all left school without saying byes so I never got to say bye to this one teacher. And he didn’t go to graduation. I had him as teacher for one year but knew him for 3 years of high school, talked practically everyday. Made jokes, kindly made fun of me, was very funny, nice (at times lol), the list goes on. He made everything better. He always helped me even when he wasn’t my teacher and stayed after school at times to deal with me. One time I visited him between classes and he even said “would be better if u were here” well maybe he was joking so I said “stop lying” and he laughed lol. Crazy how a teacher could be so comfy around u, normally he is very careful, from what I’ve seen he doesn’t even like to tap on people. This one girl when she was leaving, she placed her hand on his shoulder and said she was gonna miss him he just said “don’t touch me”. But yet he always tapped, poked me and one time playfully slapped (very gently don’t worry) my face. There is too much to name what all he did. But made me for comfortable. Even when mad at me (has quite a short temper lol) I don’t mind it (well depends, only one time he made me really upset). He said I was the best student he had all year, that is what he said in my yearbook. And the class I was in was his worst class he has ever taught he claimed. After school ended, and before my graduation I emailed him a long appreciation email, never responded but my other teacher said he did see it. So all I ever think about now is, why? He was weird trust me on that, but obviously never did anything wrong. My shoe accidentally touched his foot one time he said “r u trying to play footsies with me?” There were moments like that where it felt weird. I did develop some feelings, (but not until quarantine happened) and now it’s been 7 months since I was last in school. It makes me feel awful and I think about it everyday.

638,"Basically I want to fake my own death because of issues with my relatives,  I want to run away from them but I would feel guilty if they knew that I ran away. My mom is not the kind of person who should have children, she's way too unstable and frankly it's starting to get scary. I've been brought up in a highly traditional conservative and religious household so I have certain beliefs engraved in my mind despite the fact that I personally find them ridiculous. No matter how hard I try I just can't be fully rational. My family is muslim and in our culture it's a shame if a girl disobeys her family. In my case obeying my family would be getting married to a man from my country, having children and just being a housewife until the day I die. Not only is that a lifestyle that I'd hate to have but also I'm a lesbian. 

My worldview in general doesn't align with my family's cultural values. Honor killing is a thing in my culture and it's something that I could experience if my family found out my real identity. As a 17 year old girl I don't have many rights according to my country's traditional rules, which means that I'm also not allowed to move out and live without my relatives until I'm married. I've heard them talk poorly about women who decided to live on their own without getting married and it made me feel bad. A few years ago I told my mom that I'd like to live alone once I grow up and she got very angry, it scared me so I never mentioned moving out again.

I also have a lot of younger siblings and I always have to look after them, I rarely have any free time. Having to look after my siblings gets in the way of my education, sleep and whatnot. I always try to do my best and I never complain to my family but my mom still treats me like shit; she hits me a lot and says really hurtful things and it's getting kinda overwhelming. I wouldn't mind having to take care of my siblings etc. if I didn't get treated poorly. I'm always nice to my mom and I never display any negative emotions in front of her (since in my culture being overly emotional is frowned upon, plus I'm a 17 year old girl so I'd look stupid being angry, sad or dissatisfied in any way, at least according to my mother). All I'm asking for is not getting yelled, hit or controlled too much.

I really want to build my own life, I could live up to my family's expectations but it sounds so draining. There is a part of me that feels the need to live a traditional life, when I think rationally I know that I'm allowed to live my own way but it makes me feel extremely guilty. My main issue here is guilt. 

Basically if I could fake my death my family wouldn't be disappointed in me, they'd just think I'm dead. And I'd be at peace because I would know that my relatives don't think that I'm a disgrace.",12Nov2020,1

I'm not sure what to do because I'm kind of in a bad situation with trying to get a new place to live and my vehicle is getting to the point at the end of its life where it will need to be replaced soon and it looks like I won't see a raise or promotion from this place because the new expectations are out of my reach. Is it just me? Am I just not up to todays working standards?,12Nov2020,1
641,"I do not want this to be too long so I'll get to it.

I have 6 siblings. Out of all 6, I only get along with 1 of them.

My youngest sister has always treated me as the family ATM. 

She constantly runs to me for money or advice but as soon as her friends come around or she has something ""better"" to do, she acts as though I do not exist. 

Yesterday, she did not speak to me the whole day, yet today she called and asked if I could send her $20.00 for SkiptheDishes. I sent the money and did not even get a thank you for it.

This is a constant thing. To the point where when I'm going to the store, I have to make sure it's when she's not home because whenever I bring her, she throws everything and anything on to the bill which comes out of my pocket and she's never grateful for it. 

Never says please or thank you. Just uses me for my money as I do have a well paying job. 

I'm tired of my sister taking advantage of me and at this point think I do not want any kind of relationship with her or the rest of my family for that matter as all of them are EXTREMELY selfish and have absolutely no problem taking advantage of me and my husband. 

They lean on us for emotional support and run to us for money but never pay it back, never appreciate it and never even say thank you. 

Details: We are half siblings. Did not live together till April of this year and my husband and I intend to leave before January 2021. Same father, different mother. 

Any advice would be appreciated as the reason I even came to stay with them is to bond with them. only to find out nothing has changed and her and the rest of my siblings just see me as an income.",12Nov2020,1
642,"I have a friend, we'll call them X. So X and I met at the beginning of summer this year and we played alot of video games and spent countless of nights together of the phone and we just got super tight knit. Come end of September we started hitting bumps. They wanted to watch Netflix together and I agreed it was something I wanted to do, but I'm the type of person who sincerely does not have a good attention span to binge watch 1 full season in one day, and that upset them. It because all they wanted to do with me and I sorta wasnt into it. 

Still I tried for us to talk and ignore the tension of that want and pay attention to new things we could do. In october they told me that our friendship (with natal and astrology charts) would be going through a heavy strain. While I like astrology, I believe that everything is at the end of the day what you make it and your actions determine how close you get to what is being predetermined by these alignments and such. 

I didnt think anything of it till the emotions and strain turned real. I had no clue how to deal with it. But I knew one thing. I wanted them close, I wanted them to know I still thought of them even through the upset, I would message them atleast once a day or every other day.

It was only ever me reaching out, me calling, me texting. And I felt so left in the dust. I blew off on them the past two days, because I dont understand why they are letting this cycle purposefully damage our friendship. The cycle isnt tying their hands together, it isnt doing anything to make it so he cant reach out to me. So for a full month, hes done nothing but sit back and act cheerful with the rest of our friend group and be more social active in the group with everyone but me. 

And I give up. I dont feel wanted and what we had seems too far away to ever reach again, I feel like strangers and it's so ridiculous. When i messaged them they word for word said, ""I've been waiting patiently for the cycle to end"". That just made me even more upset and now I'm simply cutting all contact with them. My friends however say I'm overreacting, I'd like some other perspectives I dont have many friends and their opinions are biased.",12Nov2020,1
643,"I (F/44) have been with my husband for seventeen years. We share three children, two of whom have intellectual and physical disabilities. For his job, we emigrated to Germany, which has been great, I'm not unappreciative of how much stress it takes off of our lives not having to worry about the children's health insurance. But it has been hard, not having extended family. And in my situation it is really difficult to make friends. I used to work. But now, I am paid as a care giver for the two children who need it. That allows me to give my time to the people who need me. I thought I would miss working, but I don't. In hindsight, the career I was building (in academia) was pretty stagnant and took up a ridiculous amount of my time and I made less money than I do now (academic adjuncts are virtual slaves, read up on it some time.) My husband was very supportive of my career. He is in the same field, but has always been more successful. He recently got hired for a permanent post with tenure and all kinds of other good things are happening for his career. It was a dream come true for us, we went through a lot of years of anguish, so we know we're lucky. 

Now to my problem. Even early on, when we had no children, what we fought about seemed to have a pattern. He would come home from work or wake up in the morning out of sorts, and if he was having a good day, everything was fine. But if he'd had a bad day, or was feeling stressed, he'd berate me for the state of the apartment. To him, it was always filthy. It was never clean enough, and 'enough' was 100% a subjective judgment by him. He would say, over and over, that I did NOTHING around the house. At first, I did what a person might do. Tried to attack the substance of the argument. I did things, I'd say. He'd ask what, ask me to cite specific examples. Interrogate me. Then he would return to his sweeping generalizations that I never did anything. Often, he would move on to criticizing other faults. In his mind, I secretly hated his family. I wasn't helpful enough. I didn't do what he told me to. 

Finally, I got tired of these stupid fights and I told him that if he found the place unacceptable, he was welcome to keep it up to his own standards. He is from North Africa, where the custom is, the men work, the women stay home and the house is always cleaned, every day, before the man gets home. Either by wife or daughters. His mother and sisters didn't go to school or have jobs. I had a doctorate and was constantly working, doing research, teaching. He had never even considered this in his assumptions. I told him if he wanted a woman to clean for him, he could have had that kind of wife. 

It seemed to me that what was actually happening was that he felt entitled to vent his stress by criticizing me. But lots of people do that. But he refuses to take any type of criticism and, by virtue of his talents, he's always gotten a lot of validation from his family and colleagues that he is perfect. It was so hard to deal with, I went to a therapist in secret for a while, when our graduate school had that type of service for free. 

This same behavior turned to other topics over the years. He suffered a prolonged job loss, through which we had to live with my dad and step-mom. I worked whatever jobs I could to support us while we both applied for academic jobs. Everybody got along very well, actually. We're all still really close. But during these two years, privately anyway, his depression or stress, or whatever made him turn into that person, was who I was dealing with most of the time. He was barely able to enjoy anything and hardly ever wanted to be social. He was never cruel in front of my parents, they both think he's great, but whenever it was just the two of us, he would sling out baseless accusations. The most frequent one he fixated on was that I must be happy living there in poverty, maybe as a way of saying I wasn't supportive enough.  

Then, he got a job, and I thought this depressive streak was over. But it started again when we moved overseas. He had the unbelievable stress of things like writing grant proposals, producing research and the like. So the criticisms would return. I tried to tell him that I was feeling lonely and his unkind behavior was making it feel worse. Instead of listening, he'd heap more criticism. I hated his family. I never supported him. I didn't clean enough. Add to that his criticisms of how I handled the children. He got even more reckless, accusing me of somehow causing our oldest child's disability. Or that my efforts at building a career were worthless.

Every time, I dealt with it the same way. I'd give him a few days, then pretend as if it never happened. I'd tell myself it was just the stress talking. 

The last five years, he has been out of the house for six months out of the year traveling for work. Even when he was home, he chose to work long hours in the library, sometimes staying away overnight. He works better at night, so he was spending his days sleeping and his nights working. I never had a problem with it. I am a former academic, I know how consuming the work can be. Gradually, though, the children started to put it together that the house had a lot less yelling when he wasn't in it. They started to say they didn't like it when he was home. I told my husband that it was heart breaking to hear that from them, I didn't want that. My husband told me that this was my fault because I must be criticizing him to them in secret. His cited example was that his son thinks he has a huge ego. But anyone who has ever met this guy knows that is true. Children have their own eyes and ears. 

Now the criticisms have transferred to the children. Our neurotypical child, who is a very smart kid, is getting the brunt of it. His father wants him to do well at school, so he yells at him about bad grades. Our son now hates school work, which has led to some failed tests. My husband thinks yelling at him and criticizing, and even threatening to throw away all his possessions will make him learn. Instead, our son deliberately digs in his heels and refuses to listen. Both of our verbal children come to me and say things like they don't like their father. I try to find positive solutions. or ask my husband to find a different way to deal with them, he tells me the child's problems in school are all my fault and that I am 'teaching them nothing'. 

With corona, I spent six months as the home school teacher, doing all the school work (in German). The criticism of everyone has been amped up. He had to work still, on publications and research. He doesn't travel now. His yelling at the kids is an every day occurrence. I tell him he is doing himself no favors, he often says he doesn't care if they hate or fear him, just so they do what he wants, school work and keeping the house clean. If I ever try to talk to him, I can expect to be insulted and wish I hadn't. 

Just today, he gave me an earful about being 'too nice' to the kids and ordered me to stop doing things with them that are fun, because they hadn't earned them. But they are children and they only get one childhood. Happy memories are way more important to a childhood than math tests. They are empathetic and kind and really well behaved and extremely helpful with the third child, who is non-verbal. 

I am posting this with my little throwaway account because I have no idea what else to do. I can't talk to my family for various reasons. I don't really have many friends. I have absolutely no one I trust to talk to to get some perspective. I have already told him I think he should do something about stress and depression and that there is no shame in it. But of course, he thinks he knows better than everyone, so he does nothing and nothing ever changes. What can I do? I know we all love each other. I just feel like I am collapsing under the weight of never being able to do anything right.",12Nov2020,1
644,"College student here! 

The initial college transition was a bit rough for me, and honestly it still sort of is. I feel like I'm really really starting to realize how short life is, and how everything moves by so fast. I've heard that the days go by long and the years go by short - I think this has a lot of truth.

It's something I've been struggling with recently. Everything feels very temporary. Relationships fall out, people move around the country all the time, and even your family, the people you think will be around forever, eventually will pass on too. I'm starting to dread the afternoons, because seeing the sun set is kind of another reminder that the clock is ticking and life is going by so fast. People may say I'm young: but to that my brain responds with ""Sure, but in two seconds you'll blink and you'll be thirty. People will keep saying you're young you're young you're young until you're not young anymore. You can keep telling yourself you have time, you have time, until you just don't have time anymore.""

I've found myself searching online for stories of best friends staying friends forever to console this existential anxiety that I have. It feels like I need sort of constant to alleviate this fear, but that doesn't make a lot of sense because there aren't any constants in life. Then that sort of snowballs into, ""Your time on this earth is very limited and insignificant. Soon you'll get old, you'll die, then soon be forgotten.""

I feel like maybe what I'm saying has a bit of truth to it, but it's really negatively impacting me. I try to keep myself busy and call friends when I'm feeling this way, but sometimes I'll even be surrounded by friends at dinner or in class and it'll still occupy my mind. How do I fix this? Dude, I have tests and exams to study for!! I can't afford to continue pondering this question and making myself sad when there is work that I need to get done! I feel like I expend a lot of mental energy being worried about this and if I'm going to live a happy full life, I need to get out of this mindset.

Sadly earlier this year my Grandpa passed away. It was sudden and we were all so sad to lose him. He was a wonderful Gramps and is missed very much.

663,"Hello. New to reddit and English is not my first language so I am sorry for mistakes. Throwaway account.

Today I was cleaning in our old house and went through a sealed envelope which seemed like it could contain DNA results based on the company address. I have two sisters (older and younger) and since the younger was born I was always suspicious she might have a different father. My mom had several affairs for approximately 5 years when I was a child until my sister was born. As a kid, I hacked my moms social media and witnessed it all (also saw her kissing one of the guys in our house on my 10th birthday). However, I know it might be hard to live with my father sometimes (he is a workoholic and barely at home) and they got married right after she graduated high school so I eventually forgave her and let the affairs go (I tried to confront her as a child but I couldnt do much obviously). Anyway as I mentioned I was always a little bit suspicious but always let it go. But today I found the envelope addressed to my father from 10 years ago. My suspicion grew even bigger and I opened it (I know that I invaded his personal space by going through his personal stuff). And I found out my dad is indeed not my lil sis father. I dont know who the father is, even though I have some tips.   
The thing is, what do I do now? Obviously my dad knew for over 10 years (I dont mention our ages on purpose, but lets say he did the test a few years after she was born) and I guess he decided to let it go because he stayed with my mom and he is taking care of my sis. He even busier than always and now quite old but I can say he is trying to be a good dad to her as he was to me and my older sis. Do I tell my dad that I know? We are really close and I dont want to break his trust if he finds out I went through his personal mail and opened it even though it was sealed with his signature over it. Do I tell my mom? (I am sure my mom knows who the father is, but I am not sure if she knows that dad did the test). Do I tell my older sis? (She has her own family by now and lives on the other side of the country. In the past I thought about moms infidelity but later I found out she doesnt.) Of course I dont want to tell my younger sis at least until shes adult. Reddit, what do I do? Should I pretend I never saw it?   
I guess at the end it doesnt matter because my father decide to ignore the test result.. but I feel so much hatred towards our mom right now. (When I was a kid I found some after sex pills in her purse so why did she went through with the pregnancy I dont know). Also I feel so sorry for my dad (I was at high school when he found out and I had no idea what he went though). I also feel sorry for my sis. I cant imagine what she will go though once she finds out in the future.   
I feel so bad about finding the envelope and the truth. I wish I never went there in the first place. Our seemed to be perfect family suddenly seems like a broken one. Of course nothing will ever change my relationship with my sis but how can I face my mom now? She wakes up every morning knowing the truth...   
People in similar situation please let me know how did you cope with it. It it very hard to keep it as a secret but I dont want to cause any family drama when my dad knew all along and decide to keep it to himself. Thank you.",12Nov2020,1

666,"Like a lot of students, I’ve been doing online school since around March. It started that when we did classes we would just have to check in with a teacher for around 15 minutes. Then, we would go off and do our work. I liked this schedule because I could get my work done in about two hours and then still have time to do what I wanted to do. When September rolled around The schedule changed. My first class started around 10 AM (so at least it wasn’t super early) and we’d be on Google meet for around an hour and 45 minutes with a mix of being lectured and doing individual assignments. We did have to keep our cameras on so I didn’t like that much, but it was understandable and I think it made the teachers more comfortable. After that, I got around an hour-long lunch/exercise break. Then my next class which is usually joined at 12:50. This class lasted till 2:20 and was pretty much the same, a mix of assignments and notetaking. Then I got a study hall which lasted until about 3:15. My final class was a PE class which I don’t think is necessary for a virtual setting especially considering that we had to be in the class for an hour and 15 minutes. I think it more efficient way to do it was to just give kids an exercise log but maybe they just needed to give the PE teacher something to do. I liked this schedule a decent amount. I sometimes felt like I was being micromanaged which wasn’t necessary for me, I’m a pretty Self-motivated person but I understood that school had to be more structured.

However, recently our schedule has changed once again. It starts at 10 AM just like last time and then I have an 80 minute class of lecturing and individual assignments. And then given a five-minute break to get onto my next 80-minute class. After that, I get a 30-minute “brain break” Which I thought would be the opportunity to crash for half an hour however we have to choose between journaling and doing puzzles and other things along that line. Which I might enjoy if I hadn’t been doing work for the last two hours and 40 minutes. Then I have to do a 30-minute guidance course of sorts usually filled with useless quotes on getting work done and surface-level stress management strategies which is ironic coming from the people who are inducing stress but I don’t mean to sound complaintive. I understand I’m privileged to have the opportunity to even do online school because some students don’t have access to the internet or computers. After that, I get a 30-minute lunch break and then I’m on to a 30-minute study hall but instead of my study hall mean individual this time I have to be on a meet.

671,"This is my first post and it's a strange one but I don't know what to do. a few months ago my parents bought tickets to Ecuador for a month and my sister and niece are planning to go with them for winter vacation. I was asked to go with them but I am not sure if I want to go or not. my reasons for going would be to travel the country with a open mind (we did this when I was 5), spend time with my niece and sister, go to the doctor there to save money, and will not be alone for Christmas and New years. On the other hand I would have to spend the holidays with relatives I barely know (I am anti social and don't like hugs that much), possibly get sick from the food, and skip out of two weeks of work (I just finished my 2 week quarantine after getting positive). If I don't go that would mean being alone for the holiday and have to shovel the driveway, but it would also mean I get a lot of freedom and money from work ( I started in June so I don't have enough hours for a payed vacation.).

however, i live with my step mother who is absolutley diet obsessed and is constantly showing me diet fads from facebook and asking me if im on a diet the second i make green tea or skip a meal. i refuse to diet and ive told her this many times.

its taking a toll on my mental health and is making me more and more irritable with her every day. i stopped eating at the dinner table 4 years ago because of her nitpicking my food. 

we have some home gym equipment in the garage but every time ive tried to use them to ease period cramps, move my body after sitting for too long, or just for fun, she begins to ask if im on a diet and then will try to exercise along with me. its really embarrassing and annoying when she does that. shes a bit tone deaf and has rudely asked my sister with an eating disorder what diet she was on (ill give you a hint; 0 calorie diet) and commented on my friends weight after not seeing her for a few months before even saying hello. having weight loss be your entire personality must be annoying.

680,"My Mom has been struggling with knee pain for 15 years now, she had a meniscus tear originally in her right knee. After years of shots and slowly struggling with pain management she got to the point where she could barely walk and it influenced her to finally get a knee replacement. That was about 2 years ago, and it went well. She did physical therapy and about a year later she was pain-free for the first time and becoming more mobile, slowly. 

However, her other knee started to hurt more and more. Her surgeon said it wasn’t unusual for that to happen, and she wanted to avoid another knee replacement and see if she could heal on her own. So she got a private therapeutic yoga teacher, a physical therapist, and was working with an acupuncturist for pain. However, it only seemed to do so much. 

Then COVID happened, and she has been trying to keep up on all these therapies, but between being stuck at home because of COVID (she is 65 and worried about getting it) and the increasing pain in her left knees he has become more and more sedentary to the point where she basically doesn’t leave her bedroom many days. Her doctor has said she needs another knee replacement, and I think she is slowly realizing it’s inevitable. 

Between this recent development and just years of dealing with knee pain, she has just become very sedentary and it’s affected her whole body, she can’t even lift one 8 lb weight. I’m really concerned about her, and I don’t know how to help her or realistically what recovery would like her for.  

Has anyone else dealt with a situation like this? Has anyone had any luck working with an older parent who has made a recovery after being so sedentary/weak? What can I really expect even if she does have a second knee replacement? How can I support her as a daughter? ",12Nov2020,1

Everytime she gets hurt or feels bad about something she'd keep it to herself and never talk about it, no matter how much I try. I should either give up or get mad at her for being so heartless every time.

It's like she has given up on people, cuz she has had a bad past and I understand, but it doesn't mean the people who are there with you now are assholes too. I fucking care about her and I want her to talk, but no, she wouldn't. 

At this point I don't even know if me trying so hard even matters to her. I just feel like giving up, it fucking hurts to see her be like that and that I'm some useless piece of shit in her life.

I get so angry at her, why doesn't she understand, sometimes I don't talk to her for days and she'd get hurt but doesn't say a thing and eventually I have to go back to her and be sorry for being a bitch.

I’m all for self expression, but i believe they think they look so much better, and i want to be able to reassure them they look better without all the extra stuff they have going on right now.

She’s actually an awesome person with a great personality, but she’s just caking on makeup, and doesn’t look like herself.

683,"I'm in a really tough spot with a friend I've known since 1st grade. 

For the past three years, his life has been in an insane spiral of chaos and injustice and dysfunction. He suffers from Crohn's disease and a whole host of other ailments, his mother died from a heroin overdose after trying to pin her crimes on him, and now that he's out of jail for pawning her possessions, he can't seem to get his life together. On government disability assistance and uses food stamps, but still comes to me for money every couple weeks. 

It's nothing huge, usually just up to $50. But I'm not exactly rich and I've probably given him over $1,000 over the last few years, hoping he would use it to turn his life around. I only hear from him when he needs money. He has no job, can't hold one down and hasn't in a while. 

On top of that, he's clearly developed some kind of paranoia and bipolar disorder. He's convinced that his ex-girlfriend and her mother, who he lives with, are stealing from him and taking out loans in his name and somehow adjusting his tax returns. 

I have this feeling that I can't just ignore him or abandon him, even though all he brings into my life is stress and pressure. I feel responsible for this grown ass man and I can't get him out of this cycle. And it's all because he's my oldest, used to be closest friend. 

It feels stupid to gripe about a relatively small amount of money, but something in the back of my head says I'm being duped one way or another. 

He's talked about killing himself, hurting himself, hurting others. And if I'm not there to get him through the next week, what if he does? How does that not go on my conscience?

Fourish years ago I went to the walk-in clinic to get my tonsils checked out. Turns out I had/still have tonsillitis. I got some antibiotics; they didn't go away. Went back to the walk-in clinic, got more antibiotics, after taking them again with no results they suggested I go see my family doctor. I go see my family doctor;  he booked me an appointment to speak with a surgeon. A couple of months later I spoke with the surgeon, he checks out my tonsils, says they need to come out. 

S ""Do you think there could be any complications during surgery?""

Me ""Probably.""  
S ""What makes you say that? Do you bleed a lot when you get cut?""  
Me ""I have bad luck, something might go wrong. It usually does."" 

S ""That's not very optimistic."" 

The surgeon says they're a minimum of a 1-year waiting list, two years go by. I contact reception and it turns out I didn't get added to their schedule/books w/e they call it. They apologize, I get added; they call and say it might be within a few months, then covid started. They called me again to postpone the surgery. I get a call in July 2020 that it's booked for Sept 2020.   


I show up to the hospital, check-in, get changed, answer all their questions, weigh myself, etc.  They're getting ready to put an IV in, someone comes in and directs them out of the room.

S "" Unfortunately we're unable to do your surgery today because we didn't schedule the day properly. We won't have enough staff after your surgery because people will be going home."" 

Me: ?????????????????????????????

704,"This is going to be a VERY long segment but i'll try to keep it short as possible.

Since i was a child school wasn't a thing i really wanted to do, i mean i had ups and downs and i found school sorta fun but im aware i always had grade problems and only had good grades because my mom wanted me to do it.

Im going to say this now, im not sure what's wrong with my brain, something is wrong but im not quite sure what it is, even more mom knows something is off about my learning but my family were never too keen on doctors and she's the type of person to not really care much about if I have any mental disabilities since from her POV im doing just fine and am perfectly capable.

Things started to go downhill after 6th grade when my school offered me a school program that's supposed to teach two years of school in one since my birthday is late which makes me older then my classmates (long story short it didn't work out) and i went to a normal school which i had fun at and am now in the 9th grade.

Since covid came around, ive had to do online schooling since my mom doesn't want me going into the schools because she worries alot about my safety and i don't know what made me think i could do that since i already tried it and nearly failed a year.

I've been online schooling since the start of the year and I've been doing shit at it, my brain can't seem to focus or understand how to do some things, I've become even more depressed then before which is surprising and a record, i can barely get in contact with my teachers, it's gotten to the point where the school has been calling my mom about me not going to classes (because i didn't, i was much easier for me to just go straight to do the work and finish everything then listen to someone speak for 30 minutes before being allowed to do the work), it's also not helping with the trauma I've been suppressing for so many years is trying to reach out since im staying home all day.

To be frank my mom just thinks im being lazy and not trying, she believes im going to fail because i take my GED takes (because she's tired of dealing with me and school) and honestly im just doing my best to make her proud and just keep my grades up high enough to somehow pass.

I've thought of many scenarios i could face, such as running away which is the hardest yet easiest because i generally hate it here and dread waking up the next morning, just dropping out which seems very likely, or clutching it and getting my GED.

Im not sure what other options i may have, i don't know how to talk to my parents since my dad is the homophobic-transphobic-old fashioned type who always thinks he's right and won't even stand for me dropping out since he values education to the highest degree. My mom is the same just more chill and open-minded to things, I've tried to talk to her because but im scared shitless because of pass stuff despite her trying to do better now (trauma sticks) and im pretty sure she won't stand for me dropping out either since she doesn't understand how anyone could get a job or make a living without a GED or high school diploma.

I've talked to two friends about it and they said i should drop out, on even offering to do it with me since most of my friends are failing their asses off. I've talked to two high school dropouts and they suggested i do it and that it's worth it considering my situation.

Overall i don't know what to do and i'd rather run away to canada because telling my mom i want to drop out, it's much easier to do everything in secret/silence but im not an adult and i know she has final say in everything but i don't want to keep going through constant hell to make her proud and live up to the 'smart child' standards she has for me (our family has a history of clutching school and just not liking it overall)

706,"In terms of managing people I've always been pretty good, but now I've got the job everyone knows I've been working for, I find myself getting really nervous when I talk to my team members.

I dont know where this is coming from, I'm not sure if theyve cottoned on since I'm putting on a bit of an act, and they all seem to respect me as their boss, but under the surface I feel really anxious and nervous.

This year has seen a lot of stress for me with things outside of work, and inside work - yes i got the job i wanted, but the pandemic has put huge pressures on my industry and my team.

I guess its all starting to pile up, but I really dont want to be having little anxiety attacks when im trying to talk to people.

Also when people twice my age are asking me what they want me to do, and ive got to make decisions for my team, I become really aware of myself and I'm thinking it's just silly how I'm sat here making these decisions that it just makes me feel really off.

I always have supper in my room and force myself to eat a little but later I flush the rest down the toilet so my mom doesn't see because she'd be concerned.

I don't know why this is happening.

708,"Ok so this is really hard to talk about and a huge no-go obviously. But I don't know how to handle myself right now. I don't want to hurt any animal at all, but my aggression spikes sometimes and I find myself lashing out.

&amp;#x200B;

I have my first dog, he's a large breed and quite stubborn, he's trying to show who's dominant, and I get why, but I don't know how to handle it. I caught myself smacking his butt when he had the zoomies and tried to jump, he hurts people with that, and doesn't listen at all anymore when he's in that state. But this is no reason for me to hit him. I feel awful.

But it's not only that. He sometimes just lashes out and goes completely nuts, chewing on stuff, looking me in the eyes and not listening to commands at all. I tried it with treats, ignoring him, going away, giving him something else, but he doesn't stop. He destroys stuff and so I find myself giving him a smack or grabbing him by the throat even. 

When he woke me up today by chewing on the nightstand, I lost it and shook him by his throat and cried because he made me so aggressive and I was so overwhelmed.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm scared of myself, the last thing I want to do is hurt my dog. And then I thought about it and remembered that I had quite the short temper as a kid already with pets. 

I threw a guinea pig on the wall when I was little because I was angry, and I constantly annoyed every animal to be noticed. Cats infuriate me particularly, because they don't listen I guess. I actually gave away cats that I hand-raised because I could not cope with them when they grew up at one point.

I'm not sure what I should do to possibly stop this. I love animals, I care deeply for them, but there seems to be this awful person in me that is just pure rage sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has an advice on how to handle that kind of aggression, please do tell.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I hurt animals when they get too much for me to cope with. I hate myself for it.",12Nov2020,1
709,"Diving right in,

About 4 months ago, I started a new office job. It pays very well for my age and overall I'm pretty satisfied with it. Since I've started working here, I've fixed, solved, &amp; automated a lot of the issues, leaving things a lot smoother now (I get paid to do so little now). 

The only thing that is different in my workplace is that there's usually a team of people. But it was always just my manager here, for 20 something years.

Describing my manager..it's complicated. He is a manager, but does the work that people like me under him should be doing. He is great at getting work done, but not good at managing. He is nice overall, but that comes with passive aggressiveness, little to no communication the majority of the time, and unpredictable personality. He told me he's had depression in the past. So in conclusion, it's highly possible that he could be bipolar, he exhibits all the symptoms for it.

Examples of odd interactions with us:

For the first month or two he would always say good morning. His office passes my office. Sometimes I would leave work at 4:55pm and he would never be around so i'd leave without saying bye. The next day, he would ignore me for literally no reason. No good morning, no acknowledgement that I'm present. Even if I say bye, but when he shows up in the morning i'm not in my office, that also triggers him to ignore. Recently, I wanted my hours to be 7:30am - 4:30am, but he insisted boldly I must stay until 5pm, literally for no reason. We've talked about it multiple times. But ever since the last time, he is never around when I leave at 5, but goes off to talk to his co-workers right before I leave.

When I first met him, he told me he's not the micromanage type, yet is a huge micromanager. He is an insecure control freak. He watches the times I am active on Microsoft teams, then sometimes gets upset and thinks im not at my desk, meanwhile I'm either doing work, going to the bathroom, getting water, or on lunch. It comes off as he is extremely nervous that I might quit or something. Although I have a hour lunch, I can tell he hates when I go on lunch, the mood is always different. I know he is probably logging every move I make search history wise as well. One time he even claimed that through word of mouth he always knows where I'm going, which I highly doubt.

He refuses to give me administrative permissions to make my job easier, saying ""ill get to it soon"". 

I noticed a trend of when sometimes I leave without seeing him, or leave a little early, I would always be welcomed the next day with my hard drive being corrupted. I take backups so I can easily fix it. Not sure if this is done of purpose or not, but the trend is very suspicious.

One time he wrote up a message in notepad and told me to come over to his desk to look at a new program he had. But the note said ""the upper management would like everyone to stay at their desks more often"". Of course he knew I was going to read it, he just didn't want to confront me over it. Also, i guarantee nobody in upper management said that. So freaking weird.

The first month I was here he had a medial issue, so he wouldn't be in for a week. New and by myself, I held down the whole place. The following Monday I was a little late due to traffic caused by an accident, and he literally went off saying ""I need you to be in during your hours"". Literally nothing even happened to warrant him saying that. No recognition either for doing a great job, alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly after typing this, my eyes have been opened more to how fucked this guy can be. The thing is, the job pays so well, and the work itself is not bad at all. I have a lot of free time. The manager isn't always annoying, being more quiet and really bad at basic managerial communication the majority of the time. Could be a lot worse I guess. He plans on retiring soon and I take his job in like a year, so \*shrug\*. 

Most importantly, what are your thoughts on all this? Any sort of tips, advice, or view points would be great.",12Nov2020,1
710,"Burner account for obvious reasons, and this is a very reactionary post, so I apologize for any weird stream of consciousness word salad. And I will try and answer questions as quickly and concisely as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a little over a year at this point. Plan on living together come around spring time next year in the house I bought a couple of months ago. One of the things we're both looking forward to and hoping that it might fix some of the problems.  


To put it plainly she has problems with depression, anxiety, physical pain, etc. About 6 months into the relationship her problems came to the front. She refuses to go to therapy, and refuses help from anyone because she doesn't want to be a ""burden"" to anyone. To the point of telling me ""I refuse to put you through that"" even though I've stated multiple times it's more of a burden that she don't accept help to those that care for her than not letting them do anything or even doing anything to help yourself get into a better mental state. (I've been to therapy multiple times and am a huge advocate for it.)  


For her perspective on this. She just got hired on at a hospital full time about 6 months ago, give or take. She works 40-45 hours a week most times (salaried), and even though my job is physically exhausting, I don't think I could do hers. Administration is a mess, leadership is a mess, and with the advent of the Coronavirus, things have just gotten harder and harder and as things get harder her mental state just gets worse. She feels working a regular work week leaves her with little to no time to enjoy herself, she goes to work, comes home to take care of her animals, (many), and what with the sun going down earlier, because shes one of the types that would spend literally every day in 90 degree heat (I am not, but have learned to enjoy it with her), her seasonal depression is kicking in. I know this post doesnt make it seem like things are bad, but they're getting bad, and I know ""everyone works 40 hour weeks in the States, get over it."" is something that has been said many times, and tbh at first I was a bit in that camp as well because a lot of times I work 60-80 hour weeks depending on what sort of jobsite I'm on, with daily shift changes, etc. But she honestly believes that she has zero time to do anything. To put it plainly she is at the point of telling me she is contemplating suicide but is trying to make me promise to not tell anyone (I've lost three people in my life to suicide, and am a survivor myself) and I told her I can't promise that, and I'm trying my hardest to get her to call a number her doctor gave her for a psychiatrist because even he could tell shes not doing great, weight loss without being able to afford weight loss, physical exhaustion, mood swings, etc. etc. She also lives alone in an apartment that was honestly a mistake for her to get into at the advice of some family members. It's very expensive, and just not ideal for her, and with her being alone in it, all she can see is how much she hates it there. Now she has been exposed to Coronavirus, as I just learned today, and now we have to quarantine from each other, and will be going to get tested myself shortly. And she is dreading the thought of being alone. This on top of everything that has been happening with her job, has basically been, to paraphrase her words ""I'm literally getting fucked over every day, and every day is worse than the last."" And I'm having a hard time refuting that, just because I see the effect that the shittiness of her job and everything else is having on her.  


  
About a month ago things between us started to slide deeper and deeper towards us breaking things off. She was at my house, locked her keys in her car, and came in and started slamming shit, screaming, and more or less when I called her out on slamming shit in my house, screaming, it was like 8 at night, and I have elderly neighbors, and neighbors with little kids, it more or less broke down into a fight, and she basically blamed me because she was just sitting in her car for 20 minutes outside my house and I asked her to come in. I got angry at that point, and things deescalated until we managed to smooth things over. We've been more communicative lately over what we need from each other, because neither of us are very good at it.. I need her to let me help her, and to tell me when she's feeling bad or in a mental state. And admittedly I'm not the most in touch with my emotions and she's asking the same of me as well as try to be more openly excited and openly enjoy doing things with her (and I've been trying to make honest attempts with family camping trips and hikes, etc.) but when I tell her when I'm feeling bad or what she's doing is making me feel bad she begins to feel so guilty that it almost turns into a guilt trip for me, (her mother and father are masters at guilt tripping, and I've met many in my day.) and even though she's not intentionally doing it, I don't think, It still ends up her feeling so guilty that I feel like I can't even express my negative emotions to her without making her feel guilty and in turn feeling guilty myself. And her still not committing to what I told her I need from her, and feel like I'm putting in more effort than is being given.

The problem is things have been getting more and more difficult between us. About once a week we get into a pretty decent argument over nothing, and to be honest, I can tell its starting to affect my mental health more and more, and has been for months, and I'm starting to feel like the biggest PoS on the planet because I'm getting angry that she's refusing help, and refusing to let anyone help, and basically placing more of a burden on me as the sole owner of the this knowledge that she's having suicidal thoughts, and not seeing a psychiatrist/therapist, or really doing anything to get herself help because ""I don't want to waste the time I do have so I would rather sit here and wallow."" And as I type this I can feel myself get angrier and sadder as this goes on. She's having suicidal thoughts and as someone who has survived a suicide attempt, it's basically triggering things in me I thought I've long since gotten over. And at this point I'm having errant thoughts of breaking up because my mental health is starting to get destroyed over this, but I don't know if that's the correct response. This is the longest relationship I've ever been in, and honestly the most real thing I've been in, despite being older than that may suggest, and I'm just very unsure of everything rn.   


Basically I need to know what sorts of advice people have, if I'm the problem in this relationship, if she is, if neither of us are and we're hitting a roadblock, etc. I will take literally any help I can get. If I am the problem here or am wrong to get angry

711," My mom’s neighbors own a husky that they keep outside. My mom doesn’t know these neighbors well, but from what we have gathered, it might be a couple of roommates and/or boyfriend/girlfriend situation. It’s not a terribly big house—1 story, 3 bedrooms, and likely only 1 bathroom. I say this because it ties in with my hypothesis about the dog, which I’ll get to in a bit. 

You see, there are two small dogs that live in the house, too. They get let out regularly and having nasty barking contests with my dog as they run up and down the fence. Okay, whatever. Dogs will be dogs. Those two dogs get to go back inside though. The husky, however, is only ever let in when it rains and sometimes at night. Whenever the neighbors are outside, which is rare, they don’t ever seem to want to have anything to do with the husky.

Now, this husky is beautiful and incredibly friendly. He comes bounding over to me and my mom when we come up to the fence. It breaks my heart to hear him howling to be let inside or to just have some interaction. 

I understand that everyone differs in their philosophy on dogs. Some people are okay with outside dogs, and I would mind a little less if there was at least some sort of shelter for the guy. It’s a decent size yard with shade, and he seems to be fed well and hydrated. The dog’s got a thick coat, so I imagine he will fare okay in the Midwest winter, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he should have to, right? 

I have come up with a couple of theories as to why the neighbors have this dog and don’t seem to care. 1) One of the house occupants owns the husky, but other roommates don’t want him inside, so he’s forced to keep the husky outside. No one appears to claim ownership of him though. No one plays with him. Just food. Water. That’s it. 2) One of the house occupants inherited the husky somehow and doesn’t have the heart to surrender it to a shelter. My mom doesn’t live in a very affluent neighborhood, but it’s certainly not one that would require a guard dog, so I don’t think it’s for security purposes-- especially because someone always seems to be home. (Hey, there’s a pandemic going on. Aren’t we all?)

So here’s where I’d like some advice. The dog obviously isn’t being neglected. It gets food and water. It can be argued that it doesn’t necessarily need shelter due to the breed, and I don’t think my town has any true requirements when it comes to outside dogs. Calling the police is overkill. 

BUT! My boyfriend’s mom loves huskies and would be open to taking in another. Would it be totally out of line to simply write a letter to the neighbors, expressing interest in the husky and asking them for a price they think is fair? The worst they could do is not respond or say no. I understand it goes against the norm, but maybe the neighbors would appreciate that money more than having to feed the dog outside every day. If that seems like a bad idea, what do you suggest? (Other than minding my own business, of course :P)

TLDR; Is it out of line to offer to buy a neighbor’s dog off of them if you think you could give the dog a better home?",12Nov2020,1

**Is it okay for me to keep using the same bank even though I'm not living in the same state?** I do plan on changing banks eventually, but I just recently got a part time job and I don't have the money to open a new bank account and possibly make mistakes and get charged with something I missed. Once I have the money and time to thoroughly read about banks I'm around, I'll open a new one and fix my direct deposit with my job. The reason I'm asking this is because I'm just curious if there's something that could happen or go wrong if I continue using this bank. It's a great bank, there aren't any hidden fees or anything, I don't have an issue with overdraft or anything either. 

I've also never had a credit card. Like I said before, I just recently got a part time job. This is my second part time job, but this one is a little more permanent than the last one I had since I won't be moving for another 3-4 years. Should I get a credit card?

I'm not a student at the moment, I think I've seen some credit cards will be directed more to students in college, which I'm not at the moment.

I startef to hang out with a group of girls
Really quickly I realized that they not the happpy good friends as they wanted the outside to se ..
And I even told them what I saw &amp;:they themselves told me handful of stories information .. 


Their names are Emma , Amy , Mia and Luna

Mia &amp; Luna are friends for 6 years
Luna &amp; Emmap are friends for akmost 5 years

Luna said that she came to this group in the first place because she diesn't wanted for Mia to feel alone in the group tho Mia gets along pretty well with Emma &amp; Amy and Luna is the one who diesn't and actually hates Amy

In the past half a year Luna feels that Mia is getting along to well with Amy , to a point that  "" she just got dragged after Amy to everywhere and pay a lot less attention to me from before but when she argue with Amy she still comes crying to me ""

It's important to point that Luna is NOT like the resr of them ,
She knows what she want to do with her life &amp; where &amp; how to fullfil that life
She knew what she want to do from the age of 6
She has a car and she is over protevtive of it &amp; but they do not understand the logic of it ( she herself washes by hand the car ... )

And becaause of it ,
Because of the fact she very different from them I asked Amy &amp; Mia once "" why you both still friends with her tho she always was like that &amp; you don't really get along that nuch ""
The bottom line of the answer was "" she is important to us cuz she is our friend altho she different , we know that we are the only group of friends that she have , if we knew she had another group of friends  , we might have ditched her ""

From what I understand from it -
They friends with her only out of pity akone .....

She on the other hand doesn't even count Amy as her friend
She thought about stop to be friends with Mia &amp; stoo to be with contact with her cuz she drapgging after Amy everywhere ...

All 3 ( Emmy , Amy &amp; Mia ) had a conversation with Luna a week ago about what bugs her about them &amp; vice versa
Idk what they talked about there but I can guesd it was a lot of what they ( every one of them ) told me about each other with the exception of why Amy &amp; Mia are friends with Luna and what Luna thought to fo ( about Mia )

My older sister (19) lets call her A
My second youngest sister (11) lets call her E
And my youngest (10) lets call her M

Background 
My mother, my older sister and I came from a really poor family. Our dad had left us because he was addicted to gambling so my mom dropped us off at our grandparents house while she went out to work and earn money. Although we weren’t rich we were happy.

My mother met this man from another country when I was around 3 or 4. They got married and were trying to get me and my older sister to move back to his country. We moved to his country when I was six and my older sister was eight. At that time my mom was also around seven to eight months pregnant with my younger sister E. 

The man who’s now my step dad didn’t have a job prior to us moving in with him but he was employed a few weeks after we moved to his house. Everything was fine the first few weeks but then E was born. He quickly became annoyed after coming home from work because E was crying or if my mom didn’t make food for him. He’d complain about how he was working and my mom was doing nothing.

A year later my mom gave birth to M. She now had four young children to take care of but she also had to look after him as well. A year or two passed and he’d come home angry. My mom was learning to do her drivers theory at the time when he started shouting at her for no reason. My mom stood up and that was when he pushed her almost crushing me in the process because I was sitting behind her. She let that go and  the same thing happened some time later. This time though he stood on my mother’s finger breaking it in the process. We left home the day after and went to somewhere. 

I don’t really remember what happened but we ended up going back to the house a few weeks later. My mom ultimately lied about what happened to her finger saying she fell and nothing was said of that. 

He sold and cut firewood and coal as a side business making my mom, my older sister and I help. The thing was he’d never pay her for the work she did. Even though she does twice the work. It annoys me.
He’d always talk about this ‘family pot’ that we have but he barely spends money on us. Only for the necessities like school. 

My older sister was forced to start work when she was around 14. She then had to pay for her own school books because he’d start a fight if he feels he’s getting nothing in return although we continue to help him with his firewood and coal business... 
I also had to do the same when I turned 14. 
He still complains about spending money on us even though I pay for my own school books and never asked him for money. 

A week ago though he told my mom he wanted a divorce because he doesn’t want her to get anything from his pension... my mom has never and I mean never asked him for money unless it’s for food for my younger sister ( his biological child) to go to school. 
He’d continuously called her a gold digger despite all the things she’d done for him.. my household is currently stressed out because of him and my mother doesn’t know what to do.. she wants to leave him but because he once threatened her because she wanted to get a paying job she didn’t get one. 

She doesn’t know what to do because she doesn’t have a job and she can’t go anywhere because she doesn’t have any money and she doesn’t know a lot of people. 

Any advice? Sorry for the long paragraphs. I’ve been really stressed and am going through a mental breakdown because of this whole situation. I don’t know what to do because we can’t go anywhere because of COVID.",12Nov2020,1

730,"So I'm a 17yo guy who's always been socially awkward. I'm insecure about a lot of things and I don't open up to anyone really. I have my friend group but I've only truly opened up to one of them.

I don't know where the inability to open up came from but I hate it about myself. I have an awesome girlfriend who is also a coworker and while I like her and love being with her and she makes me happy, I just have this feeling that eventually, shes gonna leave. Mainly due to the fact that, like I said in the title, I'm so Meh and bland.

Not really with her, I've found that I can actually be myself when I'm alone with her and I act the same with her as I do my boys. However she is very outgoing and social and just last night her and I went on just a little adventure with 2 other coworkers for fun and in the car they were singing and shit to songs that I did not know the words to, so I kinda just, sat there trying to chime in when I could. The other 2 coworkers I love but as I said before, it takes a bit for me to be truly comfortable with people.This led to my girl saying I was boring and then messaging me asking if I was ok. She asked if she could see me again once she dropped everyone off and I said of course. When she got there I just tried explaining myself by saying ""Yeah I didn't know any of the lyrics haha"" and ""Nothings wrong I really had a fun time with you guys,"" then we just talked for a few hours.

I always feel bad for I guess kinda killing the mood while everyone else is having a good time, and like I said before, I know if this goes on, my girl won't want to be around someone like that anymore.

Can anyone help me out?",12Nov2020,1
731,"I wanted to ask advice and get someone else’s take on my life so far.
A little about me:
Age: 28
Gender: male
Illnesses: BPD, ADD, Severe depression, Dyslexia
Let me start at the beginning. I was born in Los Angeles and moved to Missouri when I was four. This is when things got a little rough. When I started reading I had a lot of trouble because I was undiagnosed with dyslexia. It was my first brush with low self-esteem. I was homeschool from first grade until 8th grade. Being homeschooled is the loneliest experience. I only got to see people once a week at a homeschool meets up. Homeschooling means spending a lot of time with family specifically my mom who, from time to time, had a bad temper and pretty much gave up on my education. I never developed any organization skills or how to study for a test, how to work thru homework assignments. My brother was also prone to have severe temper tantrums which stifled my education because the focus was almost exclusively on him. I tried to make friends with some success but I suffered from painful shyness. For example if I was with a friend and they invited some of their friends to hang out with us, I wouldn’t talk and be silent.
I begged my parents to not be homeschooled anymore because I couldn’t bear being alone so much. After many fights they decided to send me to a small Christian school of 80 people. I tested a grade lower that my age, so when I was supposed to be in 9th grade I was in 8th. My first year was awful. I never spoke to anyone in my class or anyone at all. Around this time I developed severe acne that made it hard for me to look other people in the eye.
The biggest issue was that the workload was so huge that you almost had no time for anything else. Like I said before I had no academic skills. I did so poorly throughout high school mostly getting c's, d's, and f's in my classes. This was a huge problem and created a rift between me and my parents. At the time I really blamed myself for doing so poorly. I feel now that I was ill-prepared ad that is my parents fault for neglecting my education. The school was three days a week. Monday, Wednesday and Friday were in class while Tuesday and Thursday were at home. So like a hybrid of homeschooling and real school. Most days at home my mom would run my homework schedule and often berated me and insulted me for doing so poorly. She would scream in my face saying ""you're going to be a failure"" and would chastise me if I didn’t do things the way she wanted me to. I never was able to rebuild my relationship with my mom after that and she still blames me for those days. It was hard seeing my mom like that. Once she was always there for me, taught me about pain, loved me unconditionally. As soon as I went to school she completely changed and became so cynical and cruel.
My grades caused a lot of problems for me personally. I wasn’t able to get a driver’s license until I was almost 18 because my dad forbade it. I was unable to engage in extracurricular. My dad was verbally and physically abusive to me. He would tell me he was going to kill me. He would humiliate me in front of my friends. He stifled me a lot. He never took the time to think ""maybe he has problems with doing work"" instead of blaming me for being lazy. I'm not lazy. I'm a survivor.
I had many troubling experiences at this school. Most of it was people attacking my appearance and generally disrespecting me. At one point a kid with Asperger's attacked me without reason. I never knew why. It shocked me. Another point a guy with was 6'4 took me a slammed me against a wall in front of people. It really affected me at the time. The worst one was at a soccer game. A lot of people were hanging out when someone I used to know who had graduated attacked my appearance in front of everyone and called me ""fuck ugly"" in front of my brother and a lot of my friends. It was so traumatizing and humiliating. I and friends never spoke about it. I and my brother never spoke about it either. Sometimes when I'm with my brother, I still feel that awkwardness a decade later. I never really understood why it happened and it crippled my self-esteem. I remember going numb. I had to hang out with those people afterwards. There was many times where someone called me ugly including my closest friend. I never really got over it.
Going into college, I was only able to get into the same college my brother got into. Thomas More College. A liberal Arts catholic school with about 80-100 people. There were a lot of the same problems here but things got better. I made some friends including a couple of girls that I grew very close to. It really felt like things were looking up. I started dating a girl who was very pretty. My friends and I even got the change to go to Rome for the spring semester. It was a great time. However, while I was in Rome, my girlfriend was spending alone time with another guy. It made me feel insecure. After Rome I decided to come visit her at school. It was weird. I suspected something happened between them. We broke up and they started dating. I decided to look for a new school to transfer to. I picked out a few schools to major in psychology. I've always loved psychology. However my dad said he would not help me pay for it unless I went to a local school for a business degree. This was pretty devastating.
I ended up going to Truman state university. A school notorious for its huge work load. I found out pretty early that I was not going to do well there. On top of that I had a lot of trouble making friends. Other than my roommates I made no friends at all. My grades were terrible. I became severely depressed and had trouble getting out of bed. It was around this time that I found out that my ex-girlfriend and my brother had started dating. This crippled our relationship to this day. At this point I had just given up. I was so hurt by them dating. I felt like if my brother would stab me in the back, I must really not be worth anything. My whole family was supportive of their relationship. I felt like I was being betrayed by my family.
I eventually flunked out of school and lived with my parents. I got several jobs at the same time to go back to school at a small local college. I still have not finished my degree. I ended up moving out later to live with my oldest friend and got a desk job which I was let go from. Another one which I was also let go from. I finally got a customer service rep job which enabled me to move out on my own. I ended up meeting a girl let’s call her Jane who I dated for 4 months before she broke up with me. She regretted breaking up with me but I cut all ties with her. Not long after that I was fired from my customer service job for failing to give accurate information. Customer service gives me such bad social anxiety and my performance eventually collapse. I eventually worked at a solar company but was fired shortly after that for failing to handle the workload. Jane and I started hanging out a couple times but eventually lost contact because I did not text her at all. I ended up working at a bank. Jane and I reconciled again but she saw me texting what she assumed were other girls and became despondent when we were together. The last night I ever saw her we were so distant and she was on tinder talking to guys to get back at me. I went outside and smoked a cig which she hated. She asked to go home and I told her I would uber her. She was obviously offended and left and when I asked for a hug she was obviously crying. I still love that girl.
I eventually walked out of my bank job because my boss was awful and I couldn’t take working there. Jane had started dating someone else and I started dating a girl named Cat. I eventually got a sales job which raised my social anxiety. Cat was unstable. She would often have fits of crying and needed to be with me constantly which put a lot of pressure on me. I was a mess myself. One day I went a whole day without texting her and she faked a suicide attempt (I found this out later) Jane was always checking my Instagram story and sending me random texts but I never answered. I was still upset about what happened. I broke up with Cat after she trapped me in my house she was afraid I was going to leave her. Around this time I lost my sales job too. I tried several times to get back into school but failed my classes. After all this I moved in with my brother and started ubering for about 5 months and eventually got another customer service job. I ended up moving out this past August where I am now. Jane and I started talking again and eventually decided to meet up. We had so much good conversation but she would leave me on read when I sent her tik toks. A few days before we were supposed to meet up, I sent her tiktoks on Thursday and Friday to start a conversation to meet up and make plans which we had discussed earlier that week but she left me on read. I got upset and stopped talking to her. This was a month ago. I messed up. I wish she had responded so we could make plans. We talk every once in a while but I fear she has found someone else. I wish there was some way to start up our connection with her but I don’t know how. I never felt so loved by someone and I know I messed up. I sent her a message saying I'm glad we started talking again and thanked her for keeping me company during the pandemic. Before that I sent her a message saying I loved her and she started getting concerned about me. I think it might be over. I can't accept it though because I don't like anyone else.
Now, I'm currently still working a customer service job which I hate. I am not doing well. I am on my final warning before I get fired. I'm looking for a new job for about 3 weeks. Nothing has happened but got a few interviews. Still got to get back into school but I need more money. Got a second job at the sunglass hut to pay for it. My car is not registered because I have so much work to do on it to get it registered. My credit isn’t good. I go to therapy and a psychiatrist. Unfortunately there are not a lot of options for borderline personality disorder. I'm working on it. I feel like bpd has stifled me my entire life.
I want to change my life. I want to be successful. I want a good relationship. Right now I have virtually no friends. On Friday and Saturday nights I spend them alone. I want good friends. I want a steady job that works for me. I started working out and eating well but It only makes me feel better for so long. I want to have hope that my life will change.

Please, any advise would help. I'm getting desperate to change. I just cant seem to fix myself. This is something I wanted to do for a while. I just want to be happy.",12Nov2020,1
732,"Hi, I’m (24f) and I have two brothers, one is 11 and the other is 26. 
All my childhood my father lived with us until he decided he wanted to split with my mother about 10 years ago. Me and my father have never been close. 
I recently learned that during this separation he told the judge during custody proceedings that he would be happy to take my brothers for visitation but didn’t want anything to do with me. I am his biological daughter. I only found this out a few months ago and it broke my heart. I was a child and his only daughter. Why didn’t he want me? I didn’t tell him that I knew and it seems like I’ve subconsciously been distancing myself from him. 
He’s always been a man with a very short fuse. Impatient and full of hate. I got into a huge argument with him a few days ago. He still doesn’t know that I’m aware he didn’t want anything to do with me. I feel like just going no contact with him. My only issues are is that it will impact my younger brother who still goes to see our father and they love each other. My father has had issues in the past with his mental health and I’m afraid incase he tries to kill himself and I get the blame. 

My heart is torn over a man who never loved me. What should I do?",12Nov2020,1
733,"Okay so to make a very long story just long. 

In 7th grade I had a friend, this friend and I had 5 out of our 7 classes together, so it only made sense that we became friends and with that much time together, I'd say he was my best friend. 

I've always felt deep down that he mightve not actually liked me and only spoke to me because of the circumstance of being with each other all day.

Either way, we had lots of fun in 7th and 8th grade, in 8th grade we only had 2 classes together so the friendship kinda dwindled but we had our last period together and every single day I'd go home with a head that hurt and a belly that was sore, both from laughing so much.

Also in middle school, I realized that guys were attractive to me too, so I'm bisexual I guess, and my best friend was the first guy that I knew who I had a crush on. 

I of course didn't tell him, it was embarrassing and confusing and I didn't want to weird him out. I've kept my feelings to myself.

In 9th grade, I saw him maybe 5 times before be disappeared, I haven't seen him since. I can only imagine that he moved due to personal reasons and didn't tell me, or anybody really. I asked around some mutual friends and they didn't know where he had gone.

Earlier this year I found him on Instagram, we did some small text catching up and I was very happy (I cried). Of course I started daydreaming, I wanted to have him back in my life, I wanted to game with him, if he was still in the area I wanted to go places with him.

Then the pandemic hit, he suggested we pretty much should play games for the summer, I was ecstatic at the idea (I cried). 

Here's the thing, all these months later, we still haven't played and we don't really text, both against my hearts desire. 

I try texting him but often he'll just reply with a meme, which is sometimes appropriate when I send one first but we've had few actual conversation.  This is somewhat expectedly, he and I have never really been known to be texters but again, he's never invited me to play with him.

Also expected, he's kinda shy and awkward so maybe he wants me to formally ask him first. The other thing, he has never initiated a conversation,  since February to today, he has never been to first person to send a message. 

Throughout middle school to now (HS Senior) I've never been able to shake this feeling that I loved and cared about him way more than he did about me. Not in the sexual way, but as a friend.

At this point, I still don't know where he is, I don't know if actually he likes me, it doesn't seem like we're actually going to reconnect anytime soon and I have this weight I've been carrying around for years that I feel like I need to tell him, and that's the truth about my sexuality. 

Why? I don't know, I just feel like I need to tell him or else I get stressed out. He might be weirded out, grossed out, he might think I'm joking, he might block me, he might be gay too, I don't know. The realest scenario i see happening is him just leaving me on read, which would be awkward.

Should I tell him? Am I crazy? I'm at a pretty low point right now so that's probably why I'm even considering it, I might just tell him a long text and then block him. I don't know.",12Nov2020,1
734,"So basically, I (24F) started talking to this dude (23M) on Discord. We’ve been hitting it off for a couple days now, and even though we live on different continents I would really like to see where things go. He’s just this cute little church boy version of Justin Bieber and it’s just the cutest. 

Anyways, after a couple of selfies and videochats I recognized something. I couldn’t put my finger in on it for a few days, until I just saw a picture of Madeleine McCann and I was like THAT’S IT, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. 

I guess I’m just wondering, how do I tell him this? Obviously I don’t want to upset him or have him be angry at me. I also don’t want him to think I find him unattractive. How do I tell him without ruining everything? 

By the way, he’s suuuper close with his mom, which also makes me wonder if he knows.",12Nov2020,1
735,"Just a note before you start reading: I am or was a bad driver with a lot of performance anxiety. I have trouble focusing on my environment and have a bad response time, and tend to think that I am wrong in every move I make. However, I am significantly better than I am before. 

A month and a half ago, my mom got me a private driving instructor that charges me for every hour he takes me out for a drive. In the beginning, I really liked him because his attention to detail was way better than all others that I have been with. He's taught me very well. However, I noticed that he brought a wooden stick with him every time he would come. When I made mistakes, he would tap me with the stick lightly on my thigh. 

Recently, although he was a good instructor before, he started being very nitpicky and argumentative making me make more mistakes, and having a slower than average response time. Then he would mostly FORGET half of the things he taught me and not go on forward with teaching me new things, thereby charging me a lot of money. Also, before making any move, he assesses where I look, and criticizes causing me to feel anxious and make more mistakes. Basically, he assumes I will make certain mistakes before making them especially SINCE this man FORGETS much of my progress. I try not to speak too much either because I usually want to get the driving sessions over and done with and I am not an argumentative person. Also, whenever he tells me not to do too much of something, I overcompensate, or try to become more aware of my environment by observing and then he criticizes where I look and pay attention to too causing me to fail after becoming frustrated and anxious. This makes me feel like he's doing much of it on purpose to get more money out of me.

Then when the session is over, he'll usually tell me to take my mask of in his car. (I don't know why he does that-to get a proper look at me?)

However, the other day after a mistake, he tapped my head with a stick and asked how I'm even involved with post-secondary education if I can't follow his instructions and I had had enough.  So I looked for his reviews, and two of his reviews that I found was 1 star with most of the same (but not the tapping) issues that I had stated. 

I want to change him, but he booked a driving test next month and it's hard to even book or find instructors during a pandemic. 

I don't know what to do nor do I know how to handle the situation. I just also really want my license because I am 24 and I need to get my life together. Any advice?",12Nov2020,1

737,"First time posting on reddit, not sure if I am doing it 100 percent right. I am M, 26, USA. 

I have been furloughed as a result of covid since the end of July. I have had no luck finding work since and am starting to lose hope. 

I earned my undergraduate degree in 2017. It is a social sciences degree that, while most people might think as not applicable, I truly loved learning about. I think while I was in college was one of the only times I have been truly happy. Not because I was drinking or hooking up or anything like that - that wasn't really my experience. But because I loved learning my subject from my wonderful teachers and peers. I miss seeing them everyday. 

When I earned my degree I had the post-grad anxiety I think a lot of students have, but I was fairly optimistic about my prospects. I had some student debt to pay off but I had a degree I loved that I was certain could land me a fine entry level job. I was fine with the idea of a simple office job that paid enough for me live off while I continued to read and learn on my own time. 

Well, I was disappointed but not entirely surprised my degree wasn't going to cut it. Places wanted experience, and a lot of it. I had worked typical service industry jobs while in college and so places asking for five years of direct experience weren't even going to look my way. So I got a part time thing, moved home, and settled in for a year in mid-2017. My part-time job was simple but in an industry I loved. It isn't an industry that pays well but is, in my opinion, a vital part of any community. While living at home and doing this job, I applied to graduate programs in a slightly different field than what I studied in undergrad and was accepted. 

I moved myself and my girlfriend to a very urban part of the country mid-2018 so I could earn this degree. I left behind my part-time job, which I had for a little over a year, certain that with this experience I could land a similar if not better position. My girlfriend found a job, high paying, very quickly. She has been wonderful and caring and supportive of me as I work through my grad program. I couldn't ask for anything better from her. In fact, I live with shame and guilt all the time from the work she does to keep me afloat.

It took my a long time to find any work. Nothing I applied to even looked my way. I began to feel hopeless and angry and sad. I am not an angry person. In fact, before all this, I would say I had rarely felt angry at all  in my whole life. Now, I feel anger and rage and hate.

Eventually, I got another part-time job in January of 2019. It took about six months of applying to at least ten jobs a day. I read forum after forum to update my resume. I went to the career services at the school I am studying at so they could check my cover letter and resume. I sent them to my mom, my friends, my girlfriend dozens of times so they could offer advice. Still, the job I got only paid slightly better than my last. I looked around at my peers who graduated the same time I did - they had good jobs and nice apartments. They had nice clothes and ate well. They took trips and got engaged. It felt like anything good that I got wasn't something I earned, but something my girlfriend or family graciously gave me. I felt low and cried often, at work, on public transportation, when at home alone. 

Still, my job was okay. My co-workers liked me and I liked them. The job was easy but allowed me to continue my studies. And I worked hard to show them I was a good worker. I wanted this job to be a stepping stone to the next. I also managed to get two internships, one for six months and one for three, in the field I was studying in my graduate program. I worked alongside undergraduates and recent graduates just so I could catch up and find a job, a real, full-time job, as soon as I could. My last internship ended in December of 2019. 

And I kept applying too. All the time. On lunch breaks and between work assignments. Before class and before bed. One job application after the next, all rejected at some point. 

When covid hit, I was almost immediately sent home. I was allowed to keep my job until July, when my work finally said they couldn't maintain a budget in times like this, and had to let all part-timers go. I was devastated, but again, hopeful. I now had over three years of combined experience in one industry and two internships in another. I had an undergraduate degree and was nearly finished with my masters in social science fields. I felt like this time was going to be different. 

Well, obviously, that didn't work out. I have had one (one!!!!) very good interview in October that got me to the last stage of hiring until they went with someone else. I politely asked for any advice and all they could say was everyone was qualified and they just had to make a choice. Since then, my motivation has tanked. I feel tired all the time. I feel sad and alone and broken. It feels like the entire world has rejected me. I hate myself more and more all the time. I have been under or un-employed since graduating. This has completely consumed me. If it wasn't for my girlfriend and my studies, I don't think I would be getting out of bed. If it wasn't for my family and my debt, I think I would have killed myself. 

I guess I am not sure what advice could be given at this point. Therapy? I can't afford it. Keep applying? I do, about three applications day. I need advice, or some kind of help, or to hear people going through something similar. I need to know there is a way out of this. 

Thank you to anyone who managed to read all this. Thanks in advance to anyone who can leave a reply.",12Nov2020,1

Possible victim blamer: “[the assaulter] would blatantly be a d*** to her and she’d excuse his behavior no matter what he was said or did to her.

Anyways I live alone and when I came out worked remotely so didn't have any co worker human contact. I've been proactive the whole time trying to go meetups, hobbies, ect, but Covid has rid all of those and the few I went to are shit shows or not safe and people got sick. I've made it this far covid free even though back in California 6 family members got it so I mask up and try to be safe but it's getting grim here in Denver. I also have to dog's to try and not go insane and take them to parks daily but people at parks aren't wearing masks at all and not caring even though there's a state order lockdown.


Anyways I'm open to suggestions I fear and actually feel the lack of human connection driving me insane and don't think I'll make it another 6 months of this without serious mental repurcusions personally without dumping my purse on here. Thnx",12Nov2020,1

744,"So I’m kinda struggling here to find some sort of happiness or comfort for my mother. She’s been a mess for months but especially bad today since tomorrow is her birthday. My father was amazing at making my mother’s life bright and full of love, but since he’s passed I feel as if I can’t comfort her or make her happy even a little. I’m planning on paying for her to get a haircut and a nice king message, but I still feel like I won’t make her feel even a little better. 

TL:DR - it’s my mom’s birthday tomorrow and I need to make her happy even though the worst thing has happened for her

745,"So about a month ago, I(F/19) matched on Tinder with a guy(M/20) that I had met years prior (when we were 16), because my best friend at the time was dating his best friend. I always kinda had a thing for him but nothing ever came of it and after my best friend broke up with her boyfriend (it got messy) and months later I broke that friendship with her, I kinda forgot him because we completely lost contact. 

Now that we reconnected we started talking and seemed to really start to hit it off, but I started noticing some red flags about him just getting out of a breakup, and eventually, he did tell me that he had broken up with his ex only a couple of weeks before we started talking. We kept talking because I genuinely enjoyed it, even if I knew it was not going to be romantic (or at least not anytime soon). He did ask me to hang out a couple of times and the first two times because of the circumstances of my country we weren't able to, the third time, he canceled last minute and said he had a lot of classwork due (I knew it was an excuse but went along with it), and I expected him to say something along the lines of ""I'll tell you when I'm a bit freer"" and leave it at that, but instead he went as far as making set plans with me for the following week. 

A couple of days before we were supposed to hang out I texted him to ask him if the plan was still on and he replied hours later with a bunch of texts telling me that he was really sorry but that he couldn't, that his break up was way too recent and that although he did really want to hang out with me he just didn't feel ready yet, and that he totally understood if I was mad. To this I replied to him telling him not to worry and that I understood completely. I also told him that I really appreciated the fact that he told me things how they were and that if he wanted to keep talking like friends, that I was okay with that. He said that he would love to keep talking to me and we talked for a couple of days, but I kinda let the conversation die out a bit, so he doesn't feel like he's obligated to talk to me out of pity, but I did want him to feel free to text me if he ever wanted to, so that's why I said it. 

My question here is, did I handle the situation well? or was I dumb? For the past few years, I've been learning how to set boundaries and all of that, but sometimes  I just don't know if I let the person takes advantage of me or if they genuinely deserved me being understanding towards their situation, and outside opinions sometimes help. My friends are divided on this situation so that's why I come to Reddit, so what do you think? Do you think that I handled well enough that he might wanna reach out again after he gets over the breakup?",12Nov2020,1
746,"I’m so exhausted of working day and night at college, and not having any form of social life (due to previous COVID restrictions on our semester). All I do is homework, and play games with my roommates. Work, Game, Work, Game, Work, Game. It’s just really beginning to take a toll on me. I find I have no idea what to do with myself anymore in any form of break time I get. The games I own are stale, I feel that I should be more active, I always feel like I should continue working on homework but I can’t bring myself to keep going that long, as it stresses me out. And to top it all off I smoke weed every day to deal with the boredom and stress. I initially had started smoking because I was curious and thought it was fun...
I also feel horrible saying this but whenever my mom calls me it completely drains my energy for the time being, and somewhat depresses me a little bit. Obviously I want to know what’s going on at home, so it’s not an option to ask her to stop telling me. But as it stands my sister is married to a toxic, useless person who doesn’t work, barely takes care of the kids, and treats her like shit in the longrun. I can’t stand seeing it but nothing we do is able to help her out except for supporting her where we can, but then that further provokes her husband to do nothing. She’s struggling hard with money, and now we are too, and she’s increasingly stressed trying to juggle everything. Furthermore my grandma has cancer, and has had it for awhile. I can tell her mood is shifting, and it breaks my heart to see her struggle with it.
My dad is overweight and can’t find the motivation to work on his health, as he commutes 2 hours back AND forth to work every day, and comes home to a house where he has to think about the previously mentioned situations (he’s also a stress eater respectfully)
I just don’t know what to do, or where to turn to. Everywhere I look there’s just something that drains me even more. I used to be very energetic, I have almost nothing to spare lately, and it’s also affecting the person that I want to be. I’m also single so I don’t even really have a shoulder to lean on. 
I guess the point is that life can just be really unfortunate.
If you guys have any pieces of advice to contribute I’d owe you a great deal. 
Especially so relating to my sister’s situation... I really wanna do anything I can to help her, or to at least help de-stress her. I feel like my role as her brother is less of what it used to be, and I really hate that (I’m younger btw)

747,"Recently, I have been to experiencing my day normally from waking up until about 3pm. Following that, I’ve just felt really empty and just overall bored with life? 

I just feel like nothing is really happening. I haven’t really made any new friends or really met any new people in the past few months since covid and things are feeling really same-y. I just chill in my room all night with no real plans. 

Sometimes I organise to hang with friends and have a drink but I obviously can’t do that every night but I always feel so down every other day and feel like there’s nothing happening for me. I talk to the same handful of people everyday. Ever since this has been happening I’ve been having a lot of anxiety and have a weird feeling that things are gonna go wrong as well?

755,"My fall birthday is coming up and I am dreading it. As a child I loved birthdays, whether it was my own or someone else's. This year I'm having a lot of anxiety. A lot of my birthday memories are negative due to various rude comments, bullying by classmates, ignorance (my mom bought her favorite ice cream cake because she ""didn't know what kind of cake i wanted""...every year), and just general frustrations of being broke in a capitalist society. I attributed my negative childhood experiences to the youthful ignorance of getting more excited than a child in a low-income single-parent home should get but last year put birthdays in perspective. I had a class on my 25th birthday morning, after which I had to pick up my laptop from what was supposed to be a ""free"" repair. Then I would go out to celebrate with my mom who flew into town to celebrate with me. Unfortunately, my repair would turn out to cost $1200, which I couldn't afford. The traffic was terrible so we couldn't make it out to celebrate, and that evening my long-distance sorta-bf (""talking stage"") informed me that he wanted to call things off because I wouldn't be returning to school next semester. This sucked because he knew I'd been having aterrible birthday and HE was the one who was consoling me days prior when I was crying because I could not afford to return to school. This was particularly rough year that started with me leaving school after a major depressive episode triggered by ptsd from ongoing racism (and getting dumped by my actual boyfriend on valentines day, who it turns out had been looking to cheat and never intended to take me serious due to religious differences ie. I wasn't willing to convert after 5 months of dating).

So, my mom is trying to plan something for us to celebrate my birthday in a few days. I've been having multiple crying episodes just thinking about birthdays. I was going to stay indoors and incrementally lower my expectations every minute of the day until it passes. Since covid has severely impacted our finances, we cannot really do much anyway, but I don't want her to think that I'm morose because of the economic strain, I'm just severely depressed enough already and I don't think I could handle another major disappointment on my birthday. How do I explain this to her without disappointing her or cluing her in to how poor my mental health is doing?",12Nov2020,1
756,"So I (18m) was seeing this girl (19m) at the beginning of the year up until July. Her and I are from Las Vegas but she had moved to Florida sometime last year and was back in Vegas for a few months because of some family issues. It was an on and off kinda thing because after a while we stopped hanging out for some reason. Even when we were doing good, she just always failed to pull through with plans. 

Anyway, the relationship wasn’t good. Her and I had little understanding of each other and eventually I told her that it’s probably better to stop seeing each other. She didn’t say ANYTHING to that and we didn’t talk to each other for about a month. After that she’d text me from time to time, usually commenting on my Instagram story, or checking up on me and stuff. 

I wouldn’t really reciprocate the energy though, and I would never text her first and I tried to forget her. Even though I knew deep down that I missed her. I got into tattooing not too long ago and she asked if I could finish up a simple tattoo she has. But when the day came, she didn’t say anything about it nor did she even text me. Britt her did I. I feel like if we had seen each other it would’ve been some sort of closure for me. Even if we didn’t bring up our relationship, at least I could’ve seen her just so I could finally end things off on a good note if that makes sense.

The thing about her not showing up for the tattoo was that she would always do things like that when we were dating. She’d make plans with me (literally, she was the one who would make the plans) and then either cancel last minute or just not say anything about it in general. She didn’t do that when we first started dating, only once we got comfortable with each other. So it made me mad because I saw that she was doing the same things that made me end things with her. 

Nonetheless, I still had this feeling in my gut that she was gunna apologize or somehow come back into my life and we’d be able to finally have a real and meaningful relationship. But 2 days ago, I saw that she was back in Florida again. Something about it made my heart drop a little. Not in a sense that I’m heartbroken, but something about it made me feel empty inside. Now I can’t stop thinking about when her and I first went on a date and when we started getting to know each other and all the cute things she did when we would hang out. 

Idk why I feel this way now, because only a month or two ago I really didn’t care and was just trying my best to forget about her. And towards the end of our relationship, I barely saw her because she’d always cancel on me, or remind me that I’m not her officially boyfriend. Why do I feel this way though? Why do I feel this way for someone who wasn’t good for me, that I broke up with, and that I thought I had let go of?",12Nov2020,1

770,"Help! 

Background:
I work in a small construction company in the UK with only 2 permanent office stuff. One being me and the other being our accounts woman who has had to go back to her home country for her mother’s funeral. Our director comes in every now and then, but mostly visits our construction sites. 

Since it is only me in the office, he has let me work from home for November. (He made me come into the office last lockdown, which was sort of fine since it was just me and the accounts woman, so we were able to distance safely). 

The issue: 
My director (who does not believe in COVID), has asked me to come in for a meeting with our new clients next week. The meeting will be held in a small 10 space board room, and there will be 12 of us. We won’t be socially distanced and I therefore don’t feel comfortable going. 

It feels wrong that I can’t see family members not in my bubble, but it is ok to sit in a board room with complete strangers? 

Because he does not believe in COVID, I don’t know how to get out of this without getting into trouble for being difficult. We are a small company, so we don’t have a HR department I can go to for help.

It’s hard to keep her hopeful, especially because we’re long(ish) distance. (We live ~2 hours apart but I have no car, so I rely on public transportation to visit occasionally)
Her online schooling got off to an okay start, until the school decided to kick her out and delete her accounts because of missing immunization forms. This took her out of class for 2 weeks in the beginning of the year. The school has done this twice since, and given no reason for the 2 most recent times. As a result she’s failing all her courses for the semester, and is swamped with work that can’t be graded since it’s all late. This has stressed her out a whole lot.
Most recently she’s tested positive for COVID. This threw a wrench in our plans to hang out around thanksgiving, which she was looking forward to. But now she can’t go to work for 2-3 weeks, which is stressing her out even more.
I don’t know how to encourage her that everything will be fine because I honestly don’t think it’s fine at all.

In my head I've built him up to be the one for me when  I know that one date doesnt mean anything and I haven't had a chance to know him. The date was fine and he didnt want to continue due to living in different parts of the country which is fine he doesn't owe me anything. Tbh he is probably already dating someone else new and I have no intention of contacting him. 

Its just he got it from a cultural point and got on well which was good to finally have someone understand! 

The thing is every other guy I keep talking to I feel like im comparing them to this other guy that I barely knew? I dont understand why I keep doing it and why even liked him so much.

794,"Hi, so the title of this post is a little bit of a mess I think so let me explain. I am a 22 year old college student. I am a bit passed halfway through my pre med undergraduate degree. I was originally planning to go to medical school. Ever since March when quarantine began, I've been slowly getting out of the groove of things. I ended off Spring somewhat well considering the circumstances. I took a decent amount of credits over the Summer and ended happy with what I got. But during this fall semester, I've been getting low grades and low grades, I have a somewhat difficult course load, but to be honest, that is not the issue at all. The issue is me. I have absolutely no motivation, desire or discipline to do any school work. I do the bare minimum and all. but I only attend my mandatory online lectures (which is like half) and the other half I don't attend, I just keep myself barely up to date on the material. However, this semester, my testing anxiety has come back even stronger than ever, I will literally break down hours before the exam and shut off and tell myself I'm worthless. I have done pretty badly on almost every exam. Which is kind of a 360 on my grades from the last few semesters. For the past 2/3 months however, I feel like I just want to finish college not continue. I am so burnt out and I feel like this career path may not even be for me. I've been either really on going to med or really off. I feel like school has been killing my creativity and my freedom, especially with COVID 19. I think that it has regressed all my progress and has actually had me in a worst state than ever before. 

I am so lost and not sure what I want to do. Nowadays, I cant imagine myself studying for the MCAT, much less step 1 and 2 in med school. Ive been suffering from test anxiety and I feel like I have no other routes to go.",12Nov2020,1

He’ll often beg us to be done quicker so he can catch his bus instead of waiting for the next one half an hour later. I think it’s just silly how he demands us to finish all our duties and he just says what needs to be done instead of jumping in to help. When I don’t close with him it’s a lot easier, and happier. A few shifts ago it was me closing solo and my sous chef went on a FaceTime call for about 15 minutes. When he was done he said “can ya hurry up so I can catch my bus”.

I felt bad for him, and i understood his pain. Since then we have been trying to catch up with everything, helping him however we can, whatever he needs help with. It’s not the fact that helping him is exhausting, it’s just insanely mentally exhausting to feel your dad slip away from you. I cannot focus on school, on graduating, on my friends. I feel like i’ve fallen into a dark hole that i can’t get out of.

On top of that, he has developed an alcohol problem. I could come home from school, and see him drunk on our living room couch. It’s embarrassing bringing friends back home, only to find my dad swallowed up by alcohol. I know i’m not supposed to feel embarrassed by this, he can’t help it. I feel like this is his way of dealing with the diagnosis.

But I simple don’t know how to deal with this, I feel like i have no power over my dad as an 18 year old. My mom refuses for me to go to therapy since she says i don’t need it, but i can feel myself fall apart.

I met him about 5 years ago... really hit it off but I thought it was really interesting that he didn’t have any social media. We see each other on and off for a few years but we never really seemed to take the relationship any further.

He would always string me along saying things like as soon as your don’t with school we can be together blah blah blah. I believe it at the time. 

I remember I finally went to his apt one day and that’s when I found out he must have been in a relationship. 

Pink water bottle in the kitchen. Mascara all over the pillow. And as I was leaving I noticed his fist initial &amp; another I asked who the other person was. He quickly said a family member. 

Bottom line is. I fell for this man so hard and he was completely living a double life.

During this semester at college, I joined a very close knit group of friends. We are all dedicated to our studies, despite studying different things, and can teach each other about our interests. Most of them are either Music Education students or STEM majors, and since I know little about music or science I gain a lot from the group. We also play D and D together and do other fun, socially distanced activities. I really like this group a lot, and even started dating one of them, B (M18). B is a physics and theater double major and knows way more about everything than I do. He’s the best boyfriend I’ve ever had, and I adore him.

Today one of my classes met with the Vice Provost, who shared ideas for next semester with us. He claimed that sophomores and seniors might come back in full, while freshman and junior music Ed and STEM majors with labs could return as well. This means that all of my friends EXCEPT for me would be returning. 

I really don’t know what to do if that happens. My friend group in high school, including a boyfriend, forgot about me after spending two months apart (we were friends for four years). I could easily see this happening here as well (my bf says it wouldn’t but you can never be sure). I have a job at home but it’s not very fulfilling.

808,"TLDR: A dog was dumped and showed up at my house, shelter won't take her, don't know what to do.

Okay, so some backstory. A few months ago, a pair of dogs kept showing up to my house after escaping their owner's yard. He was an older, but not quite elderly, man that did not have a fenced in yard and they just kept running off. They would wander around the woods and neighborhood, but they came by my house often. He came to pick them up a few times when we called him, but they always came back and he eventually stopped coming for them. After a few days, one disappeared and we later heard she had been picked up. The other was hit by a car and had an injured leg, but a neighbor adopted her and she has healed up wonderfully and is thriving; they often take walks by my house and I'm very happy for her.

Yesterday, my dogs (I have two, one is particularly nervous/aggressive about other dogs and always makes a ruckus when he sees one) started barking, so I looked out the window and saw one of the dogs in the yard. She was dirty but had a collar on, so I assumed it was the one adopted down the street that had just gotten out. I walked her over to the lady's house, but lo and behold, the other dog was in the back yard. After talking with the woman, she declined taking the dog, but advised me to talk to some people around the neighborhood. While walking back towards my house, the dog started eating trash from around an old burn barrel at an abandoned house. This may be where I messed up, but I put her in my back yard so I could feed her proper food while I checked with the other neighbors. By the end of the evening, I'd made no progress except learning that she was likely dumped at the local church (we're practically next to it). Maybe they thought that since this is where she was picked up, she would have somewhere to go once they dumped her again. Unfortunately, this happens a lot where I live. I went home, fed her dinner, and decided to let her sleep in the backyard for the night. Since I woke up this morning, I've contacted everyone I can think of, and have tried looking up rescues near us, but unfortunately they are either closed because of covid, or they don't take strays. The local humane shelters won't take her either since we don't live within city limits (we live out in the country), why it works like that I don't know.

I keep wrestling with guilt because we can't keep her. We already have two dogs, and a few years after adopting them we got my daughter tested for allergies and....she's allergic to dogs. So we're already managing that as it is. We also can't afford another living thing in our home, we make just enough to get by without having to sweat about it. This dog is super friendly, very shy (scared of tennis balls, I learned), and  big (Great Pyrenees). I've been going out and giving her fresh water and food, brushed her fur a little, and have been loving on her to help her not feel so scared. I don't want to just turn her loose and say "" good luck"", I've seen how her luck has been and all I would be doing is turning a blind eye and pretending she will be fine. I feel like I've hit a dead end and I don't know what to do. Does anyone have any advice or any suggestions of other places I could try that might take her?

I had made this decision because at the time, I had become concerned about job security and obtaining health benefits during this time in the pandemic. The job hours that were described at the time of the job were described differently than what shift options were provided after training and I’ve become miserable sitting at a desk and am ready to get started on making a career for myself. 

I’ve recently decided to go back to school for business marketing and was wanting to cut back on work hours while still making the same amount of money, if not more. And I know serving would provide this along with the freedom of requesting time off when needed.

If there wasn’t a pandemic occurring right now, I wouldn’t hesitate going back to a restaurant.

820,"I was working in a field that was tangentially related to my major, it was more tech-y and my only experience was “interning” as a student employee with them and taking 1 coding class. i thought i’d grow to love it and i was excited as it had more job opportunities than my original major. when i was hired we had transitioned to remote work and i got quickly overwhelmed as i had never done real work for this position in person. i just adjusted really poorly and felt like i was thrown into this thing pretty blind, my in-person work with them wasn’t super helpful for the real work as i was just doing “practice tasks” to train. 

anyway my performance wasn’t up to their standards and with big projects coming up they needed someone better so i was told i was being replaced. 

i’m less sad than i was yesterday, if anything i’m embarrassed that i performed so poorly. this lockdown has taken a massive toll on me so i guess i didn’t notice how much i wasn’t up to par. i’m realizing that i was not as passionate about this field as i thought, so blessing in disguise, but now i feel like i’ve worked for 2 years in this area for nothing. i wish i had pursued other opportunities in college but i didn’t, so my only experience is in this techy area that i don’t want to return to. 

i’m feeling pretty down about it. i need to apply for new jobs asap but i don’t even know where to start. i can’t get a service/retail job in the meantime as i visit my family often and they’re high risk for covid. and my field has slim pickings already. i’m just feeling pretty lost right now and could use any advice whatsoever. sorry if this isn’t the appropriate sub",12Nov2020,1

822,"My whole family lives in LA and they want to plan a trip to Palm Springs, and stay in a huge commercial hotel for Christmas. My mom is a brain aneurysm survivor and has lung problems, and I asked her if she really thought this was a good idea. They all seem to be really excited about it, my guess is because they're bored out of their minds, and they want me to come down and join them so we can all be together.

I on the other hand am very conscious about COVID and don't even do 'outdoor' seating at restaurants. I have no choice but to go to work 5 days a week still and have a boyfriend with lung issues, so everything I do, I think about how it could effect someone I love. I am totally torn as to whether this trip would be a good idea. I want to see my family, but going on a trip in December when cases are going up seems so stupid to me. 

The hotel will be at 50% capacity, and we'll be spending most of the time in the desert and away from other people. But I will still need to rent a car to get down there, make pit stops and random gas stations, and there will obviously be some unavoidable contact with other people because it is a hotel and I will be traveling some 600 miles. 

So what do you guys think? Should I tell them I'm gonna have to pass, or do you think there is a way to do this safely?",12Nov2020,1

826,"Hi everyone. I need help. I need advice.

About a week ago, I purchased a new vehicle from my friends  father-in-law. It was a 2014 mazda CX-5 with 62000kms on the odometer. The first time I viewed it I only turned it on and then looked it over (listened for noises, checked electronics, overall look-over). It seemed pretty good aside from some cosmetic stuff but a pretty clean interior and exterior. The second time I took it for an actually test drive and enjoyed it aside from two noises I heard when rolling down the windows.

Before I continue, some background on the guy I got it from. He runs a towing company and often comes into repossessions from auctions where you can either get some really good deals or royally screwed. He bought a large batch of cars and was going to be selling them off as is. His son-in-law was initially interested in buying it. He drove it to and from work for a little while and said he noticed no issues. He decided to pass because he figured he could find something better for cheaper from the in-law. I expressed some interest as I was looking to get rid of my car because it was causing me grief, needed repairs, and I wanted something more reliable since I am a volunteer firefighter and like to go hiking on service roads out of reception. We got in touch and I scheduled a time to meet him.

Back to the second test drive. I brought it back and expressed that I was hearing two noises. One of which I knew was a serpentine belt and the other I was unsure of. It sounded to me like it was coming from the rear right wheel. He explained to me that it was most likely the dust shield barely grazing the rotor. I looked into that and it seemed probably with the noise seeming similar from what I was hearing on youtube. We pulled it into his bay and had his mechanic take a look at it. Assured me it was the dust shield, bent it back a little, and I took it out again. The noise persisted but they said it was all good. I figured I was just being picky and it did actually seem a little better when I took it out for a minute. Some things just go away, as did a horrible squeal with my rotor so I wasn't worried. We did up the paper work and I was on my way.

On my way home, the noise began to grow. Over the next few days that I drove the vehicle, the longer I was in it the louder it became. I booked it in with my regular mechanic explaining the chirp from the belt and noise from the rear wheel.

Then there was the call. ""How long have you had this vehicle"" and ""where did you get it from."" At this point I knew something was wrong; the rear differential was shot. This was apparently a common issue in 2013-2015 cx-5s with certain VIN numbers (something I missed when doing research). They explained best case $4000 CAD for repairs and worst case $6500 if they had to replace more of the diff system. I was devastated and felt absolutely betrayed. I asked if they could looked over the vehicle for anything else before I decided the next move. These guys have been great to my family and I and super honest so I trust them and their opinions.

The second call. Unusual rusting, blown front struts, worn rotors, leaky exhaust, cracked tires and a rolled back odometer. I'm not really a car person so I only know basic things to check when looking at a vehicle and don't know exactly what to look for. They pulled up a carfax (which I totally regret not getting) which showed 188000kms recorded in 2016. They estimated $9300 in repairs to a vehicle I just payed $13000 + tax for. It is not worth it. Im in shock, I can barely stand but I keep my cool. We discuss next moves and such before we end the call. I lost it afterwards. That is a lot of money to me considering I don't make a lot. The father-in-law initially offered to help with some of the costs for the rear differential. When I emailed him the new report my mechanic sent me, he said ""that's the condition the car came in when I got it off the bailiff. I don't know what to tell you.""

What the hell do I do. I feel fucking betrayed. He was going to give this vehicle to his son-in-law. Yes I should have brought it to my own mechanic first. Yes I should have bought a carfax. Yes I shouldn't have done __________. I know, but I need help. Please.",12Nov2020,1

At the plane a guy sat next to me. We started to chat nicely and I thought I had made a friend on a plane, like some people do. He bought me a drink after I refused but whatever.

When we were going to land he got closer and I tried to move away but he kissed me, and then again. I honestly don't mind it for some reason but makes me feel cheap and I don't know what to think.

830,"Hey~
So, my girlfriend texted me last night really distressed and opened up about having suicidal thoughts. She mentioned that she’s had them before, but they haven’t shown up for a while until now (she’s suffered from depression and anxiety since she was little). She thinks it’s caused by the stress of school and some family issues currently going on, but she’s not sure. I’ve encouraged her to talk about it with her therapist, but she says that she’s scared in case they tell her parents. I agree with her on that, actually, them knowing would undoubtedly make the situation worse considering how they’ve handled things in the past. 

Thankfully, she says it’s just fleeting thoughts and she hasn’t given much thought to the action themselves, but we’re both worried that it could go down that path if it’s not approached correctly. I’ve dealt with suicidal thoughts and self-harm before so I can relate to her on some level, but since our situations are quite different I don’t want to assume anything. During our conversation we talked about her experiences and I tried to understand what she’s going through. I tried to calm her down and find ways to help her, mainly through therapy. After a while we did some breathing exercises together to help relax her body since she was trembling, and then we just talked about random stuff for a couple hours so she could take her mind of things. This is the first time we’ve talked about something like this, so I am worried that I may have said something harmful. Especially since I want to focus on the topic of suicide directly so that she can get the help she needs, but at the same time I don’t want her to go into a panic attack if I bring it up so much. Due to COVID I can’t be there for her in person either. 

I guess I’m just looking a for a good ways to approach the situation?? All help is appreciated",12Nov2020,1
831,"Hello Reddit I hope this is the right place to ask, apologies for any format issues as I’m posting on mobile.

My flatmate’s partner has moved in for a current local lockdown (fair enough) so this means there’s more of us to a bathroom. This comes with its own frustrations obviously but the most direct one being - he doesn’t flush the toilet after he pees.

I understand saving water and it’s probably not that unsanitary or whatever, but none of the rest of us do this, and I just hate seeing someone else’s pee and tissue in the toilet when I’m peeing. It just makes me uncomfortable and feels kinda dirty.

How do I confront him about it? Should I suck it up for however long he’s here?

I was thinking of posting in the flat group chat so it wasn’t singling him out - but that feels a bit like I’m shaming if other people don’t think it’s a problem, given his partner definitely knows he’s doing it because I’ve heard my flatmate go into the bathroom right after him.

834,"Hey Redditors, I need some advice. I don't have many people to talk to. I anonymously stalk Reddit so I finally decided to post. To begin, I (24M) Have a group of friends that I met online(Gaming), we have consistently been in parties and other social media activities since 2013-14. We've even met in person, helped each other with a lot of things, have a lot of shit in common somewhat. My personality is playful, I'm the nerdy black kid that enjoys music, financial podcasts, and casual gaming. I work a lot and go to college they've been the only people I've played games with/talk to on any online platform for years. There's seven of us, and a few more have recently joined the group. However, things have taken a turn for the worse. I don't know how to let go, our relationships have always been harsh jokes, arguing, and other fucked up things. None of this is new just started paying more attention. I had a bad breakup this year and needed people to talk to, so I told the few I thought liked me what happened. The moment they get mad, they clown me for falling in love and being heartbroken because she cheated on me. Not all of them do this, but they don't say anything to the ones that do, so I always end up defending myself. I'm now over the disrespect. None of them provide anything positive in my life, I just have an attachment to them because they were always the only friends I've ever had that would call me and help me with stuff, etc. Everyone gangs up on me when given the chance. They say I'm too sensitive, and it's not that I just don't appreciate disrespect. One of the guy's girlfriend is now apart of the group she consistently disrespects me every chance she gets and he ignores it but will get upset if I match her energy. I've reached a point in my life where if people don't treat me as nice as the workers at chic fil a then I don't need them. I just have a hard time letting go of people. People always tear me down for whatever reason, maybe it's my personality I've been cheated on lied to by everyone. Even my mom liked my cheating ex enough to still help her out behind my back. I'm just in a bad spot on top of that I don't know where to go next. Sorry if this is all over the place, but I am as well.

How do I let go? How do I mentally stop caring? I hate that I care so much.

Thought about the gym but covid has me not going to the gym so they we're only people I was interacting with besides my siblings.

She and Jeremy said they would call me back. But they never did.

Hello Advice people, I’m here for more healthy advice from you all.

Due to the pandemic I lost my job and have been driving Postmates and picking up side gigs to make ends meet. About two weeks ago I came across an amazing job listing. Small up and coming business, only 10minutes away from my house, my desired pay, and amazing experience that could boost my career in the future. I worked my butt off for an interview. Updated my resume, cover letter, making my Instagram aesthetically pleasing, and researching the crap out of the industry. 

I got the first interview. Met the employees and the CEO of the company. Absolutely loved the two girls (both mid 20s) that worked there and the boss (45M) appeared to be pretty chill. They mentioned that they are like one big family there and often take trips/ go out together to bond. I crushed the first interview and was offered a second one.

Second interview was a little different from the first. The boss wanted to take me to lunch 1 on 1 which seemed okay to me.... He was just a man that wanted to get to know his employees before they get hired. I arrived at the office and he drove us in his Mercedes to my favorite local sushi spot. During this meeting we discussed business but he also wanted to know personal things like about my boyfriend, family, etc. I picked up that he knew a lot about the employees personal lives but I figured he’s just a caring boss. After we finished our lunch he offered me the job and I was thrilled. My financial hardship finally coming to an end and I’m about to work for a company that was a perfect fit for me.

After I received the job one of the girls that worked there followed me on Instagram and I noticed that we had a mutual friend (we can call her Jess). I was excited to find out how they knew each other. By coincidence Jess stopped by my house the day after my second interview to visit my roommate. Of course I asked her how she knew my new co worker but the response is exactly opposite of what I wanted. Jess’s eyes grew wide and she began to worn me not to work there. She explained that she had previously worked there for two years and that the boss was a complete creep. I took what she said into consideration and was about to not accept the job. But then I was given advice from a different friend to give it a chance and make my own experience there with caution of the new information I have.But then this morning a friend of Jess who also used to work at the company sent me a DM. It was a lonnnngggg message going into detail about how this man r*ped her and blackmailed her while she was working there. I totally believe her because there was a lot of detail and I don’t see why some girl would put so much effort into lying about something like this.

I’m here asking for advice because I’m so conflicted. I don’t want to work for this guy and now I actually hate him but I need a job and I was so excited for all this had to offer. Can anyone spare some advice on this? 

TLDR: I’m in a financial crisis and landed my dream job for this time period in my life. Recently I met with some friends and discovered they used to work there a few years back. One of the girls confessed that the boss r*ped and blackmailed her and warned me not to work there. Seeking advice because a girl is freakin struggling. Thank you",12Nov2020,1

843,"I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post examples. Especially as the one example I have is a topic most people prefer not to hear. Note: this is not medical related necessarily? I don't know what this would be. 

Ever since I was five years old, I've been drawing. I've also been handwriting. This was also the age I was diagnosed with autism which likely caused the problem I have. My handwriting, has not changed one bit. It's been bad all the time, to the point where I cannot read my own handwriting. It seems to have gotten worse. I'm 23 years old. Interestingly, I can write some hiragana well, as I tried to learn Japanese. But that's about my only good handwriting. 

Meanwhile, in English, I cannot write anything by hand. My hand feels uncomfortable all the time, I lean on my wrist, I tried lifting but it gets worse. I try writing slowly, same story. I try different positions, different pens. My handwriting and drawing is the same. It sucks. 

I'm not sure if it's related or even the same issue. I play guitar, and I used to play pretty well, navigation and scales were easy, until about a year ago, where it just went downhill suddenly and I just sucked at playing. Despite years of practice. I also use my keyboard (Qwerty) all day. 

I don't know what to do. Whether this problem is permanent or temporary? There's no point in suggesting practice. I've done that. I failed every subject in school except Maths. And the problem was my handwriting. Nobody thought I should use a keyboard.",12Nov2020,1
844,"I don't know how to deal with this, it scares me too much the idea of having to live with this the rest of my life.

I had my first contact with the web at the times when you could be completely anonymous: blogs and forums and messenger, basically with an email that was not name.surname and a nickname and an avatar. I felt safe, and disclosed myself only when I felt ready to meet in public the new friends or lovers. And I could always quit that online space and delete my account and disappear.

Now I have an anxiety crisis because I cannot delete truly my app download history, for example. I want a pure record, that is the point. PURE, immaculate, CLEAN. Nothing. I cannot bear it, even with the top privacy settings and absolutely no one interested in minding my business I cannot have a pure clean record online. 

For me being unknown and anonymous is synonym with being respectable, and even more importantly I don't want to be reminded painful or unpleasant things, I need to be able to LET GO of the past instead of having it shoved into my face every time. That wrong buy on amazon that reminds me of when I was in an unpleasant situation? That app that I downloaded without using it because someone I want to forget advised me to do so? My bank app that still show me that impulse purchase I want to forget? You get the idea. I feel that I am forced to live in my past and have it thrown back at me to soil me. 

I feel condemned to be chained to my past and to be ridiculously exposed as if I have no dignity. And the worst thing is the feeling of powerlessness because I am now a pariah for saying I don't like it.

847,"I don't know why but unless it's from my mother I often find myself visibly put off by positivity especially if it's directed at me. I don't like compliments. Depending on what kind of compliment it is I'll enjoy it. Like if your complimenting my intelligence or work then I will be happy with the compliment otherwise I don't like it. 

For a while I've found a lot of people compliment me only based on my skill which I enjoy. It feels like my ego is being fed and it makes me happy to know that I'm smarter and to an extent better then all the other kids. 

But otherwise I really hate compliments. When somebody compliments me I get this very weird and unpleasant feeling and my eyes start to go wide. Sometimes I'll feel a little dizzy, sometimes I'll feel super uncomfortable and restless. Especially if it seems geniune since I can tell whether or not someone is being geniune when they compliment me. 

It's only really a few times I find myself being complimented geniunely but it makes me super uncomfortable and gives me the most unpleasant and strange feeling I've ever felt. 

And of it's just positivity sometimes not even directed at me. I still feel pretty gross hearing or even being near it. I just grow increasingly uncomfortable. I'm not trying to be edgy or cool, I am being 100%, I've noticed more and more on zoom calls that the energy seems... Positive. And it disgusts me. I really hate it. It makes me feel weird and I want nothing to do with it. I know this is mean and rude but it is really gross to me. And then there's the fact people have started complimenting me. 

It's the one reason why I've always disliked this one teacher a little. She usually compliments my work and talent and like everyone else praises it and me but sometimes she'll give me geniune compliments and I'll feel gross. 

I don't think it's normal to be as weirded out by compliments as I am or even positivity so I think their might be something wrong with me. I mean I really do enjoy having my work complimented. It makes me feel superior to my classmates. Even if I'm actually on the same level as them which academically I'm not.",12Nov2020,1

ok so i'll try to explain this the best i can. i won't use real names i'll just use A B C. A is my close friend, B is my friend but we're not close, C was my close friend who hurt me 

so person A told me that C told B that i'm desperate to fuck C and that i have a fat ass and that's why they're interested in me (it's all lust). person B asked them for an update with me, by then i had already stopped talking to C, and C tells B that they don't know why i stopped talking to them but he doesn't care because he doesn't like me anyway. so B asks them ""wait you don't like her"" and he says ""no i mean i'd be down to do stuff with her and i'm sure she would too but it's whatever""

i am pissed off that he's just lying about this stuff saying that i'm desperate to fuck him and that he doesn't even care that i'm not talking to him anymore. like that makes me feel like the friendship we had meant nothing to him. i opened up to him about so much and we talked everyday and he doesn't even care

my problem is that i can't confront C about this because B doesn't know that A told me. so if i try talking to C then he will think B told me and then B will know A told me. the trust between A and i will be broken and the trust between A and B will be broken. B doesn't want A to tell me about this (they still don't know A told me) B just doesn't want to lose C as a friend. i don't even know why B wants to stay friends with C if he's gonna disrespect women like that because B is a girl. he got rejected not long ago by someone else and i know he's just gonna hurt another girl

i have the opportunity today to talk to him about it because he texted me saying he noticed i deleted him on everything and he wants to know what he did. A told me about this whole thing because he felt i had a right to know but he doesn't want me to say anything to C. but it's bothering me that i'm letting myself be treated like this. do i confront him or move on?",12Nov2020,1
849,"There's this girl in my class. we know each other for around 4 years now. She has a bf, but she tells me from time to time that she likes me, and somtimes calls my name(quietly) in the middle of class and when i turn to her she makes heart signs.

850,"My (f20) sister (F22) is obsessed with the online game IMVU and i dont know what to do. 

A little background: 

My sister is quite introverted and has anxiety which would explain any comfort she finds in IMVU. Besides that, she has no other disorders (i.e. she doesn't have adhd/add nor is she autistic). She started playing this game two years ago and it's taken over her whole life since then. She no longer has any irl friends because of how invested she got in the game, her bf and her broke up because she would only play the game and not even talk to him. She won't look for a job because of the game despite how she complains about not having money. 

She doesn't talk to me or my parents anymore. When she does she's only paying half attention and you usually need to repeat yourself several times before she actually listens and when she does, she usually dismisses what you said because she doesn't care. I called her out on this rude behavior several times since she does it to everyone irl but she says that I'm too needy and annoying and that I talk to much. And yes, I admit I can talk a lot sometimes but my other family doesn't and it's sad to see my grandpa try to talk to her and she's busy on her phone. 

My sister made some friends in game which is nice and isn't normally a problem but they quickly became friends who consumed her time. They are always talking to her about in-game drama and irl problems and normally those are normal friend activities but this more extreme. Plus she's lying to them about several things, the main one being that they think she's a man. They talk for the whole day which is why she ignores my family. There is no family drama either and my parents are quite supportive but it is frustrating that she is living with us and isn't in school nor working. 

These friends are more important to her than anyone else it seems. She really won't talk to us because she is busy texting them. She has an awful attitude now, usually reminding me of a 13 year old. I'm happy she has friends and made good connections but the relationship she has with them is built on lies. they think she's a guy and a few other things i wont disclose. 

My family and I have tried to talk to her about this and her obsession with IMVU but she is always dismissing what we say and denies it. I don't know if she is actually in denial or refuses to admit it to us (she can be quite proud). I'm the closest person to her irl and im the only one she opens up to irl so i try to be careful with what i say but it never works out. She either misses my point because she wasn't listening, or gets really defensive.

She spends a lot (too much imo) real money for the game currency (almost ruined her credit) and gets into drama with other players. She complains when we visit my family irl (that we rarely see) because she has an online wedding (two players getting married in game) or something similar. 

At first this game wasn't a huge issue but it slowly started to be the only thing she does. She'll wake up and immediately open up IMVU. She doesn't stop playing until she falls asleep which is usually 4am. Sometimes she'll stay up until 6am because she's busy playing the game. It happens often. 

This game has prevented her from trying to get a job (she doesnt even apply to any), has ruined some of her irl relationships, and spend all her money for clothes for her character. When she was in school, she was so consumed with the game, she'd neglect her school assignments. (she's graduated now). 

Therapy isn't really an option since my family cannot afford it. Plus, my sister would refuse to go and we can't make her because she's a grown woman. An intervention would be bad because she'll shut us out completely and it could ruin our relationship. it could also be very bad for her anxiety. 

I dont know what to do. This game has taken over her entire life and it got worse when my country went into lockdown. It wasn't so bad when she started but this game quickly became the one thing she does all day and it's been happening for a long time now. All she does is lay in bed playing the game on her phone and computer. 

It was nice to see she found comfort in the game at first but the way it has escalated makes me wish she never played it. 

Does anyone have any advice on what we can do? I don't want this game to ruin her life. She has goals and aspirations that she doesn't even work towards because of the game. My parents are concerned as well. 

note: the obsession with the game happened before quarantine and lockdown. She isn't on any medication or other type of treatment for her anxiety because she refuses. She also has a history of an online game such as IMVU consuming her life. 

TL;DR  my sister is addicted to IMVU which has negatively impacted her life and my family doesn't know what to do to help her.",12Nov2020,1

Short version of this is, I used to live in PA.  
Me and my boyfriend are closing on a home at the end of the month and then will officially be living in NC, but, I am wondering if I should change my phone number, and if I do on our plan does he have to as well.

I believe like 10 years ago, it would have been a hard yes, for filling out resume's and stuff having an out of state number could be odd. And calls coming from your number to in state friends might be ignored.

But I also feel like all of your friends are in contacts now so it does not really matter much, and, do employers really care about what your phone number is as long as your physical address is in state and around where you are trying to work?

Are there any other pros or cons I am missing (except for the obvious con of having to change your number with everyone you have even given it to)",12Nov2020,1

I've been in therapy for YEARS and have yet to get to the point where I'm improving. 

I'm attractive, smart, talented...but even writing those things now just feels wrong to say about myself. I quiver in the face of conflict and will rarely stand up for myself because I fail every time.

I'm a plus size nonbinary and have ibs and adhd meaning I'm struggling to find a job where I could have easy access to a bathroom and breaks and preferably one where I can sit. Ideally it'd be work from home. I live in America. 

I have little experience, I worked at a restaurant as a cashier at a buffet that has closed, only a couple months at a dollar store that definitely was doing shady practices and only gave me a couple hours a month, and maybe a year at a retail store. I've been not working for awhile now because I wanted to focus on college (I'm also fine arts major but im still a semester off of getting my associates) amd because retail was killing my mental health, but with the current world situation the household needs the extra income. 

I do horribly in retail, I get stressed out easily and struggle with people skills. My last retail job I ended up crying several times and just absolutely miserable mentally. Ideally I want a job I can keep for awhile thats a work from home job. I'm a hard worker I just struggle with my physical limitations and trouble with people skills and stress.

I'm currently enrolled in a program where I find a job through my school's application process and go on interviews to be hired for a 6-month full-time position. Some positions are paid some are unpaid, some start ups some fortune 500s.

Anyways, I'm 2 months into my unpaid marketing gig and I feel like I'm being used very heavily and not learning as much as I should be. I understood while applying that unpaid gigs are a very controversial thing right now and that I would be involved in a lot more projects than I technically would be, but this feels strange.

I'm at a startup marketing agency that works directly with athletes and celebrities in managing their socials and what not. I am planning on working with film/photography in the future so this felt like an excellent place to make connections and get some first hand experience working with clients! I was right, but I'm doing a lot of the work myself and am not really being guided.

My boss, a 30 year old woman, is the only employee and she hires 4 students from my school each cycle. She calls us three times a day and gives us tasks to complete throughout the day, of which I mostly do video editing and graphic design for her clients. I get an assignment from her in the morning, work on it and then get feedback throughout the day. I've gone on some video shoots with her but all of the students ended up being in charge of lighting, staging, blocking, editing, audio mixing, etc.

I feel like I'm ranting and dragging this out, but the jist of it is that I feel like I'm teaching my employer a lot more than she's teaching me. To add to that, I'm doing all of this without getting paid. Her suggestions and ideas end up being scrapped for my ideas and my decisions are usually the ones that stand.

My fiance (I'll call him F for fiance) and I are currently long distance, so we video chat a lot. I also send him pictures sometimes, because, well he's my partner and I trust him.

His roommate (I'll use R for roommate) I have known about the same amount of time as him. F moved in with R not that long ago, but they work together (both miltary) and get along fine. F had to get his wisdom teeth pulled earlier this week, and they put him under for it, and R was able to drive him there and back. F gave R his phone to hold onto while under anesthesia.

A side note is that F NEVER texts people. We talk almost exclusively via Snapchat, and he communicates with R mainly over FB messenger. He just doesn't text because cell service is inconsistent. However, last night he opened up his texts to ask R to pick something up from the store and saw, dated for the day of the wisdom tooth removal, a series of ""undelivered"" messages to R of my nudes. Now, they say they weren't delivered, and the time listed for when they were sent is for later in the day, hours after they had been back home.

After the initial shock, F confronted R, and asked to see his phone. Nothing in the texts, nothing in the photos. According to F, R was very open to showing him he had nothing to hide and expressed that he understood why it looked sketchy, as well as saying F's anger was totally justified.

When we talked about it after the confrontation, I asked F if there were any photo vault apps on the phone, or even possibly 2 ""calculators"" since some of those apps are disguised that way. He said he doesn't remember seeing anything like that, but I feel like in the heat of the moment he wouldn't think to check for that stuff. And now that he already looked, I doubt he could ask R to let him check again.

I feel weird and uncomfortable. I've tried to wrap my head around it. Is there anything I or F can do? Without proof, I feel like it can't really be handled with their command, and even if it was brought up for his phone to be searched, the initial confrontation may have spooked him into deleting any evidence. Part of me wants to just move on and forget about it, and let myself believe they never went through. But I definitely feel uncomfortable with the situation. I no longer trust R, and any sort of friendship we had is gone. Basically, he's guilty until he can prove his innocence.

877,"So, I moved into an apartment with a friend and her boyfriend about 4.5 months ago. They have a cat who I'll call B. I love cats and I've always gotten along with them so it didn't seem like it'd be an issue. B is by far the most aggressive cat I've met. Constantly will bite your ankles as you walk by and just always a little to liberal on scratching you. Honestly, this didn't even really bother me.

A couple weeks ago, a neighbor's dog ran into our apartment when my roommate was leaving. B went into a complete frenzy and attacked my roommate and then went for me. I had to hide in the closet because he wouldn't stop attacking me. A lot of cuts on my arm and leg along with my roommate. We couldn't really blame B because it was obviously a stress reaction.

Cut to recently, my roommate was coming around the corner and I jumped out at her to scare her and her yelp sent B back into that mode. I again had to hide in the closet to protect myself. She chalked it up to a reaction to her scream and that it wouldn't happen again.

Today, B again went into attack mode when I was getting him out of my room (I don't let him in unsupervised because he eats my plants). He got me good on my thumb and still won't let me downstairs, hissing anytime I get close. I've managed to stop him from charging by spraying air freshener in front of me. 

I've started to have what feels like anxiety attacks when he seems like he's becoming angry. I very much doubt they'd get rid of the cat (and I wouldn't ask them to). They're getting anxiety medication for him but I still feel increasingly tense that something like this will happen again because it seems to be more frequent.

Hello I live in South River NJ, I’ve been renting a room with no contract just verbal agreement , the owner of the house is a private school board,  I’ve been here for 8 months now however I had to deal with cockroaches mold and recently mice started appearing,  house is in a really bad shape, kitchen is horrendous I don’t even use it it smells really bad and there’s mouse droppings everywhere and urine,  I can’t afford to leave right now I need at least a month but is there a way to do anything legally?

I recently had a fight with a very conservative family member that concluded with us not considering each other family anymore. I am a bisexual progressive girl and he is a racist, sexist, homophobic, catholic, conservative, prick. He is my uncle, so i will probably still see him when he comes over to my house to eat with my family (I’m a high school senior). 
Anyway, when we fought, it was over politics but he said something along the lines of “at least i don’t support a man who is pro abortion and gay marriage.” I was thinking it would be funny (at least for me) to piss him off a bit next time he comes over by putting on a pride flag as a cape, and a “we did it. 46” cap on.

886,"Long story short, I accidentally found my sister's (14F) online account for some independent forum, in which she firmly believes that our parents are abusive. The thing is, I've never thought of them that way.

My sister is dealing with mental health struggles, so I guess she has a different perspective - they don't understand it, and will blame it on society, her peers, etc. I've found out that my sis thinks she's genderqueer (but I don't know her preferred pronouns, so right now I'm still calling her ""she""), and our parents have repeatedly said that they don't think those issues are ""real,"" and will yell at her for thinking that way. They also initially refused to send her to therapy because they again thought it was ""trendy,"" etc., etc. She's now going because I pushed hard for it. But they genuinely don't understand these issues - this is a culture difference, and they did eventually relent in the end. Does that constitute abuse?

Other than that, they can be verbally nasty sometimes - if we wasted time instead of doing our homework, for example, they'll say we're ""useless"" and we'll ""end up working at McDonalds"" or something like that, and they'll go on and on about it, and that does feel bad. I always got good grades etc., so I think my sister gets the worse end of it. But the thing is, my sister *will not* talk about her feelings with anybody, so I don't think they really understand what she's feeling. Does this constitute abuse?",12Nov2020,1

We were friends first and met in school about 5 years ago and we always had a thing for each other but just recently we started to take each other seriously. He is a Scorpio and so am I. 

This kind of intimidated me at first because we are both so intense and so alike. A lot of things about him intimidated me, such as how smart and intellectual he is, his mindset, and so much more. I feel like I can’t be on his level sometimes.. so I push him away. I am not some selfish person just playing with his feelings though, and I am not intentionally ghosting him. There were just some times where I would not feel like texting for some reason and it’s not that i was ignoring him. 

I have told him before that I’ve been going through a lot and sometimes do not even have the energy to respond to people and not big on texting, he said he understands completely but it seems like he does not care that I keep hurting him. After I texted him that, he gave me my space and I texted him to wish him a happy birthday and we started talking again and I became distant again. None of this is fair to him and I keep hurting him because I am still healing.

I used to be very depressed, have a very rough past and I feel like these things are kind of weighing us down because I am scared to let him in, and let him know the real me.

Currently we stand at him texting me last night if we could talk. I feel like I am ready to talk to him but I am still scared to open up to him because I really don’t know what to say.

  I thought by now,, a few months into all living together they'd all have it right, until yesterday one of my roommates kept saying my name but pronouncing it significantly incorrectly so that it becomes a different name.

This is probably gonna sound stupid. So my gramma bought a dozen donuts for us today. She had 5 earlier and I only had one powdered-filled one. A few minutes ago, she asked if I wanted to eat some. I said sure. When I bought them upstairs, she commented on how big my cup of milk was but I Let it go. (Side note-she always tells me how fat I am even tho I only weight 120 lbs.) when I opened the box I went to eat one iced one and she demanded she gets the iced ones. I said I haven’t had any iced ones today. Or any besides one for that matter. I said she could have a powdered one and a plain one. She started screaming about how she deserves a iced one. I said no I’d like an iced one please, plus I’ll have the reg glazed one. She continued to scream and I was really upset. Then she just grabbed all the iced one and ran to the bathroom and ate them all. I got upset and said. Well if you ate all my donuts then I’m throwing your food out. She said “ I don’t care. Fuck you.” So I went downstairs and hid some of the food from her freezer and fridge. When I came upstairs, she grabbed me by my shoulders and neck and was shaking me and was threatened to kill me or kick me out. My mind is still jumbled. I hit her so she’d let me go, and she let go and started screaming don’t you ever hit me, fu dumb bitch and all this stuff. She dragged me downstairs to find the food which was literally just sitting in the oven. She kept screaming at me and stuff. She was upstairs smashing stuff in my room, and I belief she smashed my new Greek statue and my tv. Not sure yet. But I’m scared. I can’t call the cops as she’s the only person I have.

I’m female 21. Cousin(female 25)
I feel like I’m her punching bag

My cousins treats me like shit. Sometimes I feel like just never picking up her calls or texts.

It’s got to the point I feel I am her punching bag.

So me and her went to a wedding right. She wanted to get some cake for her, me and her brothers. 

I told her I feel embarrassed doing that because people were there and watching. And she isn’t embarrassed about anything, she is confident. 

She told me to just get, they don’t care because I’m young. I’m 20, and she’s 25. What’s the difference. She got annoyed with me so I just went and got it.

I put away the ones I got and she told me she wanted one she can eat, I told her I got these ones the least she can do is get the other herself she said no, and got annoyed. So I did it for her again.

Then later when we were leaving, and they were cutting the cake, she wanted to taste it and insisted I get it for her. But when I wanted it, she said get it yourself.


Before we left the house to go to this wedding, she and her brother got into an argument in the car. Like always she bought me in, this time she record her self and she was saying “this bitch also gets on my nerves like he does, they are so annoying etc” she thought i didn’t believe her so she showed me the video. 

I told her she’s not okay, she’s like what do you mean I’m not okay then I ignored her and she continue to talk to her brother.

The thing is that she uses her brother, so when he stands up for himself, she shuts it down. She thinks he is her personal Uber. She didn’t even ask or tell him  if he would drive us to the wedding. Instead she waited the last minute to ask him, they got into a big argument at the end he said okay.

Today I told her to send me all the videos and pictures we took. Instead she sent me only 10. You guys don’t understand during those two events we went to, I took for her about all together 50 or more videos and pictures.

Before the bridal party or the wedding, she decided we were going to get a dress made for us. 

She told me we would wake up lets say, 9am, the place is 30 to 40 minutes away. So the thing about me is that if someone says that the time we’re waking up, I already have the alarm set, so I woke up, and she is still asleep. Instead we ended leaving at 1pm that day. So I woke up for nothing, I wanted to go back to sleep so bad.

She did this like three or four days in the same week.  Because we had to go and find the person who was going to make the dress, then measure us, then come back and try it, then if it didn’t fit or wanted something loosen up we would have to come back and fix that. I told her I was sleep, but that didn’t stop her from telling me a completely different time to wake up.

Yet she had the guts to tell me I’m hard to wake up, and that nothing can wake me up. 

Another thing is that, for the wedding she insisted I wear this dress she bought and wanted to return it back.

So she brought this cute dress, it was too tight on her so she said wear this, it shows your curves. She’s older than me so I listen to her right, I wore it to the wedding. I thought her I already had something to wear and I’m fine wearing that, she wouldn’t stop saying wear this you look amazing. 

Her and her brother had to go back to their houses, so I can pick up my stuff and take me to my house.

I didn’t have time to get undress and change, I change out of her shoes, then one item she gave me, and her bag she gave me. 

She never told me to get changed, I thought and felt bad for her brother always driving us when he’s tired and just wants to stay home so I changed out of whether I can and got bAkc in the car.

You wouldn’t believe what she said to me.

She asked if I got out of the dress, I told her no, I didn’t know if you guys wanted to wait long time until I got changed.

She said well now that you already wore it, pay me 25 for the dress and you can keep it.

I told her no thank you, I will bring it bZck to you

She said no it’s fine, just ask your mother.

I told her, I’m not doing that, you know I don’t have money, I don’t have job.

She said well you wore it so we can’t return it. 

The thing is that she already tried it before I did, which means she wore it before I did, otherwise she wouldn’t know it was right on her.

So why am I the one paying for it?

Her and her dad got into a big fight. She left the house and stayed with us. It’s been a month since I have been living with her.

She emotional tires. You don’t understand. She literally finds anything to put me down. And because I stand up for my self it’s like she gets a pleasure out of it.

This girl who stayed me with at the beginning for a week told me I snore in my sleep. Which is a lie because I share a room with three siblings, in holidays they stay up in the night and sleep in the morning. Not once anyone in my family said I snore.

I even asked them and they said no to her.

She also lied saying I sleep talk, you guys don’t get it, my sisters are up late nights. They don’t wear headphones so if I snore and sleep talked they would tell me.

Another thing she does is she touches my things without asking. I’m not being sensitive, I will let you have whether you want if you just ask me.

Or let me know if took it.

She took my phones and as I asked her why she’s taking them she said shut up. Shut up for a second.

That’s why I don’t like her tocubig my stuff. Trust me I’m not like this with my family or my close cousins or friends.

I have a cousin who’s the same age as me and we share everything and go though each other’s things without asking because we’re that comfortable with each other.


What annoys me is the way she goes about it.

She literally gets pressure about insulting me, multiple times she tried to piss me off while on the phone to her friends she insults, laughs, while she can see I’m not in the mood for it.

This one time, I didn’t know she was on the phone because few times earlier we were talking and still talking. Until out of no where she’s saying your a bitch but I love you. Multiple times, I asked her what do you mean. Are you talking to me. 

Instead of simply saying no, she says mind your business. 

I asked her what do to mean, I’m asking if your talking to me. 

She said again mine your business, 

I said I’m not minding my business when it seems like your talking to me.

She then says my friend says mind your business, 

I said I don’t care, don’t tell me to mind my business. 

I went quiet after that, she didn’t say anything. 

Another thing, everytime she assumes I’m angry at her like I’m not talking to her, it pisses me off because she thinks I’m angry all the time and that she’s worth my emotions.

Everytime she says why are you so angry, even though I answer her calling me twice she still assumed I’m angry.

Why the fuck would I answer to you calling my name twice if I was angry at you.

It’s so tiring dealing with her.

It would be months until she makes up with her dad and goes to her house. I don’t think I can do it. 

I share a bed with her. And a room, a space.

I don’t know what to, do you guys think I’m just overreacting?

At first when we were bought out, changes were mostly for the better. Better benefits, better HR, better computers/ technology; really just better equipment in general.

The changes started beginning of 2020. But especially the past 6 months with Covid there have been numerous changes with SOP and general work tasks. Even still we as an office are required to report to our location, regardless, since we were brought back. 

Everything is via phone and computer. Physical meetings are not required anymore.

Not to mention, half my job is obsolete because of the switch to 100% paperless and updared company website  accessibility of services due to the pandemic. All reports, instead of compiling multiple sources and creating spreadsheets based on information, are basically just plucked from fields using software and all I do is double check and send the link to the next person. 

I still have a few other tasks but its just so boring. 

We chat and whatnot but I never feel productive anymore. Some days I literally sit at my desk and watch TV on my phone for a couple hours because there's no work. We even hire a cleaning service so we don't even clean (besides sanitizing our desks and whatnot but we do that throughout the day anyway with covid. )

I just don't know what to do. I get that its outside of my control. I even applied for a higher up position and I made it to the interview stage with 2 other candidates. Then they took the posting down and never hired anyone for the position.

Anyone with any experience like mine or any advice?",12Nov2020,1

913,"Is this sexual assault?

I was hanging with a boy that I've been talking to and he started to get really sexual. This was our second time hanging out and I eventually asked him if this was all he wanted me for. 

He said no and kept going. 

I kept saying no and dodging him. I thought I was abundantly clear I didn't wanna do anything too much. 

He would stop a little dodging later and then come at me like five minutes later. This was in like intervals??? And I'd have to do the awkward dance again. 

When he would stop, I would ask if he wanted me to go or if he was mad at me and he'd be like ""no!! no means no, it's your body."" 

And that's the part that confuses me. If he was disrespectful of my boundaries, why was he respectful?

I'm not really sure that this is like bad, I'm not sure if I'm being a pussy, or if I read things wrong. 

I ended up giving him what he wanted but like throughout the day I felt very not good.

I could have been more harsh and clear cut but that's hard for me and I just don't feel like I should have to. But also maybe I was too soft or wasn't clear enough. Like if I was in control in the situation, I would have absolutely known it was a no, but that's because I know me and how I be and shit. 

I would have asked my mom but she has trauma related to this and probably wouldn't let me leave the house without a tracker. 

My question is, is this sexual assault or am I extra or seeing this bad",12Nov2020,1
914,"My housemate won't take the rubbish out, and it is a bit ridiculous at this point. Her car is literally in front of the bin shed. She could easier take it out, when she goes out. But she never does.

At first I through it was just a coincidence. I normally take it out when I'm heading out. I'm working from home due to COVID so obviously I haven't been out much. I tend to use the recycle more than the general one so I don't check it often. It was over full. When I took it out the bag ripped and I had to  get another and separate it into two bags. It was that full. No biggie.

Then it happened again, and again, and again. 

So, slightly annoyed that she doesn't take it out. I left it. Like I said above, her car is in front of the bin shed. Not only is it over fully, more than before, she put rubbish on the kitchen side. Not just empty packets of what she just cook that she forgot to put in the bin, we all do that for time to time. But half eaten food, tin foil, tins. She's clearly seen the bin was full and left it on the side. 

My housemate and I work different shifts so we don't really pass each other. I really don't want to start an argument after I long day at work. I hate my job (was planning on leaving when COVID hit but it's a steady job so I can't afford to leave now) and working from home has really made physically and mentally drained. 

I don't have the energy if it starts a fight. I know she'll something like ""well I hoover"" she hoovers ever other day, way more then need. She says it's because she has a lot of plants. 

Side note. I'm not even allowed to touch the plants. Which are basically everywhere. (Two room flat and she has over 40 plants, most of which are in the front room. One of the plants is next to the TV and has massive leaves that blocks a decent part of the TV from my spot\* on the sofa, one time I rotated it so I can see the whole screen and she had a proper go at me.

I don't have the energy to have an argument with her about it, I know that's how it will end if I brought it up. What should I do?

917,"Ok so tonight, a few minutes ago at the dinner table, my family got into an argument about sexism and oppression. I am 13M, and I have 3 older sisters, a mom, and a dad. One of my sisters didn’t even speak this whole time so that’s not really a factor. Basically all the women in my family are arguing that ALL men are trash, that they’re a waste of time, all these things. And my Dad is countering them saying that you because they are generalizing men, by saying ALL men are bad, it’s not ok and doesn’t make sense. I am with my dad, because I admit, there are a lot of men who have done horrible things and deserve to be called out for it. But so have women. Not all men have done something bad, a lot have, same could be said for women. So by generalizing and saying ALL men, Every single man on this planet, is sexist and wrong. I have posted about my sister saying this before, but now it was an argument between my whole family so it’s a bit worse. Any advice would help, thanks.

918,"I have heard horror stories about people with parents using their kids' identity for things their whole childhood, getting them into debt, etc.  I assume that a person would somehow be alerted if someone else was signing up for things under his/her name...?  But, I wonder how long it takes to find out about something like this?

The reason I ask is because my mother is very manipulative and financially irresponsible, and I've wondered if she would ever do something like that.  She constantly used my child support money on herself (plastic surgery, clothes for herself, vacations that I didn't get to go on, etc.).  She also constantly uses burner phones and changes her phone number multiple times a year.  My point is, she is kind of a shady person.  I don't have any evidence or specific reasons to think she would use my identity other than my own anxiety, I guess.  I'm just wondering...is there a way to check if anyone has ever used your identity like this?",12Nov2020,1

But by far the main problem is that I lost my motivation.  I lost my motivation to keep ahead of my homework and now I am procrastinating insanely hard - doing a week's worth of homework in one day, I am failing math for the first time ever, things like that.  I also lost the motivation to work out, to go on bike rides, etc.  I know what I have to do to fix my shit and I have more than enough time to do it since I no longer have any sort of schedule (except logging into my online classes from 08:00 to 15:00) but I just can't bring myself to do it.

921,"Essentially there's 2 issues I am suffering with that I'm suffering with at the moment and I don't know exactly where else to ask:

First of all I've been suffering with random bouts of insomnia, i can sleep well one day like 9-10pm or some days it can be almost 5am before i fall asleep. I usually quite a heavy sleeper (i.e. sleeping through alarms) but the instant I get a knock at my door from my parents in the morning I can normally wake up on a good night.

Second of all I've been suffering from slight panic attacks whenever I get into the family car for at least the past few weeks and of course thinking about it makes it worse. My mother and I got into a car crash in mid-march and the criminals that crashed into the car with a van never got caught, I'm guessing this might something to do with it but I'm not entirely sure since it's only sorted to happen recently.

925,"I'm a junior in college and to be honest I'm kind of struggling right now. I have this essay for my empirical research methods class that is now a week late (I got an extension, but I've missed the deadline for that as well now) and I haven't even been able to start it. I honestly can't tell you why either. Last semester I wrote a paper that was 3 times as long as this one and it wasn't an issue, but now I'm extremely stressed over this 5 page paper and I just can't get words on the page. 

I have been smoking and drinking a ton lately due to the pandemic, but as of last week I stopped because I'm concerned about my long term health. I'm sure you guys will tell me this is probably impacting my academic performance, and you would be correct, but I've been doing this since around March when things really went to shit and have managed a 3.7 gpa (which is the highest I've ever gotten in college) since then. My point is I should be able to do this regardless, but it's just not happening.

I'm also thinking that maybe this class just isn't good under my school's new system and that maybe that's why I'm struggling so much. Under this system, we do two classes at twice the speed instead of four classes over a semester, which effectively means I have half the time to learn these research methods and apply them in essays. Not to mention online learning makes things more difficult in general. My idea is if I dropped this class now, I could take it my senior year and have the full semester to figure my shit out. 

I suppose I'm just wondering if I'm giving up too easily. I've never gotten below a B in a college class before, let alone dropped one, but I really feel like I just might not be in the right headspace for this class with everything that's going on. We have another essay due next week and are already moving onto new research methods that we'll have to apply in our next paper. We're 3 out 7.5 weeks in at this point and I feel like if I don't get this research intensive paper done tonight or tomorrow, I'm probably going to flunk anyways because I'm not going to be ready for the final project.

927,"Hey There :)
I’ve never really asked for advice online before, so I don’t really know how to approach this, but in middle school I started having really bad depression. I was at a point where I was constantly suicidal, and very seriously thought about hurting myself. 
I eventually managed to pull myself away from actually committing suicide, but I still have depression.
The real problem is my sleep patterns. I know it’s common for people with depression to struggle with getting up in the morning, but it’s gotten to the point where I don’t know what to do about it anymore.
Back in 7nth grade I could will myself to get out of bed. In 8th I had to start getting dragged out because I couldn’t pull thoughts together in the morning anymore. In 9nth I was frequently late to the bus stop, and almost always running behind. In 10nth, it was basically the same as 9nth grade. And now in 11nth, I am still constantly late for school or being dragged out of bed, even though my computer is literally right next to my desk.
Recently though, my mom has started to punish me for not waking up on time. She only really takes away my stuff, but with this being a regular occurrence, it’s starting to wear me down.
I really need to get better at waking up in the morning, but I don’t know how. I’ve already tried tackling this from the depression side of things, but even counseling and trying to open up about my issues with people doesn’t seem to be making a difference with getting out of bed in the morning.
I’ve also tried to find new ways of waking people up, but a problem that I’ve been noticing is that those kinds of things only work once for me. I can put an alarm clock next to my ear, or my mom will dump water or cold marbles on me and it will work great the first time. After that the shock will be gone and I’ll just sleep right through it.
Is there anything else I can do to fix this?",12Nov2020,1
928,"So I suffer from OCD and to explain it quickly, my (27f) boyfriend (32m) is feeling exhausted by it. And I get it, I am too. The part that affects him the most is the constant reassurance that I need. We both know I shouldn’t ask for it and he shouldn’t give it, but it’s almost impossible, I’m too good at pleading. It’s things like: Am i good enough, does he love me, am I lazy, am I stupid, am I sick, is he tired of me etc. I’m on medication, but at the moment I’m not in therapy so that’s why I’m turning to reddit for this. 

My issue right now is that he has expressed that my behaviour makes him tired. He tells me that, but also that he still loves me and will work through it with me. But for my OCD it’s not good enough. I’ve asked him to talk about it too much already and all I want to do is go in his workroom and disrupt his work and demand reassurance. I won’t let myself, but I still want to. I just can’t let it go. And so I’m turning here for support I guess. Support for me and my bf so I may leave him be. Is there anyone here who can relate or give advice?

929,"I love the doggy daycare down the road form my house. I took my puppy there for her puppy classes and then decided to take her there for daycare to get some of her energy out. Her first day went great and then I brought her back on Tuesday. When I picked her up she looked terrified and the girl informed me that she accidentally got tackled by another pup and got a bloody nose and to keep and eye on her. That’s fine, it happens. 

When I brought her home she seemed a bit off but I just thought she was tired. As the night went on she would randomly cry out in pain and didn’t sleep at all (neither of us did). I brought her to the vets in the morning and found out she has a fracture in one of her vertebrae and severe trauma between the fractured vertebrae and the one it touches. I was told she might now suffer from arthritis at a young age. She’s only a couple meds and some pain killers and 2 weeks of bed rest, and she’s only 4 months old.

This dude man, they brought him back to the office because he wasn’t doing anything at all while working from home, no reprimand, nothing.  

His personality if I had to define it is that of a try hard wannabe chad but missing the mark on so many levels.  As a hard working introvert, I understand some people I’m just going to clash with personality wise but this guy is a whole other level.  I’m not a violent person at all but for some reason every time he opens his mouth I just want to punch him in the jaw and make him stop talking.  I know that’s horrible but everything this guy says and does is fake as hell and he only does it to get on peoples good side.  

Always trying to find a problem in someone’s else’s work, going way above his station trying to make little problems seem really big so he can take the credit for finding them, all the while making work even harder for the people who have to fix the small issue for no reason whatsoever.  

Is he a legit sociopath and only 50% of the office can see it?  Who knows.  Either way i need a good, and socially acceptable way to deal with this type of person.  At first I thought he may have just been slightly autistic but nope, he’s just one of those obnoxious types of human beings that only think of how they can get ahead.

I'm only in my first year and while IRL classes weren't that bad now that everything went online it's dropped my motivation to do something even lower than it already was, I can barely even pay attention to the classes (that can sometimes go for 4 hours without any break) which makes it even harder to learn from (which was my strategy for passing high school). 

I've been debating whether I should continue my studies as I know I'll probably regret it if I stop but on the other side I just really want to start working in the field itself since I find that so many times more meaningful than sitting in a class making small exercises instead of an actual project, the issue with that is that everyone I talked to that replied to my job application told me I should go for a Bachelor as I probably won't find a job in the field without it. 

So now it's not just me struggling with myself but COVID just brought it to a whole other level and I feel like there's not a single place I can reach out for help.
