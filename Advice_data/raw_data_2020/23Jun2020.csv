0,"My brother and I are severely unaccomplished. We both underperform in school, but his case is more severe, as he usually completes work from lower grade levels. He completely lacks basic life skills and has severe motor skill issues. I have developed motor skills, but that's about it. We both have terrible social skills. We have no accomplishments, no real hobbies, and no drive. Neither of us have extenuating circumstances that led to this. The best we can do is keep up a front with other relatives.

We are blessed with supportive parents. However, they never really put pressure on either of us to excel in school or cared about our grades when we were younger. My parents have only invested in arguing with teachers and have coped with my brother's situation by accusing the school administrators of whatever they can come up with. They expect me to head to university, but are willing to settle for my brother.

Our house is pretty messy and we are basically foreign to organization and routine which might amplify because of the pandemic. We are pretty spoiled otherwise.

As nice as my parents are, at this point I don't think we can afford to rely on them anymore. Given how adjusted we are, my brother doesn't care about being coddled at all. If I were to be honest with myself, I don't care either. My only motivation comes from not wanting to deal with more regret or shame than I already have to later on, and maybe helping my parents. I'm not sure how either of us will be able to deserve success.

What should I do?",23Jun2020,2
1,"I've been living in the same apartment for about 5 years now without much issue except my landlord likes to make appointments to my place at the most inconvenient times for me. There was an issue with a leak in the pipes that had apparently damaged the unit under mine. So they came and fixed it. It's been a few times already of this same issue and most of the time I get less than 24 hour notice.

This morning I got a text that they needed to come into my place to check again. I responded no and that I'm home at 5:30pm but my text didn't go through. Then, she called me to tell me that they absolutely need to go today and assess and that she can't book the plumber again, etc. and even something about her wanting to give me a Christmas present... so I cave. At 4pm another text that they want to come back tomorrow at 1pm to caulk around my tub again. And that plumber has been delayed by Covid from fixing the main pipe in the walls (which I was aware of).

I get home and I have a stain from a boot on my carpet, another carpet all bunched up by having my desk moved around (to get to the door hatchet thing to see pipes) and the pile of blankets and books I had was all over my floor, spilled out. Plus dirt in my bathroom and on the floors.

I texted her back saying that I am home Friday and told her what I came home to, and called her, but was directed straight to a message telling me to call back (no voicemail). I blocked my number and it rang before going to the automated message again. It's not the first time I can't reach her when I want to say no to her. I don't like the feeling of having people in my place when I am not there. Who would?

I have always kept the place spotless and have never been late on rent.... I'm feeling VERY frustrated and in need to vent... would like to hear your stories too!

I'm also just wondering what should I do? What would you do?

I'm just about to sign the lease for another year on top of that

2,"He gave my name when he got pulled over for speeding when he wasn't even supposed to be driving.

Since we look similar enough the cop didn't think twice. The only reason I found out is because I found a ticket in the house addressed to me and went to the police station to clear it up.

That situation is dealt with(as far as i know).

How can I prevent anything like this happening in the future? He has a long list of offenses so if he gets in trouble again hes probably going to be stupid/high/shitty enough to give them my name again.

13,"My good friend clearly suffers from anxiety. For the past year she has constantly looked to me for advice on mostly her love life and becomes obsessed with the men she hooks up with to the point where she is always thinking about them and always anxious over whether they like her back. She is consistently asking me for advice ranging from how to respond to a text to why do I think someone doesn’t like her back. She is in therapy and I asked her today if she think it’s helping and she said she thinks her therapists advice is encouraging, but not attainable for someone who has suffered from anxiety their whole life. Listening to her problems and offering advice to her has become really exhausting to me. I suggested today she look into getting medicated but she thinks pills are a last resort and she’s “not at that level yet”. But I absolutely think she is. I think she should be medicated so she stop coming to me for all her issues and so she can actually implement her therapists advice. Thoughts?",23Jun2020,1

27,"I don’t know if I was sexual assaulted or not - share my thoughts and concerns.

For some context (this was back in February)
I went out with a friend to the club and by the end of the night we were both making out with two guys (they’re were friends too). The guy that was making out with my friend (let’s call him John) invited us to go to another bar (owned by the guy I was making out with - let’s call him Marcus) and we said yeah. 

At the time the bar was closed but Marcus had the key because it was his bar so we went there. Me and him arrived like 10 minutes earlier than my friend and we stared making out. 

Right away I knew that we were invited there because John wanted to have sex with my friend but I hadn’t think about the possibility of me doing the same with Marcus - specially because I was a virgin. 

My friend arrives and goes to the other floor and gets to it with the other guy while I was still making out with Marcus. And this is where it stars... he grabs his dick and I go with it and get on my knees but I kept thinking “no further than this”. 

Well, he asks me “should I grab a condom?” - I said “why not let’s do it and get it out of the way (my virginity). So we start having sex .... and I hated it. He kept spanking my ass even tho I told him to not do it.
Then we went to another room and we kept going. 

So here is where I start saying I want to stop and leave. I was feeling uncomfortable, I was hating it and I was in pain because he was literally *fucking* me and said he didn’t believe I was a virgin. 

Well this goes for 2hours. Me saying I want to leave and him saying “not until I cum” and “10 more minutes” over and over and over...and I allowed it and said “ok”

I felt helpless because I wanted to leave and didn’t know how. 
My friend fell asleep waiting for me and I was only able to leave because she woke up and saw that I had &lt;not joking&gt; 82 missed calls from my mom because I was supposed to go home at 8 am and it was 10 already .... two whole hours without knowing if I was alright or not. 

Well...my friend still doesn’t know that I wanted to leave but my two guy best friends know everything and they both said I got assaulted.  
Till they said this I didn’t think about it at all...but now I’m just confused and scared. 

I need to add that he was using a condom but took it off without my consent and without me knowing.


TLDR// went with a guy to his bar, lost my virginity to him and wanted to leave but he kept holding me back saying “10 more minutes” and “not until I cum” and this lasted for 2 hours - he also took the condom off without my consent. 
Obs: I don’t consider that I lost my virginity to him...I had sex again with someone I trusted and loved a couple of months after and I consider that to be the person I lost my virginity to.",23Jun2020,1
28,"Hi, gonna be honest. (16 F)

I like teaching a lot! I'm gonna be a sophomore in high school and it's super fun. blah blah blah context on how much I love tutoring my peers and what not blah blah blah

ok so my friend told me about this tutoring thing that he's doing where he's part of a group that tutors kids for free for an hour each week. i thought, whoa! so cool ok I'll join that why not. 

I join it, and like i'm gonna admit that I'm a control freak. I like running things my way and I don't really like being told what to do, having an over-arching boss (esp. if it's someone the same age as me aka the president of the organization), or ig being a follower for this kinda stuff. also the president seems kinda fake and is obviously doing this for college; i have no intention to be a ploy for his college admissions. I just wanna do this bc it seems like the right thing to do (he says that the kids are underprivileged and aren't in the position to pay), but at the same time he goes to a rich private school in new Jersey and only gives a fuck about this bc it's the time of corona and yeah. 

so, I'm asking: what do i do. should i continue with this? I already tried exiting but the pres was like (ok we're gonna go ahead with this week's clients and we'll check back next week (i said I could meet with these clients and then I said I should probably see if this whole thing fits my schedule so I could commit to it)) which kinda strikes me as culty??? idk that or he already made the arrangements with the parents and it's fucked up if i back out now. idk be honest.

also I feel like i'm being used. like all my work and time that I put in will be overlooked by this guy's achievement and leadership in this group. I'm not saying at all that I want recognition for this but i wouldn't want someone claiming the credit for something I've done. idk pls help

32,"This is my first post here. I apologize for the lengthy text, but given the particular subreddit, I guess some context is needed...  
I turned 26 yesterday and I'm currently sitting alone in my Airbnb in a city just outside Vancouver, BC that I booked for my solo birthday trip. As some of you may also experience, birthdays are not always as celebratory as some make them out to be. I tend to feel heavy anxiety the night before followed by deep introspection, which often leads to shame, embarrassment, and feelings of failure.  This year has been no different- I have sat around and thought about how my life has changed, or rather, how it has stayed the same. I question my lack of emotional development, mental fragility, financial failures amongst so many other small details that make me cringe. I do however feel a small spark that tells me I need to change.  
To give some idea of my life thus far, I will do my best to summarize landmarks that have shaped me into who I am today. I am a mixed-race (half Black, half Japanese), gay, male from Toronto. I come from a family of four other brothers and my parents are separated with their own kids. My parents and brothers lived in my grandma's house (some of my brothers and mom still do). My brothers and I shared a room, my parents in another (before my dad left), and my grandma in her room.  My father introduced my family to Islam around the age of 4 until 6 before my parents separated. I remember that time feeling fear and embarrassment practicing something different than the middle-class white families that I went to school with. I guess I could say I felt the tension and anxieties surrounding the race, class, and religious divide between family and the community we lived in, as well as my sexual identity battle. These feelings are still present to this day, though do not punch me in the gut as hard as they used to.  
Fast forward a couple of years, my parents have split, I no longer practice Islam, I studied Taekwondo for six years and achieved my black belt, quit and started dance. This is where I began to find myself. I had a safe place to explore my identity and channel my emotions into movement. From my athletic background and eager desire to please (to this day I seek validation), I began to excel in dance. It became my life to the point that I decided to pursue it in college. After receiving a scholarship, taking out loans, and receiving absurd amount of financial help from my grandma, I moved to NYC and completed my BFA in Dance from a liberal arts college. Throughout those years I pushed myself harder than I thought I ever could. I worked hard, but not smart. I suffered from depression, anxiety, bulimia, alcohol abuse, and OCD (I saw the school counselor throughout the 4 years and the psychiatrist a couple of times), yet I pushed through and graduated. I finished my dance career before it even started. I was experiencing burnout from training in a way that harmed my health, never feeling confident in my ability no matter how many times my professors told me otherwise, neglecting to network because it seemed ""fake"" and I attributed success and connections solely on hard work.   
Every day I wonder what I could have been if I believed in myself (not only my dance ability, but also my academic voice and confidence to believe and stand behind something), took the time to take care of my mental health, engaged in extracurriculars, forgave my parents rather than blame them for the lack of emotional support or finances that I so closely compared to those of my peers, and practiced vulnerability amongst the many character flaws and skewed mindsets I would replace. It's been two years since I've graduated, and one year since I've moved back to Canada. After poorly handling the reality of failed dreams, a shit load of debt, and an open relationship, I moved out West to start fresh. Since moving away to Vancouver, I've worked hard on improving my mental state, which I feel like it's one of the first times in my life that I've made progress on my own. I don't regret the past, per se... I've learned to see it has hardships that make me who I am but I can't help myself from focusing on it. I dabble in the Brene Brown, Oprah, Ekhart Tolle text, which I have found quite helpful, but I can't seem to ""get out of my head"".   
I have been accepted to NYU to pursue my MA in Food Studies. I feel a strong pull to that field of food writing through my eating disorder past and racial identity exploration, but I don't feel the same connection as I did to dance. I feel fortunate to have started a hobby to evolved into a passion. I feel grateful to have studied and been around creative, empathetic, and artistic minds. I am lucky to have found strong camaraderie. I am almost 100% I do not want to pursue dance - I don't enjoy long rehearsals, my partnering has been, and will most likely be sub-par, and I don't have the creative confidence to participate in collaboration or choreography that is so often required. What if my mental illness that was holding me back weren't in the way of acquiring those qualities of a dancer? What if all I needed to do was to work on my mind as much as I worked on my physical craft?   
I am eager to return to school. It's something I have valued being the first college graduate in my family. With my deferral request until Spring 2021 looming over my head and my return to Toronto coming shortly, I am asking myself, and the Reddit community who have made it this far, what do I want? How will I get there? How will I start believing in myself? When will I believe my experience and education are worth more than minimum wage? How and when will I return back to the city that once made me feel so alive with a different mindset? 

This has been a very chaotic stream of consciousness and may even be deleted in few hours, but thank you to anyone who read through and my heart and spirit are with you if you have experienced anything similar.",23Jun2020,1
33,"My ex has had my son enrolled for the past 3 years in travel ball 9 months out of the year, the rest of the time he’s on a basketball team.  He’s 9 years old.

Practices are 2-3 hours, 4 days a week.  Weekends for tournaments- usually 2 games a day.  Between the 1 hour warmup up and the 30 min post game meeting, each game ends up around 3.5 hours or so.

I think it’s insanely over the top.  I played high school sports and never once had a schedule as busy as his.  I think it’s way too much ever since she enrolled him at 7 and I hope he doesn’t get burned out.  I’m making him go to the family reunion next month and he’s upset because it’s the “World Series”, probably the fifth on this year.


My ex is a teacher so she has a lot of free time on her hands to do these things.  I work full time and have 3 other kids that don’t do travel ball.

I went to 3 of his 4 games this weekend.  He guilted me for not going to his 4th.  He says he understands that I work full time and his siblings need attention too.

So my mom wants me to go to aunt (Nathalie) this summer. But the thing is that she just doesn’t like me, never has. My mom has even stated in the past that she doesn’t like me or it seems like she treats me differently, but then she contradictors herself and says that’s just how she treats everyone. When I know for a fact that that’s not the case.

She makes the argument how “they are family” (for context it’s my aunt and 2 cousins m23 and m10). I haven’t gone since I was 14 after I told her that I wasn’t going back until I was atleast 18 and that she just had to respect that. But she doesn’t, to me she has some shit mindset that doesn’t because they are family we owe some sort of obligation too go. I told her that I would go when I was more mature and not a hormonal teenager. 

She was on a call with my aunt a few days ago and said that I’m going to Calgary and asked if I wanted to come, but I said that I would think about it never that I would go. But how she’s acting like I already said yes. 

What can I do too tell her that I’m not going. I’m old enough to make that call and have been for a while now.

39,"Hi everyone. I'm currently going to be a sophomore in college and I'm weighing in on the pros and cons of living on vs. off campus

For some background info, I stayed in the dorms this past year. I've made a pretty good basis of friends my first year, and I told them all I might be living at home next year, and many of them said that I could stay over at their place if I ever needed to. I also live around 7-8 miles away from campus, making a round-trip 14-16 miles. Each trip would take about 15-20 minutes.

If I were living off campus, my family would buy a car (which is around $15k)  that I would use to commute to campus, and there are many parking lots on campus that I can park for free on the weekends for when I want to see my friends, so I wouldn't have to worry about a parking fee. I do plan on staying on campus and studying for most of the day.

However, living off-campus would also mean I would be living with my parents. The pros from there is that I'd be able to get free food that I would otherwise have to cook if I'm off campus. The cons might be that I might be more naturally dependent on them since I'll be around them more than I would've been.

Does anyone have any thoughts or advice on this? I feel like my best bet is to live off campus, but I'd like some opinions from others.",23Jun2020,1
40,"I'm seventeen years old and In the us, for you guys to have an understanding of my situation. I'm borderline autistic, but it's basically so miniscule that its basically not there (I had problems with it growing up but not anymore) I'm male and grew up in a family of atheists. My parents are not divorced and I'm white.

So I'm not even sure if I deserve to talk about my problems at this point but I need to rant/get things off my chest/ get help or advice.

My parents have both had issues although my father is at least trying to work on his, (he's bipolar).

But there was just an incident, I couldn't find my phone and I had my brother ring me. My phones in the living room and who sees it but my mother, my brothers name on my phone being ""Little b*tch *ss f*ckboi""  now obviously I don't mind that they had a conversation with me or even that they were upset but they were acting as if A. They don't curse constantly themselves and B. That I talk like that to everyone and in public, which I most certainly do not.   

But the most pertinent part that bothers me is how it ended, where what should have been a conversation about the state of my relationship between my brother and i, goes into how she is disappointed in me, ""how I didn't even talk to her on father's day"" (her father died a few months ago and I didn't want to bring it up) and how she's near the same age as her mom when she died. ""I only have 15 more years and I want this house to be my safe place"" it bothers me how it's always about her and what she wants even in situations she has nothing to do with, she was like this even before grampa passed for those who say that it's probably her mourning. I want to get a job so I can leave at 18, ""your not responsible enough for a job you'll be fired within the week"" but I'm 17 and if I don't get a job I'll be stuck here at 18. 

I want to go to college abroad every country I say she has some excuse for me not to go ""sweedens full of Nazis, Canada's too expensive, you'll have to learn an entire new language in Japan"" etc etc.

It just feels like she's trying to control my life and thinks she knows best for me when honestly she doesn't know a thing about me, she thinks I'm Christian, I'm a Satanist, she thinks I'm gay, I'm bi, she thinks I'm still single and can't get a date, I've had a boyfriend for a year now, she doesn't even know that I'm planning on transitioning genders when I leave. 

And the reason she doesn't know is because I know every response she'd have to it, I'm a Satanist, ""your just trying to stand out and offend people"",  I'm bi ""your just bi curious, and besides bi people can't exist because eventually you have to choose someone"", I'm dating someone ""he lives in sweeden long distance relationships aren't real love"", I'm planning on transitioning ""that's just the hormones talking you'll be fine in a few years"" 

I just am at my limit, there's two ways this will end me leaving or a razor.",23Jun2020,1

Anyways I have dropped off my friend at his house a few times when he was high and his parents know me, so I guess they assumed I was the one selling him weed because they haven’t meet the kids who actually do. His mom called my parents and told them that they were pretty sure I was selling him weed and my parents flipped out at me I tired to tell them that I don’t and that they could urine test for THC and search my room if they don’t believe me. My parents wouldn’t listen and said I was being rude and talking back they also accused me of vaping again ( I quit months ago).

My budget is really low, and I can barely found any place to stay.

I've found this small apartment, and I would like to know your opinion on it.

Do you like it? Of course It is a cheap small apartment, but it looks interesting and the staircase that goes down to bedroom is actually nice :)

Downside: No balcony.

The other two rooms are the same size, but one room does not have a personal closet space. Instead, the person who takes the room without the personal closet space is given the option to use the sunroom down the hall as a shared closet space. This means other two roommates will will store things in their personal closet space as well as the sun room.

49,"(22F) I've recently understood that the toxic relationship I had with my dad growing up (possibly my mum too but not as bad) and other things that happened to me as a kid has made me have unresolved issues with my self worth and self love. Which in turn impacts my need for reassurance, my sensitivity towards rejection and respecting others boundaries. This all has come up from a recent relationship, it was the first time I felt real love and while I was hurt many times and it self validated my self worth, I know that I could've done better overall. I dont want to be this person anymore and I am willing to do anything I can do fix it, I know now that whatever I was doing before was not working for me.  I have taken steps towards starting therapy but I just want to know if theres anything else I can do.  


The past 6 months, I've been trying to exercise, engage in hobbies like art, animal crossing, yoga and extra study, buying clothes to look better, eating better food, using better language when communicating and trying not to assume things (I keep failing but I keep trying), video calling close friends or trying to form stronger bonds with friends and in general just trying not to engage in destructive behaviour like alcohol, going on dating apps for self validation and sex to feel attention, engaging in fights like I used to etc.   


But I still feel like and I've been told, I've made no improvement. I find myself beating myself up everyday because I keep messing up and making mistakes that fill me with so much guilt and disappointment in myself that I grow to hate myself. 

  
\- I want to learn how to not seek reassurance constantly especially in relationships as I feel like I need their ""approval"" basically how to not feel insecure.   
\- How to respect peoples boundaries, like if they need space I tend to unconsciously react because I want to fix things right away and talk about it and Im scared that things will get worse if they go away but I know realistically that it is very helpful and healthy to have space.   
\- How to not assume things, I always overthink things and assume the worst so I dont feel hurt.   
\- How to not be so stubborn and not consider other peoples perspectives  
\- How to communicate what I feel and need directly without making a tangled mess  
\- How to say sorry properly and understand how the person feels   
\- How to not make things about myself or to flip the situation back on me to feel better about myself  
\- How to not be manipulative - this is a hard one for me to understand but I have been told that I am so maybe I cannot see it but I want to understand and not make people feel this way or be seen this way  
\- How to be more mature   
\- How to not make unconscious excuses to my behaviour, for example I may apologise but then feel the need to explain why or that ""I did xyz because I feel xyz"" but sometimes I think it comes off as an excuse or making it about myself  
\- How to take accountability which is what Im trying to do now.

&amp;#x200B;

I know theres more to write but I think I will start with these things,  I just have no idea how to fix it without the person being in my life &amp; actively working on it with them. I know despite having good intentions that my behaviour hurt someone I really love and I cannot be this person anymore. I don't want to be like my dad. I want to do what I can to improve myself and not treat someone like this again. Its hurting me knowing I am like this and I didn't work hard enough to fix it earlier. I know I am better than this and this isn't the person Im meant to be. I cant leave this world not believing I did everything I can to be a good person and help heal others.

And then December comes around and he hits me up being nice then he says he’s horny and wanting to sext and I asked him why did he tell me off when I wanted to do it. He just said he didn’t wanna do it anymore. Which I think is a lie. But i did it anyway. In January I stoped talking to him. Cuz I wanted to be fwb and he didn’t want it. And the friendship/sexual relationship we had was getting boring. 

He didn’t understand why I was done but I was over it. He was so unsure of eveything with me so I left. So 8 days later he comes to me again texting me. He replied to my snap story using the excuse saying he knows we aren’t friends anymore. So took him back.

59,"24M. Need an outlet, and also advice. I was socially defiant, reserved, aloof, and uncaring about everything for a long time. I even tried to quit elementary due to existential crisis, I was oddly aware for some reason. Things changed a ton. I tried to get over how much everything sucked. At this point, I just want to keep doing what I like, but feel the heaviest sadness and desire for a lover or something. I get repeating dreams every night of being with someone. I've been ignoring and just living with these feelings for the longest time. I don't think it goes away. It feels kinda painful and really sad.

I didn't seem to have problems attracting someone either. Considered good looking; would occasionally get a smile and stare, or a decent amount of attention. I never really cared to think about how people advanced things when the interest was there. So I don't really know, any advice on that? With college closed, I'm stuck at home and need to do college stuff, but I keep daydreaming about this.

Also, are people even faithful in this day and age? My friends were switching people the last I checked, extremely casual. It disappoints me every day. You go with one, commit to one, and stay with them. Nobody should so easily replace them. It should feel, and be at least somewhat special to you. Does anyone even think like this?

64,"I live as close to on my own as I can afford with my dog. I (m25) live in a 80 year old Romanian womans basement with two other guys, (30 and 32). I pay next to nothing in rent compared to what most people pay in my city, and that was easily the biggest blessing of the pandemic when I got laid off, not having to eat though my savings super quickly to pay rent kept my mental health in good shape. But that time eventually came where I used up my savings, I filed for unemployment but it was a mess in my state so it took forever to get anything, but when I did I got back pay and now I have around 3k to my name, same as before all this craziness. 

We all usually keep to ourselves but I have just grown to hate my 30 year old roommates so damn much. Like one well call him Jeremy is obsessed with cleaning, which is fine, but he is super rude and condescending towards me. The other, we'll call him Kendrick, is a drunk, will talk your ear off with vaguely racist and low IQ banter, holding you verbally hostage until you run out of variations to say ""that's crazy"" on your way to close the door. Basically Kendrick makes a mess drunk, forgets about it, Jeremy blames it on my or my dog, and I have to be the bigger person and adult in a house where I'm the youngest. 

Besides those two i love that house. The old lady is adorable, she looks after my dog when I'm at work, the location is EXACTLY where I want to be in my state, theres a beautiful park nearby, and the rent is so damn cheap. 

My buddy, well call him Mark, is my age, lives in the silicon valley of my state, where I went to college, in a beautiful house with a huge backyard, another dog, and most of all, super nice and awesome roommates. I've hung out there for the majority of the quarantine cause they have a hot tub and Mark and I like to be productive together. I'm basically Mark's therapist, which can be SUPER emotionally exhausting but I love him like a brother so I go for it with him. Basically they want me to move in, pay around 200 more than I do a month, and live in their smallest room. It's not tiny but its definitely gonna be cramped compared to what I have now.  It's a city I'm not crazy about, but it doesnt have to be forever.

I guess my question is to anyone who's been in a similar spot to me, what is more valuable for overall happiness and mental health, space or a good community?

68,"Hello! I am F (18) currently enrolled at a state school. I have severely struggled with choosing college related things in the past, even much so that as the salutatorian of my high school class with near perfect GPA, I didn't apply to better schools our of near ignorance of the college process and options (mostly my fault, but I wish those advisors helped more with my confusion and self doubt!). I am a very competent, smart individual that has really excelled in all my classes, even much so that my multiple of my professors have acknowledged my efforts and success throughout their classes, and I joined the honors program and have maintained a 4.0 during this year. I am now a JUNIOR in credits at the end of my freshman year, and I am terrified of the future that seems to be rapidly approaching. But really, I did not come here to weirdly brag about my mild success, but I have found that because of my success in a breadth of areas, I have found it really difficult to find an area that I would really want to delve into and that would fit my wide range of abilities.

I have grown accustomed to being more of a jack-of-all-trades if you will, being good at nearly anything I put my mind to. With all these doors open, I don't really know where to turn. I am creative and love to cook, do avant garde makeup, and create art and truly have an aesthetic eye, yet I don't know if I would be cut out in the culinary or art fields, plus I would really love to stay in school because I am GOOD at it.  I have always been a lover of psychology and findings on memory and perception and how those findings can improve society, the workplace, and life, yet that field is oversaturated and poorly compensated. I have considered economics due to my thorough enjoyment of analysis and enjoyment in that class, and marketing for a similar reason and my ability to easily see connections of systems. Journalism for my writing ability and ways of conveying my thoughts and ideas, geology with emphasis on climate and atmospheric science for interest in environment,  environmental chemistry for what it can serve in the battle of regulation and solving of the earth's compositional past, and even prelaw for my ability to analyze, write, and argue (as shown by this strange analysis of self and argument for why I can't really decide, go figure). 

My desire for advice comes here: what the hell should I do? I know that I have the abilities and want to serve my society with my diligence in work well done, yet I don't know how to make this decision in where my efforts should go. I want to do STEM because I hold it to such a high ideal, yet don't know if my creativity and breadth fits into such a hyper-specialized realm. I feel paralyzed by indecision and don't know what questions I should be asking myself to try to achieve this ideal as time runs out for me to flirt with my potential selves. Any advice with how to choose, how to understand what I would be best suited for, observations, resources, or ideas, or literally anything that I can use would be greatly, greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for reading an in-depth look into the chaos of what has prevented me from feeling secure in my life, and I hope any of you kind people have some sort of wisdom that will help! :)",23Jun2020,1
70,My boyfriend and I have been together in the past and after 3 years we're dating again. We're adults now but sometimes I feel like he's still a child because of his behaviour - he has anger issues and can be very rude sometimes (multiple times a week) which hurts me as I'm overly sensitive which obviously is my fault but I still feel like he shouldn't take his anger out on me. Everytime I try to confront him he keeps apologising and saying that he doesn't want to lose me and that he doesn't want me to stop loving him and this makes me feel bad for even trying to bring up the topic so I always just end up apologising and trying to cheer him up. I always thought that no argument could make me lose feelings for him but 2 days ago we had an argument on Facetime during which he shouted at me and barely even apologised for it. This has been bothering me since then as shouting is a trigger for me because of my past and just made me even more worried about how he will act when we move in together. He reassured me that he wouldn't hurt me but I'm scared that he will get worse and that these arguments would turn physical. I used to love him so much but our recent argument on Facetime has caused me to feel indifferent about him and I just can't bring myself to tell him because I don't want to hurt him. I feel so heartless because all this time I've been telling him that I won't lose feelings but here I am and I can't decide what to do.,23Jun2020,1

  What if something horrible happens to her! I don’t know what to do I was thinking of calling cps, but I think they would say it’s not important since she’s already 16. Also what if she doesn’t want me calling cps on her!",23Jun2020,1
74,"*This sounds so juvenile because it is and we’re all 16.

My best friend of two years, Maria, used to like this boy named Alex, who is my closest guy friend. Maria is severely depressed with an anxiety disorder, as well. 

Alex knew he liked her, but he never liked her back. At the time, she liked him a lot and they were really good friends, but now they don’t really talk. Even though she says she doesn’t now, I can tell some feelings still remain and she still asks about him.

Alex and I have been close friends for about five years, but especially the last two months. We facetimed and talked a lot already, but with being bored in quarantine we started talking more. We joke around a lot, but I guess somewhere I started to like him a little. I didn’t tell anyone for three weeks and honestly didn’t really acknowledge it and suppressed it because even if they never dated, Maria liked him. 

The other night, we were talking and he basically told me he liked me and at first I played dumb because I was trying to figure out what to say, but in the end I told him I did like him. 

We’ve been flirting a little, but our mutually close friend, Brogan used to like me a lot. Brogans reaction to this would be bad, but Maria’s is entirely the priority.

Part of her depression and anxiety is comparing herself to me. She feels like i’m the ideal teenage girl, which I by no means am. She’s incredibly intelligent and gorgeous and funny, but doesn’t see it. She’s also in therapy and going to a psychiatrist. I know him liking me would crush her.

My question is, what do I do? I feel like a horrible friend, I know I am. If I could stop liking him I would choose to in a heartbeat, she’s whats important. In the past she liked a guy I had a thing with, but I didn’t care because I know you can’t control your feelings. But, if I were her i’d be hurt and pissed, too. Especially with her mental health struggles.

He’s  asked if we can make it official, but I said no way. Nobody’s going too know (minus my other best friend Meghan). Not unless at some point I had a conversation with Maria, but I don’t want to risk pushing her over the edge and potentially killing her self or losing trust in me.  Meghan is telling me it’s not my fault, I can’t control it, but I just, I don’t know what to do. 


Any advice would be helpful, especially about conversations. Clearly the need to be had between me and him. Thank you so much.

Also, I reposted this in r/relationship_advice


Edit: I’d prefer to keep Alex as a friend, but I don’t know if that’s possible.",23Jun2020,2
77,"A man in his nineties comes to my work everyday and talks to me for hours. Despite how everything seems, I genuinely believe that he doesn’t have any bad intentions. 

He doesn’t know my schedule so he started coming everyday just to see if I’m there. He is a very nice man and obviously just lonely but he since he started coming everyday I no longer feel comfortable talking to him. 

It all started when he mentioned where he grew up and I said that my moms family was from the same area. He said he thinks he may have known my grandpa. We started talking that day, a very slow day at work, and he asked if I wanted to go to lunch to talk with him more another day. I agreed and we are supposed to have lunch at a public restaurant this Friday. When he comes in he wants to talk for hours and I don’t want to be rude and brush him off but it affects my job performance having to pay attention to him for a long time. I gave him my number so that on Friday he could call but he’s been calling everyday since I gave it to him. 

Tonight, my girlfriend who was working, and happens to look kinda similar to me, said he sat in his car while she was looking outside and stared at her for thirty minutes. He said he thought it was me. He called again today and before he hung up he said I love you which I obviously didn’t respond to and I hung up. 

At first I liked talking to him, but now I’m very uncomfortable with the whole situation and do not want to go to lunch with him but don’t know how to get out of lunch, let alone the calls and conversations at work. 

I wouldn’t just be able to avoid him because of the nature of my job and because he has my number. I don’t know what to do and feel bad that I don’t want to talk to him anymore. Any advice welcome !!!!!",23Jun2020,1

I stood still and slowly moved my body to the left so I wouldn’t need to see it, they stopped and then laid in the bed together. I tried to talk to my dad about but I couldn’t really say anything because it would be very awkward. How should I tell them that I knew that they did it when I was sleeping with them?

They all snort coke after work and invited me to stay one night and locked me out as a joke. They were laughing like hyenas as the locked me out. I never told the manager any of this because i didnt want to be a snitch and i have issues getting along with people anyways so I was trying to prove something to myself.

84,"Hi, I am a prospective student to university starting this year, my major is going to be CS. To give you some background information about myself, I am not from the US. I was born and raised in Seoul, and  had the experience to live in LA, Florida, and Toronto for an year each. Along the way, I was fascinated by the diverse culture America had to offer, and dreamed of living a life here, which everyone refers to as the American Dream

I plan on becoming a software engineer, and SE jobs are known to be paid very well. An average engineer in SF bay area is paid $240k, and $150k after taxes. This is obviously more than I can ever dream of making in Seoul for the same job

&amp;#x200B;

Then recently, I came across YT videos of a variety of topics related to my future, and they really got me thinking about my career path. Here are some examples:

&amp;#x200B;

American dream is an outdated term. It is merely an illusion in the 21st century

New York is a city. It is an expensive city and it feeds on the blood of naive 20 year olds who go there chasing some dream

Money is not everything

Silicon Valley is an extremely boring place to live in. Same goes for Seattle

Don't come to America! (especially after Trump, the pandemic, BLM movement)

&amp;#x200B;

I have to admit, I'm not that crazy about programming. I don't hate it, but I don't love it so much either. I'd enjoy the problem solving if I can get paid by doing so, but I wouldn't do it outside of work.

88,"hello, i don’t really know how to start this post and i’m feeling pretty stressed out and like i made a mistake. i am in my senior year of high school and i don’t know, i just feel really sad sometimes for no reason. i don’t think i am depressed, but i do get stressed about my social life. i have never really had a best friend and my friends groups never stick together for long. i’m scared about going to my senior year alone... but that’s another story i suppose. anyways, when i feel sad, not all the time but sometimes, i tend to spend money on something that will keep me entertained for a while. whether it be art supplies or video games. well i was feeling this way and wanted to buy a switch game. i had lots of cash but not enough money on my card so i gave my mom the cash and asked to use hers. long story short i let it slip that i like to buy games when i feel sad, and like the great mother she is she seemed concerned and said that “you can’t be sad for no reason”. i insisted that there is no reason i am sad, even though looking back i think my friends situation is a possibility. now she is being kind of short with me and is using a voice that’s she uses when she is annoyed. i know she’s not annoyed, probably just worried but i feel like i made a mistake letting that slip. i’m feel fine and am trying to deal with things on my own. i’m worried i she is going to want to talk about it and i don’t want to. i just don’t know what to do and what approach to take.",23Jun2020,1
89,"Hi everyone. I am a 16 year old male, and I am a rising high school senior. Every day, I just feel lost and hopeless. I really have problems with math and science. I struggle uncontrollably with math and science. I swear I will never go into engineering or medicine or finances. Numbers just hurt my brain. My mom tries to help me understand math, and as much as I appreciate her help, I still feel confused afterwards. I barely survived Algebra 2 and Chemistry last year in school. I usually get C's or low B's in STEM-related subjects. My ACT Math score is 16 and my Science score is 14. My English and reading scores are okay, but it's just math and science that really bring down my score. My superscore is only a 21, and I'm just paranoid that I can't go into a good college. I try very hard to improve in math, as well as science, but I just can't.  I would spend 8 to 10 hours each day working on arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trig problems. I never get higher than a 17 or 18 in math and science tests, and I just feel like no college will even look at my application.

And I also just feel insecure and anxious sometimes. I have struggled with my body image and my lack of intelligence greatly ever since I was 12 or 13. I can't help but compare myself to others at school or anyone around me in general, and feel bad about myself. To be honest, I'm not the most physically attractive or brightest person out there. I have trouble participating in discussions in English and social studies class, and sometimes I just never answer questions in class. Very few people talk to me at school, and I spend way too much time worrying about meaningless things. I also feel as if people are judging me for who I am. Simply looking weird and having a low ACT score doesn't define who I am.

After school closed in the middle of March, my social problems at school stopped. However, I then began to stay at home every day and I then discovered that I had a strained relationship with my siblings. My older sister is really annoying. She leaves empty juice bottles in the fridge, and she also doesn't do her share of chores, and usually asks someone else to clean her room and do the dishes and stuff. What's worse is that she gets angry really easily. And when she is angry, she freaks out and vents her anger on everyone. And this makes me really scared. She has never physically hurt me in the past, but the emotional pain is still strong.

And then when it comes to my younger sister, she absolutely drives me nuts. She always comes into my room and takes my phone or my watch without even asking first. She also gives me dirty looks every time we see each other. And she always finds reason to take my stuff. She has no respect for me, and she usually asks me a ton of stupid questions every day. When I ignore her, she throws a fit and makes me feel guilty for not wanting to talk to her. 

My parents fight a lot as well. My dad is at the verge of losing his job, and they are discussing their options, but they make it sound like a fight. And when my mom suggests something, my dad gets all defensive and agitated. I can't even sleep well when my parents fight. They usually stay up until midnight talking about finances and stuff. I know that it's normal to disagree and try to justify their ideas, but they don't need to be so aggressive about it.

TLDR: I struggle with math and science to the point that I worry I can't go to college. I feel judged and worthless at school. I don't get along with my siblings, and my parents fight way too much.",23Jun2020,2
90,"I don’t exactly know how to put this, but I’m a 30 yr old that’s fairly talented, and tech-savvy, but have found it hard to find a job online. Can anyone give me advice on how to sell myself with limited experience? Are things hopeless for me at this point? 

Brief background, I have a degree in advertising, and thought after college I would get a job working in a creative field, as I am pretty artistic and enjoy things like writing/editing/photoshop. After getting a marketing internship, I started applying to marketing jobs and either didn’t get a call back ever, or the calls I did get were sketchy companies, more on the side of cold-calling or sales. I’ll admit, I was probably being too picky at this stage of life, and I kind of gave up. I got a job working as a waitress and have been doing that for 7 years and recently quit. 

I would really like to find a career that I love and can be proud of, ideally in marketing or maybe even social media, but I feel extremely intimidated by job postings. I don’t feel like I have any real world experience in the marketing field or I’ve let enough time go by now that the experience I had isn’t relevant. 

Also, most of the time when I read a job posting, I have trouble even understanding what the job even is. The credentials seem really extensive, even for entry-level or internships. For example, I just was reading a post for an internship that required 2-8 years of experience. What??? 

Again, I do have experience with Photoshop, inDesign, and have taken classes about SEO and AdWords. I just don’t have hands on experience and it seems like they want you to. 

How do I make myself stand out online, without lying? I want to be honest that I don’t know it all, but am willing to work hard and learn. Thanks if you have read this far! I don’t want to come off as whiny, I hope I don’t.",23Jun2020,1

I've contemplated deleting it because a few months ago I deleted Tik tok and I felt so much better, but I'm also worried about deleting it. I follow lots of my friends on there and people that don't go to my school anymore and I also love art so I'm worried if I stopped using it I'd have a hard time following artists I like because I don't want to begin using Twitter. Lastly and this may sound incredibly stupid but I'm a big anime fan and like figure collecting so I feel like I'll miss lots of news and updates if I delete it :C But the idea of it is extremely tempting. I still want to take photos and document my life but I'm tired of feeling like I constantly have to sugar coat it and so I can put it online and always look ""pretty"". Lastly I'm just tired of comparing myself to hyper attractive people online when clearly in reality no ones that perfect. Any advice is appreciated!!!! I really need it lmao ( -  \_ -) \~3",23Jun2020,1

119,"Hi there, I'm a high school senior going to college next year. I've been having panic attacks lately about college and I really need some insight on this situation because I feel like I'm second guessing this entire thing.

So I toured a bunch of schools with my parents back in the fall and narrowed it down to two I liked the best (but I applied for four). I got into all the schools I applied to for engineering. So College A was my favorite school by far when I visited. They say you will know when you find the right school, and I felt like that was it. I loved it, but the only problem was that it was very pricey (so were two other schools I applied to though). College B I liked a little less. It was okay, it was just so big and wasn't exactly everything I was hoping for. It was much less expensive though. 

When I got my acceptance letter, for College A, I saw that I was given a huge scholarship that took off over half of my fees for that school. On top of that, I was also given a music scholarship that included my own personal music mentor so I can continue my love for music in college (which was very important to me). College B's tuition was about the same as A, but my parents kept telling me that supposedly the tuition would eventually be free so long as I stuck with engineering.

I told them I still wanted to stick with A, even if it was a little more, and there was no guarantee I would get free tuition with B anyway. They were very unsupportive of this decision. Since then, they have kept making snide remarks about how I made the wrong choice and that I was being stupid. I know they're probably just looking out for me, but it hurts that they don't have my back, and since then, I have just gotten less and less sure of my decision. Lately, it has gotten so bad that I wake up in the middle of the night with panic attacks about whether or not I am making the right decision.

So I just gotta know- am I making the right choice going with the more expensive college that I loved, or should I have gone with the less expensive college that I didn't like as much?",23Jun2020,2
120,"I'm 29m, and struggled with being shy and socially awkward for most of my life, not knowing what to say or how to keep conversations going. This made it difficult for me to meet and be with girls growing up, I mostly didn't see signs of interest until long after or got super anxious and stayed away when something happened.

At 24 I was sick of being alone and wanted to meet people and eventually find someone I could share my time with.
I was done with my studies, got a job and started working out, wanting to feel better about myself and start to put myself out there. I joined a dating site, and started going on dates, most of them didn't go too great, I tried my best to find topics to talk about, but struggled to get the ball rolling. But I did make some friends along the way.

Slowly things got a bit better, and I had a couple of girlfriends, but nothing serious.

Then I met my current girlfriend, she found it cute that I was nervous, but saw that I was trying my best to have a good date and wanted us to keep meeting.
She got rather clingy and touchy rather fast on the second date, but being shy and having waited long to be in a relationship, I didn't mind and kind of just let things happen and see where they went.

I think roughly 1 month later or so she moved into my place. Of course this was rather quick, but we lived far from eachother, she didn't have a job and leaving eachother felt horrible every time. I wasn't sure I was ready, but hey, I liked the company and I would only need to pay half of the rent, bonuses all around.

She has depression and anxiety disorders, this translated into me having to do everything in the house, all the cleaning, dishes, cooking (she's cooked maybe 10 times in total over all the years), etc.
If I try to put stuff away she'll freak out because she doesn't know exactly where some specific item is at any given time. But having things around me nice, clean and tidy calms me down, and things being messy stresses me.
To top it off, I have CFS and have barely enough energy to keep up with myself to begin with. 

But she promised she'll work on improving herself over time. I just need to give her that time, just be patient, and she'll keep trying.

Now all of a sudden 4 years have passed.
I've put on lots of weight, I feel more tired every day, I hate having to go to work feeling exhausted before I even begin.

In a way I now almost feels like she forced her way into living with me and I'm now stuck with the consequences.

I feel like I'm stuck as her caretaker.

I'm also not sure if she's with me just because she's desperate for a boyfriend herself, or if I'm just projecting. I've tried to hint at this, but it quickly gets shut down.

But I do actually care for her, I care about her wellbeing and happiness. But I don't want to be solely responsible for it, I just can't do it. We're scraping by day by day out of control, without any goal or improvements in sight, years of living wasting away.

Back when I was trying to meet someone I told myself I didn't mind if it was someone who needed some extra support, that it would be an extra way for me to show my love for that person.
But I now see that this is terrible for my personality type, I just can't say no, I can't do anything that I fear will hurt her even if I know it's what I should do.
I just keep trying to help them instead of drawing a line and doing what I need for myself. I want her to find someone who's way more capable for her situation than me.

I've been afraid of missing her, but I think it's more the company itself to be honest.

I work as a salesperson and have gotten a lot better at talking to people because of it.
Seeing opportunities with others I like and have shown interest in me pass me by saddens me, thinking of what could have been.

I don't need you to tell me I should break up, I already know this. I don't need you ask me rhetorical questions on why I should break up. I already know I should.

I've tried again and again and again, I just cannot make myself do it. I'm just mentally incapable of confronting her or anything that can be seen as a conflict. I just completely shut down when I try.",23Jun2020,2
121,"**TL/DR I plan on hiring a co-worker and asking her to move in with me (share a new apartment), who I like, if I win my state house election and I want to if this is an ethics violation or not.**

I'm gonna split this into 3 parts so that you guys can fully understand the context.

**Part 1 Elected Official**- I have an election coming up in about 1.5 months and if I win the primary I likely win the seat. As a legislator I would get to hire 2 people as paid staff. Everyone else would be volunteers likely for high school or college programs. I digress, I told people at my work that I am running and they all thought it was cool and yeah, so potentially I will become an ""employer"" very soon.

**Part 2 Hiring Co-workers/friends**- I am a man and the 2 people I am planning on hiring are women, both of them asked me to basically and I told both of them if I win I will hire them both for the 30K positions. One of the co-workers over the past several months I have really started *liking* and I am not sure but I have gotten ""vibes"" that she might have some feelings towards me as well, regardless neither of us have said anything. Anyway I told them 100% I will hire them. (Planned to the moment I knew about being able to hire people)

**Part 3 Asking a person you hire to move in together**- If I end up getting elected and we will be moving and working in the state capital obviously, and I will be making 70K she will make 30K. I plan on asking her if she wants to share an apartment if I get to the point of being able to hire them, since that would give us 100K combined budget. *I am not running for the money I am running to make changes for the good* I just want to make that clear. We would be working together and if she accepted living together.

Is there anything ethically or morally wrong with this or is it all fine?",23Jun2020,1
122,"First reason is that at the launch, there will be hundreds of bugs, glitches, and other problems. 2nd reason is that not many people will have it so you can forget about online games. Reason number 2 brings me to 3: Not lots of games. And reason 4 is that all your friends on your ps4 (if you have one) will not have it, similar to reason 2 and most likely if you dont have a job (I'm talking of kids and and most likely teens) you would have to sell it. And if your like me and have invested over hundreds of dollars on games, I dont think I could do it.

123,"I recently bought a puppy in Connecticut and hired the convenient dog walking company that is across the street from me. I saw they had amazing reviews and met with the manager Laura who seemed very genuine and competent.

Due to my schedule, two of the girls, the manager Laura and assistant manager Sue have been picking up my pup and dropping her off since they are not open yet. A couple days ago when I was going to my friends birthday party, I realized that a brand new necklace I bought her that I left on the hallway table is missing. After checking everywhere for it multiple times I had a dreaded feeling in my gut. The only people that could have had access to it are Laura and Sue.

To be honest, I never suspected Laura due to our interactions. She has been like a second mom to my puppy and never had anything but good intentions as far as I could tell. On the other hand, Sue was someone I wasn't so sure about. After doing some online snooping I found that Sue has a history of Larceny and that may or may not be on her record.

One day Laura asked me to let her in because Sue accidently went home with the copy of my key which also makes me suspicious and concerned she may have made another copy.

Anyways, my dilemma is do I bring this up to the owner? Being that I have no hard evidence, I am weary to but at the same time if she did steal from me and has a history i'm sure she will target others.",23Jun2020,1
127,"I (22f) live with my bf(23m) and two other male roommates. My bf and I have been pretty safe concerning covid (wearing masks, social distancing, havent seen friends) but my concern is my roommate (21m), he has been going out every weekend to friends house, camping, and now bars - which I have been tolerating and have been disinfecting behind him since he cant seem to do it. But now, I'm feeling extremely uncomfortable because he is traveling across country to another state that is currently doubling in covid cases by day. Not only that, but two weeks after he comes home he is planning on flying back for another trip. Is it fair of me to ask him to stay elsewhere when he comes back?",23Jun2020,3
128,"I have recently started a new job that leaves me exhausted and needing a lot of rest afterwards. I want home to be a place I can just sleep and rest a shit ton between shifts. But my roommate is studying all the time and gets affected by my moods. I want to just sleep when I want to but also don’t want it to rub off on her. Do I just sleep whenever I want anyways? 

On top of that, I have terrible interpersonal skills. You’re supposed to say hello and get to know your roommates, but I didn’t do that because I mess up every relationship I have. But it definitely wasn’t the polite thing to do and now there’s this uncomfortable tension in the apartment. 

This affects my work too. I’m having trouble being productive at work partly because I’m not getting enough rest. Also I made a lot of interpersonal mistakes. I accidentally made it obvious I think my manager is cute, and he got pissed and ignores me now. The other day, I was told that my productivity rate is low and if it stays low, they fire you. So I hurried to get my rates up, nearly crashing into people, walking into people and talking at people who turned out to be my managers. 

So multiple managers are pissed at me. So are coworkers. So are my roommates. My behavior sucks. It’s hard to change. I’m not getting enough rest. It’s hard to focus on my job, or find a new one, when I’m tired all the time.

She's worried no one will hire her because of her lack of computer knowledge. She can't do manual labor either as she suffers from back and foot pain issues.

131,"I'm living with my grandmother at the moment, both because I would like to save money and because she really needs help. However I'm running into an issue with some other family members feeling as though I am taking advantage of her financially and it's starting to mess with my head and make me wonder if I am, though in my heart of hearts I don't feel this is the case.

I have taken over some of her house for my things, it's kind of cramped because I'm attempting to mostly leave her area alone though she does NOT use it and has not for years. So while I have my space it's not my OWN space, however I am not paying rent/bills for this so I'm not going to complain about it.

In exchange for free rent/hydro/etc I do all of the cleaning. When I say all I mean all, I take her dishes from the living room to the kitchen, I pick up the garbage from the living room. She literally does NO chores. I am not complaining about this, it does not bother me, I just want to be clear. I also do all of the cooking and most of the food stuff. As she is quite old she is awake quite often through the night so she snacks a great deal while I am asleep. I cook and when I am up I make her snacks, however I am not always up when she eats, so while I do all the cooking I do not do everything that has to do with food.

She takes medication. Half the time I wake her in the morning to take her first dose. All the time I get her pills/drinks for her second dose. I have looked at the medication from before I arrived and she has not once remembered her second dose.

In my mind taking care of her and doing the cooking/cleaning should be a fair trade for free rent/hydro. I feel as though groceries should be 50/50. While she does not eat as much as I do at mealtimes she snacks a lot and she tends to go for the more expensive things so I feel that price wise it would even out.

She also has a backyard and while she pays someone to cut her grass there is no other maintenance included in that fee. I have told her that I won't sink my own money into it but if she wants to give me money for the gardening tools that I would need, I am willing to clean up the yard. It has sat untouched for years and weeds have taken over. It will be a LOT of work.

I'm wondering if this seems like a fair way to go about things. Free rent for looking after her. We split groceries and she can pay for the tools while I do backyard work. 

It honestly seems to me that other family members think I should pay for all of the groceries and anything else that might be needed while I am here because I'm not paying rent.

Basically I had to go home early due to protests and streets being blocked from my bfs house to mine.. we are older college students just kinda making it by we’ve been together for 3 years. He always hops on Xbox with his friends at night and I used to play a lot but last few months I just haven’t had the time. 

So I finally have the opportunity to get on with my bf to play and I didn’t know the game mode and I’m not good at video games but I enjoy talking with friends and he invited me to play search. So I join assuming we would play search and destroy and I invited a mutual friend all to find out we only had room for three in a game mode I’m awful at. And so I complained  a Little because like dang I suck at it and I’m basically the reason the team is losing. And my bfs friend says dude I told you she would complain i told you she shouldn’t get on and I snapped  back thinking it was a joke and I told him to shut up. But then I realized he was being serious and I was like wow that was really mean. And my bf yells at me go play with someone else. At that moment I just couldn’t believe who I was talking to. I said wow. Didn’t seem like I was talking to a guy who loves me. Especially since he invited me to play... knowing I’m horrible at the game mode. So Got I literally turned off my xbox.. apologized to his friend for snapping at him but I regret apologizing. My bf was the one who really hurt me by not having my back. I def got the message I wasn’t wanted even tho he invited me. So am I in the wrong here? Idk just felt like I was being bullied in that moment by someone I’ve loved and have been with for years. I just feel betrayed.

He also keeps trying to get me to play.. but I just don’t want to he said sorry but I just can’t forgive him. It’s hard to put into words how harsh they were and just plain mean.. idk what to say I’m embarrassed not sure how to handle this or if I should ever play again honestly",23Jun2020,1

A specific case, though, is anime. I'll admit, I love anime, and want to enjoy it. But... I can't. At least, not anymore.

I know some people (especially online) within the anime community, like on Discord and stuff, that I've ended up driving away because I used to be unfiltered and would take dark things a bit too far. I creeped out a lot of people, and I guess I never fully realized how bothersome I was being until it was too late. I cringe at some of the stuff I said and whatnot, thinking ""I can't believe I said/did that..."". I wish I could just undo it all.

I don't know, the thought of it just makes me sick. I know I deserve it and stuff, but the thought of getting into any new anime is ruined by the memory of what an idiot I was.

How do I get past loving anime? How do I put it behind me?",23Jun2020,1
149,"I (F16) don't know how to actually take care of my basic personal needs. My parents never thaught me how to actually do laundry, make my bed, tie my own shoes, cook and whatnot. At the early stages of my life, I got diagnosed with a condition named dyspraxia, in which you are basically ""Clumsy"" in nornal tasks.

Let's say I want to clean out an area: I do it normally until it involves placing it well on that specific area, The thing I'm holding will fall or I would fall.

Let's say I want to bake something: My mind forgets to put the right measurements for the ingredients on the mix, there's spill of the mix everywhere. I don't put the right temperature on the oven because my mind just straight up doesn't know about ""right measurements"". 

It's not always like that, but these are exaggerated examples so you can see how the problem usually is.

I don't do well at school because of this, the condition usually comes with a short attention span and mild dyscalcullia, that I have, so I obviously don't do well.

I was targeted at school because of it on elementary school and no one actually trusted me to do work because of my clumsiness, so I would be the one kid that didn't do anything because they didn't want me fucking it up.

They thought I was a retard, and to be fair, this condition does make you act like one.

Whenever I ask my mother to do some chores, she always tells me that I am doing it the wrong way and asks me to stop doing it. It's kind of my fault as well, because I get too worked up on doing it well that I beat myself up so much if I do a small mistake and act like a retard.

My parents wanted me to be the perfect child, they wanted me to be like the other kids (as cliché as it sounds). I ended up lying to them about most things in my life, for example: That I was doing well in school, that I had a lot of friends and that my clumsiness was going away. I was afraid they would judge me for being Stupid and clumsy.

I am currently laying down on the bed with a Phone typing this down, with a bird's nest I call hair because I don't have the energy to wash it and I also don't do it well. I'm around a mess I call my room, because I don't know how to clean it out and I also don't have the energy to do so.

I don't want to get out of bed, because I know that if I do, I will make mistakes and act like the retard I am.

I wanted to rot on the bed some days ago, but I realised that wouldn't solve the problem. So I am asking the people here for advice, what can I do to take care of myself and do things well?

I don't know how to do anything, and I frankly feel like I'm just a hassle to others, but I want that to change.",23Jun2020,1

153,"I have a long distance relationship (Im in Ontario and hes in British Columbia) and i was going to move there this summer because i dont live in a great home and always wanted to move. 

All of a sudden out of no where it seems(june 18th). I came home from a beach trip with my sister and was excited to see him, as always i video called him and he said he needed to tell me something, he started crying and told me he fell out of love and i couldn't comprehend it in the moment(i still cant tbh). I asked if that means he doesn't wanna be with me anymore and he said no he doesn't wanna break up and i said i was gonna go because i needed time to think and he said dont go, but i left anyways. 

He called my mom on the phone and told her he broke up with me; i was very confused. I started getting mad and upset and said a lot of unnecessary things that definitely lowered my chanced of being with him again. He said he just needed time and i said ok. We went to sleep and i couldnt sleep all night so i just texted him and said more unnecessary things that i regret. He told me to stop and said just to give him time and i said ok. 7 hours later he told me he was certain about his feelings and said that he didnt want relationship ""right now"" and had lost feelings ""right now"" 

I begged him back and yet again said MORE unnecessary things 

I feel like I've lost my chances forever 

But he keeps saying ""right now"" when talking about how he feels

He made it clear he still wants to be friends and cares deeply and never wanted to hurt me
I don't know if i should move on or give him time
He treated me like a princess and we have such a close bond 

He asked if i wanted to play a game together when he got home from work 
I told him i didnt want to be friends anymore and he seemed very sad 
I informed him that I loved him and if he wanted to try again I would be here.
He said he knows things could change but he just doesn't want a relationship with anyone for awhile and said he would message me if his feelings change

I later said i still want to be friends im just sad and confused and he told me ""right now i dont want a relationship, i dont know if my feelings will change, i just know what i need right now.""
If your still reading thank you
I don't know if i should keep waiting or try to forget and move on

I love him more then words can discribe 
I felt a special kind of happy when i was with him
He also had bought me so much stuff that are useful things, like a headse, a blanket, clothes that i like, and a phone stand are just the useful things. 

Just 5 days ago he told me how much he loved me and couldn't wait to see me. He is the type to act on impulse i feel deep inside i should wait but im scared to hurt even more in the end if he does choose to try again it would be worth it.

 I cant stop having dreams about him and ive started taking sleeping pills i cant sleep without",23Jun2020,1
154,"My brother 16M just had his birthday today and he got a car that needs a new transmission which is $1,000. My brother and I get a $2,000 Survivor Benefit check every month because our biological father passed in 2018 (exactly 28 months today). My mom alone brings in over $5,000 a month alone not including my stepdad, it’s enough to cover mortgage and pretty much everything else. He knew the car he was going to have and knew it needed a new transmission, and he’s been asking for the transmission for around 23 months ($46,000). We don’t know what they spend the check money on and we rarely go on trips or do anything that would cost a good amount of money. My grandma my brother and I all have tried talking to her, but she just gets upset and storms out of the room and my step dad doesn’t do a thing about it. Can you give me advice on how to approach and handle the situation for the best outcome and what not. We also live in a place where it’s extremely difficult to get a job.

158,"I (24f) haven’t seen my father (62m) in about 2 and a half years at this point. I received a message from his wife on fb on Father’s Day letting me know he was having a hard day as it was the 30th anniversary of my grandfathers passing, and I didn’t get ahold of him. 

A little background I guess... So I have a half-brother who’s in his mid to late 30’s, I haven’t seen him since I was a toddler as he cut contact with my dad, I never really got much of an explanation as to how or why. I also have an older brother (27m) who hasn’t talked to my dad in probably 10 years. I’m his youngest child, and only girl, so maybe that made me feel more inclined to try to build a relationship. My mom said it best, “he’s a good friend, a good guy, but not a good dad.” He always had an issue with alcohol and still does to this day, and most of my memories of him include him drinking. Not to mention he never reached out to see me and my brother, he’d make that our job to get in touch with him when we wanted to see him (I should also add my parents split up when I was 3) and keep in mind this was when I was still a young kid. It just felt like we never connected properly. Our visiting would consist of me and my brother sitting in front of the tv for 2 or 3 days while my dad worked outside or in his garage. There were many times I’d try to go hang out with him while he was working, I honestly feel like I tried so hard to like, build a relationship, and it feels like it hasn’t and will never happen. 

After him and my mom split, he got with our neighbour for a couple years, and then his current wife when I was like 7, she also used to be my moms best friend since high school. I never liked her, or the way she’d try to guilt trip me and my brother when my dad wasn’t around. I basically always felt like I was in a state of anxiety when I knew I was going over to his place. I always felt bad, or like I was doing something wrong. We reconnected in 2017 for a few months, I introduced him to my boyfriend and the 3 of us went out to dinner, and got some drinks a few times, and it was nice. But again, always including alcohol. The last time I saw him was when he brought his wife to dinner with us, and she kept like throwing jabs about my mom and her weight and shit. Since then I just haven’t talked to either of them, and he again, hasn’t bothered to reach out, just his wife messaging me bringing me to tears because I feel so guilty, but I don’t know what to say. When it comes to talking to my dad about how I feel, I’ve gone mute, like I physically can’t talk even if I try. 

I just wish he would reach out, and talk about how he feels instead of basically putting the blame on me and my brother for our lack of a relationship. I know it would mean a lot to me to have him in my life, I just don’t see it happening and it breaks my heart everyday, but I just don’t feel like myself when I’m around him, and I’m angry around his wife. I don’t even know if any of this is making sense, I’m having a really hard time with this and needed to reach out to an unbiased source. 

I’ve been sober for almost a year now, so I think that’s another factor that’s contributed to me feeling questionable about reconnecting. 

So essentially what I’m asking is, should I feel guilty for cutting him and his wife out? And if I respond to her message, what do I say? How have you dealt with strained relationships with your family? 

Any and all advice is appreciated as this is the first time I’ve really opened up about this. And if you do think I’m in the wrong, please explain why instead of just shitting on me for being a bad daughter.",23Jun2020,1
159,"First time poster in this sub and I am on mobile, sorry for anything weird.

So my younger cousin (18) got accepted into a school in Ohio that she really wants to go to. At first she was going to go to a school here in NY, but she recieved the acceptance letter from the other school and changed her mind. Her mother (we will call her G) is refusing to provide any tax information for FAFSA or cosign a loan. 

At first, G said it was because she couldn't afford it, which is understandable. But then G suggested that my cousin go to Iona. Iona is a private college that is expensive so everyone was kind of like 'hmmmm'. Today we find out that it is because G doesn't want anything getting in the way of the mortgage on a house. 

Does my cousin have any options? Or is she just stuck until her mom lets her go anywhere.",23Jun2020,1

My mom is doing her best to support every one right now and I am just trying to keep him happy and get others happy too. Today me and my mom were talking about ways to help him get less mad and she suddenly asked me if I thought he still loved her then quickly blew it off when I asked why she was asking that. I am really worried and the whole household is just really tense. To make everything worse, my mom accidentally dropped her iPad on her foot and the first thing he asked was if the iPad cracked.

161,"Okay I know the title sounds bad, but hear me out.

So earlier this evening my mom and I took our dogs to a dog beach and towards the end we were fishing and the dogs had gotten dirty from rolling in the dirt and swimming in the pond. When we got home we bought the dogs upstairs to the bathroom and I had to get a shower anyway so I just got in with them and mom helped me shampoo them. Well, one of our friends called her and wanted to talk so she was sitting there talking to her and the dog I was working on is really stubborn in the tub and I had nicely told him to turn around so I could get his other side and kinda just moving him where I wanted him to go. So finally I have to whip out the mommy voice on him a couple times, and the second time, mom smacked me on the back of the head so hard it took me a minute to realize what happened. Then she was all, ""Shut up and bathe the dog!"" I dropped the showerhead and sat there for a few seconds staring at her. Then I picked it up again and tried - and failed - to suppress my crying. When I got my shower I was trying to sing along with my music but I ended up just breaking down in the middle of it and then when I got out of the shower I came in my room and shut the door. Then I started crying again and I don't think I can go downstairs and look at either of my parents. The awkwardness with dad and the pure resentment right now with mom. I'm laying down now and it hurts to lay on the back of my head where she hit me. What do I do?

164,"I (24 F) left my boyfriend (22 M) of 1.5 years on Saturday. We lived together, and it's been a very emotional time for me. Frankly, I'm a mess. It was a break up over lifestyle differences, and I'm still in love, and he's begging me to come back, but it's the second break up and I know that I just can't keep giving chances. 

Thankfully my best friend has just bought a house, so I didn't have to stay with my parents, where there wasn't really any space for me. 
She cleaned out the spare room, bought a mattress and blanket and sheets, and organised toiletries and everything in the bathroom.

On top of this she's been putting up with my random bursts of tears with serious patience.

Her boyfriend of 3 months moved in a week before I did, and they are in full honeymoon phase. I'm totally crashing their space, but my friend is insistent that I am so welcome, and can stay as long as I want.

Well I'm working on finding a place soon to get out of her hair, but I want to thank her somehow.

I've already thanked her with a words a hundred times, but it's not enough. I would buy her something expensive, except she comes from a well off family and literally has the means to buy whatever tf she wants for herself, so a token gift is kind of pointless.

168,"I adopted a pit bull (“S”) after my now-fiancé took a job a few states away and I was on my own. She took our other pit bull (“G”) with her to the new job. G is a non-aggressive, sweet, lovable little pit bull while S was used as a bait dog and has fear aggression toward other dogs. S, however, is only aggressive toward animals—never people. 

Since I have had S, she has “attacked” three other dogs—grabbed them by the scruff and held them, never drawing blood. You can tell she’s utterly terrified and is using offense as her best defense. Three times is a lot, I know, but all three were circumstances out of our control. 

Recently, my fiancé has moved back in and brought G with her. Today, while I was at work and my partner was out walking G, S got loose in the house and met them at the front door when they returned. S got hurt pretty bad and hasn’t stopped her heavy breathing and limping. Bleeding was controlled, she’s okay until tomorrow for a vet (we live in a very rural area and vets/animal hospitals are sparse). 

I’m seeking advice on possibly having S put to sleep. She’s only aggressive toward other dogs and animals, but also seems to have severe anxiety. Even when we go to walk, she is on high alert and her whole body shakes as she’s in anticipation of an attack. 

I’ve taken her to training classes, given her medications, watched videos and anything else to ease the anxiety/aggression to no avail. I know she has been miserable and will continue to be miserable, even if she was the only dog in the house. Normally I’m against euthanasia and often blame the trainers. However, I genuinely feel S would be better off where she was no longer constantly scared or anxious of anything and everything.

173,"Hi! So I’ve been having trouble concentrating on activities that I do lately. When I watch TV, or read a book, or even when I’m playing a video game that has a strong narrative, my mind starts wandering off continuously to other things. The only way for me to get past it, if I can even call it that, is to just keep trying and force my way through, but that is also just killing off the enjoyment that I should be having.

I have a lot of anxiety issues so I’m not sure if that’s playing into it because I have had a recent spike in my anxiety level. This has never actually caused me much issues with concentrating so I hesitate to put the blame on that. I do have a therapist to deal with my anxiety, but due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation and my health insurance not covering telehealth appointments, I’ve been unable to have any sessions since March. I also do have issues with sleeping that could be causing it. I’ve only been able to get around 6 hours of sleep at most daily for the past couple of years. I hesitate again to put the blame fully on that though since the concentration issues are a recent development. I don’t believe it’s anything like ADHD since I’m 24 years old now and I’ve never had issues like this as a child.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on ways that I can retrain my mind to make it easier to congrats and regain my enjoyment of these activities. Thank you!",23Jun2020,1
175,"My step-brother(23) has live with me(im 15) since is was eight he has always been my superhero, someone i looked up to and i became really attached to him. He used to work closing shifts and i would stay up until 2 or 3 in the morning just so i could spend i little time with him. He was so amazing, he was in a band and new how to play the guitar (i love watching him play) and taught me about video games. He was and still is my everything, i would tell him everything and he is the only person i let me self be attached to. 
This all changed when he left for Arizona (w almost 3 years ago) with his girlfriend at the time. That Absolutely broke me. Couldn't handle the fact that he left and it was so upset and so angry at his girlfriend for taking him away from me. He was the one person besides my mother that I actually cared about.(i have major trust Issues and don't let myself get attached to people as a way of coping and protecting myself for being hurt) I genuinely loves him and that scared the shit out of me. Because I don't like forming attachments to people because I know that they're just going to end up leaving eventually. I don't think that I coped with him leaving for Arizona the best that I could. Even at the end of those two years the thought of him would make me burst into tears crying. He was my everything I put so much faith and admiration into him. 

Then before quarantine started I found out that he was admitted into a mental ward. His girlfriend left him after being in Arizona for a couple months and after doing a lot of drugs and being alone for a very long time it got the best of him. He became really depressed and moved back to an apartment with one of his friends. He was drinking a lot smoking weed all the time and doing acid. And he wasn't taking care of his diabetes let alone his mental health. His friends put him into the ward because I wanted him to get better. But apparently he was non stop drinking and couldn't control it. When I went to visit him in the hospital, he couldn't even form sentences. It's like he was a ghost wasn't even there and that hurt watching him be like that. And then he came to live with us again. And I was the happiest that Had ever been in a while. Even though he wasn't the same he was back and I could spend time with him. We spent a lot of nights just talkin about how he was feeling and it really helped him get better. We went up to our camp in Maine and he ended up stealing a bottle of my mother's alcohol. He was also smoking. Which was a bad habit, especially because he was so in debt and didn't have any money.

But anyways I've spent almost every day with him, especially because of quarantine. He is my best friend. And he means absolutely everything to me. My mom kicked him out because he ended up drinking all four bottles of her tequila, and vaping not contributing to the house at all. He is a real alcoholic and the only way for him to come back is if he gets help. I understand that he needed to leave because he hasn't been motivated to do anything and he lied to my mom and broke her trust. His license was suspended in Arizona and so my mom has had to hassle him about calling the RMV and getting the stuff done. I just wish that there is something that I could do, and I want to be upset and I want to be angry at him for doing this. Cuz I talked to him about it and he knows how much I care about him, He knows that. My worst fear was the fact that I knew that he was going to leave again. I wouldn't hang out with my friends because every time I would do something that wasn't around him and I feel like a waste of time. It was like I knew that he was going to leave eventually so I wanted to spend every last second I could with him. And now he's really gone and I don't know what to do. I just feel so empty and I wish I could just see him one more time. 

The day he got kicked out. I was hanging out my friends and my parent wouldn't let me talk to him until he had already left. I've been texting him but I'm afraid that he's going to hurt himself. I really don't want this to be the breaking point for him cuz I know that his depression can be really bad sometimes. I mean she is he tried to kill himself once, I tried to overdose on insulin and the only reason that he didn't die was because he miscalculated how much would actually kill him. I just want to be there for him, but I don't know what to do. And I feel so selfish because right now all I'm thinking about is how I feel. How upset and how broken I feel right now. It's like I already felt this when he left before but Now that I'm older and we spent so much time together I just feel like we have more of a connection now. I feel like such an asshole for thinking why did he have to drink it, did he not even take me into consideration? Am I really that unimportant to you? And I know that addiction is really hard it runs in the family, I just want him to be happy and to be able to see him again

If any of you have any advice, it would be greatly appreciated.

176,"we communicated via text messaging, so that's the only way i can send her a message. this was also my first interview as a recent high school graduate so im extremely new and nervous to all this. is this okay to send to my interviewer? 

Hi XYZ, thank you for taking the time to interview me yesterday and considering for the QWERTY job. I just want to reassure you that I will have reliable transport to LOCATION1 even from LOCATION2 and I will be in COUNTRY until the end of January. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you require any additional information.

the only reason ive included the location part is bc i am quite far (20km, 15 miles) so im worried that might be a concern for the company. i also included the time ill be in my country till bc there seemed like uncertainty on this topic even though i explained it to the interviewer.

179,"With the recent political movement and high tensions, I've struggled more with family members who have different views than myself.

I'd best categorize myself as liberal, but many older members of my family are very conservative, and hold what I would definitely consider racist &amp; homophobic views. Because of this, there have obviously been disagreements and unpleasant conversations, but I'm specifically starting to call into question their morals and character based on their views. This changes how I feel about them, and obviously puts a strain on the relationship. 

These family members have been nothing but good to me in every other respect, but I can't help but question their judgment when these very human, even life/death issues are on the table.

180,"I met this guy in the beginning of June and we immediately hit it off. I’m 21F and he’s 20M. I’ve never blended so well with someone right off the bat. 

When we hung out for the first time it was amazing and we hung out twice after that all within the week. It seemed like we couldn’t get enough of each other. 

Although the last time we hung out you-know-what happened and I got anxiety. I mean it was good but it was clear I had anxiety so it was a bit awkward and we talked about it and he was being super nice and understanding. But my anxiety still persisted the rest of the night and I almost had a panic attack on the way home because I was so afraid I fucked things up.

He knows a lot about guitars and I told him I want him to come with me to buy one, and he said yes of course. It has been 2 weeks since (I know its not that long). I asked him to hangout last week and he said he couldn’t. Understandable. Then last Friday I asked him if he was working and he said yes and I said “aw I was going to invite you to X ”. I don’t know about ya’ll, but when someone I like invites me to something, I say something like “I can’t today but maybe we can do something X day?” and ya know, try and make up for it because I want to see them. He hasn’t done that :/ 

We still text everyday and the conversations are not boring or anything, but I feel like something is different. 3 weeks ago it seemed like he was super into me and couldn’t wait to see me. But now it doesn’t really seem that way. Maybe I’m overthinking everything. But it really seems like I’m the only one that wants to hangout even the way he texts me just seems a bit off :/  

I like him a lot and I have so much anxiety that I fucked things up for myself. I’ve been doing me and keeping myself busy, I’m not waiting on him or anything, but I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to scare him off by asking him what’s going on. But I don’t want to be guessing and having him lead me on.",23Jun2020,2

I struggle doing things like painting, writing, drawing, or reading books because I feel like there would be no benefit or gain from it. It’s gotten to the point where I either overwork myself for money or I just lay around and do absolutely nothing. I recently went on a bookstore date with my lovely partner and felt some spark of excitement seeing and smelling all the books I used to dive into as a child. He bought me two beautiful poetry books of which I’m familiar with the writers and watch videos about their lives.

186,"*Going to change some names and shit for anonymity* 

Ok so I’m going to try to keep this short but I met a girl - let’s call her E - and we are going to the same college next year. Anyway we hung out once and just talked and kinda got to know each other and I ended up kind of liking her. Not like a constant reminder but every now and then Id think ab her. I didn’t pursue it too much though.

About the third time we hung out it was a group of us and the rest were her friends. They wanted to hang at a place about 10 minutes on bike. However, since I drove down, I had to walk. I end up walking with E and this other girl I had never met before, Ill call her M. Well it’s me E and M and theres a red light but E takes off and blows through it, leaving me with M. M is super drunk and she seemed just as horny because she kept throwing herself on me. We hooked up for about two minutes and that was it before we found the rest of the group, but they were pissed (understandably so, because they may have thought I tried to take advantage of her). Well E is still mad and won’t talk to me while she convinced all her friends I assaulted her, which they believed until M told them what really happened.

Well anyway a few days pass and I apologized to E about it and thought it was nbd when she continued to remain upset. She also conveyed to me she now liked another guy. At this point, I don’t need the mental drain and anxiety that she brings so I move on, I figured I only met her twice prior so it was nbd. 

Then most recently M and I hang out again just to talk about everything and we hooked up again, this time both sober. But this kid that is best friends with E is there and he tells her right away. She texts me and starts freaking out and telling me never to talk to her again.

Idk what to do, like obviously Im not dating her and she is acting as if we were. But she seems like a wreck and is constantly coming for my neck ab everything now. Also E and M were kindof friends and that’s probably over now this has all happened.

194,"me and my best friend have been friends for three years now and those three years have been pretty interesting to say the least. 

to give some background to my advice-needing-situation: we had a crush on each other in the beginning of our friendship, we have hooked up once (she’s my first) and have made out multiple times, but that was within the second year of knowing each other and nothing has happened in a little over a year. she’s also married now. 

at this point i feel as though i have ruined the friendship with my on-going crush on her and my anxiety. a little over a year ago i asked her if she still had a crush on me and she said ‘i don’t think so’ which confused me since she continued to flirt and be touchy feely with me. i kind of convinced myself she probably still liked me and didn’t change much in regard to my behavior towards her. but when it started to become clear that she genuinely didn’t have a crush on me, i thought i could change her mind or that she was still attracted to me. stupid, i know. this obviously made her push me away a little bit, but we were still best friends and did everything together. 

i have anxiety and tend to overthink excessively which can, at times, cause me to make small problems seem bigger than they actually are. i am someone who needs to talk things out so i usually i’d go to her and ask her if i upset her, etc when i notice she’s pulling away a bit or ignoring me, etc and she would always say no. 

keep in mind i said we did everything together, including working together. we had no time away from each other and i am guessing that played a huge part into us arguing a lot. we get into these petty little arguments all the time where i get upset or vice versa and T shuts down and then i feel guilty and apologize/ask if we’re ok and then we are back to normal. we no longer work together but we still have these little arguments here and there, but lately they’ve been getting worse and we have gone two separate times not talking to each other for a week, despite living with each other. we have different communication skills and aren’t on the same page in that department, thought i am working on giving her space when she’s upset. 

i think i am finally starting to get over my crush, but what’s killing me is that it’s obvious she is pulling away more than ever. she won’t either won’t respond to my texts or responds rather dryly, won’t open my memes on insta (we used to spam each other with them constantly), won’t tell me stuff that’s bothering her like she used to, etc.

she is my best friend and i don’t want that to change. i just miss how we used to be- not even the hooking up or anything, but us hanging out and having a blast, or us sending each other memes all throughout the night, and us confiding in each other with things we’ve never tell anyone else. we still talk and hang out, and when we hang out it’s great and feels like normal, but then she’ll go back to being seemingly distant with me and doing the things i listed above. i know not everything is about me and that she has been going through some things, but she will talk normally with her other good friend, though i will say that they mainly text each other and don’t hang out all that much. 

i’m not sure if i’m reading too much into this or not, and of course the obvious answer would be to talk to her about it, but like i said earlier; we have extremely different communication styles and we have already talked about her distancing herself before and she’s always said no. i want to believe her, but i feel like the signs she’s giving me are proving otherwise.

i’m new to reddit and this is my first post so i apologize if this should be posted elsewhere or if the formatting is weird, just let me know! I also know this doesn’t have the best flow but it’s late and i haven’t slept much the past week due to testing and studying so i just threw this together real fast.

I've had panic attacks before so i was trying to calm down but he kept yelling. then he spun my chair to face him and said ""you can't be sad, I'm mad."" and hit me on the thigh. hard enough to leave a hand print for about 30 minutes but not hard enough to bruise. he never apologized, all he said later was ""i did it because i love you"".

Hi, I’m assuming I am, so I guess I’m wondering how to overcome it. 

This has been trapped inside of me for so long and I didn’t know who I could tell. Sorry if it’s a bit long. 

I grew up in a strict religious household, with narrow minded parents. All my life, beliefs were pushed onto me and I was a child, I guess I didn’t know any better. The belief I’m struggling with is about the LGBTQ+ community. 

My parents are very against everything to do with gay rights. Every time it’s brought up in the news, they change the channel. Every time they see actions in public that support the LGBTQ+ community (whether it be the people themselves or supporters) they tell me how awful these people are and how they’re sinners. 

I’ve never really put much thought into it, but lately (before quarantine and during) I’ve come across more scenarios that make me sick of myself and the thoughts that come into my head. 

I’ll see a post or a comment or content relating to the LGBTQ+ community and the first thought that comes into my head is disgust. I hate myself for thinking that way and I don’t know how to change it. After thinking that, I immediately think to myself, “No, love is love, you shouldn’t think like that.” But negative first thoughts are continuous. I’ve been reading WEBTOONs lately and I see BL or GL stories and I’ll think, “Gross, hell no would it read that” and it scares me how that’s the first thing that comes to mind. 

Other times include people coming out to me or seeing strangers and PDA, and I always think the same negative thoughts.

My last girlfriend told me she thought I had a 6 pack under my shirt when she first met me and said she was shocked that I didn’t have one when she saw me with my shirt off for the first time and it’s scarred me for life. I don’t want to date because of it.

I feel like if I get back into dating that I would be catfishing a lot of women because I do look very fit and chiseled with clothes on but the bottom of my stomach is not the best.

203,"One of my great friends (We'll call him W) seems to never able to secure a relationship. In the 13 years I've known him he's had 4 actual crushes on girls and he asked them out but they said no and I've told him several girls I know find him attractive but he's never been interested in them (he's known them a while as well). 

The sad thing, for me, is that he's a great guy. Funny with any crowd, loyal, halfway through writing a movie and it's pretty fuckin good, he wants to be a music producer too and is pretty damn good with that as well, brave... Now i could be bias as his friends but we've been through a lot of shit together and I've seen him at his worst and he's still a great human being.

But when it comes to dating, he just has trouble connecting with people. It's like some people just grab his attention right away and others he feels nothing with... He has plenty of friends that are girls, but never a girlfriend. 

I just don't get it and it breaks my heart because I've always known him to be so blindingly confident and sure of himself (with dating never being a priority) but now that we're getting older and he's starting to think about it more i can tell his self esteem is crumbling. 

I think it's that he knows he's talented and whatnot (very proud of himself and his work but he stays grounded) but the girls he's liked haven't liked him and i honestly do think it will be a while before he finds someone he really connects with, and i think he may know it too.

213,"In about a year I will have my Bachelor's in arts. I plan to run away from my parents and never look back. The reason I say run away, when I'm old enough to get a bachelors is because they're demanding I move to Japan with them. And while yeah there are some good things about living in Japan, I want to be as far away from my parents as possible. I'm somewhat worried that if I make a run for it, my parents are going to try to track me down, file a missing person's report or something that could be problematic and end with me seeing them. And I want none of that drama. But trying to argue with them about how I want to be free, is gonna be the longest argument that I will ever lose.  

Why do I want my parents out of my life? My father was an abusive scumbag. My mother was somewhat better. My father has stopped being shitty when I entered college, but the damage he's done is pretty bad. I'll write the shit both of my parents have done at the bottom of the post because it would be fairly long and isn't as important.

I know it's a bit early to ask about this but after a life time of misery, I just want something to look forward to.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My father made me learn to draw. And that wouldn't be so bad if the way he made me learn wasn't bad. He basically made me draw for hours at a time, yelled at me for making mistakes, occasionally hitting me for 'arguing back' which was me trying to answer his questions he would ask me over and over again. (Like why did you make this mistake? Anyone can get this right. Why can't you do this? And he would ask this multiple times getting angrier each time I answered because I was 'talking back'.) Sometimes he would say that I was going to be homeless in the future if I didn't do what he said and I said fine, I'd rather be homeless. He threw me out the house a handful of time for a few hours before dragging me back in. Things go so bad, I remember often crying and being forced to draw because of how much I hated everything.

Even when I did what I was supposed to do, he would guilt me by saying I was doing the bare minimum. That I was only drawing as much as he told me to. (Which was a lot by the way, because if I made a single mistake while drawing what I was copying. He would make me redo the entire drawing over and over until I got it perfect. I spent entire weekends like this.) He said that I didn't deserve anything for the bare minimum and often took my stuff away constantly. I remember he had gotten me an xbox 360 for Christmas and took it away for about two years because 'I was only doing the bare minimum'. He banned me from quite literally everything, until all I was allowed to do was play chess against myself and draw. And then played Xbox 360 in front of me while I was drawing.

At one point I got a D in a class, and he threw out every card that I had collected from playing yugioh (Which was about 7+ years of cards I collected and memories for me. I wasn't that great at socializing, but yugioh made it easier for me to make friends. Yugioh, as nerdy as it sounds, was really important to me because of how many friends it has made for me. He made me grab a trash bag that night and grab handful after handful of cards, and put  them in the trash bag and throw it out.)

He often compared me, an elementary school child/ middle school child with ADHD that was on meds, to everyone else my age. Saying that I was clearly a bad child because every other child was doing sports, had an active social life, did a club, got straight A's, had a hobby, went to saturday school, and took care of their younger brother at the same time. This is actually what he has said on multiple occasions when I told him that trying to keep my grades up while doing art was really hard. He said I was clearly the problem.  Even when I had straight As and had like a single B, became an honors student and got student of the month (Which was awarded to the highest grade student for that month.) My father said I was still doing the bare minimum and that it meant nothing if I didn't keep it up. When I wanted to go to college, he even said that it wasn't worth it for me because I can't get good grades. (Around the time I quite taking meds my grades went back down). I did however after entering college, got straight As for two years straight. 

The reason he made me do this was because my grades were originally low. I don't remember ever failing a class except once in highschool because I was in honors math.  (And that was an F for the marking period, not the year). I think I got a couple Cs and Ds in the important subject back then, but like I said, with ADHD it was very hard to focus. I really couldn't help it between the ADHD, and a very dysfunctional family where my parents were constantly yelling at each other. 

This kind of highly toxic behavior got to me. I hated my life so damn much, I wanted it to end. I had believed that I was trash, and that I was a mistake. By middle school I was borderline suicidal I think, considering that every night I wish I didn't wake up, though I never made any real attempts to take my own life. 

I currently have some amount of social anxiety. It's gotten a lot better since I started college. But around high school, I couldn't look people in the eyes, when I was around people I was quite aware of my own breathing and heartbeat. During group projects, people asked me if I was okay because I think I was panicking. At the time I had no idea what social anxiety was and what panicking was, so I didn't realize that I was. While I did admit earlier I was a bit shy/awkward. I wasn't suffering from social anxiety. That's something that developed like in highschool. Even my older friends have said that they remember me talking a lot more and even me being the one to ask them to be my friend in elementary. Someone with social anxiety doesn't do that.

Overall in my life I had no choices. For a time I even tried to write, because I wanted to be a writer but my father would instead fill up free time that I didn't spend studying with more art. So I had no time to even do that and I eventually gave up being a writer. I don't want him to ever make another choice for me. I want to be free.  

This is leaving out some stuff but I made this rant a lot of times. And I don't want to dig up some of my bad memories.

  
My mother was better. 

I remember her often ignoring me if I tried to talk to her during my child hood. she would just grunt, to whatever I said while keeping her face in her book. And she's still sort of like that. I told her I got my first girlfriend and she just grunted. And then twenty minutes later she asked what my girlfriend's ethnicity was. And replied that she was disappointment that my girlfriend wasn't Japanese (my mother is Japanese. And apparently racist which is hilarious since she married someone that's African American, you would think she wouldn't be racist.)

If I had a slight difference in opinion she would often freak out until I complied with her. I couldn't even choose the clothes I wanted to wear. A lot of the time she basically told me that I should just be a model. She would often disregard what I wanted, I told her I wanted to be a writer, she said just be a model. (Which is somewhat understandable considering that I was scouted a few times.) She would say that I should become a model, get rich, and she could live with me and take care of my child. And she would be able to wear all the clothes and stuff she wanted... She was dead serious about this I swear and would say this very frequently. Whenever I was upset or anything she would say this as if this was going to make me happy. If I said I wanted to do something in life, she would say that I should be a model. 

She would often only talk to me if she wanted something out of me. For an example, because I became fairly good at drawing she would take pictures of my sketchbook and send them to her friends. When I got good grades she would take a picture and send them to her friends. Even when I demanded that she stopped taking pictures of my personal sketchbook, she ignored me and tried to take a picture. I had to stand in front of her camera and demand she stopped shitting around. She would often take pictures of me when she got new clothes for me, and sent them to her friends.  And then she wouldn't really say anything else for the rest of the day. I felt like a trophy. She would pull me out to take a picture of or show off to her friends and put me back in a glass case and refuse to acknowledge me when her friends were gone.

She demanded that I be home at like 6. If I went anywhere she demanded to know where I was, who I was with, and why I was going alone. Keep in mind I live in a fairly safe and rich neighborhood. I know me and my friend's joke that you could get drugs like five towns over. Otherwise our town was fairly quiet and peaceful. It felt like she just wanted control over me.

She did some good things however, she spent a lot of her own money sending me to college. (Which once again I could say that she wanted to be able to tell her friends that she's sending her son off to college. But it works out for me so I won't count that against her.) Anyway I do plan to save up money and pay her back the tuition cost because if I don't I feel I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. So while she wasn't the perfect mother, she wasn't a bad one. I certainly don't remember any moments in life where I had to admit I thought my mother was awesome or cared about me all that much. 

I personally feel very broken. I see nice parents and their children, and it feels touching to me. Sometimes it makes me cry when I think about it too much because I get jealous that I've never experienced that and will never be able to.",23Jun2020,1

215,"So I am playing this game with a friend.

So now during our gameplay, we meet a third person which we grow to play with him and both me and the other guy liked him.It got to the point where I had to switch characters so I couldn't play with the other guy and the third guy who was there. I lost contact with them in game but I kept close contact with the guy I played 5 months with, by chatting to him. And now I decide to start playing with him again cause I can but he wants to include the third guy and talks about him like he has known him more than I do. Right off the bat I know I'm jealous a bit, but I wont admit it because I know it wont change shit.

216,"Yeah the title makes this sound insignificant (because it is) but this has been bugging me for a while now, so whatever

So my school has a gaming club put together by a bunch of students, myself included. I've been part of it for about two years now, and it's definitely become an important part of my school life. I've met the vast majority of my friends through this club, however, lately we've been drifting apart.

I've been getting very bored of this club lately, I have to dedicate about five hours a week even with the virus going on, but I feel obligated to stay and stick it out until the club dissolves as it's very important to me.

If I leave, I'll most likely lose my closest friends (though we're not really that close), and I most likely will not be able to join back if I change my mind later, as the owner is pretty strict. However, if I stay, I'll be able to explore my other interests further, and I won't feel bound to the club.

So should I leave now, leave sometime in the future, or stay?

222,"Hi, I (M/24) find it hard to keep up conversation with people. At the back of the mind I want to talk to new people but most of the time I can’t bear with other people’s nonsense.

Also, at my workplace I can’t keep up any conversation with my colleagues because I don’t find anyone interesting, even if I try to have a conversation, I end up saying something awkward. I just talk about my work related issues with them, that’s it. For me it is getting hard to talk to people day by day.  

Now I have noticed that sometimes I have started to stammer. Maybe this is because I don’t speak  much? 

From the past couple of years I have even stopped trying to speak to people because I just can’t. I just want to sit back alone in my room with possibly no human interaction. Listen to music, watch Netflix, play PS4 and do my work. But I am scared that I might end up losing people whom I have now or maybe I’ll end up alone.

223,"I pay for a reserved spot in my apartment complex so I can be close to the door and there has been a lady parking in the handicap spot to the right of me and has been for about 4 months now. 

It really hasn’t bothered me until I looked at the red placard (which in the state of Texas means temporary for up to 6 months or less) she has hung expired in Dec 2019. I saw and noticed that it expired Dec 2019 last week. 

I know that disabilities are not visible some times so I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt when I have seen her move swiftly with ease to the car. 

It did bother me when I saw a handicapped person trekking across the parking garage since this car was in the handicap space. 

Today I looked at the placard again and now it has “Dec 2029” written in the white space with sharpie. Now it seems especially true that this woman might have had a temporary one that expired, and now has written a new date 9 years from now to use the placard for her own convenience.

I looked up on Texas DMV website and it said red placards are temporary 6 months maximum and blue tags are for permanently disabled people and are renewable every 4 years. This essentially tells me the DMV would never extend a parking pass by writing a new date on an expired tag and especially wouldn’t put a date 9 years out.

224,"So I've been talking to this girl for about a month and a half and we have become very close friends within that time span. We talk everyday, we flirt, we tell each other how much we love each other, but we still haven't met in person due to covid. Today, I made the possibly disastrous choice of asking her to be my girlfriend. I absolutely rushed this decision because I've been dying to be in a relationship for a long time now and I'm tired of being single and lonely.

She responded and said even though I'm one of her closest friends and that she is grateful for me in her life, she isn't ready for a relationship due to stress caused by covid. She doesn't know how or when we could meet but made it clear that she wants to see me more first. She ended it by asking me to give her more time. She also said that it wouldn't be fair to me if she started the relationship while she was so stressed.

I initially perceived this as ""not now, but maybe in a couple of months when we've met a few more times"". However, we met on a dating site where she told me she in fact did want a relationship. She still updates her Tinder bio every week.

225,"

I [27F] have gone through some incredibly hard stuff my entire life, but especially in the last two years. I lost  life long friendships, I lost someone I once loved to suicide, I lost my best friend to an overdose, I was raped while taking a run, and I’ve been in a relationship that wasn’t always good for me. 

I grew up being sexually abused. I have had a constant cycle of abuse in some shape or form for my entire life. 

Add to those things a sick kiddo who has had 24 surgeries and all the stress that comes along with it. 

I finally got myself into therapy about 6 months ago, I have been seeing a therapist who has helped me greatly. I felt like I had hit the jackpot with him. 

Until he very obviously hit on me during last weeks session. 

Obviously I don’t feel comfortable seeing him anymore which is another heartbreak all in itself, because he was the one thing I have consistently looked forward to for several months now. I was comfortable with him. He knew my whole story and we were working through it, successfully in my opinion. 

I’ve been calling around trying to find someone new since last week, and every single one I have called is either not taking new patients, doesn’t accept my insurance, or has waiting lists into next year. I have literally exhausted the options google gave me. 

Do I stay with a therapist who I don’t feel has pure intentions anymore, or do I do one of these online video therapies I see advertised everywhere now? 

I just don’t want to fall back into the same slump I’ve been in and this past week was particularly awful and I’m already slipping back into my self destructive habits. 

Advice?",23Jun2020,2
226,"Hello, I (23M) feel like I'm getting to that age where I feel ready to start looking for a lasting relationship. That includes eventually getting married. I come from a family where we don't exactly date in the normal sense (normal meaning, I guess what you'd see on TV here in the US). Now my family is from India but I was born and raised here so cultural conflicts like this were likely inevitable.

But basically, the way most of my cousins and brother got married was our parents show them pictures of girls (along with some basic information, where they are from, age, what career, etc.. basically a tinder profile lol) and if they are remotely interested they can contact them via text or something like that. Note that these girls have also agreed to be setup by their parents so it's not like I'd be texting some random girl who wasn't expecting me to message. Since some people normally assume these are ""arranged"" marriages I assure you this is not the case with my family anyways. It's perfectly okay to say no to any of the girls our parents try to set us up with. The thing is that our family likes us to marry ""our kind of people"". That's not just referring to other Indian people but specifically within our community of people (essentially people who my parents have some sort of first hand knowledge of or know someone who knows someone who knows that person and so on). My parents explain this by saying that marriage is about more than just the two people getting married but also about the two families joining so they need to make sure I marry someone who can get along with my family and who's family can get along with my family (and I suppose them being Indian is the easiest solution since they would be similar religiously (though I myself am not at all religious, but that's an entirely different problem) and culturally).

Being raised in America I'd say I'm much more American a lot of my family. My siblings are the same but they don't find anything wrong and go along with things as is and as far as I can tell I'm the only one in my family who always feels out of place. Which makes me feel like I'm always wrong, though I know I'm not. I don't have any great aspirations in life but have always wanted to fall in love with someone, have them fall in love with me, get married, have kids, and live a long life and the end :D. Though now that I'm writing this I feel as though that may, in fact, be a great aspiration on its own. Anyways all that was just background so I can get some advice on what I should do? I don't want to completely say no to my parents if they ever show me a girl since (though I'm not fond of the idea of starting relationship online with someone who may liver in a different state) that girl could be someone I can have a relationship with but I also don't want that to be my only course. I have friends who always remind me that I'm 23, an adult, who can make my own decisions and I don't HAVE to do what my parents say. And though that is true the problem isn't simply that I just ignore what they say and do what I want, the problem is that all of this, all of them have made me super confused and I'm just lost, not sure what to do, not sure what's right, not sure what to think :'(.

Lastly, as you can imagine by now I haven't ever really been in a relationship and don't have a lot of experience (well, any I guess). I'm not interested in just casually dating but want to find someone with the intend of getting married one day. I've already graduated college so I don't have the option of just talking to girls in class or anything like that. I'm currently on a job search and not sure when or where I'll find a job (thanks for that COVID, not too worried though since I did graduate with my Master's in Computer engineering so am not too worried about finding a job eventually). People say go to bars and clubs and you can find people (me? Nahhhh I don't really like clubbing and am not much of a drinker). I drink socially but that's it and just going to bars just to find girls is a bit idk forced I supposed. People say do what you like and don't make finding a girl your sole reason for doing something, which is sound advice except like....what would I do? I like playing games, watching TV, and yea don't do much. Do more? Always had a hard time finding anything else that piqued my interest. Clearly I have a lot more problems that just finding girl but any advice is appreciated thanks.

236,"Hi.  I couldn't think of a particularly appropriate place to put this, so it's here.  I'm (20F) in need of some advice on what I should do concerning a sexual assault that happened to me about a year and a half ago (it was Sept 2018).  During my college orientation week at a frat party I was sexually assaulted by another freshman, Logan.  It is rather sensitive so I will not elaborate on the events here but am willing to discuss further below, if necessary (for like severity maybe?? idk why you would really want this information).

I was not very traumatized by it.  The only effect that I've had from it is that I have a tough time being around Logan.  We attend the same church on campus as well as the occasional non-Greek event (maybe twice per year) and when I see him I get incredibly anxious.  But beyond that, I felt free to engage/not to engage my school's general hookup culture.  Basically, it's him that I now have an issue with, nothing else.

I decided not to report him.  I felt that what Logan did didn't warrant being kicked out of my college and never being accepted to another one, resulting in his having no future, especially since he is lower-middle class.  I also have a problem with the way that these investigations are handled by universities, so I generally morally oppose going to school officials and the Office of Equity so long as there are alternative methods to handle the situation.

I took it upon myself to make sure that Logan would never be recruited to a frat by contacting people who knew people who had authority in frats to blacklist him.  I also had a friend send an email to all presidents and rush chairs of the frats at my college not to recruit Logan.  He has not joined a frat and he is no longer allowed in at Greek parties or events.  I thought this was a good way to handle the situation given that I just wanted to limit the access he had to girls while being drunk, as well as teach him a pretty severe lesson without ruining his future.  For context, Greek life is very big at my school and it is basically necessary for most people to join to have a social life.  There are some other groups that can provide a student with a comparable level of social life, but he is not part of them.  My campus is semi-large (8k students) and Logan has somewhat of an unintended scourge on his name in the Greek realm, which leads most girls far, far away from him.  Logan has a very limited social life and is relegated to the few-and-far-between non-Greek events that Greek students attend.  It has also worked: to this day, Logan has not sexually assaulted another girl.  

My freshman year roommate and I were not very close, but I ended up telling her the situation several months after this happened.  She told me that I was enabling Logan to assault more girls in the future by simply remaining on campus.  I disagreed with her because I thought I had taught him a good enough lesson by ruining his general college experience without ruining his future.  I thought what I had done was a good compromise and a way to fix his method of access.  I have stuck to this opinion until quarantine, where I have started to question basically everything.  Maybe I didn't handle this correctly?

So, should I revisit this issue and report him for sexual assault once I return to campus?",23Jun2020,1

239,"I love my mom so much, but she’s too much at times. She doesn’t allow me any freedom with my few friends, and I always have to have her approval, which is almost always a no. I’m turning 16 in September and I want to have my ears pierced and be able to go places. (with a curfew) She always goes to the negative things that will happen, like how I have bad hygiene so I can’t do it. When I ask something, she reflects that back on me like “Oh, you want to have your ears pierced..? You can’t do that with your hygiene.” And when I try to reason with her saying if I can prove to her I can take care of myself, I could have them pierced, it’s still a no. I just want freedom. She doesn’t want me to learn to drive, because I am diagnosed with autism + ADHD. She says it’s “too hard” for me to learn. When I asked her if I can hang out with my friend for a sleepover, she said no because 1.) there were gonna be boys and 2.) my friend is pan. So I think she might be homophobic too, but I don’t want to believe that. I can’t get a job either and my bedtime is 8 pm on schooldays. I’m 15-almost 16! I just want small changes, even if there’s still some restrictions. Everyone I know seems to be able to do everything I’m not allowed.",23Jun2020,2
240,"I (22M) have been working in a shop at a dealership since November of 2020. I do not have acollege degree and did not graduate High School. The dealership I work at will send me to school once I finish my online classes. Sorry for the format as I'm using Reddit mobile.

I got premoted from moving the service cars to the back for the technicians to becoming a tech. I got in the shop and dropped money on a bunch of tools from the tool trucks. My shop foreman seems to play favorites though. 

I got premoted along with another Porter (my old job position) and now the other person doesn't want to even be a technician. My ship foreman jumps down my throat for anything small. At the same time ihave never witnessed him jumping down the other guys throat like he does to me. Even another technician noticed it today... Foreman hasn't once asked me in the 8 months I've been in the shop what I have learned or what I'm comfortable doing. Which I feel if he wants to see me progress he should ask every once in awhile. Me and my foreman don't speak at all until he has something to put me down with. I have even tried to say, ""Good Morning, Man!"" And he had literally walked right passed me. 

I'm a bit confused on my options of what to do because I love my job. I'm thinking of going to the service director and if that doesn't change I'll pay a visit to our HR Advisor, who already isn't a fan of Mr.Shop Foreman...

243,"My (43f) son (14m) has always had lots of friends. He’s basically been raised an only child (his half-sister is 10 years older.) He’s never had trouble making friends before because he’s been playing organized sports since he was in 3rd grade. With the stay-at-home orders, of course he’s been lonely and bored. Now that they’re lifted, though, he still doesn’t do anything. He’s decided not to do sports anymore because he’s literally the smallest kid in his grade and never got much playing time anyway and says it’s not worth busting his butt in practice to ride the bench. All his friends are going to weight training in the morning for football, or swim team practice. He just mopes around and says anytime he asks someone what they’re doing, everyone is always busy. We live in a very very small town, so it’s not like there are tons of other kids his age or other activities he can join to make more friends. Is this just the teenage-angsty phase? I know he leans toward depression as it runs in our family. I have it too, but when I was young, I at least had a best friend I was with 24/7 which was a godsend. I just hate seeing him bummed and lonely like this. Has anyone been there and can offer advice? Thank you for reading.

252,"I am a 22F. I am a disney fan and a huge romantic. I love romance, fairy tale and true love. But after some personal reasons of being very hurt during my first love, I am unable to open my heart to people or think about dating. Unable is a small word, scared to death is a better representation. This hurt had turn into extreme bitterness and this results in me hating to see any sweet romantic gestures or couples being in their own world or even see my friends getting married. I never show this and always show my support for them but I hated seeing these. 

The extent of my bitterness goes to even my parents when my mom would retell their story of how they fell in love, how she married her first love, I'm suppose to feel good about this because this is how my family started. But the bitterness is still there with the feeling of dread ""will I ever find someone like that"" or ""am I destined to be alone forever"" because of my fear and reluctance to open my heart to people.  

So to summarise, I am reminded of how lonely I feel when i see any couple being lovey dovy, and has grown a resentment for it. 

The advice I am looking for is, how can I change this bitterness or get rid of this bitterness without finding a partner of my own.

Getting a partner would be out of the picture because that's is a whole personal issue I have to solve. And if I get a partner just cause of this, I feel like I would be using them just for my own gain and I dont want that. I want to be fully healed from my first heartbreak before finding another one.

265,"My sibling and father are emotionally abusive and manipulative, and have been my whole life (youngest child).  But because of this I feel like my mom treats me like I am not allowed to have negative emotions, because the two of them just suck all the life out of her, so she can’t deal with anything else.  She has gotten increasing short-fused over time and it’s starting to make me feel very bad.  I have been dealing with a traumatic life change over the past few years (health issues, probably traumatized her, too, since she had to take care of me), and I’m not allowed to act like it scared me or upset me to be so sick.  I’m not allowed to cry about the fact that it uprooted my life and that I may never be “normal” again.  I’m trying my best to move forward, and I am not a complainer or a crier and never have been, so when I cry, it’s because something really is bothering me.

It hurts my feelings that she doesn’t seem to have any empathy for me when I cry, she just yells at me to stop.  I’m trying to be understanding, because I know my father and sibling are mean to her, and that’s hard to deal with, but she’s starting to really hurt my feelings, and I frankly don’t even like talking to her anymore, because she’s so irritable and always assumes that I am criticizing her and talking back to her or giving her attitude when I’m not.  I’ve always been on her side when it came to my family’s mistreatment of her, so I don’t know why it seems like she’s pushing me away and getting to mad all the time over nothing.  I’m tired of being a punching bag and her assuming that I’m being a jerk to her when I’m not.  I don’t know what I’m asking here.  Maybe words of encouragement?  A way to disconnect myself from the fact that I don’t like my mom very much anymore, since telling her directly that she’s hurting my feelings isn’t working?  I don’t know.  Anything is appreciated.

And before anyone suggests it, I have suggested therapy, since she has been through a lot, but she doesn’t think therapy helps.

I met this girl a couple weeks before the breakup who was friends with my ex at the time. She helped me through that summer a bit and if it weren’t for her I would have lost myself and my sanity. She used to be very depressed and suicidal so she knew how I was feeling.

She’s told me bad things about my ex that I didn’t know a few times. She’s one of very few people who actually reach out to me to talk. We would go out to a restaurant occasionally to talk. Honestly she’s not a bad person, and I enjoy talking to her.

I’m fully convinced that she likes me much more than a friend. She’s complimented me on my appearance and showed interest in me. However I’m not interested in her one bit.

So there were cases of envy which were obvious, jealousy was a major issue and my ex just preferred to believe everything about her family because she was scared that they will abandon her if she stood by me.

Because there is a child involved, I somehow still have to deal with these people as annoying as they can be.

My question now is this: How do you deal with people who just hate you for no reason, despite knowing that the things they heard about you are all false?

Do you still continue to deal with them or you just avoid them completely?

271," Background: My dad was a cop, recently retired, has a decent post retirement job. He's always been sort of a rough around the edges dude and I think his relationship with all his kids has had its fair share of ups and downs but generally speaking despite this we know he loves us he's just a bit emotionally inept.

My (24) younger brother (18) went to a BLM protest, not because he is anti-cop but because he is anti-racism. My dad took this extremely personally and chose to stop talking to him, his only expression of opinion to my brother was something to the effect of ""I see what I'm worth to you"" followed by radio silence for the past couple weeks. My step-mom is also on my dad's side and being passive aggressive toward my brother and my younger sister (17) is a mommy's girl at this point in her life and is also ignoring my brother. So the poor guy is just living in silence.

A week or two before the protests even began he and my sister (29) had what was objectively a very nice e-mail exchange regarding racism and white - privilege (we're white) and honestly I thought it was well worded and they had extremely similar opinions, thoughts, and feelings so I wouldn't have expected it to be anything but a conversation. But he apparently didn't take it well so he skipped my nephews birthday and told my sister he needed time to digest what she said.

Since then he has actively ignored any phone calls or face to face attempts to speak from my sister, my brother, and me (despite the fact that I hadn't said anything about my opinion to him).

He finally called me after 10 missed calls, 2 left on read text messages, and 2 requests to my younger sister to ask him to call me. Mind you I live in a different country and could of been calling for an emergency, he wouldn't have known. I initially wasn't even calling to talk about any of the other shit going on but after being ignored it became about that.

Our conversation was a loop of him saying that all the most vile anti-cop opinions are what my sister and brother believe even though that's not true. During the conversation I tried to set aside our difference in opinions about the movement because i know he believes in equality we just have different beliefs in approaching that issue and talk to him about ignoring his kids and how much he is going to hurt them and damage his relationships with them if he keeps this up and he said:

""I hope they're hurt, I'd say I hope they're as hurt as me but that's not possible.""

He then went on to strongly imply he wouldn't be answering my phone calls anymore, and he hasn't regardless of why I'm calling.

My sister sent him another e-mail talking about how hurt she is but telling him that regardless of their relationship she wants him to have a relationship with his grandson (2) and she always wished she knew more about our grandpa and has always loved our dads writing so she subscribed to a story prompt and it sends him a question/prompt each week to answer and he can send it back to her so she can share it with her son when he's older. He called her back to say:

""I got your e-mail. I wish you wouldn't have wasted your money."" And that was it.

I tried to call him for Father's Day he ignored it. I sent him a picture message saying Happy Father's Day and he responded:

""Thank you for the sentiment.""

274,"Hello. It’s my first post and I’m still figuring reddit out, so be patient with me and I’ll do my best. I wasn’t sure which subreddit would yield the best help for this, but I’ve seen some kind people on this one so it’s my best guess. It’s a long and complicated story because I need to tell it and it’s just.. a lot. I’m sorry that I don’t know how to make it shorter. I haven’t really shared it with anyone so part of me is scared to talk about something so personal and painful, so I don’t know if I have the strength to re-read and edit this thing. 
Opening context- 
I’m reaching out because I don’t have a lot of friends to talk to about this, and I feel like I’m losing my mind- I feel scared not knowing how to get through this and I feel like my instincts are getting warped and deteriorated by his actions and making me less equipped to have boundaries/appropriate limits, or to trust myself.

What would help: Ultimately, what would be most useful to me is validation, and tactical advice from people who have been around these kinds of people or who have been prone to the same kind of behaviors themselves. Especially in regard to circular toxic arguments. 

The story: 

We’ve been in a relationship for a chunk of time and we live together. We met because I was looking for a roommate for a new place to help split some of the cost, he was looking for a new place to live, the new living situation fell through but we liked each other so much we decided to still become roommates in my current apartment and go from there. Fell in love, etc etc. 
He was very confident that he would be splitting the cost of rent with me- is an honest and responsible person who has worked a lot of jobs. But a newer development in his life at that point was, he was rendered disabled by an illness and suffers intense chronic pain and other issues. 
So at the point we met, he was waiting on approval for gov assistance (SSI? The income for disabled people). 
Long story short, he had too much faith in the government. They had lost his first application, and this was his second run-around of applying and so he felt at ease because he figured they wouldn’t mess it up twice. Thought it would be a simple process that would only take so much time, because he is very clearly, unquestionably, someone who qualifies for it. 
He was wrong. 
They denied it, my understanding is that this wasn’t his fault, the system is just a nightmare. But neither of us knew that until it happened. 
(He has since appealed and re-applied, it’s still something that will maybe happen. but it’s still going and it’s been a year and.. uh.. quarantine.. yeah, who knows now) 

I have, by that circumstance, been situationally placed in the position of primary breadwinner, with someone physically unable to work dependent on me. I do not see myself as a confident or stable person to support two people. I am a kind person but I have my own anxieties, I have ADD and am prone to bouts of depression because I’m frequently tired and I grew up with severe social anxiety. 
I try to be proud of myself because I have a job and my own place despite that stuff, and I managed to climb out of retail-hell to get a job that is a better fit (I take care of/assist people in their homes, and I get to negotiate my own schedule with my clients). I got this new job right near when I met him- I was in a life-change mode which is why I was trying to move to a nicer place too, but ultimately ended up staying in my apartment, which is ok. 
The context of us meeting was platonic and I was not at all seeking a relationship- he wasn’t even interested in women. I know that sounds like bs but life is weird sometimes, I just happened to be that weird exception. So, like.. We fell in love, but he fell in love with me first, and that forced me to finally let go of a sort of long-distance relationship that wasn’t working. 

Point of that info being- the relationship I closed the door on, the last one I had before him, was with an alcoholic. Who I loved very very much. Me deciding to close the door on that relationship finally was on the basis of... I don’t want to wait for someone to get better, I deserve someone who lifts me up. I deserve better than that. 

So yeah. Fast forward again... a few months later, my new boyfriend who lives with me finds out he has no income because the thing was denied. I am saddled with the responsibility of keeping us both alive financially. 
Which sucks, a lot, but is ok. I’m somehow managing it. 

The problem is, that, either my new bf failed to warn me, or, the no-income was a perfect storm of stress and despair, basically a nuke on his sense of security: his mental health is absolutely terrible. And it’s been manifesting in extremely toxic ways. 

I completely empathize. He’s someone who was independent his whole life because he left an awful homophobic family and worked hard to survive and escape, did pretty well- then he suddenly got sick at 19 with a progressive illness and he worked until his body wouldn’t let him anymore. He applied for gov assistance when he finally had to accept that he could no longer work, was confident he would be ok, and then found out he was completely fucked. Or at least that, most of his fate is dependent on what I decide to do. And him, being an independent person originally from poverty, from a highly abusive family, whose only safety was his ability to survive the world on his own...
Yeah.....
It’s been triggering. It’s been a shitstorm. We haven’t been together long enough for him to feel safe with this level of dependence. And... 

It makes sense. I completely empathize. 
But holy shit I am not equipped for this. 

We met on a premise of him being self-sufficient, people who know him or lived with him vouch that he’s always cleaned up after himself and been highly responsible and cordial. He believed just as much as I did that he would have an income and would be a balanced part of my life. And I was very relieved and looking forward to the company of a responsible roommate, and eventually when we fell in love, a healthier relationship than the one I left behind. 

I can handle things going wrong, I can handle having to do more of the work than I wanted to because his health/morale is worse than he expected in light of his terror at being without an income and all that entails. It sucks for us both but like.. 
the mental health aspect is killing me. The toxic way he’s handling this situation is wrecking me. I had no way of knowing it would be like this and I’m completely unprepared and feel very damaged and scared not knowing how to protect my boundaries. He deals with agoraphobia too and is home 24/7, and the quarantine just sealed the deal on being around each other -a lot-. 
His mental health has taken a turn for the worse in ways that are -new- to him because he’s never been in this situation before, so he is equally lost on what to do and it’s a mess. 
For instance, he never had bouts of anger before, and now he does. We’re both at a loss. 
He started going to therapy for some months and is on medication but quarantine has put an end to the therapy for now, and the outbursts are still extremely frequent. 

That wall of text is context of the situation really. The meat of the issue is below:

For a long time now, there have been extremely toxic arguments that arrive abruptly and hit like a tornado. It has evolved over the year as I’ve tried different approaches to how to handle it, but yeah. It’s been extremely confusing. I was terrified it was domestic violence because the anger, which is really triggering for me, and the way it unfolds comes across as bizarre, unyielding, and manipulative. 
I’ve tried forcing an end to the arguments, but it escalated it even further into super toxic territory, suicidal- threatening to throw things, talking to me like I’m his enemy and that everything I’m doing is to hurt him. 
The reoccurring theme regardless of if I handle it well or not is like his headspace completely changes, a sort of ‘aha I knew you were using me all along!’ ‘this is proof that you are secretly manipulating me!’ and that justifying this deep horrible narrative to himself as the argument progresses. Kind of like he suddenly identifies me as one of his abusers and he’s talking to me like he would have stood up to one of them. 
And then it gets stuck and neither of us can make it stop? 
I sincerely don’t believe it’s.. intentional in the larger scale of things. 
I don’t have the energy to make excuses for someone, I don’t believe he’s just trying to cover something up or feels entitled to act in abusive ways. I do believe that he’s equally panicked about this stuff happening. 

We talk about it as much as we can stand to, and my conclusion from what he’s said and what I’ve seen is that it starts kind of like a panic attack. 
Something I say or do scares him or reminds him of something one of his abusers did. He then panics and acts on the emotion blindly and starts interrogating or arguing, trying to prove his conclusion right so he can take defensive actions to boot me (an abuser!) out of his life. And/or, it gives me an opportunity to try to clarify and give him evidence that of course it wasn’t an attack or a real threat....Idealistically. 
The problem is, when this gets set off (when he gets triggered?), his emotional state is so strong that the narrative just keeps circling over and over, and I’m not able to talk him down because he doesn’t seem rational enough to accept the information. Like, the very existence of his pain acts as a contradiction in his mind, like, ‘if she wasn’t evil, I wouldn’t be in pain’ and everything I say gets filtered through that absolute insanity. If my emotions escalate (rightfully!), his stay bad or get worse (more ammunition for his fear), and he yells a lot which is super triggering for me so it’s very unnerving, as if it happening wasn’t bad enough. 

The worst part is, I can’t back away or take a break to let him cool down and return to it later. I’ve tried in a huge variety of ways. Triggered-him seems to take it as a huge middle finger no matter how it’s done. Or the disengage is like me giving up on him, then.. fear of me leaving him and him being homeless gets filtered into anger. So trying to disengage forcefully re-triggers if it was calming down, or makes it even worse. 
The best I can do is try to get him to a sane stopping point or to a point where he himself will disengage. 

A piece of the reason I have this whole interpretation is.. frequently, after or between these outbursts, we talk about the same subject and we are completely on the same page and he apologizes. He understands my feelings, my overwhelm, or he even agrees with me on whatever subject triggered the outburst or argument, which was the very thing he was completely disagreeing with moments earlier while he was triggered. 
(Ironically, sometimes trying to have a conversation triggers him again. fucking hell. But normally we can talk about it, and he clarifies and I find there was no real issue)

As I said, it’s like he’s locked on to me as his enemy once he’s triggered, and to admit defeat would be to die or something. (To be fair, his dad literally shot him when he was young to try to kill him for being gay. I mean....... there’s a lot)
While he’s triggered, he seems to authentically be in fear of his life and it’s coming through like a fucking cat hissing trying to bite my hand off. And I’m just trying not to panic or get angry at the wild things being said because I know it won’t help. But I simultaneously have no idea how to defuse the situation. 
Most of the time the only solution has just been waiting for him to run out of gas. 

He tells me it’s like he gets hit with a tsunami of adrenaline and panic. Sometimes if it calms down faster than expected and he catches it a little better, there have been times where he literally is like ‘oh no did I yell I didn’t yell this time did I? I don’t think I did right? I was trying really hard to not let it overwhelm me’ 
I went to therapy with him once (before quarantine) (he has a male therapist), they were talking and he got triggered and the same cycle happened out of the blue, he was extremely abruptly panicked and accusing and yelling- even though all interactions with that therapist have been really positive and the therapist is really calm. And the therapist waited it out and when my bf calmed down he was severely embarrassed and confused and apologetic. Between that and the rest I’ve seen I’m not worried about it being some gross abusive power-trip and just him faking wanting to get better to leech off me or something. I know a lot of people in that situation basically get brainwashed to blame themselves. I truly don’t think any of this is intentional or rooted in manipulation. 

But it’s not sustainable. His triggers are -everywhere-. It’s a nightmare. I try to not set him off from what I know about him, but we both know it’s impossible and not fair to me. 

The other option besides waiting it out that usually works (discovered in the past few months) is this: 
Giving him a hug (not intuitive when someone is yelling, like damn) and reminding him who I am, just listing the things he should know- that I’m not using him, that I wouldn’t ever intentionally cause him harm, etc etc. 
Usually, he stops talking and within a few minutes his adrenaline lowers and it’s like he suddenly processes the stuff as himself and then he asks sane questions and I clarify and he actually believes me, he realizes he was being completely out of his mind and illogical. 
In contrast, while it’s happening and he’s still triggered (escalated?) he is -completely convinced- of his conclusions and feeling justified in the pain and anger, and I feel completely helpless in the face of that kind of brick wall. 
When I’m unlucky, even after the hug/talking, he can get re-triggered because something that happens during our calmer conversation, or me trying to bring it up later to get my own closure. 

The problem with that solution is..... ... feels bad..
Like imagine someone treating you horribly or debating against something that makes no sense and acting like you are evil and then the thing to solve it, to reset the emotional state, is to hug the person. 
No amount of understanding or self-talk or context can override the fact that, at my core, I feel like it has the psychological effect on me of... like, via my body, I’m co-signing that I deserve to be treated poorly. It’s like forcing yourself to get really good at overriding the instinct that prevents you from jumping off cliffs. It’s probably not a good instinct to unlearn, because it keeps you alive.
If I can stomach going against my own internal pain and anger, I do this method. But it doesn’t feel like a safe defusing method for my long-term well-being.
Also, it gives me concerns re: the concept of enabling. I’m a little worried that if I do that method, he will rely on me to defuse the situation and won’t find a way to do it himself. At the very least rewarding that behavior with affection doesn’t bode well, even if it’s something he isn’t doing on purpose. 

The more static information is this:
I’m not willing to leave him, at the very least at this point in time. It would weigh too much on my conscience and I do love him and want to see if there is any chance of getting through this. At the very least I’m waiting until he has his disability income, and if that gets rejected again or absurdly delayed I’ll cross that bridge then. But in theory, in a chunk of time he will know if it’s rejected or approved, and at that point he will have some sort of income or be working on another way to survive if the gov completely fails us. At which point I will be more confident in establishing from his behavior/progress if this is a temporary problem or a ‘fuck this I’m out’ sort of martyring situation that I won’t put myself through. 

That decision means, I’m stuck being exposed to this for a chunk of time longer minimum- and I’m writing this hoping for even slivers of helpful information or kindness because I’m trying to stay sane and alive through this and every bit of comfort or tactics/anecdotes/guidance probably helps. I’m a bit sensitive because, a lot of pain and sadness in me right now, so be gentle with advice I guess. Personal experience and anecdotes tends to be really helpful, especially someone who experiences this sort of trauma/panic response and if you’ve found any ways to snap out of it or if your partner has found a way to help you and balance the emotional drain it has on the relationship. Maybe people with chronic pain or who are disabled might also have some insight for me, maybe especially if you relate to the feelings of helplessness he’s experiencing. 

My impression is that the vast majority of his behavior is basically a panic attack and completely irrational reactivity and situational spouting of fears, but I suspect that he may unintentionally have some toxic expectations and is or risks becoming severely codependent on me because I’m someone who actually gives a shit. I feel like there are tones of severe hopelessness and self-pity and sometimes a narrative of him needing more help than me and being more broken. This is a very hard time and he has a really big financial trigger on his shoulders constantly- but he has done a good job surviving even with his illness so I know he can support himself to some degree. I do want to love and support him but I am one person, and I don’t want to foster a default dynamic that encourages him to flip out when I won’t go to the store to pick something up for him because I’m too tired. As I said, most of it is irrational, but I do feel like some of it risks being our dynamic as a result of me trying to cope with his outbursts. 
When he’s in a lot of emotional pain, it’s very hard to know where to be empathetic and where to be like ‘suck it up and deal with your disappointment I am not a robot leave me alone please’. I don’t feel like it’s smart to do that when he’s triggered/escalated, but I need help knowing what boundaries to be firm with even if rational-him is scared by it or disappointed. 
It’s super hard for me to confidently draw the line of boundaries when I have irrational-him periodically rolling the dice and choosing a hill to die on via a 3 hour argument, and then frequently even if he doesn’t get triggered I have rational him feeling helpless and disappointed and scared sometimes because he is in incredible physical pain and can’t go to the store but I say no to going for him because the dishes and laundry and whichever horrible interaction we had last leaves me exhausted, and the thing he asked for isn’t an emergency but something that would cheer him up. It’s hard saying no to someone knowing me saying no takes away their option because they are sick. 
This stuff is so complex and painful for me which is where validation would be nice because I’m still battling feeling like I have to say yes to everything he asks for because I’m not in incredible pain or am physically capable of doing it. 


Yeah... I’m literally writing this while it’s happening because I can’t do this alone anymore and writing this is the best I can think to do. I’ve been able to maintain my income but my heavier work begins soon as things ‘open’ more from quarantine and I’m terrified I’m going to crash and burn because I’m barely surviving without a heavy workload eating my energy. 

The anger-trigger today that is still ongoing now was me waking up a bit late and asking him if he would go downstairs and put the mail out to be delivered. 
I was tired and realized that he was probably dressed and might catch the mailman before the mail comes faster than I would. The mail being sent is an important document with a deadline, related to his disability income process. 
I had sent it as a text as to not interrupt whatever he was doing, he came into the room to clarify my request, I felt his tone getting weird and him getting triggered, and he started raising his voice and saying how dare I be so thoughtless and ask that, he’s agoraphobic, how could I put him in that situation, why would I make him do something that I can do when I know it causes him intense emotional distress, etc etc etc.
Because he was triggered, no amount of explaining helped, I said I was scared it wouldn’t get mailed in time so it seemed urgent so I felt like I should check to see if he was willing because he was already dressed- that no was a perfectly acceptable answer- that yes I know he has agoraphobia but there are some days he can manage to go to the store, so I thought it was important to ask since it’s important paperwork, again, that no is a perfectly ok answer... etc etc... but him escalated, it followed the usual pattern of him/his adrenaline causing him fixating on the perceived ‘offense’ (someone who loves me wouldn’t ask me to do something like that, she knows that causes me harm so her asking means she’s wishing me harm). And just... total complete wall of irrational dialogue (in my opinion, I just mean... it doesn’t seem fair or right to have that expectation or react that intensely with no benefit of the doubt, so I think it’s irrational). 

He’s currently burned out of the anger but it hasn’t really stopped yet, it turned into more an angry-retreat and irrational him is currently in the bedroom in bed maybe, for a couple hours, and it’s my impression with his current headspace that he’s going to believe I’ve left him in there and abandoned him and that’s a reflection of me not caring/refusing to face the problem (both him and me know that’s absurd. But that’s the problem. When he’s like this, he doesn’t, not until it ends). 
My current situation probably won’t end well for me, because I could go in there and try the hug method but because it’s been a lot of hours it will take longer for him to believe me and not be convinced it’s some elaborate trap (I want to laugh but it’s also so awful and sad). Or he’ll come out here as I’m posting this and I’ll be in for a new burst of anger because he’ll be stewing on me not coming in as being more evidence of the validity of the fears that started this mess to begin with. 

All I can say is, anything that might help me redirect this in a better way or make these outbursts more possible for me to survive is nice, because this is my life right now. 
Even if I can’t make it stop, maybe something will help me cut it short. Or maybe something someone says will help me retain some boundaries during it, or make me feel validated and less at risk of blaming myself somehow. 

Even if I don’t get advice, I feel glad I finally wrote this down and at least I’m not alone right now because someone else is surely reading it.

277,"Hi Reddit. This is a hard post for me to write.

I have to use discretion with the information I give, but I will try my best to be descriptive while keeping anonymity. 

This evening, I was working on a joint computer both my significant other and I use. He uses it most often, so it is therefore connected to his Apple account. In other words, it receives messages, and has many of the same apps on the desktop as his phone does. 

While working, my husband was receiving messages — nothing out of the normal. I went into his messages app to text myself something funny that he would catch later, when I saw texts from an unknown number.

Disclaimer: Before I go on, I will say this — I had a lapse of judgement in this moment that is not characteristic of me or our relationship. However, there have been things happening lately that have worried me, and had a lapse of trust. 

Lately, my husband has been really weird about his phone. He constantly angles the screen away from me, will take it out of the room with him when he is only leaving for a second and coming back, and will even move it to the opposite side of the couch where I can’t see it when I sit down. It is something I had noticed for awhile, but never really thought too much of, because it IS his property and I don’t need access to his phone, nor have I ever asked for it. It was weird, but not biggie.

Then, about a month ago, I grabbed his phone while with him just to do something stupid and he flipped the hell out. Like, an anxious mess “give that back now” freak out that is very uncharacteristic of him. I became angry and scared, because the behavior made me think he was hiding something from me. We talked it out and he swore there was nothing to hide. I believed him and moved on.

Anyway, I ended up clicking on the unknown number and saw flirty messages that had been going on for about a month with the unsaved number. Things among the lines of, “Hey Babe!! I miss you (with heart emojis)”, general normal conversations, but with a obvious flirty over tone (a lot of language like “sexy” and kissy-face emojis, even when they aren’t talking about anything particularly over the top). And conversations about animal crossing (a game my husband has been obsessed with — side note: it is a wonderful game). Which at first seems unnoticeable, until I suddenly remembered that he downloaded an app strictly for having conversations with his friend from work (who I’ve never met) about animal crossing, and got defensive when I asked him about it (truly for no other reason than general curiosity at the time). Whenever he is on the app, he continuously shifts his screen away from me. This app is one of the few that he has on his phone but not on the computer.



I know this is nothing definite, and I could be freaking out for nothing. I feel guilty and disappointed in myself for looking at his messages beyond my original intention. I have NEVER done this before. There has just been so much underlying worry building for awhile and I caved, but I am also angry and scared at what I found. 

Should I be worried about this? What can I do?",23Jun2020,1
278,"TLDR at the bottom!! 

so, the title sounds bad. and I guess it is. but basically if I like someone, platonically or otherwise, i dont know how to express it besides just being a dick. but like, a caring dick.  most recent example was that I was trying to tell my boyfriend that he should get water because he never drinks enough and hes really dehydrated all the time, but for some reason the only way my brain could figure out to word it was to call him a ""dry ass little lad"". and I swear half of the stuff that I say to my friends is telling them I hate them or that i wanna kill them. i don't hate them!! i dont wanna kill them!! my boyfriend is dry and small but i dont wanna be mean about it lol!! 

i know the most obvious answer is just... dont say mean things. but i try! i really do! but i just say things before i even think about it, like I dont even compute that calling my friend a smelly bitch is not nice until I've already said it. I try super hard to be nice or even just be not specifically mean but I just dont even realize it's happening and when I try to fix it it's usually either still mean or awkward or both. ive been like this since I was probably 12 (I'm 21 now) and it never changed because my best friend is the same way, and I was very asocial so I just wasnt around anyone else. also, I have made sure my friends know that I say these things to show affection and nobody has ever said that I hurt their feelings, but I kinda just... dont wanna be that one mean guy. 

sorry this is long winded, I'm frustrated and not very efficient with words lol.


TLDR: I express affection and care by calling my friends names and I dont wanna be a jerk anymore, pls help.

284,"We only dated for a bit over 4 months and honestly they were the best months of my entire life. It felt surreal to have someone to talk to. Someone to love and and count on to be there whenever problems came up. She never has told me much of her past but it seems to be pretty traumatic from the tiny bits of info she’s given me. Prior to this I had never in my life known what it felt like to be in “love” with someone and I became so obsessed with it and felt like I couldn’t live without it. 
We haven’t seen each other in a bit because of the pandemic and she hinted to me a few weeks ago she was starting to feel down. Today she texted me and said that she just wanted to go back to being friends because she thought it was better like that. She told me she wanted to be alone and she thought it was the right thing to break up with me after she thought about it for some time. She told me she was going to go to therapy so i assume she’s going trough some things that are pretty deep. I never got to know what it was. 
She seemed to get over me way too fast and seems to want to avoid talking about our relationship at all and it makes me feel bad.

286,"So here’s the story. I have a girl I became best friends with in kindergarten. We have been friends ever since then. As we grew up, we grew apart, but I never considered her any less of a friend. We would hardly ever talk, but when we did we would pick up right where we left off. Her and I always talked about being each other’s bridesmaids when we got married. 

Fast forward to now, she’s engaged. A few months ago she started picking her bridesmaids. She didn’t ask me to be one. Instead, she asked her sorority sisters and people she’s known for a couple of years. This hit me hard. I was very upset and felt betrayed. I would’ve never hesitated for a second to let her be a bridesmaid in my wedding. 

At this point, I decided it was time to cut her off. I pretty much made up my mind that I wasn’t even going to come to her wedding. It’s a slap in the face after all. Embarrassing even. Tonight she texted me basically asking if I was gonna come to her wedding and now I’m kinda hit with the reality. I wasn’t expecting to have to confront her about it.

289,"I'll try not to make this long. I've had a crush on this girl for a while. We met through this app, things went extremely well for two weeks until she went MIA on me. I was hurt because we had plans and what not. Months later she came back and said life was too much and she was sorry. I accepted, but weeks after she went MIA again. We talked again and same thing. I kept thinking what am I doing wrong? This girl was great and maybe it's me. I'm thinking I was too much or something? I follow her on social media and she follows me back. I'll see that time to time she'll view my posts right away and sometimes even repost them even when I post late night. I was told by my friend either one of two things; she wants to talk to me, but doesn't want me to get hurt or doesn't want herself to get her. 

Should I message her randomly late night asking how things are going and try to talk to her again and this time be blunt and upfront or just forget about her and move forward? 

Even if I message her, I wouldn't know what to say. I was thinking, ""Hey, it's been a while. How are things going with you? I miss talking to you and want to catch up."" I'm trying to be forward and blunt, but this is tough lol

When I first saw the story, my intuition was to ask him if he was doing okay without reading the reading the story... So I did so. I texted him, and a few hours have passed with no response from him.

292,"(18F) I’m currently living w my sister and have been for a few months just to get away from home. My parents got divorced two years ago and I was the one stuck at home while my sister was off at college so I had to deal w my parents by myself since the divorce. My dad is the only stable parent I have. He’s moving states away and I’m not going bf I don’t want to leave my friends, job, school, etc. I moved out of my moms into his bc my mom wasn’t being the mom I needed her to be (ik I’m an adult but she hasn’t been a mom since i was rlly young). I lived w her bc I knew I would be able to do whatever I wanted and she wouldn’t care. After a few years her emotional baggage is really starting to take a toll on my mental health. I’m the one having to parent her and act like the mother. I was on probation and she had illegal drugs in our house and didn’t tell me about it even tho of my PO did a house drop in I would be the one in jail but she didn’t think ahr that. I’ve talked to her abt wanting to stop vaping (she vapes and sometimes supplies me w it) and complained abt how I couldn’t breathe and it was hard trying to quit when she was doing it right in front of me and would give the excuse “I’m an adult I can do what I want”. She would give men she met online our address after I told her COUNTLESS times not to for obvious reasons. She didn’t think abt it that man would’ve been a pedo he knew where we lived and could’ve came by when she wasn’t home and something would’ve happened to me. She plays victim and makes everyone feel bad for her and doesn’t ever take responsibility for her actions.

My mom is sweet and I love her to death but I cannot deal w her anymore bc it’s starting to affect me. My sister and I are her only source of happiness and identity and it puts a lot of weight on my shoulders. It’s hard seeing her passed out drunk on the couch every night like she did when I was a kid (her drinking was the reason for the divorce). 

I have an option to move in w my cousin (30F) and her 5 kids (ages 1-10). I’m not very close with her and I feel like it would just be awkward. I feel like it’s really the best option for my mental health, but I would feel kind of awkward in her house. She lived w my family when she was pregnant w her first child so she is more than welcoming me into her home. I just feel like i would be a burden and not know how to be a part of the family. 

I’m an adult so I don’t really have to ask her permission to do anything, she would just want me to be a good role model for her daughters (which I love the kids to death). I just feel like I wouldn’t be able to play my music out loud I would be too shy, do my hobbies like guitar, and idk. I just feel like it would be awkward. I love the girls so much and I would be more than happy to help w their school, rides to wherever or anything they needed and her husband doesn’t help much so she could use the help. I just feel like it would be so awkward. 

I know my cousins sounds like the best option. Any tips or advice ? I’m struggling to make a decision. either risk my mental health to have freedom at my moms or be better off at my cousins but feel awkward there.",23Jun2020,1
293,"Struggling with my past relationship I was 20 she was 16.

So I live in the UK where the age of consent is 16. I was 20 and she was 16 we went out for 4 years.. things were like any other relationship. She was close with my family and things were generally pretty good together. We argued a lot though but majority of the time we were loving and caring. I remember being hesitant about her age in the past and always feeling bad and shameful about myself as I know she was a lot younger than me. She supported me in these situations as our age gap really made me question myself out of anxiety. Id heard the term cradle snatcher and couldn’t help feel that I was one for dating this girl at such a time. Anyways We had indifferences and long story short I decided to end the relationship. I was 24 she’s now 20, and our breakup was generally swift and we both agreed it was for the best. A few months down the line, I feel like she started taking it really hard. I happened to see her liking posts on twitter about how if a 20+ year old gets with a 16 year old then they are a pedophile. I felt sick to my stomach and I’m not sure how to deal with it. I was young in the head at 20 and very naive so to see my ex supporting this “he’s a pedophile” narrative I feel rotten to the core. I don’t know what to do but the thought of being branded a pedophile for a long term relationship haunts me so much. I cried often about the age differences as it made me feel self conscious.. always hearing people say people that date 16 year olds  are creepy.. I can see there point because when I was younger I would say the same about older guys dating younger women but fast forward and I’m in that position. 

I thought about approaching her about it as I screen shotted it on Twitter as it showed she liked it on my feed. I have the urge to contact and ask her if she thinks of me and our relationship in that light.. should I ask her this or pretend nothing happened? It hurts more that she is friends with my friends and they will see that she’s liking stuff like that on Twitter after having a 4 year romantic relationship with me. Iv never felt so insecure and trapped. 

I need advice? I’m sick of feeling like a scumbag and this depression, guilt and anxiety making life not worth living😞",23Jun2020,1
295,"I just moved all the way to another state 7 hours away from home to be with and live with my boyfriend. In my last serious relationship, we constantly discussed our dream wedding and how many kids we’d have. I got it so ingrained in my brain that I’d have my dream wedding and kids. 

I guess it just never came up in conversation with my current boyfriend, and since we’ve only been together for 7 months, unlike my ex who I was with for years, I guess I never felt the need to bring up marriage or kids since I felt it was too soon to discuss those things. I guess I was naive and assumed he’d want those things. Every boyfriend I’ve ever dated wanted those things, so it didn’t even cross my mind that I’d be dating someone who didn’t want those things at all. 

I find out today that he doesn’t believe in marriage and has no desire to have kids. I don’t know what to do. I just moved to another state to be with him. I can’t go live back at home with my toxic family, and I can’t afford at the moment to live on my own, as I’ve already lost so much of my savings paying rent and bills and still haven’t heard back yet from any jobs. 

I have been through so much hardship these past few years and I thought I was finally getting my happy ending, I love him and I don’t want to have to end up leaving him, because we have different ideas for the future. 

How do I approach talking to him about it? It’s so hard for me to talk about these things. Today  all I did was mention that I was kind of bummed about how he felt, because I always pictured marriage and kids. He broke down in tears and said he’d never want me to leave him over it and that maybe he’d consider those things. 

I obviously don’t want to make him feel forced to do anything, just so that I will not leave him. I’ve never been that type of person.

However, how can I approach talking with him about this? Him and I didn’t really talk much about it, I’m not sure how to talk with him about it. How to approach the situation without getting emotional or awkward. Is it worth trying to work things out?",23Jun2020,1

I have barely any money, my husband is working and not making much either, we have Bills late due to his less hours at work now and I am really desperate to find a way to actually make money on my own time, from home, somehow.

297,"I have always been into thrifting so I learned to tell a real from fake and yesterday I found a designer bag which would have been 2000-3000 dollars retail for 15$. I bought the bag and put it in my closet then went to sleep when I woke up the bag was gone, when I asked my mom about it she said she took it because its 'too expensive for a 15 year old'. I was not planning on wearing it but instead selling it as I do with almost everything I thrift. My mother knows about this and has previously said that it was ok as long as I put 10% of profits in savings. I demanded she give it back since I had paid for it with my own money and she lay no claim to it (I have a babysitting job). But she kept saying I was too young.later that day she went out and flaunted her brand new designer bag to her friends. When she came back I got really mad at her and my father had to step in and intervene.

298,"Let’s start from the beginning. March of 2019 i moved in with my boyfriend of 4 years, everything was wonderful until in October of 2019 my mom passed away leaving my 80 year old grandparents alone in their house. my boyfriend and I’s relationship rapidly deteriorated and it’s mostly my fault because I went crazy psycho after my mom passed, i never got to say goodbye to her and it fucked my head up. i began pushing him away and none of my family checked on me, i was crazy, with very erratic behavior not knowing how to cope. when our lease ended in march 2020 we decided to be friends and i would move in with my grandparents to take care of them and continue working full time and going to nursing school. 

my (ex) boyfriend and I continued hooking up and right after having unprotected sex i found out at the beginning of June he had been lying to me for two months about sleeping with someone else (just one time but it broke my heart completely). During the time apart he still made me feel like we had a chance of being together and finding out he slept with someone else while sleeping with me hurt. He was an amazing boyfriend for the almost 5 years we were together but this ONE instance of lying is killing me, it hurts that someone you’re so in love with could sleep with someone else 2 weeks after ending things and knowing what i was going through mentally. and now ill always have this hurt and resentment attached to the ending of what i thought was a wonderful relationship. 

Im having possible implantation bleeding and cramping and my period is not due for another week and a half. i’m taking a test tomorrow. 

if the test is positive i have no idea what i’ll do, if i would keep the baby and try and continue nursing school, or get an abortion. i pray i am not pregnant so i don’t have to put myself through this situation. :(

301,My only brother is getting married in December and it's not a small wedding it's a huge 250 person affair. Now aside from the obvious to everyone but my brother this wedding might not go as planned because of the  pandemic. Which he is pretending isn't happening but that's another post. Anyway my sisters and I were all asked to be in the wedding which we agreed to the trouble comes in when the requests became outlandish at least to me. To fly to Nashville (we live in PA) I want to say the bride  was fine with us not going due to the cost especially since we agreed to chip in for her accommodations. My brother was furious at my other sisters I got off because me and my longtime boyfriend are planning to buy a house but my sister one of whom just spent 2k on surgery and are splitting the 2k rehearsal dinner declined. He yelled at my sister until she cried the day after her surgery. No matter what we do it isn't enough we are constantly accused of not liking her. We all do but we don't know her well they were together less than a year before he proposed and the wedding was planned in less than 3 months. Then he made my sister cry on her birthday. I don't understand him I was so close to telling him to eff off that me and my partner were out if he wants me at the wedding fine but that I don't want to be in the wedding. I decided to suck it up and buy the dress this week with my sisters. I want to say I love my future sister in law. However I have no idea how to cope with my brother's  increasingly ridiculous selfish and demanding behavior. I've talked to my therapist but he wants me to talk to my brother which isn't really an option when someone just immediately  goes on defense. Has anyone had any experience like this?

307,"Short version: my coworker sexually assaulted me, now I'm asking him to find a new job and quit this one instead of me reporting what he did. Hes agreed, but it telling me being unreasonable. 
Long version: after my breakup with my ex this coworker (j) started flirting with me. He and I were talking, spending time together, generally getting to know each other for about 4 weeks. Another coworker told me that she and j use to date, and even live together. J lied to me about this and a plethora of other fairly important things. I told him I no longer want anything to do with him. Prior to me finding out about him lying I booked us a hotel room about an hour away just so we could get away for a night. I planned on using the room by myself. I got VERY drunk, and J had been non stop texting me asking if he could just come over too, how he wouldn't try anything, we'd each have our own bed etc. Stupid drunk me agreed and let him come him over. After I passed out he got in my bed and started groping me. I started crying, hyperventilating, begging him not to touch me. I pinned me down and left bruises on my arms and legs. He continued to grope me and grind on me despite my crying and begging. He grabbed my face and forced me to kiss him. I eventually passed out and he continued to just hold me down. I woke up with him fingering me, he said I wanted it because I was wet.. I started panicking and scrambling to get away from him but he kept holding me and grabbing me. I eventually scratched him then locked myself in the bathroom and cried.. when I came out I went to the empty bed and went to sleep. He left me alone after that. His excuse is that he was high on xanax, so he didnt know what he was doing. At this point I've asked him to find another job and not to contact me unless it's about the $235 he owes me. He said he will, but he says I'm also being unreasonable.

They are continuously bashing her. For the smallest of the things. I have reliased from what she has told me that the main problem is communication, stubbornness and anger management. 

Her parents seem to take their anger out on her for absolute no reason. They never listen to her despite her telling them about how she feels. She is always the one who is listening to them. 

And when her parents tell her to do something, she does it and then later go against that decision which causes them to yell at her. There are more instances which suggest they are controlling such as not letting her choose her own career path.

314,"Hi everyone I’m a 23F, and have been dating my boyfriend (24M) for a year and a half now. Last August we moved into a place together with three of our friends (5 in total). Everything started off really great! People took care of the house, not a lot of messy issues or anything too major. But, since COVID hit the place has turned into a pig sty. Like, we have mice and fruit flies now due to the lack of care and cleaning. The problem seems to be my boyfriend, my other roommate (J) and their two friends that constantly come-over and chill. The kitchen is disgusting because nobody cleans their dishes, beer cans are left out all over the place, and garbages/recycling is constantly overflowing due to all the drinking. My other roommates and I have tried to talk about the mess in our home group chat. First it was the occasional “hey everyone please do your dishes” message but now things are getting heated because nothing is changing. The other week I had to clean up a mountain of piled beer cans that had gathered in the kitchen corner that had spilled and garnered a large amount of fruit flies because people refused to bring the recycling in from the curb. I was upset because I have made myself in charge of cleaning all the bathrooms once a week (which I’m completely okay with), I take sole responsibility of keeping our room tidy (dusted, vacuumed, laundry, and room garbage) , I take the garbage and recycling to the depot when people forget to put it out, I vacuum the house weekly, I can count on one hand the amount of times I’ve left a dish out in the last year and a half, and have cleaned up other people’s multiple kitchen messes after they have sat for too long. I’m not perfect, and do fuck up every once in a while but I usually clean up my mess immediately if someone points it out to me in the chat.   I will admit I exploded in the group chat after cleaning the mountain of cans but I really don’t think I’m being that unreasonable... My boyfriend however does not seem to think a dirty house is a problem because it “doesn’t effect him emotionally” after I told him it makes me stressed and resentful having to clean up other people’s messes or seeing the house so filthy. He told me I should just “move out” if it bothered me that much instead of us actually trying to work out a solution. I just see no reason for the house to be this dirty... three of my roommates (my boyfriend included) are on CERB so they only work 1-3 days a week. I myself work 4-5 days a week as a server and often past midnight. I’m rly tired of having to clean on my days off... Am I being unreasonable? What should I do so he doesn’t feel like I’m attacking him? Should I just cut my losses and find a different place? 

TLDR; boyfriend, roommate and their friends party every other night and leave out garbage, cans and dishes resulting in mice and fruit flies. Told my boyfriend it stressed me out living in a dirty house and  was pretty much dismissed... What should I do?",23Jun2020,1
315,"The title is pretty self-explanatory. My instructor is good, however he is extremely perfectionistic. He questions my actions all the time (even if I‘m not doing anything wrong, just as a trick question) and makes me explain myself. This may be educational, however it‘s extremely disruptive when I‘m trying to concentrate and it makes me second guess everything I do. Maybe it’s also because I have OCD and I’m already obsessed with doing everything perfectly, or else I become very unstable. As a result, I‘m horribly insecure about my driving and I feel like I‘m an extremely dangerous driver. I can‘t calm down behind the wheel at all and therefore I already failed my exam once. I cry after every lesson, feeling like a lost cause and a failiure.
I already talked to him about it (without mentioning the „bad“ details obviously) but nothing has changed. I would love to just quit but my parents already spent so much money on the lessons and it would make them feel like it was for „no reason“. Changing the instructor would maybe be an option, I kind of fear how my current one would react though, knowing he already made it „this far“ with me.

316,"(sorry this is really long, but any advice is appreciated a lot!)

I've been on 4 dates with this guy. The first time we only talked then after the date, he messaged me saying how he wanted to kiss me so badly so on the 2nd date he asked if he could kiss me and we did. Throughout the entire time he would keep asking if I was ok. He'd hold my hand, kiss my forehead, cheek and asked if I was ok with tongue. He groped my butt and I told him to not touch me there so he said ok. Later, he groped my boob and I shove his hand away, but eventually he tries to reach into my bra to pinch my boob. I flung his hand off. We talked for the first half hour of the 2nd date then basically made out for around 2-3 hrs. I think I was just in shock and just let him continue kissing me cuz I didn't know what to do. It was also my first kiss so I was surprised he even tried to touch me. I asked him b4 if he usually moves this fast and he said no not even close and that he's even surprised at himself. He told me if it's too fast to let him know cuz he doesn't wanna make me feel uncomfortable. Ik in his previous relationships he never asked will u be my gf or will u go out w me so I asked how he knew he was in a relationship and he said it was cuz they kissed and held hands. I asked him what his intentions were after the 2nd date and he said he wanted to continue going on dates. Then after the 2nd date I asked if we could hold off on making out sm and get to know each other better first. He said ofc and the 3rd date was nice cuz we talked the whole time and only kissed for a few mins at the end. The 4th date, we got to know a lot more about each other cuz I wanted to ask some deeper questions. He would give shallow answers though, but he prob doesn't like talking about his feelings. I asked what some of his struggles were, but he just mentioned everything related to school so I asked how about emotionally/mentally and he just said him being indecisive. I know his family life isn't the greatest, but didn't want to ask too much about it yet. Also, I noticed he never really does any cute things that you'd do if you liked someone (small things such as holding the car door open, surprising u w food, putting a jacket on u, etc.) He's also never complimented me b4 or called me pretty. When I shared about my insecurities and about feeling ugly he said ur not and then after a bit he said I think you're super cute. That was on the 4th date and that was the first time I heard a compliment from him. On this date, we were making out and he started touching my thigh and then rubbing me down there. He also tried grabbing my boob and rubbing/kissing my nipple and I started crying cuz I didn't want to be touched. He also started rubbing his d\\\* against me down there cuz he was hard. When I started crying he kept saying sorry, held me in his arms and asked if I wanted to be sent home. He said he got too carried away. Then I decided to ask him what the diff is between dating and a relationship since I wanted to know his intentions and he wasn't saying much, but I kept asking then he said I don't think we've known each other long enough to be considered dating (which I think is valid, but idk if he just sees me as something to try to conquer over since he knows I don't want fwb and I don't want to have sex b4 marriage.) After I stopped crying we continued kissing again, but he some of these kisses were so aggressive. I would be like ouch and then he laughed it off and said oops was that too hard and said can you tell how much I want you? The more I kiss you the more I want you. I want you so bad. I asked him if he was seeing other pple and he said no he doesn't think he'd want to do this w more than one person and he asked if I was and I said no then he said good. He also told me b4 how he stopped fwb and that I don't have to worry. I'm confused because we message everyday and if he just wanted sex he prob wouldn't put in that much effort? Unless he's just tryna be nice to me to get me to have sex w him. He also constantly asks if I'm ok when we make out too. He knows I come from a Christian family too and he would genuinely ask me a bunch of questions about it on almost all the dates. I asked him if he was open to going to church too and he said yeah. I don't know if he's just trying to see how far he can push it w me because when we make out he asks is this a sin or I kinda let him push the boundaries then tell him no. But after this last date, I had enough and was like can we set some boundaries and he said sure and I told him no touching for now on and he agreed to that.  

Yesterday he asked how my day was so I asked if we could call, but he was on a call gaming w his friends. I asked him if he could lmk when we could call and he said sure, but he replied to my messages a few hrs later and never said we could call if ur still up. Then today I rbombed him and later he asked how my day was. I asked to call, but I was busy at the time so he told me just lmk when ur done then we can call. So after an hour I told him we can, but he didn’t reply till an hour later and said he sorry I was playing league. Let me just finish these games. Then said he his friends won’t let him leave. I said can’t u just leave after a game or a few and he said no his friends won’t let him. Then I asked if he could let me know when we could call another time. He said sounds good and that he didn’t want me to wait for him. He calls and games w his friends every night around 10-3am. He should be able to make some time for me. If he continues to keep seeing me and even tho we’ve only been on 4 dates and we don’t like each other yet, but r both — I’m assuming — r interested then shouldn’t he put in a bit more effort? Sometimes it seems like he cares and other times I know I’m not a priority, but what does he want? I don’t know what his intentions r or if he’s just seeing if this will go somewhere.",23Jun2020,1
317,"I have really bad depression and anxiety and a couple years ago, in college, I just stopped really feeling emotions. I've been reading up on emotional blockages and I'm 90% sure I have one, but can't really afford therapy.

In high school about once a month I would have an emotional breakdown with hyperventilating, sobbing and exhaustion. In college I had a roommate and I can't cry in front of people out of fear of being vulnerable. This probably sounds stupid but in my last year of college (before dropping out) I would sometimes almost cry, but because my roommate was in there I'd just hold it in, and it almost feels like I've clogged my emotion ducts or something. Lately I've been stressed out and depressed but it's hidden behind a dog of generalized anxiety and I just want to curl up and cry but me emotions just aren't there.

I know a lot of my issues come from my parents who are completely emotionally closed off. I've never been vulnerable to my parents and they've never been vulnerable to me so the thought that I'm ""allowed"" to share negative emotions with someone is alien to me.

It's kinda boiled over today because my roommate is very sad because her chicken is injured, and I want to comfort her but all I feel is anxiety. How can I help someone with their emotions if I can't even figure out my own???

Tl;dr: bottled up my emotions for so long that I can't feel them properly anymore. How do I get past emotional blockage?",23Jun2020,1
318,"Now that I’m older, I’m realizing my father probably wasn’t asleep when the older boys from the neighborhood would be dry humping me in my sleep. Also that normal fathers don’t take their daughter to a vacation home with a bunch of older boys and yell and scream at her not to tell the therapists the school forced her to see that he lets her sibling peep on her in the bathroom and that the kids he babysits touch her. 

When he dies and I move in with my mom she not only smirks, asks me “what I was wearing,” invites my abuser’s abuser (who triggers me because I grew up watching her abuse her grandkids who beat and molested me in turn) over regularly and asks me to hug her despite me telling her what’s going on 

Acts like nothing was ever wrong with my dad even though he hated her too and tells me I treat my (perv) sibling like shit (he kissed me on my neck until I was at least 17 or 18 and had enough)

321,"I live in a city of 60000, our city is still requiring us to to pay our water bill, parking tickets, get trash stickers etc. The problem is that our city hall building is still closed to the public due to the pandemic, meanwhile, other building such as the library, court house and other government buildings are open. We even have small businesses open and have for a few weeks now. 

The problem is that our city hall has not. They give us a mailbox with blank envelopes to fill out, and we are supposed to put them in the mail slot by the door. The doors are locked and have been since the pandemic news started. There's signs all over the doors stating that they are closed and if we have any problems to call this number that leads you through number pressing after number pressing. 

If you knock on the door, the office ladies just give you a dirty look and tell you to use the mailbox.

322,"
So some background info: I’m a sophomore in high school. (Going into my junior year) For privacy reasons, I am just going to call him Steve although that’s not his real name. Steve and I had the same friend group. Throughout our relationship, our friends remained friends with him but they would often tell me I needed to get out of the relationship because what was seen was bad enough. They told him many times when we all hung out that what he was doing wasn’t right. What they saw anyway. (Behind closed doors he was VERY abusive) Physical, emotional, sexual and mental abuse. I now have PTSD, and I am changing schools and also going to therapy. His friends checked in on me when we broke up and decided to cut contact with him, meaning they are no longer friends. One girl, who remains friends with him and who he also cheated on me with during the relationship (which I stayed btw) accused me of lying although I have texts of him calling me names and videos of him being extremely rough with me and friends who recall me calling them sobbing almost every night. According to the girl “He’s going through a rough time because a pretty white girl decided to lie and make him lose all his friends over false information.” None of the information is false. I have scars on my arms and legs from self harm from feeling trapped in that relationship. I am a very forgiving person although he has not apologized or asked for forgiveness. I have a big heart. But part of me is so happy that he lost all of his friends. He put me through hell and what I went through will effect me for the rest of my life. He deserves it, right? But part of me feels terrible because although it’s not my fault he lost his friends (his friends decided not to be friends with him anymore) what he did to me doesn’t define him, right? Or does it? Just like my scars and what I went through doesn’t define me, what he put me through doesn’t define him either right? (I would like to add that although it was not as severe, he was abusive to his ex girlfriend) She has helped me tremendously since we both went through the same thing (in a sense) and with the same person. I just don’t exactly know how to feel and I know it’s up to me to decide how I feel but I would just really appreciate some feedback and opinions. 
   Thank you so much if you took time to read this, I know it’s long.",23Jun2020,1
323,"I (27M) have a long time friend (30F) who has been struggling for the past 2 or 3 years, when her mother received her first cancer diagnosis.

Her mother means the world to her, they have always been very very close and lived together for 29 years (she could've moved out earlier but chose to stay).

&amp;#x200B;

Over the course of those 3 years, some relapse occurrences happened and she and her family sold most of their belongings to pay for the treatment. As a result my friend often finds herself struggling financially and her family is suffering just as much, emotionally and financially.

&amp;#x200B;

I helped on a few medication bills with what I could, though while it gave her some relief at the time it also seemed to hurt her.

I've known her for a long time and she is very strong, often takes upon herself to solve matters, goes back and forth to work and hospital and even with everything that happened she always cares for the people around her. 

On the other hand, opening up for help doesn't come too naturally to her: she can express what she feels and even ask for help but at the same time she also keeps her distance.  


She sometimes mentions suicidal thoughts and tells me how she feels, I offer to see her or call her but she always declines, most of my support is done through messages.

She often shows a strong presence and does everything to hide her pain or being seen when hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple hours ago I got a message from her that her mother's condition worsened significantly and was sent to the hospital.

I don't know what will happen, but regardless of that I wanna help her more, I just don't quite know how.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about taking her to professional help, but I'm not sure how to talk her into it given the situation;

I wanna keep giving her emotional support, listen and check on her, though I wish I could do it in some way other than messaging but I don't wanna push her either;

If her mother passes away, I don't know how to be there for her other than what I've been doing so far;

I don't know, maybe there is some other way of helping her that I am not aware too;

I also asked her ways to support her and she asked me to stay by her side basically.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you in advance.",23Jun2020,1

I assume that it’s just facial hair because my brother trims his beard hair all the time. 

I clean it up, bleach it down. Bleach the comb, put the hand towel in the hamper and put my face towel back. 

Well, fast forward to that night and I confront my brother about it. He says, he didn’t do it and points to his face and shows me he didn’t shave. He said it was my brush that dropped all of the hair. I just let it go. 

In hindsight, i dont know why i just believed him. My hair is curly and mid length, those hairs were pubic like (you see where this is going) and all over the place. 

Well, I begin my nightly routine and go to dry my face. I reach for my towel and begin to do so and by the time I’m half way done, the smell hits me. It smells like pure balls! It’s fucking disgusting. I throw the rag down and begin to exfoliate, re-wash, re-re-wash and douse hand sanitizer on my face. I re brush my teeth and everything! 

As I’m sitting here trying to calm the fuck down my brother’s words come back to me; “I have a date tonight!” ... no words. 

IM SO FUCKING LIVID. Not to be like that but I’m such a hypochondriac! Any sense of disease, sickness, dirt, etc and I completely shut down. Just to gauge — one time I thought I had a cold sore (it wasn’t. just a really bad bruise) and I prayed to God and promised that if he never let me get herpes I’d stay a virgin forever! 

Anyway, i really hate the idea that my brother’s penis and dirty balls that’s been who-knows-where came anywhere close to my face! 

I’m so fucking traumatized and I wanna cry! I told my mom about it and she said “That’s how boys are!” And that I should hide my stuff and I’m the one who’s in the wrong. And won’t punish him. I feel so violated it’s crazy! And the worst part is — I feel like I rubbed my brother’s balls on my face!

Recently we all have gotten pretty close to each other and I'm starting to get vibes that they both like me and I'm going to be open and talk to them ab it. I wouldnt mind dating one of them since we are close enough to where dating would destroy the relationship or so I thought. It then came to my attention that they both might actually like me (due to flirting and jealousy of me hanging with each of them) and I have no idea what to do if the situation comes around. It will tear the friendship of the other if I pick one which will hurt me pretty bad but it would be akward to pic both because I'm not into that kinda thing.

Fortunately he let me go, and didn't fire me, because I was able to collect my PTO that I accumulated, which was nice, also it wont look bad on my resume. I was also really unhappy there, so its kind of a blessing (but also sucks not working in general and making $$$) I was a full time street sweeper operator for about 3-4 of those years, then got EXP on some other trucks as well. That job was interesting to say the least. Anyway

SO, I'm trying to figure out what to do next. I'm considering going back to school and doing a 2yr program in waste water treatment. But, I don't know if its worth the investment, and time. I'm just having a really hard time trying to figure out my next move. I have my class B drivers license, so I could fall back on that if I had too. I could get my class A, that's what my dad is recommending to me, but ill be honest I know what those guys go threw and the sacrifices they make to there families. My dad drove for 20yrs and I see every day what that did to him physically ( it destroyed his hands) major arthritis, and all the nights gone from home, sounds shitty to me then plus all the shitty drivers on the road. OMG. 

I really don't know what to do. I guess its a good thing that I'm not married or have kids right now, because I would be screwed right in the ASS HOLE.

- I'm nowhere close to getting an internship (which would probably lead to full-time employment after I graduate) for my major (supply chain management) and I'm scared that I'll end up working my dead-end job for the rest of my life if I don't find one before I graduate.

- Another thing that ties to my first point is that I can't get over the fact that some of the people in my college got internships and are really making the most out of the summer and are set for success while I'm just working a basic job.

- There's a recession going on out there that God knows when it'll end and I really do need to save all the money that I can.

355,"Hey everyone, How are yall? I'm a 21y/o entering my 4th year of college. My freshman year I was a psychology major and due to my limited understanding of how loans work, and a ""suprise"" audit from my college I ended up very unprepared. As a result of my discouragement, (and no excuses, lack of discipline) I ended up getting horrible grades, and fearing that I wouldn't be able to return. I did though, and switched my major to biology with a psych minor, as I have no clue what I want to do with my life and I figured aim high, and if I miss I'll have a fall back. The cons to this switch are as follows: I really really don't like chemistry and I find biology very uninteresting, and I am now at least a year behind for my graduation. My grades are alright, but my freshman year has really dampened my GPA. I haven't done any internships, and my friends around me are all succeeding. I feel really displaced, and that I'm  wasting years of my life studying something I don't really care about while still not knowing what I do care about. I feel passionless, drained, undisciplined. I try to beat routine into myself, but I always come back to some real self-destructive habits (i.e procrastination, undereating, oversleeping). How do I get my life together enough to piece some idea of what I really enjoy, and what I really want to do? Please help, Ill take criticism, I just need help and I don't know who to go to. Thank you.",23Jun2020,1
356,"In 2015 I entered high school, right at the beginning of the year I saw a girl from a classroom who was before my class, it was like I fell in love instantly, I had never felt that before, but I am very shy and insecure with myself and time passed and passed and it was only after almost a whole semester that I took the courage to enter her room and call my classmate to tell him that the teacher was coming, luckily the group of people who he was talking to was the same group of friends as this girl and then he introduced me to the group, and so my friendship with them grew, to a level where I spent more time in their room than mine, and one day I took the courage to talk to the girl I was secretly in love with, she was sitting in the last chair with her head down over the table, so I asked if she was okay and she said no and that she wanted to being alone, I understood the message and I left her, as time went by I tried to talk to her and when it was getting close to the end of the year we were already best friends, as I said, I spent more time in her classroom than in my classroom, consequently I didn’t attend classes in my classroom and I repeated the year, while she had passed.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2016 I was doing my first year of high school again and she was in the second year, she started dating and I still hadn't told her about my feelings, but everyone knew that deep down I liked her, I was the guy that people pointed out and said that we made a great couple, the guy that people pointed out and said ""this guy likes her"", but the only thing I knew how to do was deny that feeling, afraid that if I open up to her, we would end up getting away from each other, and I liked her so much, that I still remember a thought I had at that time: ""I like her so much, that just being able to be close to her, of to be able to see her every day at school, I already feel like the happiest person in the world "", a while later something very important happened, I was playing on her cell phone and opened her conversations with her boyfriend on WhatsApp, I had a friend on the side and she started recording an audio saying that the girl who is u liked it was very tasty and i started saying similar things too, this audio should be canceled, but instead of dragging her finger to the side and stop recording, my friend took her finger off the screen and sent the audio, At that time, the function of deleting messages was just a dream, and her boyfriend listened to the audio. The other day at school the girl I liked was very upset with me and said she was done dating, she said she believed they were still going to date, but time passed and passed and they didn't date again, and even so I still hadn't said that I liked her. The end of the year was coming and again I spent more time in her classroom than in my own classroom, and I didn't pass the year again, and the school I was studying at the time if you didn't pass the year twice in a row you will be transferred to the night shift.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2017 doing the first year of high school for the third year and she in her last year but in the morning shift, I attended a quarter of classes and then asked to transfer to another school where I would study in the morning, and the time for my class it ended before my friend's class, so almost every day i went to visit her on leaving school, but for a few months i stopped going to visit her and when my birthday day in the third week of september i went to visit her and luckily I managed to see her, I still remember the hug she gave me today, it was the best hug of my life, I was so moved by that hug that I started to cry, and from that moment on things started to change, she asked me out on November 27, 2017 and on that day we had our first kiss, and then right after that she said: ""I think if I hadn't done it, you wouldn't have the courage to do it"", and fuck, she was right, iI would spend the rest of my life hiding that feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

In February 2018 we started dating and now I was sure I was the happiest person in the world, I was finally dating the person I always wanted to be with, and so the year went on, when at the end of the year the sister she discovers that she is pregnant and a little later she ends up losing the baby, and then things started to get complicated, all attention was focused on her, a while later in early 2019 her uncle passed away, and then the thoughts and her depressive behaviors started to intensify, and I ended up in the same situation, we stopped talking to us as often and then in the beginning of August, a few days before we completed a year and a half of dating, we ended the relationship, and from that time here i've been trying to forget her, i had some quick relationships during this mean time but nothing that really got me, in january this year i met a really nice girl and in february we started dating, we we did well but due to COVID-19 and the quarantine we stopped seeing each other and i went into a mild depression again, i went back to having anxiety attacks and i thought she didn't deserve it and last week we broke up.

&amp;#x200B;

Although all this time has passed and it is about to be a year since we broke up, I never managed to get that girl out of my head completely, and I constantly wonder if I should call her to talk, I miss her so much, i don't feel bad for losing a girlfriend, i feel bad for losing my best friend, i need advice to move on, what should i do? Call her to talk or try to move on with my life? And if so, how should I do this? I'm almost giving up on everything",23Jun2020,1
357,"Short summary of who I am on the surface:
I'm a 21y old guy who lives in western europe. I'm in my 4th year of university studying computer science, lagging behind one and a half years. I have a girlfriend since march and a decent ammount of friends. I'm build fairly well because of going to the gym.

My problem:
Live has felt like a drag ever since going to university. As a kid I was the best in my class, somewhere in highschool I lost drive and passion for being the best at school. My grades were still among the best even though I didn't study or work a lot. My first 2 years at uni were spend mostly in my dorm, I never attended classes, gamed and went out sometimes with friends from highschool. I'm still not sure if I never went outside because of loneliness, anxiety or addiction to my routine of doing nothing and sleeping. My grades sucked but I managed to pull through barely.
At year 3 I changed dorm, even though I finally made new friends there, I still didn't go to class. I fell into a depression and combated it with working out, partying and anti-deprisiva. I was obsessed with looks, thought working out would fix it, which it kinda did since I look way better now. 
I failed my year for the first time and told myself I would do better this year. I didn't...
The only 'accomplishment' this year is getting a gf. I sit around doing NOTHING (just browse the web) all day, sometimes I draw or go to the gym, but not enough anymore to maintain my muscle.

When I look at the prospects of my degree, I feel bored and sad. I really don't know what to do anymore. The days pass me by... All I want to do is have sex with a girl I'm not even sure I love. Soon my parents will stop supporting me and I'll have to provide my own money...

363,"Hi I'm a 14yr old female who is probably bi (maybe pan?)
And I was wondering if you guys have any idea how I can tell if someone is a member of the lgbt+ community 🥺👉👈. 

Like I just want to know if some body is gay, so I can know if I have a chance with them 😭. 

I know there are no tell tale signs but is there some things that are like common stereotypes that are kinda true!?",23Jun2020,1
364,"I know the title is kinda dumb but I really got no clue what to do. 

Post-writing note: Heads up I kinda vent and ramble so it's a long one.

I (20M) am the kind of guy who hates showing any emotion. It's not as bad as I make it sound though. I show happy, excited, and all those positive emotions that make me not appear as a robot, but when it comes to affection, sadness, irritation or whatever those get bottled up. It's probably cause of some trust issues that I know I have and have been working on, but you know easier said than done. I know that's not the best, but I do A LOT of meditation, personally introspection, and even keep a journal so that I don't get overwhelmed by these negative emotions. I like to think I'm a pretty emotionally healthy person as I have my own outlets for these feelings, but that's not what I'm here for. 

Now that I've needlessly defended myself, the details: 

I have never truly desired somebody. Sure I like people, everybody does, but never thought, ""Yeah, this is someone I absolutely want to spend a lot of my time with"". I have dated in the past, not much, but yes some. Honestly, I still to this day feel guilty about those relationships cause I knew they really did like me. I'm told I'm supposed to be pretty attractive, but at times I don't see other times I do. I only ever agreed to date them because I thought something would happen and I would develop reciprocating feelings but it never happened. Don't really know if this really matters but because I haven't felt for these girls I've never sex, much less ever kissed a girl, besides my gma. (Love ya Grams) All of these failed relationships have lead me to believe I'm asexual because I have never felt the physical desire for a person. I mean this might be tmi but, I don't even like to beat off or anything. The problem is when I think of her everything goes out of whack. My head goes a mile a minute and I feel so embarrassed. IT MAKES ME FEEL SO UNCOMFORTABLE!!! I know I'm getting worked up over something so small but I have LITERALLY NEVER felt this way over someone. I mean I've even thought about how I want to hug her. HUG HER!! For someone who HATES being touched by anyone or touching other people, even family. It's pretty serious to me at least. I just don't like not having control over my emotions like I'm used to. 

So here's where I really need the advice. Well, I could use the help on processing these feelings, but I really need help with is this: She's moving. She's transfering to a college two and a half hours away from the one I currently go to. She went to one that was just 20 minutes away previously so we saw each other plenty before, but I've never been in a successful relationship before, much less a long distance one. AND this is all operating on the basis that I can communicate my feelings to her. I really don't know how she feels about me, but I do feel somewhat confident about it. Again unsure. I know I could just ask my friends or family for advice, but I can't bring myself to do so. I'm afraid my friends will make fun of me even though I know they would just do so jokingly. But this is serious, to me, I don't want to made fun of even if it's just a joke. And my family? Don't get me started. My mom would tell all my aunts, all five of them, by the end of the hour and I hate her talking behind my back cause she NEVER gets the facts right and exaggerates like there's no tomorrow (Probably where those trust issues come from). So I guess I'm relying on strangers on the internet. 

I really appreciate it if you even just read this and would take any help at all, but it's 2am as I am writing this and I need to get some sleep so I'll have to read any responses in the morning. Cheers.",23Jun2020,1

366,"I've been talking to a person - they reached out to me at the beginning of my depressive episode.

I've been very very nice with them. I've complimented them. I've been patient.

I said I was hoping I can help them get better at social skills, so once they attend college, they can be ready. The problem is I'm too idealistic - so I didn’t think this through.

But I'm going through a depressive episode. I need to get my own life together - everything.

I have classes going on. I dug myself into a hole. If something messes up with them not reaching that goal, I'm going to be screwed. I'm scared. I'm really scared.

Problem is if someone helps me out - emotional support, I care for them like crazy. I'll do anything in my way - keep checking my phone ALL the time. I'm forgiving of their mistakes even if what they did is objectively wrong. I'm so damn scared. It's just I wanted to be there for someone bc I relate to them in that I hated that someone was not there for me before.

But I don’t know what to do now :(

They really care about me and really appreciate me. They've said they're glad they met me. They've said I'm nice, sweet, loyal, and genuine.

I feel like this huge weight/responsibility is going to drive me crazy and eventually hopeless. Worst thing is I opened up to them like crazy. I trust people wayy too easily if they give me emotional support online.

368,So I met this girl from work and slowly started catching feelings. I asked her out on a date but I told her to wait because of I was going through some issues. She agreed to wait but after that things started getting rocky. Her main argument is that I lie about my feelings and the girls I talk to. And my argument is that she always plays the victim and is also talking to guys. I will admit at that time I was in a relationship with someone so she did not know that. However I’ve caught her as well flirting with the guys and I can’t help but get jealous and I told her about it which led to an argument about how I don’t really care. One of her coworker friends tried to get her to get with my friend and when I found out I had relations with that same coworker friend (I also cheated on my ex with her) she did not know of that and we agreed to keep it discreet. It was always on and off from then. one day we were good the next we ignored each other. But I always kept coming back to her because I do really care for her and I want a future with her. I admit I am not perfect and I am toxic but I’m willing to be better for her. Recently we started talking again and she’s agreed to go out on a date with me but I’m afraid of her talking to other guys. I’m no longer talking to anyone and I’m trying to be better for her.

370,"We're both older teens. I feel like I tell my boyfriend a lot of things. We let eachother go on our Snapchats and go through messages. He goes through mine and I go through his, and these past few months I've realised that he tells other people things that I don't know about. 

It's not that deep but for example, he had a conversation where he volunteered to tutor this friend's younger brother after school on a particular day every week (didn't happen because virus). I didn't even know he was considering tutoring other people. I like to know what he does with his time, you know? Another time, he told me he was taking 2 courses for summer school like it was a conversation we had before. He said, ""biology is in the afternoon"" and I was all like, ""What? I thought you're taking math???"" And he tells me he's taking both. However, he only told me about the biology one before.

When I confronted him a few days ago, he told me I have to ask for this kind of information. Where in the world would I pull a question out of my ass like this, ""Hey, are you tutoring a child after school on this particular day?"" Or ""wow, I think you're not telling me that you're taking two summer school courses!"" 

I'm slightly hurt by it because whenever there's a change in my life, I tell my boyfriend first. Like if I scored a volunteering job one day, I'd tell him. He's the first person aside from my parents that I'd run to with information. Him not opening up makes me feel like I literally know nothing about him and that I should stop telling him my things unless he asks (which is hard because I want to tell him everything).

So what can I do to get him to open up, and what am I doing wrong?? I already ask him random questions that pop in my mind like ""What's new in your life?"", ""What have you been doing today?""",23Jun2020,1

372,This pandemic has greatly impacted the way my family socializes and me being a socially dependent 19 year old it can be pretty aggravating.

It’s now almost July and most of my friends are going out and seeing eachother and I’m not allowed. I completely understand on my parents end though because my dad did go through radiation for cancer before this virus broke out and he’s horrified of catching it.

373,"About a year ago, I got into a heated argument on a discord server. Over my time in the server I continually shared more details about my personal life (which was stupid af) and a couple people attempted to dox me (shared a group photo with about 30 people in it, and I was one of them). They insisted to know who I was but I didn't believe them because they said some things which made me know for sure that it was a bluff.

However, im a very anxious person and a massive over thinker. Over the course of a year, I've seemed to manipulate myself to believe that they do know my real name. I keep on replaying interactions in my head and somehow convincing myself that they do in fact know my name and I keep reading way too deep into things.

 Since our argument we have somewhat made up, and I left the server ages ago. I know this doesn't sound that bad, but ive always had privacy and trust issues.

I know that if they were to act on the info they had on me, nothing would happen (and they could get themselves into legal trouble for trying to ruin my reputation), but nevertheless it keeps bothering me and I dont want to think about it, because deep inside I know they're not going to do anything and the issue has been resolved.

Please can someone give me some advice that will help me stop thinking about this so I can just move on with my life. thanks",23Jun2020,1

Every time we get coffee he has me pay with my debt card and gives me exactly the cost of his coffee which is 2 dollars and 50 cents change every day (I may overreacting but it’s annoying). Every time he smokes a cigarette I have to be around for him to talk to or he acts like I’m an asshole and I don’t smoke. We both don’t have jobs right now because of corona. He refuses to go outside and do anything during this time. He won’t go fishing, walking, beach, driving  or anything else I suggest. If we do anything it’s what he wants to do when he wants to do it.

378,"My brother thinks that there are some people who somehow stole song lyrics from his phone and are making a profit off his work. It all started with some local artists and after 1-2 years it escalated to global artists as well. When I first heard the theories he was telling me, he kind of convinced me because there is evil in the world and evil people do evil things. He said that some of his friends somehow took his apple id and password and they took everything from his notes. And I knew at the time that he was writing rap lyrics and he was writing a lot. Everything he said was in the realm of reality and that stuff could have happened. When he started talking about a song that I knew was released before he knew how to write, I asked him, How could it be possible that a 2002 song is yours and you were 4 years old at that time? He started telling me how it is possible to change the dates of videos on youtube and how it is a conspiracy against him.
That’s when I knew, that my brother was sick.
I immediately talked to my parents and told them how serious this is. We decided to send him to a psychiatrist without him knowing though, because he would not have accepted to go. We made it somehow to send him to the doc’s office and he started talking with him. After the session he was furiously angry with us, started yelling how could you have done something like this and  I was pretty sure I fucked up and he was not going to talk with us anymore but the anger went away after some time. Then me and my parents talked to the doctor, he said that he has delusions of grandeur and it could have been from the exessive use of marijuana(he smoked a lot of weed). The doctor prescribed him olanzapine but told us to lie to him and not tell him why the pills are really for, otherwise he would refuse to take them. So we listened to him, we somehow made a story about how he needs to take the pills but we also made sure to use different drug boxes so that he wont see the name olanzapine and do a quick research and find out what the pills are really for. He took the pills for 6 months. He was not as agitated as he was before taking the pills, but the delusions were still there. He was a really fit guy with a great body because he was a soccer player until the delusions started. He started getting fat because of olanzapine and it started bothering him that’s when he started asking questions about the pills and eventually found out what they were for. He decided to stop taking the pills and I can’t just see him like this now. Most of the time he has his phone by his ear listening to the songs, it really is a sad picture seeing your brother like that. My main concern is even if he would have continued with the treatment, would he ever realise everything he thought was true was just an illusion? I really want to just wake up one day and find my brother by my side telling me how he finally knows he was in a bad state of mind and everything is going to be okay.

To make it even more dramatic, before the delusions started my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer so that might have contributed as well to my brother’s sickness even though she beat the cancer.

Anyway I was feeling very hopeless and useless so I thought that expressing my feelings and this story would somehow help me and hopefully my brother as well.
Me and my family need advice on how to behave around him and what could we possibly do.
Anyone wanting more information about the situation I’d be happy to go into more detail.

381,Hi all. I’m really into multiplayer gaming and watching content creators on YouTube showcase their gameplay. The rush of adrenaline I get for 20-60 minutes whenever I play a round of League or watch some guy tearing it up in another video game is unmatched to anything else. The only down fall to that is I can’t enjoy anything unless it gives me instant gratification. Watching fast paced videos and playing fast paced games makes me no longer interested in wanting to watch a tv series or sit down and play a slow story based video game. It doesn’t let me enjoy calmer more relaxing things and I really dont like not having the power to do that anymore. Is there anyway to get a longer more attentive attention span? something that lets me keep playing my games but also lets me binge watch a tv series? I really want to enjoy those things again.,23Jun2020,1

384,"I’ve had age related body dysmorphia since 2016-2017. I’m a guy turning 22 next month ( I was born in 1998). I have this weird problem which causes some people to perceive me as younger than I am and some people to perceive me as older than I am. In 2016-2017, when I was a freshman in college, there were some people who thought I wasn’t in high school yet or in high school (9th-10th grade) and there were some people who thought I looked like I was a graduate student. Basically, throughout college, I was perceived as being in my early to mid teens or mid twenties. There was one time this lady asked me: “What grade are you in honey?” in late 2017 when I was 19 and a sophomore. She and her husband were absolutely shocked to find out I was in college. But when I was a freshman, there was a man who asked me if I was doing my masters.

I used to post pictures of myself on the internet when I was 18-19 and got a variety of responses. Here are some: 

“You could be either 15 or 51. No offense but you have one of those faces where its hard to guess the age”.
“ I would say around 14-15 years old unless you’re a young looking guy who looks like they never went through puberty.
“Early 20’s unless you have brilliant skin care regime”
“As soon as I saw your picture, 14 came to mind”

etc.... etc.... some of these were very insulting as you can imagine.

I honestly wonder, do I really look that young and old at the same time or are people just bad judgers of age. I’m embarassed to show a picture of myself. I promised myself since 2017 that I won’t. Just wanted to rant. How does my problem sound? Usually, when someone doesnt look their age, everyone either assumes younger or older but not both. People seem absolutely mindblown by my age and I feel very embarassed. How do I deal with this?",23Jun2020,1
385,"I think that this is the right subreddit for this, apologies it isn't. When I was younger in preschool to elementary school I would randomly hear music and stuff. Not anything crazy, just random drums, guitars, or singing, and it was never any tunes I'd heard before. 

One time I asked my  brother who I shared a room with at the time if he could hear the ""drums from next door"" too and he didn't know what I was talking about. I didn't bring it up again. 

Later in my middle school years I started hearing footsteps and knocking on doors. I can recall a specific time that really scared me, I was home alone and taking an afterschool nap in the living room facing the back of the couch. I heard the door to the room open and footsteps approaching me, like I could feel a presence looking over me for a while. I didn't move, and when it eventually went away and I got up I saw that the door was still closed.

 It was on and off again for a while, but now it's coming back. There's not a lot of music now, except for drums there's lots of those. But I'm hearing my name being called sometimes and feeling more things over me randomly when I'm sitting or laying down. I feel shakey all the time and can't sleep and I can't leave my room. I've had problems with eating and self care a lot so this is not helping that. 

My parents have and have had bipolar, depression, insomnia, and basically I have a whole genetic bag of mental stuff that could have been passed on. I recently stopped living with them (abuse, neglect, that sorta stuff), but I live with my grandparents now who don't really support talking about that kind of stuff or acknowledging things that are wrong. So I'm not sure what to do. Are there any ways that I can stop these noises or calm down?",23Jun2020,1
386,"Hello, reddit. I'm (23M) in a situation that I don't know the nature and don't know how to handle. 

I met a girl(25F)about a year ago and we got off quite well. I asked her out 8 months ago and I made clear during hiking that this is a date ( thru light touching and the way I talk etc.) But she responded little and we never went out a second date. But we are still nice acquaintance that very occasionally contact each other. 

Fast forward several months later, we got close again through text message. I tried some flirting and asked her out for a dinner(we just reopened the restaurant). The dinner is this Sunday and hasn't happened yet. I'm of course psyched about that. 

Last night, at 23:00 she was talking about she need to move out of college dorm room and needing a new place to stay. I own my own house through hardworking but I have lots of mortgage and the COVID is preventing me from a raise. So money is tight. She asked if she can move in with me and pay me rent. She then asked me if we can pick up furniture from IKEA together. My jaw dropped and I haven't responded yet. 

My question: is this a trap? We haven't dated yet, why is she thinking about moving in with me already? Or, she is entirely unattracted by me and she is just trying to get a cheap room or worse planing getting the house in someway? I usually don't distrust people like this, but she is graduating into a economic shit storm and I am very fortunate and humbled that I can keep the job and the house. I worry desperation bring the worst of human. 

Somebody slap me with the truth please. 

I'm a 5 and she is a 6.5 ( I think.) If that helps anyone. Never been a ladies killer in any shape or form.

388,"About a year ago, I got into a heated argument on a discord server. Over my time in the server I continually shared more details about my personal life (which was stupid af) and a couple people attempted to dox me (shared a group photo with about 30 people in it, and I was one of them). They insisted to know who I was but I didn't believe them because they said some things which made me know for sure that it was a bluff.

However, im a very anxious person and a massive over thinker. Over the course of a year, I've seemed to manipulate myself to believe that they do know my real name. I keep on replaying interactions in my head and somehow convincing myself that they do in fact know my name and I keep reading way too deep into things.

Since our argument we have somewhat made up, and I left the server ages ago. I know this doesn't sound that bad, but ive always had privacy and trust issues.

I know that if they were to act on the info they had on me, nothing would happen (and they could get themselves into legal trouble for trying to ruin my reputation), but nevertheless it keeps bothering me and I dont want to think about it, because deep inside I know they're not going to do anything and the issue has been resolved.

Please can someone give me some advice that will help me stop thinking about this so I can just move on with my life. thanks",23Jun2020,1

390,"the gofundme isn't for me, it's for my grandma and i want to remodel her backyard, but i know i can't afford that. So i thought i would try a gofundme and would like help on how i should go about this.   


As the reasons for this are my grandma's health is bad, she's currently in the hospital for rehab aiming to get walking again. But issue is, that she wouldn't be able to do much more than that and she loves working in the backyard. But won't be able to, so i have taken up that role. But if her health goes again, i won't be able to take care of both the garden and her.

So my aim is to remodel the garden to something that's a bit easier to take care of, so i don't have to worry about her making any attempt to do any yard work. Plus it really needs to be fixed as the wood posts that were put up on the sides with like that weird square hole garden fence stuff. It's falling apart, the posts are rotted at the base and are barely holding thanks to the plants.  


One last thing, she doesn't want to be buried, so i told her she's going to be turned into a tree/plant. So when it happens, as she's 88. I plan to put her in the garden, so she's still close.  


So any ideas, advice, tips are very welcome.",23Jun2020,1
391,"Ok so first some context, so I think my mom and dad are...not good with conflict, I don't really know how to put it. My Dad is always working on some really big project, like recently he had us put a really large water feature in the front yard, and last summer we built a huge deck in the back yard, usually this would be fine and dandy, but the problem is he doesn't know what he's doing, and neither does anyone else in our family, so we always run into complications and find temporary solutions to them. So I asked my dad why we don't hire somebody who knows what they're doing to do these projects for us instead of continuing to shove money and effort into them only for it to break again. He went off saying things like ""I know what I'm doing!"" or ""How many projects have you done?!"" So I let him do his thing, and later he is all burnt out from working and gets super irritable, but that's the smallest part. He is always working...like always. He gets up at 4:00 in the morning to go to work gets back at 4:00 in the afternoon only to work out in the yard or on a car or on one of his big projects, there's always something then he goes to sleep rinse repeat. And it's not like I don't try to help him to lighten his work load, I'm always asking him if he needs help, and usually he just tells me he's got it, sometimes I help him anyway but he gets mad at me. So I'm pretty sure he's always burnt out and thus always irritable. I think the reason is because he doesn't have any hobbies, like on the rare occasion that there are not projects to do, he either just paces around, or looks for things that are wrong so he can fix them.

Now for my mom. My mom is a complainer simply put. Don't get me wrong she also works super hard but not nearly to the degree as my dad. She always has an issue with something, and always finds something wrong and just complains. She also makes a big deal out of everything, like she will absolutely lose her mind if something as minor as spilling water happens. And this overreacting has gone to some pretty huge extremes, like one time she just left, not in a car, she just started walking away, at night. (I live out in the country so this was really scary) She didn't answer her phone, dispute my dad, my brother, and me all trying to call her. She eventually showed up yelling at all of us because she was freaking out that she couldn't find her work laptop. Like ok sure that's kinda important, but even a ounce of rational thinking could have prevented that from happening. Also I'm pretty sure she is an alcoholic, like no joke. She comes home drunk and I'm not surprised.

The combination of my mom and my dad needless to say lead to a lot of fights.

I also have a brother, but for the most part he's pretty chill we get along well enough dispute him being a football jock and me being a band nerd.

Then there is me. I for the most part am very antisocial with my parents and with people in general. I feel kinda separate from the rest of my family cause they all have different opinions on everything and can't seem to agree to disagree so they fight a lot unlike me who is very open to all opinions and willing to consider each side of a story. So basically I'm incredibly unbiased. And my unbiased nature can lead to some unsavory outcomes when I'm asked to side with one of my family members. So to combat this I stay out of it as much as I can, which basically means staying in my room all the time. I started doing this in 6th grade, now I'm a junior in high school and I've become more separate from my family than ever, and the fighting just keeps getting worse and worse. I keep wanting some sort of an escape but I can't do much as a 16 year old to get away. Then one faithful day I got my license and I saw that as my escape. I bought a car, (with my own savings) and would leave. Of course I had to ask for permission to leave first, which I think is fair enough. But today I messed up. I left to go play some DnD at a friend's house and I was really getting into it. And I didn't realize my phone was face-down, I have a Motorola and one of the features is that when the phone is face down it goes on silent mode, so I frantically grab my phone and see if I had any messages from my parents regarding when I should be home. They texted me an hour ago telling me to be home by 8:00. Now it was only 7:30 and it takes me about 20 minutes to get home Frome my friends house so I started packing up my things, and texted my mom I was on my way home and that I was sorry for not answering cause my phone was on silent. I didn't get a chance response right away, so I started to head home. Now I am pretty smart, as in I'm not gonna do anything stupid like do drugs or go break bottles or something (idk what delinquents do). And I tried to explain myself and I would be home before 8:00 so I thought I would be fine. Boy was I wrong both my parents proceeded to slam me about how I was so irresponsible and how I shouldn't have been given my license. I didn't know how to respond to that, I haven't been in many fights before so I started thinking logically cause that's what I do best, but no matter what I said I was still getting slammed. I went to my room cause it's my safe space, but they came in and kept telling at me, they've never done that before, and I think I had a panic attack, I'm not sure I've never had one before. 



So basically I just want to find a way to fix my family, it's gone on long enough and I don't know what to do. Apparently my parents have a councilor, but I don't think it helps. I'm worried about my parents and my brother and how this will effect me if I ever have kids. So yeah.",23Jun2020,1

Today I posted a screenshot between my girlfriend and I of me being really embarrassed but I thought it was funny, I said “I want to dieeeeeeeeeeee” and this guy commented something along the lines of “u shouldn’t joke about suicide, ur a bitch for this” and I blocked him. My friend went to his account and commented something similar on a post of a baby with water being dumped on its face and the guy blocked her and made a post about me. 

My girlfriend called him out for it and said I wasn’t joking about suicide at all (which I wasn’t) and he called us children even though my gf is 19 which doesn’t make since because he’s like 19-20, and said I have no experience with depression or suicidal thoughts. He also went for my masculinity by saying “you’re not a man” which is stupid because I don’t care about that. At this point I unblocked him and commented “bruh I was hospitalized like 2 years ago so yeah I think I do know the struggles? No one ever said suicide was a joke, I said “I want to die” not “I’m suicidal and I want to die”. Yeah I literally am a child and I never claimed to be a man, I’m sorry that you had bad experience that made you react that way but damn, you know how to talk to people. You could have just said you didn’t like what I said”. 

After I said that he turned the comments off and messaged my girlfriend and I threatening us both, I’m 17 and I’m pretty sure it’s illegal to attack someone, especially a minor but I played dumb and acted like I didn’t know what he meant. I explained that I wasn’t saying suicide was a joke but he didn’t care or just didn’t understand and he accused me of sending people to his account to attack him. 

He asked why I even cared that he was mad and continued to make fun of me for different things like me wanting to join the army and just the same “grow a pair” and “you’re not a man” stuff, he even said that I’m disloyal because I’m friends with a girl, even though I met her before my girlfriend.

I don’t know how my parents have agreed to get him this after all they were so strict with me. He cries after every single confrontation, he’s manipulative, disrespects literally everyone in my family and treats my loving grandmom like a maid, like trash. My parents aren’t home for most part of the day and he’s alone with my grandmom. I have heard him scream at her, for which I have scolded him. When I inform my parents about the way he treats her, they get defensive and they blame it on my grandmom. Calling her manipulative.

Never studies. He is very manipulative, lies a lot and cries to get my screwed by parents. He knows when to be emotional when parents are around to get me in trouble. 

Anyways, he’s always been the favorite kid. Parents get defensive and aggressive when told about his behavior and his smartphone addiction.

I also honestly think my dad is just bringing us along to make it easier for himself. He literally made his own company where he said he’d hire people to help clean but he hasn’t done that at all. He even brings us along to clean one single apartment, which he should be able to do on his own very well. How do I tell him that I don’t want to work with him anymore? He is very stubborn and will always try to have things his way, so I need help with that too.",23Jun2020,1
406,"My uncle recently passed and in the process of cleaning out his house I found a shelf that has around 33 unopened bottles of all different kinds of liquor. I believe they belonged to my great grandparents. Some are dated as far back as 1950 but some closer to 1980-90. 

They are all mixed (wines, vodka, Canadian whisky) nothing super expensive it seems... I guess I am asking if anyone has any idea how to go about selling this stuff? I’m sure there’s collectors out there that would find some of the bottles cool at the very least. But is there a way to go about selling old bottles of alcohol online? 

Any info would be much appreciated!!",23Jun2020,1
407,"For the last 10 years or so my personal relationship with my Dad has been pretty shit. We dont speak much, i go round to see both him and my mum every few weeks or so and only my mum talks to me, if im left alobe with dad in a room its just silence. Hes always been a bit like that. I never learnt any ""manly"" things growing up, he rebuilt 2 classic cars and never once even offered to show me anything about them or let me help. Never any DIY things either. You know the stuff dads typically teach kids?
  
I moved back to stay for a while at the start of the pandemic because i lost my job. Nowadays he spends all his time in the spare room on the computer, constantly moans about anything, we are not allowed to put anything on the kitchen worktops without a towel down incase it scrathes or stains. Its like a fake granite solid exspensive worktop. He does no housework to help my mum, never cooks but complains almost every meal about not liking anything. Has stopped doing the garden so mum does that too. Constantly belittles and moans at my mum for things she does. The only cleaning he does is he will wash the kitchen floor on his hands and knees every two weeks because he wont let mum mop it cause she will ruin something. A few years ago he had surgery on his eye (got the top layer of the lense removed) its not terribly intense at all but he made mum tie his shoelaces for about three months. He wont eat vegetables anymore so mum makes him soup for lunch everyday so he at least eats something healthy.
  
Basically im just getting so fed up with him. He acts like a grumpy spoilt little kid and has been getting worse and worse for the last 10 years.
  
Doesnt have a mobile so nobody speaks to him. They went on holiday and i saw a band he loves coming to town so i text my mum saying ""hey why dont dad and i and my uncle and cousin go to see this band it would be awesome"" no reply at all which is never what my mum does so i know she asked and he said no. Its like he doesnt want to spend time with me at all. Im really angry at him but dunno what to do. I try and try but hes not interested and he makes everyones life miserable.
  
My uncle died last year and my cousin suggested at the funeral if the family could go back to my parents house so he wouldnt have to go home alone. All any of the family said was ""are you sure my dad wouldnt be mad at us all in the house?"" He was livid and said they are not coming back to the house to make a mess. At a funeral of all times.",23Jun2020,1
408,"So i dont even know if this belongs here but here goes:

It is random, when i am alone, and its very quiet sometimes i will get this feeling. Its like anxiety i guess, i just feel scared and i want to hug or see my mom. I feel like crying and i feel melancholic. I dont know why i feel like crying but if i dont find someone i know or distract myself with something fun i will feel this way. If it starts, i cry for about less than 10 minutes, if i find someone the feeling goes away in about 1 minute. Sometimes when i get out of a long hot shower i feel this way. I just want to cry i guess.

Does anybody else experience this? If so do you know what it is?",23Jun2020,1

410,"TLDR at the bottom. This may be a long one because I’m going to try and give as much detail as possible to get the best responses. I’ve really been struggling with this and I need any help I can get. 

A few days back, my friends and I (20M) met some girls online and decided to have them add me on Snapchat. It was 3 girls, 3 of us, and we made a group chat with us 6. We were just sending some funny selfies, nothing harmless, when one of the girls sends me a picture outside of the group chat (solo). I open it up and it’s a straight video of her masturbating. 

Awesome! We send some messages back and forth and she sprinkles in a few pictures of her tits and other nudes, until I notice a discrepancy between two of the photos. In one, there was a patch of freckles on her chest between her tits and in another it was smooth across, no freckles.

At first I thought no big deal, I have freckles on my face that only really accentuate when I sit in the sun, maybe she spent the day outside and they were just extra noticeable today. We go on with the messaging, until a bigger discrepancy shows, and I get the weird feeling that something is off here.

I check her Snapchat score, which is the total number of Snapchat’s sent and received over the lifetime of the account, and it’s below 100, which means the account is essentially brand new. Anyone with a real account normally ranges anywhere between 10k and hundreds of thousands. So I immediately knew this was at the minimum a burner account.

I go back to the group chat and message one of the other girls privately about this girl, when she says she has no clue who she is and she was not one of the people we hung out with the other night. Even weirder. (How’d this account get in the chat?)

Fast forward a few nights of me and my friends doing some digging, when we find out: holy shit, it’s a guy running the account. Not only is it a guy, but it’s one of our closest friends. I’d honestly call him my best friend.

Now the problem becomes multi layered. 

1) it’s my best fucking friend and he’s trying to catfish me (for MY nudes!) with some fake nudes and a fake account, what the fuck.

2) for all we know he’s heterosexual, has never said anything/came out as gay to us or anyone. 

I want to iterate in advance that obviously there would be nothing wrong if he was gay, but to our knowledge he is not. 

Now for some background on the friend. He’s a pretty outgoing guy. Very loud, talkative, and most notably for this story, very feminine. He talks in a feminine matter, he loves shopping, dresses over the top, things that the stereotypical gay friend would do. The first impression most people have when they meet him is that he’s gay. I’ve never inquired because I wouldn’t want to pressure him into anything, but he’s never brought it up.

Both of his parents are religious old school immigrants, who I’m 99% sure would be extremely anti, which could be a reason why he has never come out but I don’t want to assume anything.

Anyways, I don’t know how to react now that I know my close friend has been trying to catfish me. I won’t tell anyone, because I don’t want to ruin his reputation or, if he is gay, OUT him on my terms. 

My friends that know about the situation want to approach him about it, but I feel that putting him on the spot would only make things worse and wouldn’t gain anything. 

I really don’t see any good solutions in this case, so I’m coming to my good friends at Reddit to ask for some advice. So, please help me out.

Since then, I’ve learned a lot more than what I already know.  I can’t go to the salon now, so I’ve been considering doing highlights on myself again (not with box dye, but with good quality dye).

413,"Dating this girl long distance for a couple of months and was supposed to come out and see her last Wednesday. 

She randomly days before I came.. said it wasn't going to be ideal to come anymore because she had ""a lot going on"".  ( I also want to note that she is very smart and well put togethe)

She mentioned her ex hitting her up but I honestly don't feel like she is talking to him because she was so adamant that she was over him. 

Even if she was I wish she would be honest and I would be understanding. I wouldn't probably continue to date her but now ...I'm starting to get concerned that she's on drugs. 

&amp;#x200B;

She mentioned that someone she knows casually smokes meth every now and then. I was shocked by that as to I didn't think she would be the type of girl to hang out with people like that. 

She was also very quick to mention ""Don't even think that I would ever do something like that"", so I believed her.  A few weeks later she mentions one night how a few years ago her friend ""katie"" and some guy were doing herion one night while she was there. She passed out though and didn't partake. 

Obviously clear red flags. Shes also an actress on this show though and they just wrapped filming.. So I  though maybe she had anxiety that filming was over and needed a break and I was coming to soon. 

She basically goes ghost out of nowhere until today and says "" Hey!!!  I'm so sorry this isn't fair to you I've just been on kind of a bender"" 

I said "" i understand, I know you just got done with the show and everything, just hmu later and we can catch up""

I send another saying ""have you just been drinking and partying a ton? are you good?"" 

she never texts back and I just need some advice.  Are these possible signs of an addict?  I know that sounds dumb because I'm sure it does sound that way, but I just feel like the behavior is really strange. 

Also the fact she doesn't want to talk on the phone is strange. I feel like she's avoiding me asking the right questions or the hard questions.

415,"I honestly don’t know how much more I can take it. My relationship with my dad is really bad. He has done things that unintentionally lead to my grandma’s death. This created lots of tension. About one year after her death, my father had a series of strokes. He wasn’t able to work for a period of time but refused to do anything to actually help himself get better. He wouldn’t take medicine, go to the doctors, etc. Because of this it seems like none of my family members holds him accountable for his words or actions. I can take it when he says crap about me but when he takes crap about my loved ones especially my mom who had to work her ass off ever since he stopped working, I can’t help but cry. When I try to defend myself or others, he gets violent and starts banging his head on the edges of the wall till he bleeds. In one incident, we had to call the cops. Now, my family asks me to stay silent whenever he gets mad to avoid trouble. I just don’t know how long I can stay silent. Once I tried to go to our back yard to ride my bike and he told me that I was trying to get everyone sick.

I despise the gm/president of my fav baseball team for being a bunch of liars and also being terrible at their respective jobs.

This team has a minor leaguer who is super MAGA and a mega homophobe on social media. I am semi surprised how forthright this person is about his beliefs given how many other pro athletes have had their careers ended for being so public about similar beliefs. (He is basically Aubrey Huff)

417,"Hey everyone. First of all I am not a native English speaker, this will be long and I am on mobile, so sorry in advance.

Tldr; I think I finally see a bunch of red flags clearer then ever about my friend on my birthday.

I (31f) don't have many friends and like to keep my circle small like old lifetime friends. This friend (29f), lets call her G, is from highschool and we have been through a lot. I have felt something was off from time to time, like she would ditch me when she was in a relationship or the relationship is going well. So we would become distant, become close again. I now know this is because of me being afraid of losing someone I am attached to.

A few months ago I found an astrologer online, I am gonna call her P, and came across her 3 months online group about reprogramming our subconsious mind and spiritual healing, with 100 other women. It was all about sharing our experiences and positivity and healing together so I signed up. I really needed something to ease my mind (I am in health field and an essential employee) also mentioned it to G as she has a victim mentality which I believe and as we discussed makes her form unhealthy relationships, she was just out of one and reaching out to me once again. She told me she finds it silly, but she will join just to 'do someting together with me'.

The astrologer, P(32f), has a small following like 10-12 hundred people. I sometimes replied to her insta stories and she replied back we had some kind of communication but since she has a small following she replies to almost everyone, either way it is no big deal and I didn't feel the need to mention it to G. But I did mention I had booked a personal astromap counselling appointment. A few weeks later into participating in online group work, G begins dropping hints that she is talking to P, and forming a friendship with her, outside of the program, asking her for favors how P never refuses etc. One day out of the blue she tells me 'Is't it really interesting that a lot of people follow P but she follows me and talks to me' so I say 'why would you underestimete yourself and say something so insecure? If you formed a frequent communication and a friendship it is only normal she is human afterall'. Then G began dropping hints about how close she is with P. Saying things like 'as P always says, as I always tell P' etc.in irrevelant matters about myself or herself like P is a great mentor but that great mentor was her close friend and she was kinda bragging about it. So I was kinda getting bothered as to why would she do or say things like that it never even crossed my mind at that time as if she was doing this to may be make me jelaous maybe or in a way tell me she is more special than me? She would point out the things she had in common with P. How they joked around, how they must have met in past lives, how they felt connected, I would take it all in a neutral way. Until things that happened on my birthday.

Two days ago was my birthday. She lives like 1.5 hour drive away and wanted to meet, tried to arrange it a few days before but in her usual weird manner. Like I missed you I want to be with you but come pick me up and take me to your place. Or I will come to meet if you can take me back. The thing is pandemic is kinda better in my country  and restrictions are getting dismissed by authorities although I know we should still be cautious. So I understand she might still be anxious to use public transport. But again my schedule is hectic because of it as I have to take 8 hour shifts on my feet with all that protective garment without a single break, no food no water. And I was lucky to arrange a break around my birthday. So I told her I could not drive her back as I would already have only two days off, one is to rest and second one is my bd. So she found an another friend to take her to and from my place and we met up outside in a much less crowded place. I had an argument with my parents on my birthday plus had some stomach issues but still met her since she came all the way for me.
I kinda had an issue in the online group few days back and was having a hard time focusing as although the group was promoted in a really accepting positive, flowers and rainbows kinda way, I was not received well for talking about an essential belief of mine or when I said I was feeling negative about something in my life. One time someone was kicked out and shamed after she left asking 'if all men cheat', saying we should never spread hate, never generalize, we should learn to have a positive approach all the time even facing hardships. A few days later P said she hated all religious people, on the group, everyone was agreeing with her, noone was getting kicked out for spreading hate which I found hypocritical tbh. I identify as a religious and an openminded person, and in a middle eastern country I don't find my place among seemingly religious, or radical people. Although I am a reserved person, coming from a radical religious background having had trouble with every dogmatic idea and ended up forming my own idea of religion. I respectfully stated my own opinion that I totally agree there are tons of bad people that identify as religious but there are also good people and we should not generalize as we should not generalize men, abusive parents etc.sharing my own experience in a religious-cult that I was born into but mabaged to escape. Which was not received well once again was totally ignored by everyone . Still I know noone had to agree with me, but I felt that I didn't belong. Then I realized it was becoming more and more cult-like. P would write some sort of rituals (in which you would have to say chants, bathe in oils, pour milk on earth, or bury things in the yard etc) came to her in her dream that we 'must' do in order to heal our energy etc. Although I don't believe in that, I respect people who do that, non of my business. But I realized there is this big psychological pressure in the group into doing the ritual that P told us. Once in a while P would say there are still people among us that doesn't resonate with the group's energy etc, and she checked on our energy once in a while. So I was thinking if she was talking about me. I think P has Paganism as her belief system which is once again, non of my business. But if I had known she would like to enforce it on the people in the group I would def stay away. I even tried to do one of her rituals but felt bad afterwards. It is something I don't understand and don't interest me tbh. Having escaped from a religious cult, I was on alert on how this was becoming one as well.

On my personal online appointment with P, things fell into place. She was once again saying things like she hated religious people how bad and hypocrite they are from the very start, and that even when I stated I identify as religious. I also felt like she kinda held back, in an opinionated manner. She predicted I will transform and change one full eighty in a year or so and lose some of my beliefs as well. Which was kinda scary. While I was discussing all this about G, she takes pics of birds takes videos for her insta etc, and all of a sudden she says 'oh so you are upset with P'. So I say it was unprofessional of her to approach me this way and I began finding this group thing kinda hypocritical, but now I understand P doesn't share my beliefs and finds it hard to respect mine while preaching we should be respectful all the way and spread only love. I tell G, eventhough ee communicate back and forth on insta, I don't have a personal relationship with her I don't seek to be friends with someone I never met face to face, so I am not personally offended. She gets slightly upset that I am sharing this now, saying keeping such info(replying to P's stories or she answering me) to myself is kinda sneaky and she shares it with me because we are close and she would have liked to know. And I am like 'why? I wouldn't want to know what you personally share with P as you say she is your close friend now and your convos are private, also when you mention and bring her in our every conversation it makes me feel like you are trying to show me you are closer to her than me now.' She didn't deny nor accepted the last thing and she went on to say how I should share more while she should share less with me from now on to better our friendship etc. And brought up a past discussion we had about her approaching me and every single person in a traching manner. I told her she doesn't need to teach me stuff I already know so she says she had no idea that I might have known because I share so little with her. But the thing is she know I have been on therapy for the last 4 years and working on myself. I had suggested her that as well, she only went to one appointment and decided not to go anymore as she already knew more than the psychologist.
We went to a coffeeshop later that day, which had an all tatted talkative waiter. She gave all the attention to him joking asking really personal questions, flirting etc. Which is fine to an extend but it lasted for 3 hours. Eventhough I stated it was late for me, I was tired and wanted to go home, it lasted 1 more hour. Since it was late the waiter was able to visit our table frequently, she was trying to have deep conversations with him trying to make him open up to her seeing it as a challenge while I was there all awkward. She asked his astrosign and asked me to look up his chart to include me in the convo i guess. So I did when he left she was like he was a good astromatch for me, trying to make me more interested or what? I only told her 'no' straight away. I couldn't leave by myself as she couldn't go back home needed a ride. At last the waiter found out it was my birthday and serves us cake on the house. She then suddenly proceeds to ask the waiter to take our photo, while taking my phone and giving it to him, and he takes it while I was still trying to process as it was past midnight and I was feeling really tired. So we leave I tell her it was kinda shame that we wasted out limited time not only on us. She gets shocked says I was having a good time, it was different etc. So I tell her I was happy being with her but I didn't like talking to someone I don't know for that long and since she is really loud with the jokes and the flirting everyone elses attention was on us which again I am not comfortable at all. So she didn't seem upset or anything and still said it was all because I talked little. It was past time and I didn't discuss further as I had a work shift the next day.

So coming to yesterday, she left her stuff in my car and asked me if I can bring them to her after my shift. So I went and she was like what happened to your energy it feels so darkish I tell her I am really tired. I had actually wanted to talk to her about last night but it was impossible as she was on the move running errands. We went to grab a coffee, butonce again all of her attention was on a male waiter, a different one this time. Like he would look at her and she would point out did you see that? And smile so widely calling him and flirting once again. I was too tired to care at this point and her friend was about to pick her up. So I decided to talk later. And we left. I sent her the photos the first waiter took and go to sleep. This morning I wake up and see her instastory she shared of our photo. I look really uncomfortable, my posture is really slouched and my face is funny as I talking, all the whike she was looking all insta-ready and posing with a smiley face to the waiter, with captions like happy birthday my dearest we have no distance in our hearts etc. So I told her it would be better to ask me first before sharing with her hundreds of followers and to please take it down as it is a really lousy photo of mine and I am not comfortable with it. She is shocked once again and seems to not understand and asking me if I am serious or joking. So thanks a lot if you read this far, and I am asking how should I approach to this? As I am both mentally and phsycally exhausted.",23Jun2020,1

421,"Here’s my long story I would really appreciate any advice, different perspectives, or feedback. 


I grew up in a very religious house hold my parents are both very involved with their church and are seen as people of very high positions within the church. My father especially. Growing in such a house hold was very hard anything out of these religious views was seen as wrong/bad. It’s something I struggled a lot as a child/teen. I couldn’t watch certain tv shows, listen to music, talk to boys, etc etc. Even when I would tell my mom I felt depressed she automatically would respond with some sort of bible quote, and tell me to go pray about it. I did that for a while and I got nothing. It didn’t help me feel better, it didn’t fix any situation I was in, or made me feel listened to. I always felt like I was forced into a box by my parents I had no choice but to be in.  I hated it. 

Around the age 12-13ish I opened up my dads laptop to play games on and all through his internet history was porn sites. At the time I had never seen porn (the worst I saw was the Wedding Crashers uncensored version) and was genuinely confused, but after a few multiple clicks I realized what I was seeing. I was disgusted. I couldn’t believe my father who had force me to live my life in his religious views could be such a hypocrite. It made me angry seeing him go to church every weekend talk up on stage about the Bible, God, whatever then come home and watch that smut. He is a great man. Hard working, dedicated to field, to his church, his family always had food on the table, a joke to tell, or a present to give. But I never saw him in the same light after that. As I grew up I slowly phased out religion out of my life and my although I still live with my family, and see my dad everyday. Over the years I have held my distance from my father due to the impact of deceit I felt from him. I’m currently trying to ‘fix/find myself’ -to work out my issues I have in my life and I feel like this is something I would like to move on from, but the only way I feel like I can is if I talk to him about how much his actions have hurt me growing up. I want a closer relationship with my parents and I’m willing to put the time, and effort it takes to get that. However I do not know how to talk to my dad about this issue without hurting him. He has been excluded a lot from his family (brothers) in the past/present and I don’t want him to feel more excluded especially from someone in his immediate family. 

So my question is where do I go from here? How can I talk to my father about this? Should I talk to him about it? I’m sorry if this was long. 

TL;DR: My father is a religious man and I feel his addiction to porn hurt me a lot when I was younger. How can I talk to him about it so I can grow past it and have a better relationship with him. Should I even?",23Jun2020,1
423,"hello redditors,

I have been battling depression since a long time. I don't have friends except one with whom i made became friends 6 months ago. So basically we aren't that close. I have always been always alone since my childhood.  I was introverted, shy and always mature from my age. I always had hard time making friends. I eventually made friend. But it turns out that all of them were really toxic and very needy. I was always taught that being accepted by society is happiness. And I realized in order to get accepted i always have to act like them. And thats what i did. And It was a total failure. In the end i couldn't tolerate anymore. And started being how i really am. And no one accepted me. In the end i got bullied. It traumatized me enough not to go to school anymore. I literally begged my parents for not attending school anymore. I didn't knew what to do. I started running away from my problems. And ended up becoming addicted to manga and anime. This led to totally spoil my results. My parents were always strict when it came to studies. And on the day of my result they were totally disappointed and ended up ignoring me for days.

In high school, I ended up choosing what I really hated to study. It was really a torture for me. I finally made a boyfriend. He loved me and took care of me. But our relationship became toxic. Later i came to know he was suffering from borderline personality disorder and clinical depression. I really loved him so much. But things didn't work between us. He started verbally, emotionally and physically abusing me. And ghosted me and dumped me. No one was there for me as a social support. This event ended up giving me a trauma. And after this event all the relationship i was in started to become a toxic one. So i eventually stopped dating. After my high school i started cutting contacts with all my toxic friends and people i don't want to see again. I thought once cutting contacts my life would become easy. But it doesn't seem that way. My mental health is becoming worst day by day. I am totally losing interest in everything. My memories are haunting me. The depression is getting even more worst.

426,"It’s been 100+ days since I’ve seen my friend due to quarantine. I can’t see him for reasons beyond our control. We’ve kept in touch, and over the months I have been struggling with missing him, and only getting to see him virtually.

I decided awhile back that I would start writing down my deepest feelings and best memories of him in order to express my feelings instead of bottling them up.

Over the months, I’ve written a nice page worth of thoughts, and today I decided to read through it. It made me feel warm again, like how you feel when you are around someone you love.

So I converted the writing into a nice letter, which reflects on why I love him and appreciate him (nothing romantic).

Then it struck me that I could turn this into a gift. I have a gift I’ve been wanting to give him for a while now, and this letter I’ve written would go perfectly with it.

Here’s where I need advice:

a) The letter is pretty long, it would take up half a google doc at size 12 font if it were typed. I really don’t want to shorten it, but should I shorten it for the sake of colloquialness? 

b) I don’t know how or when to give it to him. Should I snail mail it? Or should I deliver it in person whenever we see each other again? I want to do the latter but who knows how long it will be until I can see him again?

c) I don’t want to seem too clingy or creepy. If you received something like this, would you be weirded out?

Thanks for any advice, in the end I just want this gift to be a thank you and a statement about our friendship.",23Jun2020,1
427,So my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 yrs now and I love him with all my heart and I tell him everything meaning I've told him about about my past experiences with sexual assault. The other day he ended up coming over and he was trying to talk me into letting him touch me in a way I didn't like I kept telling him I didn't like it and I would pull away after doing it a couple of times he took both of my arms to where I couldn't move and reached inside my pants.

428,"((TL;DR my mother has been on a heavy psychopharmacology plan to cope with her epilepsy. It’s damaged her kidneys and brain, causing her to act irrationally, have explosive anger, and be suspicious of me.))


Hi. My mom has had epilepsy since I was a young child, after she took a new antidepressant that damaged her brain 19 years ago. She developed epilepsy that causes her to experience petite and grand mal seiners. Petite mal cause her to act almost like she’s drunk (confused, anxious, weepy, difficulty with verbal coherence, fatigue, among others,) and during this she can be angry or crying or withdraw into herself completely. Grand mal will involve moments of true, shaking/twitching seizure, and moments of lucidity where she’ll experience visual and auditory hallucinations. She will often loose access to memories, or not recognize who I am. One time she thought I was an intruder and hit me in the face.

Fortunately, these seizures are normally nocturnal/respond to physical and mental stress. So she’ll be cognizant and sharp during the day, most of the time. Her medication causes extreme fatigue during day; stress/activity causes her to have a seizure, so she’s been housebound for many years. During younger years, I was able to at least have a mother during a few hours of the day. Between sleeping late bc/ heavy medication, and evening when daily stress usually brought on a petite mal seizure at the least. But now things are different. She was always difficult to deal with, flighty and quick-to-anger as a person, but ultimately kind and caring to me. Now, I’m older (early 20’s) and living with the family after COVID crisis and recovering from 2 years of extreme health (mental and physical) issues. But now that I’m back, she’s constantly angry with me. Always acting like she’s annoyed with me, jumping on me for little comments, blowing small things out of proportion, yelling and physically perusing me if I try to leave situation, telling me not to tell my father bc/ it’s hard on him and this is between her and I, telling me I’m entitled and ungrateful, suspecting me of things, mistrusting me, yelling at other family members, and more things I could list but won’t.

I can’t say I’m a perfect daughter and haven’t yelled back at her in frustration. I can’t say that I have been perfectly behaved in the house and been respectful to her at every turn, but she’s blowing up on me for not doing the dishes?? For hanging up on her when she was being combative on the phone? For suspecting me of using drugs? (I’ve had problems smoking marijuana in the past but come on, they test me twice a month and it isn’t enough for her.)

Idk what to do. She said she would go to counseling with me and my dad but idk if that will help? How to people deal with aggressive family members with mental and physical health issues? I feel alone and trapped because she’s my mother and she’s told me what to do basically my whole life, but her role as a mother has been compromised by neurological damage. I’m saving up to move out, but what then? Leave her with my father who’s been overburdened for years? Ugh, it’s such a kettle.

429,"So here’s the main pretext to my dilemma: I am an avid Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioner with hopes of opening my own gym one day. 

My family moved from my birthplace a year ago and I decided to stay back with my girlfriend for the past year, until the virus hit. Over this year I have become really attached to this new gym that really embraces a specific style of the martial art that I really enjoy more than anywhere else I’ve trained. I am also friends with the owner/head instructor who to me seems to be someone put into my life as a sort of mentor to build me up in a way to follow my dreams. 

However, I have been evicted from my place forcing me to temporarily move to this new place where my family is. I have missed them a lot and love being here, it’s beautiful and calming. This new place is also quite affordable compared to my hometown and I am about to graduate with my professional license in August. 

I am so torn, should I move here and enjoy a more peaceful and affordable city as well as pursue my dream here or should I go back down to my hometown and get back into the environment that seemed to be shaping up my professional life as a gym owner.

432,"Okay, so first of all, we're a family of four, Father, Mother, my sister (15) and I (18). For as long as I can remember, my father has been a mentally abusive cunt, I'm not sure if this is the right terminology but my mother tells me he's a narcissist. He acts like he knows everything and if anything happens in the house and we don't call him first before even calling authorities or something, he will get extremely upset, sometimes to the point of banging objects around the house. He doesn't get physical with my sister or myself, but in the past he has been physical with my mother. He takes trivial issues with my mother, such as being a bit untidy and having a habit of collecting and reusing plastic bottles and the likes, and turns it into a big deal about how my mother is a slob and a pig. My mother has had some health issues recently but he refuses to allow her to see a doctor, instead he self prescribes medicines for her (including prescription ones, no idea how he gets hold of them, also he's just an optometrist). His behaviour has also been causing my sister's mental health to deteriorate, she's started having panik attacks and hyperventilating. Now last night my father was going on a tangent about a really trivial matter, but my sister started panicking do she slammed her door and started hyperventilating. This really angered my father, even though i was comforting her and trying to get her breathing back to normal he came to the room and started scolding her about her wrong behaviour, all while her breathing is still abnormal. I've discussed the issue of leaving the house with her but she wants us to bear with it and wait until my sister turns 18 so that we'll have no legal repurcussions, by my argument is that I'm not sure my sis will survive that long mentally. What do you guys think of the situation?

TL;DR my father is a mentally abusive cunt who thinks he's superior and doesn't care about my mother's physical or sister's mental health. What should i do?",23Jun2020,1

435,"First of all, I’m 14 years old, but I’m very precious for my age. I have severe anxiety. The majority of people I interact with are adults. It’s easier for me to have conversations with adults than my ostensible peers whom I tend to avoid. If I do make an attempt to hang out with people my own age I would have to level with them to be socially accepted, which is something I don’t care to do nor be. I have seeked out friendships with relatable people my age but we don’t connect very well. I have always felt different and had difficulties making friends from a young age. I am desperate to be normal.
    Yesterday, I decided to spend time with a couple of my peers. I was, once again, the outcast. Sometimes I would say things and they would just look at me, then at each other. They were using slangs and acronyms the majority of the time, and vaping, which I rejected when offered...twice. They criticized me for choosing not to have social media. They would occasionally ask me personal questions relating to certain aspects of my life, e.g. my love and family life. While they were behaving themselves like obnoxious children, I was nervously sitting back and analyzing them. They brought up that I was akward and quiet. They then FaceTimed another peer whom was manipulating and condescending to them. I mentioned my observations after they had ended the call and I think they were left perplexed. The reason I have learned to recognize and apply the use of of body language and social interactions was because of the extensive research I conducted on proper socializing techniques as a means to mask my social difficulties, which my attempt of doing so evidently failed. 
   It’s not that I haven’t had normal adolescent experiences and experimentations, it’s that it just doesn’t interest me. I have a boyfriend with common interests to mine and the relationship of 15 months has advanced. I just want to learn how to be socially acceptable to my “peers”. I also want to disclose that I may be on the spectrum, so if anyone can speak on behalf of that it would be greatly appreciated.",23Jun2020,1

438,"Hello everyone.

One of my (24M) roommates (M22) has been living with us for over 6 months now and has been a friend for years. He's a lovely, caring and funny guy, and has really proven to be reliable when it comes to paying rent and cleaning up after himself. Yet a couple of weeks ago he started to bring round this younger girl (F19) he met at work. She seems nice enough and they're having a great time, and i'm over the moon for him as it's what he deserves. 

Before all of this, my roommate was stellar at cleaning up after himself. The kitchen was always clean: floors always swept, surfaces wiped down, washing up done etc. Was never a problem. Until now, where she is round after work about 4/5 nights a week and they cook into the late hours of the night. A few times now i've come downstairs the next morning and found just a fuck tonne of food debris all over the floors and worktops, food residue on the stove, pots half filled with cold noodles, sticky worktops, the washing up bowl filled to the brim with greasy, dirty plates, cups and utensils, a broken wine glass, chairs in the middle of the room etc. They have been doing this until about 12/1 in the morning. 

The good thing is, he is very thoughtful and will keep the noise down if i ask him to (my bedroom is right above the kitchen) and does clean up after himself eventually. Usually he would clean up his mess the same day or day after, but they've been spending so much time together and getting so drunk that sometimes it's not done for 3 days. I don't want to touch it, I feel like i shouldn't have to clean their disgusting mess up. I want to, as i'm a bit OCD about having a clean kitchen, but this is far from an overreaction on my part. If i had photos, I would put them up here. I can even go down and get proof for this if need be. 

What do i do? Like i said, he is very reasonable and will happily listen to what i have to say, it's just a question of *when* it ends up being done, and if i end up sounding like a nagging parent at the end of it. We have another roommate too (23M) but i don't know his stance on all of this. Perhaps it bothers him, perhaps not. I just want to know if i can talk to the ""messy"" one and try and politely get it into his head that this is disrespectful of everyone else's living space. God knows this won't be cleaned up for about 3 days either knowing their track record. Sorry, all of this is just really stressing me out and i have a menagerie of other things in life to stress over aswell. Any advice would be extremely welcome. 

Thanks for listening to my rant.",23Jun2020,1
439,"Hello, I am the middle kid (18) of 4 brothers. My oldest brother has long since been out of college and on his own, but my other older brother (26y) is still living in my parents' house. He took a gap year after high school and then attempted college only to drop out the first year and return back to living in my parents' house. He has been living cost-free for about 7 years because my parents pay for almost everything. Food, electricity, phone plan, gas, basically anything that requires money is paid for with no returns. My dad loves him very much but the ""parent"" part of him wants to kick him to the curb, but my mom won't allow it because she also cares a great deal and without a degree, knows that he will struggle if left to his own devices.

The thing is, my dad, like a lot of other dads right now, has had his pay cut by a significant chunk to the point that he thinks he probably will have to keep working and won't be able to retire. He still has to pay for my college and the future college of my little brother as well, and the fact that he has to pay for my brother's existence full time doesn't help anything. To top it all off, all he does is game the entire day and buy collector's items with the little cash he has. He doesn't do any housework, doesn't have a job because he recently quit after less than a year employed, and overall gives nothing back for the privilege to live for free in a big comfy house. 

I make him out to seem like a bad guy, but he is actually a good brother with good morals. He doesn't necessarily do this on purpose, but he doesn't really know that he's in the wrong because my parents don't have any expectations for him. If things keep trending the same way they have been for the past 7 years, I will start college, graduate, and be financially stable before my brother even moves out. I love him, but I want him to move out and get a job so he can be successful. My parents won't be able to take care of him forever.

So my question for you guys is, how do I convince him to get a job and move out or convince my parents to give him the boot? I've raised these concerns with my parents before, but it seems to be just kinda shrugged off and forgotten about due to their not wanting him to fail.

441,"Hey guys, 

So I have decided, after 5 years, to quit my job. I've definitely already made my mind up about that, I don't need advice on whether I should quit. 

I'm quitting for a few reasons. For example, our main office, which is supposed to support us in doing our jobs, has gone to shit in the last couple months. No one there knows what their job is anymore, and I have to keep calling and emailing around, just to be able to do my day to day tasks, which adds a lot of stress and takes time away from all the other stuff I need to get done. 

Then on top of that, because of the whole pandemic situation, our weekly hours have been cut by about 40 to 45 percent. While we have a lot more work to do, because we have certain guidelines we have to follow, mostly a lot of cleaning and disinfecting. 

And then two weeks ago, there was an incident with a superior. He came to check on the store, which in it's own is fine. But he came on a day when I, the current manager, wasn't there. Which is against protocol, but that apparently doesn't count for him anymore. Anyway, he gave some very unreasonable feedback. I won't go into detail as to not make it too recognizable, but it was all stuff I couldn't change even if I wanted to. Structural issues for example. The tone of the feedback in his mail, and his follow up phone call, led me to have a panic attack. Because, this didn't feel like feedback, this felt like a lead up to a character assassination. 

And turns out I might be right, because afterwards I heard from my colleague that he had started asking questions about my competency, personal problems, and trying to turn her against me. 

Now this last incident was the final straw, and I have been looking for a new job ever since. 

But now, for quitting, I don't think he'll see it coming. Because for some reason he's gotten it into his head that he knows me. Working together shallowly does not mean you know each other tho. So I know he's going to ask why. And I know I don't have to tell him, but I feel like it would make me feel better to tell him. But that's pretty much what I need advice on. Should I tell him his actions were the final straw, so he can hopefully learn from this, or should I just drop it? I wouldn't fight him about it, I would just mention it in a way to indicate it made me feel like shit. 

Tldr: boss was rude to me, should I tell him that's why I quit?",23Jun2020,1

443,"Hey everyone, 

I'm working at a company as a student assistant, will get full employment next year. Currently there are two employees and my boss in the department, otherwise just a bunch of student assistants. 

One of the employees (i.e. my superior) was tasked by my boss to decide over a vacation request of another student, and also to decide whether or not said student would get more work hours for their contract (=also get paid more). They now told me about their decision for the vacation request via sending me an excerpt of a IM conversation with the other student, and asked me for my opinion in allowing them more hours. 

I feel like there are boundaries being broken here by my superior, but I'm worried of their reaction if I deny them my opinion. I also don't approve of the conditions on which they approved the vacation request as they asked the student to still be available for short-term urgent tasks = not an actual vacation, so I don't feel like I can comment on the student's employment status but NOT voice my disapproval for the ""conditional vacation"". Said superior has a tendency to gossip anyway and I have tried to deflect and deny them gossiping with me.

454,"i have no one else to talk to on this, not even my partner (M), as i promised i wouldn’t out her (this girl) as being bi to anyone.

but for whatever reason, i still think about her. don’t know if i just regret how we drifted apart as friends, if i’m sorry for what i did, or if i possibly liked her (back?) as something more. but i still worry about her, i still regret how things ended. 

to give a tldr; i am a pansexual trans guy. now a college sophomore. when i was 16ish, i had a friend, 15, who was in a shitty abusive household, and while i seriously cared for her own well being (having also been abused), i was too scared to be myself. so, i kept a crush i had (a friend of ours) secret, and lied about it when asked. multiple times. they were never together but everyone thought they’d be, and then i had to come in and ruin it... and in getting with the guy who is now still my boyfriend of 2 years, i neglected my friend. avoided her becuase i hated how cuddly she’d still be with him.. i’m ashamed to admit it, but i was jealous. 

her and i did eventually become close again, as friends.. there were some signs, and i started to wonder if she liked me, but brushed it off as she came from a very mormon family, and was herself.. to the point i played dumb when she started talking about confusion over sexuality, and if i’m being honest the signs were very strong it was *me* she hinted at crushing on. i even “jokingly” asked if the person she referenced was me once, but she dodged it... and i tried to be close, i tried to be there for her but it just wasn’t enough.... 

i graduated a year ago, we drifted off... i feel so awful. my boyfriend is still in highschool, and they go to practice together, and i hate that i can’t be there, i hate that i can’t somehow make it right. see if she’s okay. give her chocolate milk like she always wanted. hang out in her tree.. part of me almost wished i’d at least tried being with her romantically, there was something so alluring about the times we snuck out at night to my car, the times we were close... and yet i distanced myself. i didn’t have the balls to tell her i’d kept that stupid secret, for fear my now- boyfriend would find out. i was too ashamed to tell her i loved her, even as a friend. or more- i honestly don’t know if i’ll ever know the answer to that. 

since then my number has changed. over a year has past since we last spoke. i could never go to her house i’m sure, her parents might shoot me (deadass she was worried they would for some reason). the best thing i’d have is my email, but given how scared she got when her parents nearly found out we DMed in secret on insta, deleting her account, i don’t want to risk her safety.. yet i worry for her? she’s 17 now, so i can only hope she’s on her way to escaping her stupid abusive parents... 

i’m so lost what to do with these feelings. i can’t risk her safety yet i want to apologize and give her help if she needs it, i have money and i know how far that can go... yet maybe i’m just being selfish. she’s probably moved on by now, i doubt she’d want me back in her life. 

so what, i guess i just sit here, unable to even tell my SO the true story and stuck with regrets?",23Jun2020,1
455,"I’ll keep this one short. If your phone gets grabbed from your hand by a stranger but they don’t run off with it, they just hold onto it and keep it from you. Does the law “Defending Your Property” apply if you deck them in the nose, knock their block off, and take it back within the second?

I had this almost happen at work once if a co worker didn’t step in the way. The Karen was complaining and saying she should get more crowned service because she survived something. I looked down at my phone ready to pull out the camera and hide it in my apron when she caught a glimpse of it started to dive to grab it.

457,"I've liked him for a couple of weeks now, but I've never told anyone. When I was gone, my best friend asked him out and they seem very happy with eachother. When I first found out on call I acted happy for them, put on a smile and made jokes about it, as you do. When I got off the call however, it really hit me. It really hurts. I feel like I'm suffocating and I really wanna cry. I can't sleep, my mind is running. I don't know what to do. I don't wanna hurt my best friend, in any shape way or form, but my crush has said things like how he would date me over her in the past, but maybe his feelings have changed.

458,"hello reddit, to start off: I’m M(16), living in a limited/strict household, have little to no friends at this point, and have developed several problems throughout my life. Forgive me beforehand for sounding very jumbled and all over the place, i’m writing this at a whim at 4 in the morning, and i’m very stressed. I’m just trying to get this out now while i feel like i can vent.

Now that that’s out of the way, since i was around 10 i’ve had it rough. I had an eating disorder since an early age, causing me to throw up after every meal. This was why i was homeschooled until the 3rd grade, went to a private school where it didn’t get any better. Around my last year there, (4th) my only group of friends basically got the entire school against me, starting terrible rumors. This instilled trust issues, some minor depressive episodes from day to day, and could have been the start of paranoia for me. At age 10, it’s a lot for a kid to go through.  This has been one of the reasons i’ve been led to live a life currently battling massive depression, anxiety, and several other things.


The next year i went to a new school, a public school. Things were going good, until i hit 8th grade. While i obviously had minor issues, as anyone would, it was this part of my life that changed me. I spent the previous year starting to like a girl, by the summer we got closer and closer, eventually dating by the start of the school year. Things were good, but i always has doubts. It wasn’t anything truly going on behind my back, i was just constantly anxious, scared, scared of losing her to someone else, i wanted things to be right and things to be perfect. My mind was truly driving me insane. There were days where it was hard, very hard to find any kind of motivation to even do anything. This was all over my overthinking, 9 months passed i broke it off. Many things have happened since, i’ve still been dealing with my issues, i tried a second time with this girl, and it went bad, she left and it left me worse. While i’ve gotten her out of my mind, that relationship left me scarred, with higher levels of depression, anxiety, paranoia, etc. My house doesn’t help either. It’s a very strict religious household, i can barely go out, and if so it can only be with a select few friends. It’s just a constant stress in my house that truly is horrible.

One other aspect is that i always have a paranoia, always think anyone and everyone is talking about me, saying who knows what to who knows who, making me seem like a bad person. I do feel that’s an effect of the previously stated encounter at my first school. It’s stressful, but  i do have friends, a good number actually. Ive gotten to speak to a good majority of people in my grade and am friendly and chill with all of them, i hope. That’s another one, i feel like i don’t have any real friends, anyone that has anything truly in common with me, and it’s lonely. I have one good friend that gets me to an extent, though i feel i can’t fully trust him as he’s friends with a friend of mine that’s been fake in the past. I just want someone to get me, and i wanna be able to talk to someone who does.

Anyhow, all these experiences truly have me in a mental chaos for the past year. All these pains have finally come to me. i truly feel mentally drained out of all the joy i could have had, i just want to be happy again, i hate this life and i hate feeling like this. I’m truly sick of this all. If anyone could comment please do, I’d very much appreciate hearing what you all have to say. 

Thank you all&lt;3


TL:DR -&gt;  Past experiences i’ve lived through, and still go through have mentally torn me apart. I have no one in my life to lean my shoulder on, no one to trust, and my mind is truly hurting more than ever. I hate every second of feeling drained, i’m just looking for some help here.",23Jun2020,1

462,"Hi, 

So I have my nuclear family has a recurring pattern of crappy and unhealthy relationships/behaviors. I’m 21, and growing up I thought my family was pretty stable until I was about 13. My parents had issues sometimes where they would argue, but we would go on family vacations, they were very loving to us, we would go to church together every weekend as a family, I had good relatively “normal” extended family as well. My parents were also both in the Army but we worked as a family. However, when I was 13 (around 2012) I discovered my mom was having an affair, which is a big no-no overall but especially in the military. I confronted her and she basically lied and covered up the whole thing. I bottle this up for a year, fast forward shit hits the fan the night of my eighth grade graduation. A man who had an affair with my mom sent her superior in the army details of their relationship and also sent it to my dad. Everything is f***ng crazy that night, but I notice that the name of the man she was with who outed her is different than the one I knew about...shit. 

Basically, it comes to light over the course of months and years that my mom has been a serial adulterer and cheated on my dad multiple times. Somewhat unexpectedly he never presses for divorce/separation (although he’s hurt and pissed) and keeps insisting they try to work out. At first they do, but more revelations keep coming out and when things start to be better it comes out my mom has cheated on my dad again (in the present). One of the worst parts is it’s with people our families know (family friends who usually have kids my age) and some whose wives my mom was even close too. 

Obviously I harbor a lot of resentment to my mom at this time. I think everyone in my family does too (including my dad). However, he (and then convincing me and my brother this is the issue too) adopts the frame of reference for the situation that my mom is a sex/love addict. To him, I think it provides a comfortable label where my mom doesn’t have to be the “villain” in his eyes because before (and since) my father has always been enamored with my mother - growing up, I knew he loved me and my brother but he just seemed so devoted to her. She was one of two serious girlfriends in his life (they were college sweethearts) and she’s the only woman he’s ever had sex with. My mom goes to therapy and my dad does as well - including Anon meetings for spouses who have addictions - he starts off going to SAnon meetings but then AlAnon meetings (which I think is kind of weird bc that’s not the issue my mom has...) 

However, things don’t change. In fact, things seem to repeat themselves. At beginning (I was a young teen) I desperately wanted my parents to stay together and I was in my dads side in that regard that they needed to try to work it out (and my mom was selfish for not trying hard enough). However, in a recurring pattern every six months or so after everything has seemed fine something else would usually come up that my mom has cheated again, either physically or emotionally - this went on again and again from 2014 to 2019. It became so exhausting and was a constant source of trauma and stress throughout of high school - and it caused me to grow to resent both my parents because my mom couldn’t stop cheating on my dad - but also because my dad wouldn’t just do the normal thing and divorce her so she didn’t have to be cheating on him anymore - she could just be making her own mistakes instead of him (and me and my brother by extension) feeling betrayed by her as a wife and mother. 

Despite all of this I love my parents very much. They are so flawed in this area of my life but outside of this they are great parents and are supportive, affectionate, loving, funny, etc. they can get along well and we can interact as a family if we’re all together. However, my father just continues to pine over my mother even though she has moved out and they are separated and she is in another stage of her life now (going to law school.) he literally will not let her go at all or sign divorce papers. He has this flame for her that at this point I do not understand. I think my mom is a very vivacious person but he is so stubborn and seems like he will NEVER give up loving her - which seems nice, but I think he has this ideal that he can help fix her and make her love him again like “before” all this happened (in reality I think my mom has been cheating the whole marriage). He acts like he is the key to her “sobriety” (and yes, I know sex and love addiction can be real - but I think it is nowhere near as simple or “conformed” as an alcohol or a drug addiction). He is definitely not healthy with her (and she isn’t with him - cheating on your husband is not good for you) but he will not let go. If I ever mention him divorcing her and finding someone new he is so against it and goes on this Spiel about how “a marriage is hard work and it’s not about being in love but rather “loving someone when it’s hard or the passion is not there”. Basically my dad has this weird Catholic-skewed ideal of marriage that a marriage/relationship that is “lustful” or “frivolous” in his eyes is bad - but yet I still feel like he is like weirdly horny for my mom! I point blank told him I would never stay in a marriage like his and that’s not what it’s supposed to be like/that’s not what “perseverance” in a marriage is. To give you some context, he’s into crap like “Bulletproof Husband” and the movie “When a Man Loves a Woman”.

I’m just so frustrated at this point. I just want them to get divorced and move on. I also feel like they both just have really shitty therapists and they are in the same immature, self-centered places they were five years ago. My moms self-centeredness is more plain obviously, but I just feel like my dad is such a hypocrite - talking about how he is not like those guys my mom cheats on him with - he puts his family first, he is just dutiful - but he is so determined to have his own happiness and make his marriage with my mom work that he is fine with my brother and I’s emotional well-being and perception of relationships become shit. He also acts like he’s super evolved and in touch with his emotions when he obviously he still has a lot of repressed feelings about all this - he acts super white knight, “chill man” most of the time but then he can snap and become rigid and also has threatened to my mom that he will tell people what’s she done. 

How can I help my dad move on? How can I show him he is being both kinda selfish and also that he will never be able to fix her, he just has to let go? I’m so fucking tired and frustrated. I feel like the adult in this situation. He says he doesn’t want to put 20 years of marriage down the drain but almost half of my life has been wasted while none of this crap has changed and no one has gotten better. I feel like it’s an endless circle with nobody changing any god dang behaviors.",23Jun2020,1
463,"Apparently the assault happened about a year ago at a small party that a number of my friends attended, but I wasn’t there. I only learned about this recently from a friend who was at the party, and it has been eating me up.

My friend dated the victim for about 6 months or so, but they broke up a couple months ago. AFAIK, she hasn’t told many people at all about the incident. My friend has disassociated with the perpetrator, but he hasn’t contacted anybody about the incident. I feel like if I don’t do anything, I am complicit with this type of behavior. I really want to help, but I have no idea what I would do. I don’t know any details regarding exactly when, where or what even happened. I don’t want to spread any misinformation, but I can’t exactly just go ask this girl what happened, since I don’t have any real contact info for her and we’ve never been close. I feel like my friend telling me was probably a breech of her privacy, and I don’t want to do anything that she doesn’t want done, but it’s so hard to just stand idly by and do nothing about it. I definitely don’t want to reveal her identity or anything private, but just saying “This guy did something inappropriate to an anonymous girl at some time at someone’s house” doesn’t exactly feel like a conclusive statement.

As long as people are silent about these things, they will continue to happen. I know it’s not my business to get involved with this, but I am just so conflicted and have no idea what to do. Any advice would be amazing. Should I let others handle this? Should I get involved? I literally have no idea what to do here.

For context regarding my actual life experiences, I’m a teenager who has never been involved in any sort of controversy ever. I haven’t even drank or gotten high or even gone to a large party where others were.",23Jun2020,1

465,"Because this story is 100% real and good lord it happened recently, It was suggested by friends of mine that I submit a ""Reddit"" post. 

It began in high school when I met this guy. I'll refer to him as ""W.""
W and I were friends in high school. In high school, we weren't popular. We weren't cool. Our group of friends was designated as the ""weird"" crowd. ""Eccentric."" ""Emo's""...I guess? *shrug* We had fun regardless. 

  Fast forward to over 10 years later. I have an AMAZING career. I save lives for a living. Always was what I wanted to do. I care about others. I've worked REALLY hard and had to go through several ups and downs to obtain the life I have now. I had to struggle. Which made me who I am today. I love taking care of people, including strangers.

 Okay, now that the preface is over with. Naturally, over the years, W and I lost touch. It happens with high school friends. Especially, because we took different paths, which will clearly be stated within the next few paragraphs. 
   W and I lived in the same state and lived near each other. Although, I joined the Military and went away, I always made my way back home and continued my education near what was always home to me. Eventually, W and I made contact again through Social media. He just so happened to still be in town. W and I met up with each other and we had laughs. Things were pretty chill. We reminisced about high school and the ""good ol' days."" Over the course of a few  weeks, W and I hung out a few times. I liked him. He was still the same, odd character he was in high school...which explained later on, was the issue. 
    I didn't think things would get serious with us, given that we were two entirely different people. I noticed he would always come to my house to hang out though and one day I just asked about it. Big mistake on my part. 

W and I went to his house to hang out. By his house, I mean his parents' house. 

(I need to mention we are pushing 30 years old at this point. By NO means am I poking fun at a 30 yo living with their parents, given the economy these days, but I am poking fun at a 30 yo living with their parents and NOT doing ANYTHING to rectify the situation.) 

His room was the size of a closet and hoarder status. The door could BARELY be open and it smelled like mold. I gave him the benefit of the doubt though. Again, my mistake. I figured he was like in school or something? Or maybe he just really couldn't afford to be out on his own and that was how he just had to live for the moment. I didn't really ask a ton of questions regarding it. I just felt like maybe it was best to hang out at my house. He said he worked seasonally and I never asked details. Again, I didn't think shit would get that serious with us.

A few weeks into seeing each other, I received an offer for a career advancement in a different State. I was not going to turn this offer down. Although unexpected timing, I knew I couldn't pass on this. So I communicated to W about my offer and that I was taking it. I let him know I had to move out of State for this offer. He understood, completely. 
   I moved to the new State. I kept in contact with W. When I first moved to my new said State, I felt lonely. I didn't know anyone. The pandemic had just started and shit was closing down. Right after I moved, we were all on lockdown. I had to go to work and then come home. Nothing more. 
  My new unit here in the new State was supposed to leave the country for a month. So, I asked W if he wanted to come take care of my house for a month. He obliged. He was excited to do so. 
  My unit canceled this tour due to the pandemic. No biggie. That meant I didn't have to leave the country as I just was starting my new civilian opportunity. So, it ended up working out. W and I agreed that he would come here for the visit. Why not? I didn't know anyone and could use the company. 

  March 23, W flew over to new State to visit me for the month. This is where it starts. 
   
   1.  The second day. I asked W if he needed anything put into the washer, as I was doing laundry for the day. He told me yes. But was weird about this ""Yes"" he had just given me. He stated that he had ""not made it to the bathroom in time."" I was taken aback by what had just been said to me. **This grown up man shit his pants...is that what he is telling me?** ""Is there a medical condition that causes this?"" I asked. He said, ""No, it happens sometimes. I just don't get up in time,"" he stated...or words to the effect. Needless to say, after this, I was lying to myself. I was trying so so hard to convince myself that this was completely normal. I was convincing myself it was just a one-time fluke. 

2.  About a week in, I was still going to work. I could not really take days off so he would make himself at home, which I was okay with. I didn't mind. He was doing me a favor by being home with my dog. Which was cool. I clean my house a lot. I bleach my bathroom, the toilets, the sink about twice a week. I've always done this in any house or barracks I live in. I like to be clean. Especially the kitchen and bathroom. Anyway, I was bleach the bathroom and clean before work and I would come home after a 16-hour shift at my hospital and the kitchen would be DESTROYED. Food left embedded on the stove, garbage full and multiple dirty dishes in the sink. My wine would also be completely empty. The toilet, after a few hours of bleaching it, would have shit-splatters on the lid. I would be so frustrated, but would never say anything. 

3.  So, you know how when normal people want to have hotdogs made, they boil them? Or am I the only one who has seen hotdogs being made this way? You DO boil them...right? He would put them in a frying pan and fry them. The odor it would leave behind was sickening. The smell of fried hot dogs would linger in my house for so long afterwards. He not only would fry hotdogs, but would NOT wash the black mess it would burn unto the pan afterwards. 

4.  I had purchased this fancy ""Martha Stewart"" kitchen cooking ware set. I am known as a cheap ass and I do not buy things I do not need. So this was a big deal. I had been saving up for this kitchen set. Beautiful. My favorite piece was my blue frying non-stick pan. I came home from an EIGHTEEN hour shift...and not only were things a mess...but my new frying pan...blackened...from the hotdogs he had FRIED. My wine was all gone too...he kept saying he would replace it, which he would, but then would drink that too. 

5.  Week 2... 
   I had been working overtime like crazy. I remember sitting on the couch and I told him, ""Man, I hope they don't completely tax my Overtime like they did last time."" He asked, ""They tax overtime?"" I don't know why this irked me as bad as it did. I asked him in return, ""Have you not ever worked overtime?"" He then stated, ""Well, I haven't technically had a job that wasn't under the table."" I was shocked. I said, ""What? So, you haven't ever had a job?"" He was like ""I mean, under the table, yes."" I was thrown off. 

6.  His mom packed his suitcase for him and his other accessories. 

7.   One morning, I woke up and started coffee. The shower was running and so I figured he was showering. Which was totally fine. He was beginning the stink anyway. I was happy he was in there. An hour passes by, the shower is still running. An hour and half and I'm thinking, ""What in the actual fuck is he doing in there for 90 minutes?"" ""I have a water bill that he clearly isn't helping with."" I knocked on the door. I politely told him to get out. I told him that the water costs money. He said okay. He came out of the bathroom, and his hair was straight dry. I was so CONFUSED. ""Why is your hair dry?"" I asked. ""Oh, I sometimes don't wash my hair in the shower."" ""But, you were in there for over an hour....your hair would naturally be wet from like condensation errr whatever, "" I responded. He didn't say anything. I thought this behavior was so fucking odd, but I didn't say anything. I didn't have time. I was working so much. 

8.  I then watched this boy eat cereal. He ate it in the bowl with a spoon and everything. But he NEVER put milk in it. He would eat it without milk, every single fucking time. To this day...this was probably the MOST irritating thing. 

9.  He didn't have any money and said that he came here on his ""savings"" which consisted of 150 dollars. I paid for EVERYTHING. Including the dinners that I had to make, the extra groceries I was buying to feed a 220 pound man and the money I knew I was putting away for the electric bill that month. For whatever reason, he still had money to buy the 24-pack of mountain dew every two days that he would drink. ALL 24 cans. Along with my two bottles of wine every day that he would empty, along with the beer. 

10.  Week 3... 
   I was off work but was ""on-call."" It was around 7pm. I received a call from work. The call would require me to only be there for 2 hours and then I would return home. It was nothing major. I left and told him that I would be gone for about 3 hours total. He acknowledged. (I should mention he would still continue to try to touch my leg and be close to me during these times and I was so damn annoyed that I couldn't stomach him touching me. I was counting the days he would leave.) I left the house. I came back about 3 hours later. The environment was weird in my home. The shower was running. I thought, ""maybe he is just taking a shower, hopefully it's not an extra long one like last time."" An hour goes by and I knock on the bathroom door. I didn't get a response. I knocked again, a little harder...still, no response. I pounded on the door, no response. I got it unlocked and got in. There was W, unconscious with his face on the toilet, empty alcohol bottles and completely unresponsive. I placed him the supine position and got him flat. I did what ANYONE in my profession would. I checked his airway, breathing and pulse. All were present. So, I rubbed his sternum pretty much as hard as I could. I was wanting him awake, but I also was angry with him. He semi woke up. I dragged him in the room and laid him in the recovery position on the floor. I kept him there and monitored him throughout the night. ( I Had to work the next day,) 

11.  The next day I went to work. I came home and spoke with him. I told him during the rest of his stay in my home, there will no longer be alcohol allowed. I made it VERY clear, no more alcohol in this house. He acknowledged that he understood. I came home from work the next day, came home and found beer cans, empty stashed away behind my couch. He mentioned that without alcohol he would get headaches. I'm unsure if he knew that this meant he had been dependent on it...that's what you would call an alcoholic. At this point, I wanted him out and away from my house. I was stressed and taking care of a man child. 

12.  He was try to talk to me and have FULL conversations while I was trying to watch my shows. 

13.  He would take food off of my plate without asking. 

14.  He did this whisper thing, LIke everytime he would stand up and go to another part of the house, ""He would whisper some random shit."" It was WEIRD. 

15.  I found myself picking up more shifts at the hospital, like, more than what I could handle. JUST to keep myself from wanting to strangle this person. W had no clue of what struggle meant. He had NEVER had a job and wasn't trying to live life. He was perfectly content living in his world where his parents was taking care of him and find without a job, a career goal or anything.

The majority of my friends have thousands of dollars in their bank accounts, granted they dont have the same barriers as i do. They aren’t in college and they are full citizens. One of them just bought their first car, 2020 model. The other ones are going on road trips every other month to places like new mexico, California, arizona. Not with their parents but on their own. 

It’s weird being in this situation where im still mostly dependent on my mom, doing homework every day while my friends are out traveling and working everyday and doing adult things. 

They’re doing way better than me, mentally and financially. One even tells me that he firmly believes that college is a waste of money and time.

468,"I (20 M) have a friend (24 F) who seems to be really strict following her religion. So she can't really (in her own words) interact with the opposite gender (that isn't her family). I fully respect that as I follow the same religion. 

I have a crush on her; and so I did what any guy would do and make my advances. Perhaps, I've gone too far as she currently is mad at me. She seemed discomforted by my previous advances, so I apologized (and she forgave me) and I toned it down a notch. We compromised that we can still go on as colleagues and friends. 

She keeps making it clear that she ""can't treat people special and that she treats people equally."" I was weirded out at first as I initially want to only be good friends. 

But now, it's honestly just absurd. She accused me of ""spying"" on her. It honestly sounds pretty childish. We have a WhatsApp group of just friends in class. One day she left without word. I asked her in class what's wrong. 

She told me that she changed her profile picture to an anime that she likes. Apparently, this meant a lot to her. Coincidentally, I watch the same anime and I changed my profile picture because I thought it was cool (not knowing she has changed her profile picture). She concluded that I (in her own words) ""have eyes"" on her. She also said that I made her uncomfortable and that she wishes not to elaborate more on that. 

Honestly, I thought my previous apologies to her were accepted and our compromise was mutually understood. After my apology, I even stopped talking with her privately (as I know she didn't like that). Even in class, we rarely talk. Yeah, I would joke around like everyone else to keep the online classes interesting. I thought everything was OK. 

Now, I'm accused of doing something I didn't do. I honestly feel like she always sees me as an enemy at first glance when all I want to do is have a good bond with her. She told me not to justify anything, so a dialogue can't be reached.

It feels so complicated. I don't even know if I still love her, but I still feel guilty. Maybe because I still respect her as a friend. 

I want to fix this. I simply want to talk with her. Exchange what's on our minds and figure this out together, like adults. 

I don't know where to go from here... 

What can I do? 

Should I get a third party involved as a mediator?

If I meet her again (we're in a program that will end soon. The teachers are planning to have a meeting (still unsure whether face to face or online) with the students after the program ends, because we've only seen each other through online classes. And we would just want to hang out and just talk about stuff other than school assignments.), how should I interact with her? What should I say? 

Should I just leave all this? Why?",23Jun2020,1
469,"Just some brief context;

 I work as night shift security guard at a very easygoing site for 4 years. When I started working here, he was very rude to me, by not speaking to me or answering radio, made homophobic comments(he thought I was gay, which I’m not). He said “gays should be dead” “ I hit a gay guy in the head and almost killed him in my last job”. That was his first convo with me, anyways I ignored it and kept working. 

Every time he talked, he was hating on the gays and implying I’m gay even though I told him I’m not. I complained to supervisor and his comments stopped but he was always looking for opportunities to get me fired. It’s really uncomfortable working with him and no one else is willing to swap shifts with me either on the same site. I have option of going to work at another site but It’s not as convenient as my current site; have to drive further, there is more work, dealing with people and patrolling. 

I really can’t decide. One site is perfect but have the sociopathic coworker other is more work and travel distance.",23Jun2020,1

14 F. I haven’t felt “okay” in over 9 months. suicide keeps popping in my mind. It’s comforting and very sad at the same time. I don’t want to think like this, I don’t want to die either.

471,"I'm going to start with a bit of backstory. I was diagnosed with Aspergers at 11 after I had lashed out a lot in school due to bullying getting kicked out of a private school. I got moved to a school for people with autism, some more functioning than others but I didn't like it. Didn't make any close friends, mostly just people I would play with and the education itself was minimal, mostly because I wasn't willing to participate in because I wasn't really thriving and they wouldn't really force me in any way so I didn't. I was sat in front of a PC for the most of the day and just watching Youtube and whatnot. Fast forward to I am done with that school and moved to another IT school also for people with special needs but a bit more ""serious"" but still I am not sure I will be able to use it for much. After going there a bit I got confirmed that I was missing a lot of basic educations by talking with some of my peers, education that is mandatory by the state to have such as algebra nor do I even know if I can handle it. 

So I have no clue where I'll be able to go in life, I could go to university but not only am I sure that I'm way behind and probably would come across a lot of concepts I would need to learn or re-learn or get what's called ""flexjob"" where the concept is that if you have a disability you get a job with less hours and the hours you work the workplace will pay while the state will make up the difference until it pays as a fulltime job. The kicker is it seems to be mindless busy work, pack shit down into boxes or cleaning. Not to shit on those jobs but it seems so pointless to have gone to an IT school for 3 years for it to turn around on that nor is it things I want to do for the rest of my life.

I also feel a bit guilty for complaining though since while it feels like I got fucked by a system but atleast I live in a country where I won't be completely fucked and probably do better than in a lot of other places.

All in all I feel angry and stuck and I don't know what to do.",23Jun2020,1
472,"For the past years, I've always been called an exceptional kid. I always went to the best schools and now I'm in this top 10 high school in the whole country and everything is great, I finally have friends, people that genuinely care about me, people in my class I go to parties with, etc, etc, but actually, I'm just lost. I have no idea where to go with my life next. I had this plan of going to study in Germany once but now I don't even know if that's a good idea. I'm probably going to go through with it bc I don't wanna stay in my home country as it is just one huge dump. Both politically and socially. 

And then there is the issue of choosing my major, I know this is something everyone struggles with but I have no idea what I should choose. For the past years, I told myself it'd be either programming or graphical design, but I suck at both, the only thing I've done with these is writing basic programs for some contests in 7th and 8th grade and have no motivation whatsoever to do anything else.

478,"Okay! So I’ve been dealing with dealing with depression and schizophrenia for a very long time, I’ve gotten help with it before, inpatient therapy and outpatient therapy, and it usually helps! But for quite some time, since Christmas actually, I have been slowly becoming more and more... well I don’t want to sound edgy or anything but um. insane?
There really isn’t any reason. 

   It started with intrusive thoughts like “Hey! You could totally cut yourself with that glass right there!” and I just kind of shrugged it off? They started becoming more and more intense and planned, at one point, I had a really long and thought out plan to kinda... cut my ear off I guess? I even started to hallucinate again. They used to never actually tell me to do anything! But yeah, they told me to do it over and over again. I ended up shrugging that off too.

   I think a month later my hallucinations got really bad. I would see people that looked really scary, I would feel things on my legs, and worst of all, I would hear like, inappropriate noises? (I was r*ped when I was younger so it makes me super uncomfortable) I really wanted to tell someone about it, but it seems every time I get a little sad or something, I get put back in the hospital, so I kept it a secret.

   Alright, so now, jump to a month before now. I don’t really know how it happened, I just got such a huge urge to hurt myself. I caved. I took a blade out of a razor, grabbed a few knives from the kitchen and just did whatever I felt like. It felt amazing! It seriously felt like a long adrenaline rush, I felt so powerful! I went to bed thinking about how great it was! When I woke up, I felt miserable. I was paranoid that my mom would see, or that she would just straight up ask if I hurt myself. But when it was night time, I did the same exact thing.

  So now about two weeks ago, I was doing my usual night time thing when I thought “hey, you should try something, something that’ll make you feel more alive than ever! Try to cut off your pinky!” And so that was my new task! First I was going to cut off the circulation (just to get in the mood I don’t know) so I did that. Then I was going stab it, and work from there. I got really deep, and was really feeling like I was going to do it! Then I saw this white stuff and I freaked out. So I stopped.
 
   The same night, my dumb brain said “Welp since that didn’t work you gotta overdose!” I didn’t want to! I remember sitting on the ground, thinking about overdosing, the voices kept getting really really clear, not muffly like usual, and they kept saying “come on do it!” “You can’t do anything! Come on!” I remember grabbing the bottle, looking at it, and that’s it.

  When I woke up, I felt horrible physically, I thought I was dehydrated or something, I couldn’t keep my eyes open and I couldn’t walk that well. After I drank water and ate, I still felt miserable. Then something clicked. I was pretty sure I overdosed. I checked the bottle and yeah, a lot of pills were gone. I felt horrible for a really really long time, but physically and mentally, but I didn’t tell anyone. I’m still not 100% I did it, like maybe I was sick or something, but I think that’s what happened.

(adjjkcjs sorry this is really long hhh)

  Okay so I’m gonna speed it up cus I feel a little rambly. I’m kinda sorta maybe taking more pills than I need to because I feel like I deserve the horrible feeling? I haven’t taken my antipsychotics in a really long time though, just because I feel a thrill when I when I hallucinate. Finally, after this many months, I realize that I need help.

So I guess my question is, how on earth do I tell my poor mom all this? How do I show her I show her my cuts and stabs? How do I explain what happened to my finger? And most of all, how do I tell her that it’s been going on this long? I’m sorry for rambling that much, but any advice is really good! If you need more details I will totally try my best to answer any questions! Thank you so much for reading my thing! ^^",23Jun2020,1
479,"Dont get me wrong, I'm very very lucky. We have a big house in the countryside, my parents have always been supportive and theres nothing really ""wrong"" at all on the surface. But I've generally hated living on a literal island with them and a bunch of mates who never had  any life ambitions, and parents who sometimes take it too far. I struggled a lot during my early years due to aspergers syndrome, and I definitely think that plays into why I hate this beautiful place so fucking much

 I've been away at university for the last 3 years, and would typically only come back for less than 2 weeks. I'm always expected to he around for childcare of younger siblings and housework. I'm fine with that. After that, my dad would shout over me at stupid trivial stuff, like leaving a box of cereal out. My stepmother is highly OCD and shes always stressed out about everything , and my dad is an incredibly busy person (who does make time for his kids). But I just feel as a 22 year old now, that their marriage is quite miserable. As a result they're always bickering and pissed off at each other. It does upset me to some degree as i do want both to be happy, but the other part of me says (fuck it just get out now).

I've been home for 3 weeks now, and today especially I've just grown completely sick of it. I like getting away from all the bitterness and general vibe at home. I used to he able to escape to my university flat up in Newcastle, however I am a graduate now and have nowhere else to go. I'm not sure if I'm an asshole for wanting to jump ship and be 22, but I cant shake off this depressed feeling I get whenever I'm on the island. As a result, I almost always smoke weed daily when I go home. Should i be this eager to leave? Am I a bad person for this?

Just for a little context: I live in somewhat homophobic country in eastern Europe. I met him in middle school, but our friendship didn't really kick off till we got to uni about 3 years later.

Now of course, since then I considered him to be almost a family to me, but since the pandemic begun I'm really not sure if it's not something more.

for about 6-7 months, I couldn’t sleep well. Idfk if its depression, I will never know because i never saw a therapist despite the fact that i tried ending my life in my school bathroom once (lol)  and other red flag shit my parents should have noticed. anyways I always sleep at around 8am, not that i want to, i just couldn’t sleepeven if i try to. my father noticed this and decided to warn me even if i try to explain that I didnt intend to be awake at 4am-ish. THAT WENT ON FOR MONTHS AND IM SO TIRED OF IT. just this morning i opened a family gc and saw my father shitting on my sleep sched to my mom and sibling. He said that I always try to pretend sleeping and he is so ~quick~ and ~silent~ that he caught me a few times (I NEVER TRY TO DODGE THAT IM JUST TRYING MY BEST TO TRY SLEEP),, then just switched to my brother about being a better son that sleeps regularly,, and i just ended up feeling shittier abt myself. its just a small issue but those situations applied to most of the things that happens between me and my parents. I absolutely want to tell them that I didnt mean to be like that, but everything i do ended up being a sick, evil shit in my parents’s eyes as if Im trying to fool, betray, or insult them.

492,"I'm not sure how to start this but here goes...  


Firstly, I have a large head, people say it doesn't look big but normal size hats are always a tight squeeze and helmets never fit me. (don't get me started on glasses)  


I've never really settled on a hairstyle, an undercut looks good as it makes my head look a little slimmer but my hair is super straight so doesn't hold any shape on it's own, meaning I have to fuck about with styling products to make it look not shit. I hate doing this, I like to be able to just get up, shower and go in a morning. I've had it buzzed off and had it down past my armpits and never really been settled on a hairstyle.  


My Dad's bald and I'm aware that I'll probably go the same way. No real hair loss yet though (although at certain angles under bright lights my hairline looks a bit transparent but I think this is just me looking for something that's not there yet) but I don't think this all stems from a hair loss thing as like I said I've buzzed it off a few times and don't hate how that looks on me it's just I feel a bit exposed with no hair at all (I've only recently been able to grow something that you could consider a beard so I've not tried shaved head/beard combo yet but I feel like my beard needs to be a bit fuller for that to work)  


About four years ago I found a XXL hat in a vintage shop, it fit like a glove but it was a trucker cap and not really my style, I bought it anyway (I've literally not found a hat that fits me since being 12/13 so it was a big deal) The label in the hat had the dimensions on (61-64cm) so I put them in google to try and find more larger hats. The selection wasn't the greatest but after some digging I found this site  [http://hown.co.kr/](http://hown.co.kr/) and ordered a few caps.  


Since then I've not had a day hatless, I love the security it offers in regards to wind/rain and my hair and the fact that I don't have to consider what's going on with my hair and in my head it helps mask the size of my head (whether it does or not, I don't know, like I said people have said the headsize thing is all in my head (sorry) but I have proof that it's larger because stuff doesn't fit). It also falls in line with my style, I wear a lot of workwear and utilitarian clothing so having a hat on doesn't look out of place (I'm not wearing a smart shirt, tie and trousers with a cap) But as I get a bit older, I'm realising that it's maybe a bit weird to have a hat on all the time, people have commented about it and I imagine that will only increase as time goes on. (I also think maybe people assume I'm balding)  


The issue is that now when I try and go out without a hat on I feel extremely uncomfortable and self conscious, I worry my hair has blown into a weird parting or just looks weird or that having my hair on show somehow makes my head look bigger. I'm constantly having to check my self in mirrors as I walk about or popping to the bathroom every half hour while I'm at work to make sure my hair doesn't look strange (it's just a bit shorter than shoulder length atm so no styling just parted)  


So... The advice I'm looking for is:  


a) Is wearing a hat all the time enough of an issue that I should care or should I just keep wearing a hat? FYI: I have since found a bucket hat and a couple of beanies that fit so I do change it up, not just the same baseball caps everyday.  


b) If I need to end my relationship with the hats, does anyone have any advice on how to do this? how to feel less aware of my hair and less self conscious about the fact it isn't secured in place?

495,"My sister, 46, is a single mother to a 4-year-old with a learning disability.  Two years ago, due to some things that aren't relevant to this post, I had decided not to renew the lease on my apartment.  My sister was behind on rent, so I moved in to make it a little easier.  She had recently gotten out of an abusive relationship, and claims that she is the way she is because of it.  But honestly, she's not that much different from what I've known her to be my whole life.  Regardless,  I can't stand the way she handles herself.  I don't know if I'm an asshole, or what.  She complains every day about being tired.  About every other week, she has a crying meltdown.  Periodically she gets mad at me for something, ususally some form of miscommunication.  

For example, a few mornings ago I went out to get some breakfast.  My sister was studying, and my niece was doing her own thing.  My niece of course starts following me around as I'm doing things, and is just kind of being a turd like kids do.  She does things she knows she's not supposed to, just for the attention.  That's just kid shit to me, no big deal.  Maybe I sounded annoyed telling her no, don't do that, blah blah.  But I didn't raise my voice even once.  My sister slams her laptop shut and comes into the kitchen and starts slamming things around.  So I just go to my room.  I can hear her saying things angrily, and hear a couple of fuck you's.  She stresses me out so I decide to take the dog out. I'm standing outside of the apt and she opens the front door, slams it, and locks it.  Luckily I had my keys.  I then decide to just go for a drive.  When I return home, she asks if I'm okay.  I said yeah, I just left because you were raging.  Apparently, she thought I felt obligated to watch my niece, and thought I was mad because of it.  I explain to her I was just feeling a little uptight, and yeah I was getting annoyed with her doing kid shit.  I don't know.  Later on, she apologizes for slamming stuff around and now things are back to normal.

This type of thing happens every few months.  I'm not going to say I do a lot, but I do a fair bit.  Pretty much all the cleaning.  I help with her kid.  I'm the only one who takes care of her dog.  I tell her since we're quarantined anyway and I'm not working, I don't mind at all if you ever want to go study for a few hours or need some time to yourself.  But she never asks me, she just cries about being tired and behind in school, how much she hates being a mother.  I feel like if I don't do enough, she starts acting crazy.  Plus, if she gets too frustrated with my niece, she will say some pretty awful things to her.  I want to leave, but I feel bad for my niece.  I don't know what to do, but the whole situation stresses me out.  At this point I start to feel anxious when my niece cries or misbehaves.   I don't know what to do.  I want to leave, but is that an asshole thing to do?",23Jun2020,1
496,"I'm 27, and ever since I've got my first part time job, I've been supporting my family members.

At first, I've investing everything so that my mom would get some monthly cash, but also giving a shit load of money to my dad and paying some other stuff for my grandparents. Now mom has a decent monthly income because of what I invested, and I don't really give her a lot of money anymore, but I keep giving to my dad, who's extremely irresponsible and needs money constantly for stupid shit. Even the money I send him for medicine and debts, he buys booze with it.

I'm not mad about helping them, I'm just mad about the fact that nobody acknowledges it. Nobody really knows I'm helping the other (although they suspect it). But even though I gave them almost all my money and missed out on a lot of things because of this, they judge me for not saving any money. How the fuck am I supposed to save when I give 30% of my pay to mom, 50% to my dad and now I'm supposed to live and eat and pay utilities from my 20% left. Like really, there were times when I couldn't even afford food. Sometimes I couldn't afford transportation to work and so on.

I mean, I've done pretty well with my life (career wise), I earn a decent amount of money now, and I might start saving some now, maybe, but I hate the fact that I'm being judged for helping them. And they won't even admit it, because they're like ""I have no idea what you have been doing with all your money"".

Ok, some advice would be nice, but mostly I wanted to vent a little bit. Thanks for reading.",23Jun2020,1
497,When I think of studying I think of doing hours at a time which makes hard to get myself to do it. Can I do shorter intervals like 20-30 mins at a time?,23Jun2020,1
498,"I know this sounds odd but hear me out.  I've heard of people being addicted to Falling in Love, flirting, the honeymoon phase, or even toxic relationships. I think I'm addicted to heartbreak? You know that feeling you get when someone you really love says something absolutely heart-wrenching? Like maybe the first time a significant other admitted to cheating? Your first ever break up. When a pet died or family member died? Those little shock waves of just sadness that go through your body. I crave those. Is this even possible? Or is it something else entirely? I think the ones I like the most are right as me and someone else start falling for each other, and then they admit they actually never felt anything and just leave. Is this an actual thing?",23Jun2020,1
499,"I have a lot of issues with earning money. I haven't been able to get a job and I honestly feel as if I won't be able to thanks to a few disorders I have (autism, anxiety, and couple others). Maybe I'll still try, but if it doesn't work out, there's other stuff that I've really wanted to do. I draw, craft, write stories and music, and lots of stuff, and I really wish I could make that my job. But every time I try, nobody's interested. I don't think it's that I lack skill. I'm not amazing or anything, but I think I'm pretty skilled. My best guess is that I'm just not social enough. Also, it seems my attempts actually turn out worse than failure. There are times where I managed to gain popularity with plenty of people liking my stuff and commenting about how cool it is. Yet, as soon as I say I'm selling that kind of stuff (which I think I set price to less than half of what it's really worth, at least according to another artist), there's litterally no reaction. Not even a like, not a comment, even when I post questions such as what people would like to see for sale and stuff. And it's like I lose a bit/most of my popularity every time I try this. I have to admit, sometimes I wound up starting over and doing something kind of new, hoping it would work this time, but so far it never has.

I don't think I'm doing anything wrong, honestly. If I am, I don't know what it is, because I literally researched how to do this stuff and followed every bit of advice as precisely as I can. I feel like I'm doing what other artists who are selling their works are doing, only they actually get buyers. And I notice they're always way more sociable and able to gain more popularity than I ever seem to be able to.

Is it just because I don't get online often and look at other peoples post, or like other posts, and comment? Do I have to? I don't think I can, honestly. It's not enjoyable and feels like a waste of so much time. I would much rather be working or spending time with my boyfriend and stuff. Is there a way I can still manage to succeed at this without having to do this stuff?",23Jun2020,1
500,"I have ruled it down to two school: one that I visited and one that I was unable to due to location (therefore I cannot compare campuses) and I am having a hard time deciding where to go. It's for an art related major by the way, not sure if that's relevant

I am asking for advice on how to chose where to go. The universities are in different countries (one in the UK, one in Belgium, the one in the UK being the one I was unable to visit). What criteria should I take in consideration to make my final decision? The one thing that's making me so indecisive is the fact that the uni in the UK offers a one year internship possibility, whereas the one in Belgium only three months. The one in the UK is also renowned for what I want to do (top 20 in the world excluding the US - but it's not particularly a good university in the UK). Another factor making me doubt is the fact that the uni in the UK is located in a very unsafe town, one of the worst in the UK, whereas the other school is in a town I visited and felt safe in.

501,"I'm a 17 yr ( M ), born and raised in Egypt, my family is lower middle class, never really bothered me, ever since I was young I got attracted to video games, let's say I would prefer to stay home rather go to a parents friend wedding, and as the years passed my addiction grew, now I must clear some things up, my father was somewhat of a gamer himself, thus he owned PS1, PS2 and a PC, when I was young I was centered around the PS2 and everything was fine, come to the part of my life where I got more into PC gaming, my father works as a teacher and does timetables for the school, thus he needs the PC for that, and I understood, the PC is in "" my Room "" ( 17 and still sleeping with my sister in the same room for some reason I wonder what ) [ its Egypt you sickos not Alabama ]
To make things short, my dad uses the PC as a TV, WE HAVE 3 SET OF TVs in the house excluding the PC, he stopped doing timetables, he just opens the PC, turns on some Program to allow him to run TV on it and just sits there, in my room.
Now I have suffered depression all my life, which became apparent to me when my mom passed away, everything in life felt it was useless, every emotion felt more and more like staged acting, I was more dead inside, except, when I was playing with my friends online, IRL and others.
I have offered to buy myself a PC but dad said that you already have a PC and you can upgrade it if you want, yea, just like the room I have. We would argue around random crap, like why am I using headphones while playing when we have speakers....
If you played any shooter game you would understand why its important to have them on, well he doesn't and says I'm gonna ruin the audio jack by constantly plugging in MY HEADPHONES to MY PC. The reason I'm writing this now is, I have gotten to a low point of my life once, and now I have feel myself going down that same path, I've gotten so close to just ending it all, to stop to emptiness inside my soul, I know you'd suggest help, I have already tried twice, and let me tell you, whatever you do, it still lingers, ready to come back.
There's also some family problem affecting me, my father would actually mock and bully me for random stuff, which is a habit my 6 year old sister started to pick up, my relatives where surprised how my younger sister treated me, before she was born even when I was young, my 15 yr sis now, would intentionally get me in trouble, and guess who was papa's favourite. Just not me, now I know why my mother would sometimes tell me to go get something for her whenever she felt he would pick on me or do something, my mom .... wanted me to stay with my aunt when she was at her dying bed, everyone seemed confused, hell I even was, I never realised how bad my actually sucked until she passed away, all because I lived most of my days in another world, where you would forget everything and only care about having a good time with your friends.

502,"Throwaway account, I am a 26 year old autistic female. I want to start off by saying I live in **one of the most violent cities in the world.** 

I live in a poor and **violent area** in this particular city. There was a shooting two hours ago a block from my house, and this is my everyday, *this is my reality*. It’s hard to wake up in the middle of the night and throw myself on the floor until the shooting stops. 

The violence here is growing immensely, there are days in which the news report ‘’yesterday it was the most violent day in the history of this country’’ and a few month later it’s the same headline.

I’ve been **trying hard**, as I’m sure a lot of people try here, to save money to leave this place, but it’s incredibly hard when the minimum wage is less than 7$US dollars a day in this country. For the past 5 years I’ve been studying, growing my skills, my portfolio and my experience to be able to land a job abroad.

For the past 3 years I found myself applying to 3-5 jobs a day non stop, and so far **no luck.** I know there are people in my situation that are experiencing this as well, it’s not easy, I understand. I do have a freelance job but it’s $75 US dollars a week for 14 hours a day, which is enough to eat but not to save to be able to leave.

This frustration is taking a toll on my body and my mental health, **I am depressed**, my stress and anxiety are making me lose my hair, I am very weak physically, and I’ve been told I look older than my age.

And it’s understandable, **no one should live like this**, I want to give myself an opportunity to start over in a safe country in which I will never have to hear shootings again. I want to keep trying, I want to be able to make it, I will make an effort everyday to make it come true. **But I don’t know how,** I have tried a lot of things and failed miserably.   


**I am desperate** for a solution.

I've lived with all females growing up, my grandma great aunt and 2 sisters. I have an older sister and a younger one, I care for them both. But growing up we 'experimented' with each other, I did with my older sister once and then she left the house. Then it was just me and my little sister and we did alot within a span of a year or 2, from oral to anal. Btw we weren't that old at the time I may have been 13 and she was 11. But then DCS took us from our grandma for other reasons, we went into the system and were separated. My little sister was touched by a grown man in the system but she's still a virgin, and I think it might be my fault that she wasn't too bothered by it. But anyways while in the system I had sex with alot of other females, and I got locked up in juvy usually u would think about females you wanna fuck when u get out but all I could think about was my sister... and after awhile i realized I was in love with her and I cant seem to shake it out of my head.

514,"Me (F 16) and my brother(18) have an overall healthy relationship. Obviously we’d get into physical squabbles when we were younger, but he hasn’t really intentionally hurt me for a couple of years. He’s always had a temper where he can scream and threaten me over really tiny things. 
I’ve told my parents for years that I feel he really needs therapy because my family is very against talking about feelings with each other. I was put in therapy when I was younger and I felt it really helped give me a lot of coping strategies. 

I guess I want to know if his actions are normal for his age? The most recent one, which prompted me to write this was about a week ago. My mum sent me to go wake him up so I went into his room and called him. He just groaned so I went over and when he didn’t respond, I nudged him. This is when he screamed and cursed at me. I was really shocked and just said “geez” before rushing away. Anyway, about 5 minutes later, I was in my room, with my back to the door. He came pounding in my room, clearly enraged. I didn’t face him because I just wanted him to leave so then he grabbed me and threw me onto the bed that was next to me. I never curse and only do it when something is seriously wrong so in this case I quickly got up and kept asking “what the f- are you doing?”. He’s 6’4 so I was absolutely terrified because he could literally flick me across the room. Every time I got up he would grab my arm and throw me to the floor really hard. I’ve never seen him so angry and the entire time he was shouting things like “you want to go!” And talking about how I invaded him by waking him up or something. I wanted to hit him back so bad but I felt like if I made one move he would knock me out cold. He seems to never realize his own strength or care about when he has seriously injured me. 

My dad ended up coming in and pulling him away and I only have a couple bruises on my arm so it wasn’t bad at all but it really just shook me. I asked my mum and she won’t send him to get counseling because she keeps saying that all teenage boys are like this and he’ll grow out of it. He’s never properly punched me in the face so I guess that’s a good sign. 

It would be really helpful if someone could tell me about their past experiences or whether his actions are simply a teenage phase. I guess none of my friends share similar stories so it could just feel like it’s abnormal when it’s actually not. Thanks for taking the time.",23Jun2020,1

Because of all this, I don't want them knowing anything about my mental health or me seeing a professional because I know anything and any insecurities I talk about will spread to my ENTIRE family whether I like it or not, and all my mom will do is call me bothersome as she already does.

Now the issue came when I went to go and make some lunch, and asked her what she wanted. She said she was okay and I asked if she was sure, and that I really didn’t mind making her something etc. -and she insisted so I dropped it because I didn’t want to be too pushy and upset her.

I kept offering her snacks throughout the day too, which she turned down. She told me she was planning on not eating for an entire week and I told her I didn’t think that was a good idea and again reiterated that I didn’t mind her having some of the food from my house, even if it was just a piece of fruit that she could manage (since even that’s better than nothing). She still refused.

I understand that I can’t just instantly cure her eating disorder by snapping my fingers, but I feel slightly responsible since she was at my house and I didnt push the issue as much as a really could. but on the other hand I really didn’t want to upset her by forcing her to eat and make her super uncomfortable.

521,"My boyfriend goes days without talking to me when we argue. It drives me absolutely insane. How can I deal with this?

Context: We are in a long distance relationship and have been for almost 2 months. We have yet to meet in person but he was planning to fly me out to his state in early July. In the last 2 months of us being together, he has shown some red flags but I have chose to ignore some of them because he has some really great qualities as well. His biggest red flag is that he can often go days without speaking to me after we’ve gotten into an argument. Our most recent one was 4 days ago where I was very sick and he told me I was being too short with him and that me being sick wasn’t an excuse to act “ differently “ towards him. I told him off after he told me that, because I think we can all agree that is super messed up. He replied to me telling him off 2 hours later saying how sorry he was and he knew he shouldn’t have behaved that way towards me. Since I was up all night dealing with my sickness I hadn’t slept so I took a nap before he apologized to me. When I saw his text 3 hours later all I replied was “ thanks😊” as I was still hurt. He says to me “ really? that’s all you have to say when I tell you how sorry I was? you know what, don’t even reply. have a good rest of your day.” I responded that I replied that way because I was still begging upset with how he treated me. And he has yet to contact me since and I haven’t reached out either as I feel it’s not my responsibility to make amends with him when this wasn’t my fault. Him not contacting me is hurting me and is making me feel abandoned. Even if he wants to cut ties with me I would appreciate a response from him at the very least. I also hate to admit how depressed I feel when he’s not in contact with me. Not sure if this matters at all either, but since our last conversation I saw he followed a girl with an onlyfans account on Twitter and bought content from her.

I always had a great relationship with my grandmother. Unfortunately, due to some severe health issues, she will be moving to a nursing home in the near future. She needs a respirator, can't walk anymore, and can't cook/bath/care for herself in general anymore. She's pretty happy with this decision, because many of her old friends are already in this specific nursing home. 

Here is the problem : she has 7 cats. I have like 5 cousins, 3 uncles and aunts, my sister and my parents, and none of them wants to take even one cat… They all say they don't have time, enough space, or simply they do not like cats. My aunt has the biggest garden I have ever seen, but she still refuses to even take one… I mean I can't force them to adopt a cat, BUT they are all pressuring me to take the 7 of them !!!!  

They all know I LOVE cats, I loved them since I was a child and even have a first aid certificate for cats and dogs. So they were all plotting to have me feel guilty about the fat of these poor cats...    


I would LOVE to take them all with me. I have known them for a while ! But I already have 2 cats (strays I rescued from the streets) and barely can afford to feed and care for the 3 of us.  I live in a tiny house (4 rooms). Vet bills are expensive. One of them has chronic gengivitis and needs daily treatement. I just can't afford to have 9 cats… I could maybe take 1 or 2, but not 7 ! 

 As much as I want to save them, I'm just not able to… One of my aunt even had the audacity to tell me ""Well if you refuse to take this responsability, then they'll just be euthanised !""   I don't get how they can be so heartless.   

I made some research and found a shelter where pets are not euthanised. I know it will break my grandmother's heart to see her cat go to a place she doesn't know, and it will break mine too to disappoint her. I would never have imagined myself abandon a pet …

Throughout quarantine, we had talked a bit over discord and I got to know her better and nothing was very awkward because it's online but now we are back at school my social awkwardness has started to show and she's really wanted me to stop being socially awkward and to be able to just communicate with her other people as well normally 

Bus rides home can be awkward and normal conversations with her can get weird 

Idk how to start and keep a normal conversation going and the last thing I want is to lose her for not being able to communicate properly 

She's the girl of my dreams and if you have the time id appreciate the help thanks",23Jun2020,1
524,"I don't know much about what he likes, all I know is card games, football, old songs and movies, funny stuff. According to what I knew I always tried to get him something that he'd like but it seems I never succeed. Once I got him a kinda cool looking lighter and a bullet keychain but he didn't use neither. Then I got him golden poker cards, he does play with them but I feel like it wasn't such a good gift, then this year I got him a hammer-lighter and 2 socks, one with peppers one with beer mugs, but he didn't really seem to like them, idk. He liked the car freshener tree my brother gave him. Maybe I don't understand him and he actually likes these gifts but I'm not sure, and whenever I ask him or any other relatives about what he'd like to get they say ""nothing"". What are some good presents I could give him? I have around 20$.",23Jun2020,1

527,"I live in supported accomodation, and finally have a regular support worker now after literal months of having, whoever was free at the time. 

I like going to the nudist beach and relaxing in the sunshine with nothing on. Tan lines look silly, and being nude is fun in the sun. But, im too nervous to go by myself in case something happens that I dont know how to deal with (im autistic). 

Would my support worker be allowed to accompany me at the beach? A chaperone I guess it would be called. I would just straight up ask but its not exactly something to just ask at random. I spoke to management about it not long ago, but thought now i have a regular support worker maybe i should bring it up again? how best to ask about it?",23Jun2020,1

530,"Hello,  
im a 23year old male and currently stuck deep in a ""sexual"" problem.  
I dont know how to to control the energy.

I got my heart broken many times in my teens(15-17) which led to living a single life for the past \~6 years.  
In those years i mainly focused on improving myself. For example: no more gaming, meditation, starting to study (with very good grades as this my main focus now.) etc. And it really helped me to mature a lot. But one thing got way worse as you read in the following paragraphs.

Also neglecting social life as well. This means I am not interested in clubs to party every weekend. Because I believe its just short term fun and your focus of improving oneself to your best form fades a bit. And my only friends are people who wana ONLY party or game.  
So... this led to having only 3 real friends. 

And... this led to mainly sitting at home and jerking off to porn etc. The thing is, I get shit done anyway, I learn a lot for university but sometimes a hard depression kicks in where I get anxienty. In such a moment I tell myself: I really need to stop watching porn and start to get a girlfriend.  
After a week of nofap I'm back to feeling good and horny. But in my mind, still is the thought, that I need to stop jerking off etc. But in the end i give in and do it anyway. In the beginning it isnt really that bad, but like I already said sometimes I fall back in depression and the whole cycle repeats forever.  
It seems wicked. 

But also what it has led to: putting a girl on a pedestal.   
And the thing that scares me the most is beeing nervous when dating a woman.   
The last two times (6 months ago) where I met mith an old friend (w). We chatted online for a long time(3years) before we met again and writing mainly dirty things but when we met I couldn't even kiss her, because I was so nervous.  At the 3rd date I finally kissed her and she said: ""Oh my god you are shaking so badly, why are you so nervous we have talked for so long about this."" A few months later she dumped me as I was progressing to a nice guy because she ghosted me.

Exact same thing happened as I met with my neighbour (w) 2 years ago secretly in the backyard.  
She said that I was shaking really bad when i touched her. We stayed out of tocuh and one year we met again secretly where we were making out and I was shaking again so badly with my head.  
But i didnt fall in love with her, she ist like a one night stand to me. But she sees my as the same thing.  
So its fine. We just dont chat so often. Currently she wants to have sex with me. But I am just  passive because I know I will be shaking again soo badly when we kiss. And i dont wana imagine how bad it will be when we have sex. And the funny thing is too that I dont wana have sex with her, beacuse she is a whore. She sleeps with everyone. Thats fact. And so she is toxic and I should stay away from her, but when I am horny I just wana have sex with her. 

*'But for long term I just wana have a girlfriend with good character and same interests to fall deeply in love and together beeing invincible and at some point marry her'* 

**TDLR**: I don't know what to do. I want to Nofap for months at least to reset my sexual mind, because I have a problems when dating girls as I get so freaking nervous and I objectify them. But at the same time I think: I shouldn't surpress my sexual energy. In my mind I concluded that I should transmute the energy in more productive things for example building a business. But I don't knwo if that works.

**Things maybe to add**: I am not ugly. It's rather other way around: I am handsome. All my female and MALE friends/classmates said at some point that I look pretty attractive (and the male friends are not gay lol). This made me somehow insecure because my brain has adapted to getting reward from just the looks and so subconsciously I tell myself I have to always good look and be confident because I am handsome. Which leads to being freaking insecure. 

Im fucked.",23Jun2020,1

It actually sucks to see someone living your unattainable dream.

536,"My friend and I got to know a man we've seen at our local beach for months. We felt attracted to him because of how friendly, cute, and shy he was (trying to speak our language and then giggling and apologizing)  and how good looking he was. We found out today after talking to him for a while that he is 39 years old. He asked for our ages first. I am a very cautious person but we've seen this man around so much, he raised puppies around his apartment and feeds stray dogs daily, he didn't 'come on to us' in a creepy way as all he did was say he saw us 4 nights ago at a restaurant and eventually asked for a way to contact us if ever we wanted to meet up and asked if we played snooker. After all of this, he told us to drive safely and that it was nice meeting us. I've attracted predators before and they never acted like this, he was much more hospitable and shy, it made me think he was about  29 years old if that makes sense. I know that it doesn't make a difference and that his intent is the same but I'm wondering if it's safe??",23Jun2020,1

539,i’m a 14 y/o girl. i’ve had unsupervised internet access since i was 6-7 which led to me finding out about chatrooms through youtube and even online games like club penguin etc when i was 6-7. god typing that out makes me feel sick. i remember going on omegle for fun and 30-60 year old men telling me to get naked and i would do it. i didn’t know what i was fucking doing. i used to have a online game themed youtube channel when i was really young and a ton of older men would message me asking me to send them pics and i feel so. ashamed? for doing it. i didn’t know it was wrong i didn’t know what sex or masturbation was. i didn’t have a parental figure or even parental controls on preventing this. they knew my age. it was obvious. i told them my real age and they didn’t fuckin care. they took advantage of how naive i was and how naive literal 7 year olds are and used it for their own sick pleasure. this continued until i was 13. knowing that i did shit like that is fucking horrendous. i feel sick just thinking about it. and told a couple of my friends about it and they just fuckin laughed and basically blamed me saying that “i should’ve used common sense” i didn’t fuckin know! telling me it’s hard to believe i “didn’t know”... i just don’t know what to do. it’s been eating me up inside. it’s embarrassing as hell and it’s all i can think about nowadays. i don’t know why and don’t know what to do.,23Jun2020,1

Im afraid it’s because it’s bad and i don’t want to make him talk about it because he’s clearly very upset. I feel so confused. I can’t even bring myself to cry or be upset anymore because it partially doesn’t feel real and i don’t know whether to be afraid or optimistic. I can’t even imagine how I’m going to feel when it sinks in and i watch my parent go through chemo. Should I tell my friends?

I know that if my grandfather gets sick, he will die from this. We’ve tried asking her to wear it properly and I even made her a new mask after she complained that hers didn’t fit right, but no luck, it’s still under her nose all the time. I’ve reached the point where I don’t want her in the house anymore because I think she’s too irresponsible to care for my grandfather, but my family is worried about the amount of work we’d have to do without her. I’m just kind of stuck. Does anybody have any advice?",23Jun2020,1
543," Tldr: my brother broke my face, my anxiety is driving me crazy, parents aren’t doing anything, considering getting back at him and then moving out immediately after

My(19f) brother(17) beat the shit out of me a few days ago. We got in a fight over something stupid and we were yelling at each other and then he just started punching me in the face. I have two black eyes, a broken nose, some bruises on the back of my head, other bruises too but those are the worst injuries. Pretty much the entire upper half of my face was swollen and bruised. He doesn't have any injuries that I know of. This is the worst he’s ever hurt me. A couple years ago he put my other sister (21) in the hospital and she ended up having to get stitches across her eyebrow she was pretty bruised up too. He's also slapped my 6yo niece so hard she had a mark on her face for the rest of the day, and then tried to lie about it. He’s younger than me but he’s a foot taller and way stronger, I’m 5ft tall 100lbs. 

I can’t begin to describe how frustrated I am with my parents. I was in my room crying and bleeding after this and my mom decided that that was the perfect time to tell me that she wanted to get a divorce. I have absolutely no idea why she thought that was a good time to tell me that. My dad hasn’t done anything to punish my brother at all. My brother was out hanging with his friends today, and my dad took him out to eat yesterday. My parents have told me they don’t condone what my brother did to me and that he was in the wrong. He keeps saying he was defending himself and it was self defense but he always comes out of these fights completely unscathed and he always throws the first punch. Even if i decided to start working out, I'd never be able to hold up in a fight against him he's so much bigger than me. Neither of my parents buy the self defense story. I feel like my parents are trying to sweep this under the rug and get things back to normal, but I don’t want to go back to just waiting around for my brother to lose it and break my face again.

I can barely sleep anymore, I’ve lost most of my appetite, I walk around my own home with mace on me. I can’t even be in the same room as my brother without my adrenaline kicking in. This fight was different than the other ones, I really thought he wasn’t going to stop. The anxiety is driving me crazy, I’ll just be sitting in my room and suddenly it feels like I’m getting punched in the face again and I can’t get the thought out of my head. 

I know that I can be bitchy sometimes but that's not an excuse to start punching me. I don’t want to see my brother for the rest of my life but I can’t move out until August. I can't do anything about my parents wanting a divorce, but I can make my brother's life harder for him. I’ve never been big on revenge but I’m seriously considering it right now. He has an Xbox +games, a TV in his room, and a really expensive computer setup. My plan is to sell his tech and give the money to my parents (I had to get some kind of scan for the doctors for my face and it was pretty expensive, I feel terrible about it) and then donate his hat collection and all his shirts, pants, and shoes the next time he goes out with his friends, and then move out immediately. I don't plan on coming back until my parents kick him out when he turns 18. I don’t want to make things worse, but the way things have been going, he keeps beating smaller women in his family and then gets off scott free, I hate this. I told my parents about my plan and they said they were alright with it, but I only think that's because they don’t believe I’ll go through with it and they aren't directly involved in it. I’m so confused, embarrassed, anxious, and angry, I don’t know how to handle these feelings and I’ve never wanted to get back at someone so bad in my entire life. What should I do?

I’m sorry if this ends up poorly written, I’m pretty emotional right now and also on pain pills.",23Jun2020,1
544,"Hello, I'm sure it's pretty standard, but I'm going to be using a throwaway account for personal reasons. This post is marked nsfw because I mention some past trauma that some may not be comfortable reading. **Speaking of, possible trigger warnings ahead: sexual assault**

I've been in a serious relationship for 2 years with a guy I love more than I ever thought I was capable of loving. My boyfriend is very understanding of my feelings and wants. Never once has he pressured me to have sex, nor insinuated that I should unless it was in appropriate response to a joke I throw or us teasing each other for giggles. We've almost had sex already a couple of times already but each time we have gotten close to having sex, I have asked him to stop, and we will follow-up with cuddles. I want to emphasize his self control and respect of my anatomy, something I have never had the privilege of in the past. He knows that as much as I want to, if I'm not ready he will wait, and the last thing he wants is for me to regret something he wants to be special.

My boyfriend is not a virgin. He hasn't had sex in quite some time though, and because of it isn't worried about waiting.

To get to the real dilemma, I was raised in a fairly Christian household (my parents weren't both as religious until I entered junior high) and molested multiple times when I was a child and almost raped once. This event was something I thought I had gotten over, but in recent years (before I met him) I have been struggling with PTSD and have had episodes of extreme uncomfortable with my body and how I struggle to see myself as an actual person. My boyfriend knows this and encourages me to seek help while reminding me that although he would like to have sex because he loves me, and wants to express so, he would wait forever if it meant I was safe and happy. It's also because of him that I found the courage to confess to my parents what was done to me.

*I do* feel much more safe since being with him. I have eased into the concept of sleeping with him more and more over the course of our relationship, but I also have religious guilt. Almost entirely because of trust issues and my previous lack of interest in being in a relationship, I always thought being a virgin until marriage was what I wanted. A small part of me still does want it, but I feel like it's the guilty part? The thing is I want to be with this man for the rest of my life. We have both discussed this with each other and share many other wants for our relationship. Since I plan to marry him one day anyway, is it worth waiting? 

The last thing I want is to regret it and upset him. But also, I don't want to regret NOT sleeping with him. But also a part of me feels bad not having sex with him because of how wonderful he has been to me. I've expressed all of this with me and he tells me not to stress and that we have all the time in the world for when I'm ready. What should I do?",23Jun2020,1
545,"I tend to put off learning or doing new stuff because of my “what’s the point” mentality. Like, what’s the point of reading that book on the history of China? It’s not going to be practically useful to me in anyway. Or what’s the point of trying to paint watercolour? You’re not gonna make a career out of it anyway. Yeah, i’m interested, but could my time be better spent doing something else that would benefit me practically?

I’m trying to change that mindset and get into doing things purely for the interest and fun of it but damn it’s hard. Sometimes i start and then in the midst of it i start to feel like “ok, how can we make this productive/useful?” 

It’s like everything i do needs to have an end goal. I know that’s not necessarily a bad thing, but too much of a good thing is bad too. And it suddenly puts a certain amount of pressure on an activity that was meant to be relaxing and fun.

Would love to hear some thoughts and advice on this!",23Jun2020,1
546,"This question needs some back story. This friend of mine started off as a girlfriend two years ago. We met online and we broke up a few months later but have stayed friends. Not too long after our breakup, a girl who I had like earlier and still liked asked me out and o said yes, we are still dating (almost two years). Me and (Im gunna call her Sharon, my ex/ friend) have gone through a lot and I’ve been by her side through a few bad relationships, some family problems, and some depressive episodes. And she’s been here for some of my depressive episodes, some substance use and some emotional/personal problems of mine.

Recently my friend Sharon got a new boyfriend, who wasn’t treating her how she deserved (levering her on open for hours, not telling her where he was, ignoring her, etc.

She was coming to me about these problems and I knew she wouldn’t be able to have a talk with him seriously unless she went in with the intention to end the relationship. So I convinced her that how she was being treated was not healthy and she really needed to consider what was going on. (It was not my goal or intention to have them break up, just to push her to talk) And so she went and talked him. And they came out better than ever which is what I had hoped for. But after that, she started to leave me behind. She would say she was busy or out with him, and I understand that, I don’t need to talk to her 24/7, but it went from being her closest friend, to it seeming like I don’t even have a part of her circle anymore. She hardly talks to me, and when she does it’s not about any of the deep stuff that helped to build our relationship, it’s all surface level bs. I don’t know, maybe I’m being paranoid but I think she’s leaving me behind as a friend, and I don’t want that. I just don’t know what to do.",23Jun2020,1

When we had no place to go in my hometown state my sister took both me, my brother and my three dogs in. She is in the military so we’re living pretty alright. She got new orders for next year in March, so either I stay in Texas or I go back to my hometown. The problem is the help I’m gonna receive is gonna be the same in both. I won’t have none. 

I currently graduated high school, and am saving up for a car to get a better job. One that could potentially keep me stable on my own. But as of right now I’m just left with the thought of letting everyone and myself down.

When she leaves I will need to care for my brother and my dogs. My brother is going to be a senior next year and when he graduates he wants to go into the military. I’m going to be alone. I’m afraid I won’t be able to do it on my own. I’m afraid of being alone in this big state. I plan on going to college but how can I do that if all of my money is gonna go to bills.

551,"The contract I signed for this new rental (a trailer) states that I must maintain the lawn. It is defined as mowing, keeping sidewalks clear). Problem is that they never landscaped the ground (this was around shut down time) and now the lot is just an overgrown construction site with big rocks, chunks of wood, plastic, metal, etc. 
My partner and I are more than willing to maintain a lawn, and I bought a mower shortly after moving in to be ready, but the first time we tried...terrible. Clay dust clouds, rocks flinging, grinding our blades, etc. We talked to the maintenance woman who told us there wasn’t much we can do till it is landscaped so we sighed in relief, knowing that they were aware it wasn’t ready. 
She has been to our lot twice to weed whack the growth down, but the lot is not landscaped yet and not a lawn - just huge ugly weeds and potential blade-killers.
Yesterday we got a notice on our door with a printout of the page where I initialed saying that I would maintain the lawn under contract. It reminds us that if they have to send someone out to do it, we will be billed. 
But we physically cannot work with this land. If we push a mower over it, we’ll likely damage our machine, hurt ourselves or others from the rocks, or damage nearby homes from whatever projectiles get flung. Nowhere in the lease does it say that we have to landscape it ourselves, and that isn’t even a general tenant responsibility anyway, especially since we only have a year lease. 
I want to write an email explaining the conversation maintenance had with us (and a member from the office was present then too), and outline that the lease states we are to maintain a lawn, not work an overgrown build site. But I’m afraid I’m being a Karen and using semantics will leave me with little ground to stand on. How can I go about responding ... if I even should?

My coworkers suggested I take a shit ton of pictures, which we will do. They also suggested that I bring a landscaping team in for an estimate and attach the estimate to my email to pull a “if you don’t landscape, we will hire someone and send you the bill if you prefer.” Method. That sounds ballsy, but I like the “You have to finish what you started” hardass approach. So far people thing my landlord is pulling a fast one...but I don’t know.

555,"He just sits on his chair all day every day. On his iPad watching the tv. Doesn’t speak much. Sighs constantly (this drives me fucking crazy). But if I do something inside or outside the house, that’s when he wants to get involved. He never does anything of his own accord. 

But then, if I suggest doing something, he makes up an excuse why he’s too busy or something. 

It honestly just feels to me like he’s playing some fucking weird game of tyranny in his head or something. He seems to want to always know what I’m doing, where I am, what I spend my money on. But he just sits there, all the time. Even during lockdown in the past months, nothing, no keenness to do anything, just sits there with a numb mind.

557,"Two years ago I started an apprenticeship working in a nursery. I left after five months for two reasons that mixed together. 

1) My mental health was so bad that I felt overwhelmed with my work.

2) I felt disrespected by my coworkers 

I was supposed to be working part time but my manager had me doing 40 hours a week and when I asked for this to be reduced to help with my stress/mental health she said I was in no position to request such a thing as I was a trainee. 

Is this a valid reason to put on a job application? 

After leaving the apprenticeship I went to college to get a childcare qualification and I am applying to a different nursery now. 

I’m worried my leaving a nursery in the past before completing the apprenticeship will damage my chance of getting in, but I’ve grown and learned a lot in the past two years (and I have the qualification to prove it) and my mental health is no longer a problem",23Jun2020,1
558,"Hi folks,

So I'm writing this post after my daily trawl through my LinkedIn feed.

An entire digital ream of people talking about how wonderful they are and sharing things other people have said about them saying how wonderful they are.

I find it all massively obnoxious.

I'm in business for myself, however, and so get a lot of value out of LinkedIn. Connecting with people there is nice. But I cannot bring myself to post ""recommendations"" from others on my page.

I'm good at what I do and *have* a pool of referees who are both available for contact and who have given me testimonials.

However I'm really worried that I need to be joining the relentless bandwagon of people droning on and on about how wonderful they are. Otherwise, perhaps people are assuming that I must not be that wonderful as if I were surely I too would be sharing a bunch of self-promotional messages.

565,"So Ive been in love with this girl for almost a year,I have told her twice that i like her.The first time she left me on read for the whole day which broke my heart.Turns out she told my Best friend at school since they have first period together.And he was defending her saying she felt bad and that she took the day off to think which is why she didn’t reply.And i was emotional that day and i couldn’t deal with it so i was just all over the place with a cold heart.Couple days go by we talk,she told me that shes not ready for a relationship.And i understood since she has not been mentally great during that time.And after we basically didn’t talk as much for 3 months since our relationship changed which hurt me alot.January she starts texting me more but to only talk about her problems and i felt used and i told her how i felt that she only talks to me when she has problems and i felt used,so we took a 2 week break for our friendship and made up after.February i find out she has feelings for me and so have i the whole time.We Flirted and called which made me happy.I ended up setting up a surprise promposal and she said yes and i was so happy.The Next week was Valentine’s Day we were supposed to go out,Her mom was fine with it but her dad was not.We ended up having to cancel our first date.Valentines day came up and i planned another surprise with a letter telling her that she means so much to me and that i want to be with her.I never get an answer which stresses me out.She was happy about it and liked it.But she started getting distant.I told her how i felt and she told me that shes a busy person and she cant fit a relationship right now, which broke me and got me to the lowest.March i am still heart broken and i texted her asking if she still wanted to go to prom cause i didn’t want her to go with me if she didn’t truly want to.and she replied with “up 2 you” and that just showed she really doesn’t care at all and i confronted her on that and told her that just because she doesn’t want to date me doesn’t me she can push me to the side and treat me like shit after i was there for her every night she needed me no hesitation.She leaves me on read of course and Then the next day we go into quarantine and they ended up cancelling Prom the same day.I didn’t speak for her for a whole Month and a half.Until one day i texted her apologizing for the way i texted her.She apologized as-well and Since then We have gotten closer LIKE really close.We usually FaceTime 3-4 times a week and talk for hours.I found out that the same she was gonna text me as-well to apologize.I cant tell if she feels like she likes me again or just as a friend.She gives me mixed signals and its really hard to tell somedays.Im too scared to tell after the first 2 times didn’t go well and every day i haven’t told her my heart starts aching A lot and its hurts i dont know what to do if i should tell her or just move on.I am 17 and shes 16 and i love her but dont know what to do now.",23Jun2020,1
566,"So to start off, I have two best friends that I consider family. They're both married and I've been close with the husband (let's call him JJ) for 10+ years, and I've been close with the wife (let's call her M) for 5 years. They're having a baby on the way and I was super excited to hear about it. I was especially excited when they both told me I would be the Godmother. They're at the end of the second trimester and things have changed ever since the M got pregnant. I remember one time specifically I was worried about something and M yelled at me for being worried. When I asked her if she could please stop yelling because I was having a panic attack because of that, she told me that it was tough love. I told her it was unhealthy to yell the way she did and I'm traumatized for it because my dad did that a lot when I was younger (my father is very abusive to me). Fast forward to last month, I was venting because my dad did something I didn't appreciate, and usually whenever my dad does something I go to them because there's nothing I can do no matter how much I try to stand up for myself. I can't go to the police and I can't tell my mother about it either. To save myself from a very long explanation, my mom wants to divorce my dad because he's a jerk (he's not abusive to my mom), however the fact that me and my brother still live in the house she financially can't leave. She would be destroyed if I told my mom what my dad does because it will get worse and we will more than likely be on the streets if something was to happen. So I try to push forward until I can get the money to move out. I've always told thos to JJ and M, but instead of being supportive like usual, M blamed my mother for it even though I told her multiple times that my mom doesn't know the abuse my dad put me through. He just shows that he's a jerk to and she literally can't leave financially until we (my brother and I) leave. M started calling my mom a bad mom even though my mother has been nothing but an angel to my brother and I, the best mother for us. She didn't care, she continued to try and insult my mother. Instead of explaining myself any further, I put my foot down and told her the whole situation again and nobody needs to insult my mother. After that she said sorry, but then she started to blame me. After she blamed me she told me that I can't be a Godmother to her child anymore because of my dad. She felt that I would act just the same as him, even though she would always tell me I'm one of the sweetest people she ever met and she trusts me with her child. That changed because of my dad, even though I would never bring her child around my dad and the only time I would change my personality is to continue to be sweet. She also thinks I don't care about her baby because I'm not going to be able to see her kid (even though we're in the middle of a pandemic, the hospital would only allow one person to be with her, and I have a very low immune system, so it would be dangerous to me and her regardless) I dropped it after that because I figured she's just having a rough time with the pregnancy. I was confused why JJ didn't stand up for me because he's known me for a long time and can confirm I would never act like my dad. Fast forward to two days ago. JJ started arguing with me about how I'm not going to town and stuff like that (like going out to eat and stuff) because I'm scared of the corona. As I explained above, I have a low immune system so it's not a good idea. This isn't the first time and he basically told me I was wrong for staying at home. Every single time I asked him to please respect my choice and to drop it all together, but he continued to do it. He was also complaining that I don't listen to his advice when 1.) I told him usually I want to figure things out for myself, I just need to vent and if i want advice I will ask for it because I just need a listening ear, and 2.) I told him that sometimes whenever we give each other advice, the advice isn't always right. If I gave advice that wasn't right, I don't say anything about it except that I'm glad everything worked out. If he gave advice that wasn't right, he tells me I don't listen to him...it feels like he expect to tell me what to do or something. Also whenever we have a serious conversation, and both of them do this, if I think they're doing something that I sense is wrong I tell them but i also explain that I'm not perfect either and i explain my mistakes.

569,"Hey y’all, I need some advice. Also, I’m on mobile and have a tendency for run-ons so beware. 

So because of the quarantine, school was cancelled and other activities I usually do throughout the week have been paused, so obviously I have gained a little weight. Not a lot, but it is noticeable on my arms and my stomach.  I have a poor self-image to begin with so this new weight has made me plummet into more unhealthy eating and staying in bed all day. 

Recently, I decided I want to be healthier (starting yoga again, going for walks and swimming etc), but I’m still struggling with my eating habits. This has resulted in my mom ‘congratulating’ me whenever I eat something healthy like a salad or a homemade meal, saying stuff like “see, eating healthy is still tasty” and “you should come out of your room more often because then you are more active”. For whatever reason this makes me extremely uncomfortable and I feel like crawling back into bed and eating junk. 

I just don’t know how to bring this up to her because it feels stupid and to be honest we don’t have a great relationship because she won’t ever blame herself for anything, like it’s always my fault that I feel someway. This attitude has made me kind of resent her, to the point where I won’t let her touch me or express her ‘love’ for me (if that makes sense). 

She also tends to complain to myself and my sister whenever we eat the food in the house, saying we have no self control and we need to stop eating constantly. I don’t understand this because when you buy food, don’t you eat it???Like I get it, sometimes we binge, but it’s not like we are doing this constantly and we aren’t eating pounds of food at once, more like 3 cookies instead of 1 or 2 (small cookies which I made). 

Does anyone know how to bring this up without making it seem like I’m blaming her? I feel exhausted and pressured constantly to be better, but it just stresses me out and then I eat and then I hate myself, it’s a vicious cycle.

Sometimes I feel ok, but lately I have started working out, and for some reason it makes me feel worse about my body. Idk, I'm fucking crazy I guess. 

But let's get to the story - Me and my friends were at a bar (it's legal btw). I love socializing and drinking and just talking with all kinds of people, and I was honestly having a good time. Now, my friends are a bit younger than me, ranging from 16 to 18. This is because I went to the ninth grade twice and also boarding school, but this normally isn't really a problem, I just find some of my friends a bit.. childish sometimes. 

But there we were, all having fun, getting a little drunk. And then some of my friends started to play this ""game"" I guess, where you rate your own looks from 1 to 10. This is the childish part. Quite a simple game, I wasn't really listening, and then they asked me how I would rate myself. I was, again, a little drunk and felt caught off guard, and then just said the numbers that appeared in my head. 

""I'm like.. a 3/4?""  - And that's IS what I think. I'm not like.. really fucking ugly, but you know.. okay yes, I am really fucking ugly. And not that you *need* to be beautiful, I try not to judge others on their looks, but you know.. I'm sooo average at best. 

But they reacted as if I had just said that I wanted to end myself. Like, they were so shocked, and then they told me that there was no need to be dramatic, and that I didn't need to ruin the mood by making everbody feel bad for me becaue of my bad self esteem. Some of the boys tried to tell me that I was not at all a 4, but they just said that because of the whole feel-bad-for-OP-vibe. 

Then I just got up and left, and cried on the way home. It wasn't my intention to ruin the mood, I just said the numbers that came into my head, and now they (mostly the other girls, not really the guys) are avoiding me and calling me an attentionwhore. What the actual fuck. They say that it's annoyng that I always talk badly about myself, but I don't even talk about myself ever because I litterally have nothing good to say, so why would I say anything?

Guys, I need advice on how to handle this. Am I being stupid? How can I make everything good with my friends again? Should I just lie the next time someone asks me and say that i'm a 10?

They made a lot of stories about us too, which some of our neighbors believed. 

They get so mad when they are ignored. I think they have a mental issue and it triggers them. 

On the day of the mediation, how should I go about this?

592,"I’ve lacked motivation a lot of my life and only a small handful of things I can remember giving my all. I’ve tried my best to force myself but I can never find the right reasons to do anything. For example, I know how to work out and how to diet correctly to lose weight, but I hugely struggle to make it through the month. I’ve always been pushed to do things by my family very aggressively so I never learnt to motivate myself properly. Now with Quarantine i’m beating myself up about it badly.

595,"This guy I’m seeing is a aspiring film writer and he often asks me to read his scripts and give him feed back on them. Outside of this he is wonderful, but he insists that I read them. Now the problem is their bad, their VERY BAD. He’s not a terrible writer, he’s just terrible at what he chooses to write about. He tries to write these humor pieces that are literally the OPPOSITE of funny. And it is so incredibly off-putting. Like I find myself literally getting less and less attracted to him everytime he essentially “passively coerces me” into reading his stuff.  

Its even more offensive to me because I am a film student, so I know what good scripts look like and having to keep reading bad ones and being unable to give any real constructive criticism on it is borderline unbearable. He always asks me what I think and I can never tell him what I actually think I’m just a hostage essentially. I try my best to visually communicate how uncomfortable it makes me praying to god that he’ll get a clue but he never does.

I was, and still am scared of my self and regretting ever feeling like that since.

My confidence is at a good level when I go out I really don’t care what people think about me I know that I look decent. With confidence that I gained I just wanted to talk to girls and see wether I could hold a conversation. Yesterday was a great example because I didn’t approach those two girls. That night I went to bed and had a dream. It was on a escalator and I saw this beautiful girl and I said “do you have a boy..” and she repeated me with this face. The face was basically don’t bother me. After that the dream went on and it didn’t bother me. When I woke up I was like what was the dream trying to tell me. I came with a conclusion that I should always take the chance because if it goes wrong I won’t hold a grudge I will respect her decision. Point of the story I have to take the chance.

601,"Hi this is something I’ve been feeling for a few months now however, Is it normal to feel nauseous when you think about somebody that you used to love that broke your heart. I am not currently lovesick because I’m  over that person but even though I’m over this person, when I think about them I feel nauseous. 
How can I feel nauseous about somebody that I used to think was like the most gorgeous person on this planet.
But the plot  twist is this person actually isn’t a bad person in actuality they’re still one of my closest friends that I talk to daily. 
I would understand if this person was abusive or toxic but other than occasional arguments which I admit that I may have fueled a very long time ago, they’ve always been a very caring and wise friend. So why when think about how I use to feel romantically about them do l feel nauseous? Personally, It feels like my body physically will not let me think about this person in a romantic way anymore, which is a good thing for me because it helps me get over this person but I don’t understand why or how this is happening.

Im still in touch with a lot of people from high school, the ones I am in touch with are engaged, house of their own, kids etc.. they seem to be doing really well in life and don’t get me wrong I’m happy for them all (the kids are cuties!) 
I HOWEVER am still living at home, single, but I work. 
I spent my childhood in a mixture of abuse and being a parent to my younger siblings (not much of a childhood!) at 16 I started working full time and was also adopted by an family friend, life has been great since then but now that I’m 25 I’ve noticed that I’m not at the same stage in life as everyone else my age. 
My adopted mum (AM) has always tried to give me the childhood experiences I missed out on (paper mache, baking cakes, theme parks etc) I’m definitely my AM’s baby girl but some people do mistakes me for a teenager instead of an adult.

607,"I (21F) know this question is a bit selfish. I'm the first person to admit I could have been a lot more supportive towards my sister (17F) who was diagnosed with depression three years ago and PDA this past year. I myself have also recently been diagnosed with PTSD due to a separate incident that happened a few years ago. 

As selfish as it sounds, I have to admit that I find being around my sister very difficult and suffocating. She gets very upset when I go into the living room if she's trying to focus on something (often crafts or sewing) and often aggressively demands that I go nowhere near her (which has been incredibly tough during lockdown) and gets upset and angry when she can hear me in my room, especially if I'm making noise via playing music or talking on the phone. I am a university student and currently have my classes online and this has proven quite difficult. My mum is very good at calming her down but is at work during the day. 

Because of this, I spend a lot of time in my room away from the rest of my family, and am starting to feel incredibly isolated. Recently I've started to have panic attacks when my sister gets upset with me as she can often bang on doors and throw things at me which seems to be triggering elements of my PTSD. I've tried to gently approach this with her and asked her what I can do to make sure I'm not disturbing her whilst still being able to go about my (currently virtual) life and studies and the only response I get is either pushes or to be told to go away. She does not like me talking to her at all and she seems to wish I didn't exist. We also have a brother who's 16 but I'm the only person in the household she treats like this. 

I hate to say this but I love my sister, but I do not like her. I feel completely hated by her and I don't know how to go about my own life without making hers harder. My mum thinks she may have another mental health illness or disorder which is yet to be diagnosed which causes this, but until then, how can I support her/live with her without causing further problems for either of us?",23Jun2020,1

**1)** side question before main question - would it actually be okay to be friends with someone like that? And would that friendship have to hinge on the answer to my next question?

**2)** what I'm wondering is if i should tell them how old i am - i'm scared to do this because y'know unknown and ""ohh what if this person judges me for being so bad at art at my age"" or is like ""this person is old blah blah"" and I'm forever shunned jesusvhrist that actually sounds ridiculous now that i type it or like ""somehow they mircaulously find out im this old and they're like ew oh shiz omg creep alert why didn't you just tell me how old you were"" like it is legit only a person i've said like 3 sentences to and im fucked up over this one thing as if we're going to be best buds or something or im suddenly the designated ""older guidance person whatever"" that has to look after this person as if they can't look after themselves like im suddenly responsible for this person

**3)** can i just go on with my happy life posting every so often with my own safety and privacy intact, not revealing my age, while also being able to say a few words to fellow users if they should like to reach out to me?

613,"He started a new job today. The 7th one just this year alone. Knowing the job for the week, I doubt he’s going to last a week. 

Every job he’s been to, it’s been three reasons : 

1.) I don’t like the boss, he’s an asshole, jerk, dosent teach etc. 
2.) I can’t get along with the coworkers, they all quit within a day etc. 
3.) I don’t like the hours, it’s too long, short , i don’t get paid enough etc. 

I begged him to stay until he gets a job lined up but always quit without backup. It’s starting to financially ruin us. He’s already filing Bankruptcy. It’s growing a lot of resentment on me. He use to be this ambitious guy but now he’s just full of anxiety. He’s told me he rather stay home because then he can “control” his anxiety.  He also did this last year with a total 10 jobs. I don’t think my anxiety can handle his anymore. 

I want him to get therapy and he’s mentioned before he should but says only if his “insurance” can cover it. So that’s been a uphill battle. 

I’m not considering trying to get a second job but I want to start college soon. He wants me
To go to college but thing is, how can I if he keeps quitting jobs?

I am not a heavy drinker, maybe a drink or 2 every other week with friends, and maybe once a year I get drunk but make a point of sleeping at a friend's so she isn't involved.

616,"I have a friend who I've known for about 9 years now. We were pretty close the first few years of our friendship and only had a couple friends each. We now have a circle of mutual friends we usually hang out with. I understand completely that it's normal to outgrow friends and everyone has a preference for the kinds of people they want to be around. However, sometimes I don't know where I stand. 

When we're one on one, we joke, talk about stuff that isn't superficial, we have a good balance... since they don't initiate one on one's much anymore and I realized I was the only one asking, I usually only ""hang out"" with her when our friend group does something together. In group settings it's like I have to fight to be part of any conversation with them. I feel quite alienated. I don't expect to be each of my friends' closest friend, but that doesn't mean I don't deserve some kind of effort in return right? I don't have a BAD time but I constantly feel like i'm a burden cause our friend group seems to be closer to eachother than I am with them. I am comfortable in my own company and I don't base my worth off of how many friends I have, but I can't help but feel hurt when I seem to care more about certain people than they care for me. Again, I am probably outgrowing them but I don't have any bad blood with anyone so I stay because I still care.

Anyways, pandemic and all, my friend and I text occasionally and most of our interactions come from social media. I post a lot more on instagram now cause of quarantine- my friends are the only ones who follow me so I use it as a public daily diary of some sort. Well, I started to realize that my friend usually only comments on my posts to talk about themselves. Yeah usually I wouldn't care but it's quite constant. Really if I mention /anything/ new going on with me, like if I bought a new pair of shoes or I started going to the gym, or I finally went back to my favorite store, they make a point to comment that they've done whatever I did ""the other day."" or that ""i've been thinking about doing that for a while now"" ... am I stupid for feeling odd about this? It feels like a subtle form of ""one-upping."" It might just be a bad habit of theirs but I don't really get compliments or ""I'm proud of you"" 's from them either. 

I think it's worth mentioning that I feel like I've only started to notice these kind of things because a few years back I heard from a closer friend that they thought I had an ""aura of superiority and pretentiousness"". it hurt a lot and made me feel self conscious about my other friendships. I thought she disliked me and definitely felt tension and I was going to let nature take it's course if she decided to distance herself or confront me about the way she felt about me. it never happened and I feel it's been too long to talk to her about now.

Please call me out if you think i'm over-thinking. Any advice, thoughts, or comments are welcome. This situation isn't eating me alive or anything, it's just been on my mind and it's miniscule in comparison to other things going on in the world.",23Jun2020,1

This made it so I often pretended to be sick instead of going to school and I got more and more disconnected with my friends so eventually I started to spend all my free time alone without friends.

So far, I've been making due with a fan that I've been moving back and forth between my bedroom and the living room. However, I do have one crazy-awesome advantage: electric is covered in my rent, so I can use as much energy as I want!

I can't use any window-units or anything, namely because all the windows in my apartment are oddly shaped (they're all floor-to-ceiling windows, but only a small section ""opens"" side-ways).

I'm totally fine just buying another fan, but if at all possible, I would love to able to actually keep the place cooled-down, especially when I get home from work. I love my place, but I *don't* like walking in and it feeling like a sauna, hot and stagnant.

621,"Title is kind of self-explanatory. I’ve always been very against self-diagnosing based on stuff you see online. My friends tend to do it a lot, but I’ve always tried to keep them from doing so. I just think it’s horrible for your mental health to tell yourself you have mental health problems. Obviously if you really do, you should see a doctor, but a doctor should tell you what you have, right?

I have a lot of issues that tend to match up with ADHD symptoms. I’ve never really paid attention to it, but it’s gotten progressively worse as I’ve gotten older. I have a short attention span, trouble sitting still, mood swings/anger issues, short term memory loss problems, issues with object permanence, and I’ve struggled with periods of depression in the past (which is linked to ADHD, apparently). My mom has me convinced my short attention span is a problem I created for myself by using my phone too much, but I’ve ALWAYS been like this. I used to get in trouble for not paying attention in class as a kid. I’ve been a problem child since day one.

I kind of want to go see a doctor and get- do you get tested for ADHD? I dunno. I would like some kind of confirmation as to how I’m feeling. If I don’t have it, great, I’m just a spaz and need to work on some bad habits. If I do, maybe I can find a better way to address it? I don’t really know.

Either way, my mom doesn’t want me to see a doctor or therapist or whatever about it. My parents both believe that doctors just want to diagnose you with anything to make you pay for medication. I also don’t want them to feel like I’m making excuses for having issues. I just have so many issues remembering things, being productive, and breaking fidgeting habits I’ve had since I was a kid.

TLDR: I think I might have ADHD, but I don’t want to self-diagnose and my parents don’t want me to see a doctor/therapist for it. I don’t know if there’s a way I can help myself get better at managing it or if I should just continue to ignore it.

626,"Just got done with University. I didn't really enjoy my course, although it helped me identify an aptitude for computer programming. I have a good few weeks this summer to give proper thought and consideration into where I'm going next in life, and to start taking steps in the direction I choose.

Seeing as I didn't enjoy my degree that much, I'm eager to pick something that's going to give me more purpose and fulfillment. Three years of passionless work have definitely shown me that I need some level of vocation. I'd like to not worry about money, but ultimately it's more important to me that I feel like I'm doing something meaningful. I'm prepared to make some compromises, but I don't want to end up stuck in some depressing office or factory where I'm just moving numbers or boxes around.

Ideally, I'd like to be developing some sort of transferrable skill that I can carry across careers. The most obvious thing is programming. That's a very broad discipline, so I guess I need to narrow it down.

I also have some creative/arty aspirations that I think I would regret not exploring. Seeing as it's not easy to monetise creativity, it needs to be something that runs alongside my job. In that case though, it'd be nice if my job didn't completely suck me dry of all the week's energy. I know that might sound kind of naive, but I really do think I'd feel regret lying on my deathbed if I hadn't made a serious effort to explore that passion.

I'm only 21, so maybe rather than rushing into a career, I should take some time to explore my passions and get a better idea of what I want to do. Take some lower commitment jobs like working in Tesco's etc. My parents seem to think if I step off of the conveyor belt I'll become some waster, but I've completed a three year degree I hated, so I don't think I'm just avoiding responsibility by considering some time out.

If anybody could give me feedback on my thought process here I'd greatly appreciate it :)",23Jun2020,2
628,"Me (M15) and my friend (M16) have a pretty toxic relationship if Im being honest. I hate being around him, and talking to him too. He always makes me feel like shit and likes to embarrass me as much as he can. He'll bring up stupid crap that happened a long ass time ago for no fucking reason. He's ungrateful to his single working mother which is just heart breaking to me. Anyway, I have thought about ghosting him multiple times, and I know he'll get mad and call me ""fake"" and shit, but I don't really care about that. See, he has a lot of embarrassing photos of me... and my dick pic too. He got it after I was dating his cousin for a little bit, but all she wanted was my DP. I'm a horny ass kid so I didn't really care at the time. But then she showed it to him and you know the rest.

I know he will use it against me if I leave on bad terms, or any in that matter. I feel like this could come back to haunt me whenever I get older. Especially if I end up doing something with my life. Any advice would be great.",23Jun2020,2
629," Hi everyone. I need advice from you on what to do. Sorry for the mistakes as English is not my first language.

I (23, F) met this guy on a dating app a few weeks ago. We went on a few dates, he told me he was looking for something more serious and was making future plans for us together. He was really kind and sweet in person but was sometimes cold in the messages and would reply after 10 hours or after one day. I got a bit suspicious that he might have someone and tried to find him on social media as we didn't add each other before. I got no results. I somehow managed to find him on Facebook only to realize he lied about his name, surname, age, place where he lives, about his relationship status, nationality and many other things. He told me he is 26 but is actually in his 30s and has a wife who I believe is pregnant.

It is perfectly clear to me that he created this fake identity to cheat more easily. I reported his profile on Tinder, but he created a new one. It seems to me that he manipulates and lures younger girls into having sex with him (we didn't have sex only because I rejected). He is VERY active on Tinder so I believe he's seeing more girls at the time while cheating on his wife.

This guy is a great actor. He faked his nationality and pretended to speak another language. He tried to convince me that another girl in a bar was flirting with him, while it was actually him who approached her when I went to the toilet.

I wanted to confront him about this in person, but he was constantly making lame excuse for not being able to meet with me so I finally told him in the messages about what I had found out. He seemed not to care a bit, tried to convince me he wasn't lying and that I'm making a big deal out of nothing.

The guy is such a piece of shit and seems not to care about anyone but himself and his dick. I want to prevent him for hurting other girls and his wife.

Should I contact her? I found her on Facebook, she has a profile photo with him. I don't want to destroy anyone's marriage, but at the same time, he's the one who obviously doesn't care about his marriage and fucks around. I was never in this kind of situation before and I am against cheating and lying. I can't stand people who do that.

I asked him if he was married or had a girlfriend on our first date. He said no. On one of our next dates we talked about relationships and I said I despise people who cheat. He agreed and said he has never cheated on his girlfriends and is not a fuckboy. So this guy is obviously a manipulative liar who has no feelings for others when he is able to lie so easily.

I don't know if his wife knows that he's cheating or not. We went out quite a lot during the week, but sometimes he'd cancel our plans last minute or he was ''busy'' for days (that's why I got suspicious).

What should I do? I know if I was married and my husband would be cheating on me, I'd like to know. But then, I don't know anything about their marriage and don't want to be accused of something and involved in too much drama.

I don't know if this is important but they are Arabs. He told me he is from Latin America but is actually Arabic. We live in a Western country so they don't seem to be traditional Arabs, but he once mentioned that ''Arabic women don't enjoy sex'' (now I understand why he said that). I just brought this detail up because I know that position of women in Muslim society is different from the West. I have a couple of male Arab friends and most of them cheat on their wives while they stay at home, take care of the children and don't know what their husbands are doing (but they live in the Middle East, unlike this guy from Tinder and his wife who grew up in the Western country).

What should I do? Do you think I should tell her or not?

Thanks for your help",23Jun2020,2
630,"We're both 14 (yes we are young but I really need help). He is very very shy.

My little brother (8) wanted our groop (me, my brother, him and his brother (also 8)) to play truth or dare. After a while we got to the question if we like **someone.** Everyone got asked and he said yes. Later in the evening my bro texted him and asked him if **she** was me. He answered no. I was happy altho there was a chance of him lying. The next day he quietly told me that he was indeed lying. I was so stressed. I made it so it looked like I didn't understand what he said. After that I asked him about that. He couldn't say it straight. He also told me that he was embarrassed. He didn't ask me out, he just said he liked me. 

I felt bad for him and I started crying. I didn't want to lose him, He is my best friend. Mom took me for a walk. The next morning when we saw each other in person he didn't say a word to me. Then me and my family had to go home (we live in different towns). 

The next week he came to me like nothing had happened and started talking. After that nothing important has happened. There has been a few weeks since that. I don't wanna leave this open like that but I can't say anything cause he is shy and I know he can't talk to me about that in person.

631,"I have extremely high expectations of myself. I often get into a zone where I work extremely hard and my motivation is fueled by me competing with my ideal version of me. 

I feel like I haven't had this for a very long time, i've only recently (in the past year) been able to function like this. 

At the moment I also feel like even if I don't achieve my expectations, I'll still be happy that I came so far. I'm thinking maybe people say high expectations are bad because the more and more you get used to this way of thinking, the more and more you're likely to punish yourself for not achieving your expectations. Like maybe it's something that becomes bad with time.

632,so I’ve known this coworker for a year and she’s really cool and we’ve been hanging out and I’ve always kinda liked her but never said anything. But last week we fucked and we fucked twice since.

633,"I was 15 and really, really drunk. I can't remember it. To this day, all I remember is waking up without my pants on and seeing him next to me. And I'd been bleeding. I saw a used condom on the floor and put the pieces together pretty quickly. A lot of therapy still hasn't convinced me to tell my parents. How could I let my mum know that her husband's (boyfriend at the time) son had stolen my virginity?

I tried to speak to a 'friend' about it but I realised that there would be a criminal case (he was of age and I was underage) and his wonderful, amazing dad would have his life changed forever. My life was already changed - why should anyone else's? I'd ruin their relationship and break their hearts. So I stopped halfway through telling her. She told someone else, and the gossipy bitch had it spread halfway round the school. I started self harming and drinking, trying to block out my suicidal thoughts. I later started smoking weed and taking drugs.

Anyway, when our parents got married a couple years ago, he came bouncing over to me, all happy and smiling. Normal. ""Long time, no speak!"" Yeah, no shit. When my partner arrived an hour or so later, he asked how I was and I burst into tears.

Someone saw me and told my mum. She was devastated - it was her special day. I told my mum a story, why I'd been crying. But she genuinely believes that my partner made me cry on her wedding day and she is so resentful about it.

My partner told me not to tell her the truth. I'd kept it quiet for around 8 years and he understood my reasoning for that. But she dislikes him because of it. He said he can take it. I've been with him almost 6 years now and he just wants what I have always believed it best for me and my family.

Do I tell her? She will tell her husband what his son did. She would probably tell my dad. My life would change. Everyone would pity me, be angry at me for not telling them in the first place.

My partner changed my life. He's the first person I properly spoke to. He convinced me to go to counselling, to process it and to not cry when I think about it. I haven't shed a single tear while writing this. A year ago, I'd be a wreck by now. Because now, I'm just angry. I let my stepbrother ruin my innocence and steal my trust. He was like a brother to me and after that night, I barely let anyone get close to me ever again. All this happened, yet my mum thinks I'm in an abusive relationship.",23Jun2020,4
634,"Hello Reddit,

Long story short my Landlord pays a guy to cut our grass outside of our home. As he was cutting grass he got very close to my car, which in turned caused some rocks to fly into the car and cause some minor paint damage to the right side and a long crack in the windshield.

&amp;#x200B;

I complained to the Landlord about it and they said they will pay for the damages. They contacted their Insurance company, then their insurance company told me to contact mine. Basically it sounds like what they want to do is have me file a claim through my insurance and they will reimburse me the deductible.

&amp;#x200B;

To me it almost seems like it will cost their insurance more to pay for the damages than it would to pay for my deductible, so they want me to file the claim so my insurance pays for the majority of the damage and they just pay the 250 deductible. Does this sound right? My main concern is that my rates will go up and it will appear on my record when I am not at fault. They admitted they would be at fault and pay for it, but I don't know, it just seems like I will be paying for it in the long run if my rates go up.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Also, if I do submit through my insurance is it likely that my rates will go up? It would be the first time I filed through them regarding windshield damage. Would it be a bad idea to report teh paint damages too? The car is a 2018 VW GTI with only 10k miles on it, so I am not trying to let that damage sit to rust out. ",23Jun2020,1

Anyways im with my mom now and i just got my first job working minimum wage fast food. Because of last year i still have no summer clothing. My wardrobe consists of a bunch of ratty tshirts and one pair of shorts that are too small. My mom was talking to my sister about buying her some summer clothing and i mentioned how i needed shorts that fit and that i also didn't have a bathing suit. 

She feels that now that i have a job that she doesn't need to buy me clothes. I would understand if i already had clothing that fit and i just wanted more but i don't even have bottoms to wear. She feels its lucky she still buys me food. It made me feel sad and frankly really hurt. I've had a tough few years and i'm tired of not having pants that fit and not being able to do things with my family because i literally dont have hot weather clothing for any outside activity. The jeans i do have dont even fit. I'm tired of being told i don't deserve clothing that fits. 

I don't know what to say to her to make her see that i need her to buy me the bare minimum? Or am i in the wrong here?

638,"I’m in my early 30’s, and for a few years now I’ve had this unshakeable feeling of a need for change in my life. I can’t really describe it, or what kind of change I’m actually craving specifically, but basically it feels like for the last few years, life has just been kind of uneventful and passing me by while everyone I know is moving forward. I went to grad school a few years back to make improvements to my career, and I can’t thank myself enough for taking that risk (aside from the student debt lol). Throwing myself into a new situation like that was really invigorating. I’m happy in my career, I like the city I live in, but as my friends are meeting partners and starting new chapters in their lives (I am not as lucky in that department), I feel like I have to take control and do something for myself if I feel stuck in a rut.

there were days where my mother and i would go hungry and no one helped us in my family. my sister  (Lets call her jane) she refused to help. my sister married a cop and moved into a house and now is living the luxury lifestyle. my other sister lets call her rebecca) jane and rebecca would always say that taking care of there mother is not there responsibility and my mother should care and feed herself. there are days when we went hungry and they refused to help. rebecca would talk to my other sister (lets call her sonia) she would tell sonia that she hates mom and mom is using her for money and she wish mom was dead. sonia send me screenshots and thats how i knew she was saying all those things. my sister jane is a republican she said she dont like democrats and will never be friends with one.

i was going through depression a few years ago when i was suicidal and didnt wanna live. no one in my family was there for me. no one knew what was going on. i only had myself. at the same time i was taking care of my mother. i take my mother to her appointments. i take my brother to his appointments. i go grocery shopping, i pay the rent. i cook. im basically there caregiver. i take care of them and i have no problems doing that. the reason why i never committed suicide its because my mother and my brother needs me. without me they cant survive. all they have is me. no one else takes care of them.

in 2011 my mother was about to get evicted from her apartment. no one wanted to help or even cared. i had to go to court and fight the eviction and made a payment plan so we wouldnt be evicted. my sisters or brothers never helped. no one helped. i was deperate so i took out a loan and my sister jane loan me 600 dollars (which wasnt enough ) but i still managed to pay the remaining of the rent balance. so then she stopped speaking to me because i never payed her back. the reason why i never payed her back because at that time i had no job. i didnt finish school. i was taking care of my mother and brorher so i couldnt pay her back right away. my sister jane told my sister alexa that our niece stole money from her wallet when she visited her but she still talks to her as if nothing happened and she refused to talk to me because i owed her money.

my nephews daughter passed away a few years ago in a car accident. my sister jane never spoke or made contact with him until his daughters passing. his daughter hasnt even met my sister. and there she goes trying to pretend like she cares going to the furneral and pretending like she's been there for him when she dont even speak to him. thats my point and thats what i been saying. people only care about you when your gone but make no effort to contact you when your alive and thats why people are calling my sister fake and dishonest. it took me a long time to relaize this but blood dont make people family. love and loyalty does.

I live with my parents and they have some outdated views on mental health. They would probably tell me about how I have nothing to be sad about and that I don't need any help.

And in their view that would be right, because they do everything that they can for me and I really appreciate it.

My parents don't know about any of these feelings because I have been pretending to be okay every time something goes wrong.

They are not abusive and do not harm me, but they argue often with each other and my brother and it affects me a lot. It's like I'm stuck in the middle of it all doing my best not to get yelled at.

651,"I’m not quite sure if this is the right forum to post but I just wanted to know if this is normal. I’m an 18 yo f and I still sleep with my Teddy that I got when I was 3 years old. If I can’t find him every night to go to bed I freak out. If I’m out sleeping at a friends house I’d I don’t know exactly where he is at home I get anxiety attacks. I only recently started being able to sleep without him if needed but I rarely have a goods night sleep if I don’t have him with me. 

I have had some serious traumas in my life but they have happened while I had my Teddy not before I got him so I don’t know if they have anything to do with it. This attachment is so strong that the mere thought of loosing him or giving him away gets me anxious. 

I strongly believe that I won’t be able to ever sleep without him.

Let's be honest, few people will remember us after our death!)

""Seentus"" solve the problem of death anxiety and improve mental health for people who want to leave their mark on history by providing platform where users can send messages to future generations, share photos, ideas, social network links that will tell the people of the future the story of our generation and remain visible even after death unlike Facebook or Instagram. (gamified virtual time capsule with dating elements).

We also see it as a tool to be used for the collective knowledge and learning of future generations. With the thought of “History is written by victors” and considering how much propaganda is produced in our current age and historically, this type of product could give a voice to the average Joe. Historians, sociologists, and others would love to be able to read the thoughts and minds of past generations.

Now we are also testing 2 prototypes of the news feed:

1. Classic news feed   

2. Futuristic ""deep"" news feed . Photos do not move down, but deep into. Try to enlarge the page and see how you fly between photos.

And it gets even worse when someone is doing something clearly wrong. Because I always feel really bad when I'm correcting them, like I'm trying to sound like a smartass or calling them dumb.

662,"Now this is going to be pretty long and the feelings are still pretty fresh so bare with me 


So to give you a back story, I (23f) am a University student living on my own and have been for the last 2 years. I had really bad depression which took a nose dive late 2018 and had been getting worse since. Instead of wallowing in my depression, I got a prescription for antidepressants and signed myself up to a bootcamp (you know good endorphins and whatnot). I am a full time uni student, working 2 part time jobs to support myself and my dog and Im balls deep in debt. 


My best friend, we’ll call her Zoe (not her real name) was having some trouble mentally and she turned to ‘*the green stuff*’. She ended up buying my mother’s car off her and when she was there, her husband said that he was going to send Zoe my way because he couldn’t deal with her in the state that she was in. 

My mother (who has a history with drugs and alcohol) made it clear that “I was not in a position to be taking care of anyone”. And that if Zoe came to me, then she better be ready for me to growl her for turning to weed. Unfortunately the both of them don’t really think about others and they booked a flight and sent Zoe to me. 

So my best friend of nearly 13 years cane to stay with my over the Christmas break last year. She stayed 4 days and then ran back to her husband over a tiff we had. Now Zoe is someone that always has to have things her way and doesn’t like if someone isn’t kissing her ass (my mother’s words). When I mentioned that her mental health most likely got worse because she picked up smoking, she tried to have a go at me for not having my shit together either. After she was done, I pulled her up on her behaviour and told her to never speak to me like that again. 
The next day she booked a flight back to her husband and from the safety of her home, she let loose everything she thought about me.

Basically, I’m a broke uni student who can barely take care of herself and can barely function as a human being. That I’m so “comfortable in the hole I dug myself into and I need to wake up to myself”. Along with many other insults and “observations” about my lifestyle. 

A couple days later she gave a half assed apology along with a whole bunch of excuses of why she felt the need to say all the things she did. And I told her that I don’t think I can forgive her or be able to be friends with her. 

Now fast forward to last Thursday (June 19) My mother called me and told me that Zoe and her husband are moving to my town, which honestly I’m okay with, it’s a big town, and I’m in a much better place mentally that I don’t really care anymore. I had started seeing a therapist and I’m finally off my antidepressants. I feel like a human being again. 

June 20 rolls by and I drive past a relatives house to see the car that Zoe bought from my mother with a trailer full of furniture. Zoe and her husband are staying with my family here in my city when we have unofficially broken up. It’s been a couple days and I really don’t know how to feel or how to react. I’m seeing my therapist tomorrow to try and make sense of everything. 

But I’d like to hear real life advice from the real people of reddit.

My girlfriends hair started falling out in mid February (current date is 23rd June) so it has been a little over 4 months. She has lost a considerable amount of hair, her hair was very thick but now it is quite thin. She is getting to the stage where small bald patches on her scalp are showing up. 

It has destroyed her confidence to the point where she doesn’t want to leave the house or see her friends, and I want to do my best to help her. The doctors prescribed her to take folic acid a day for three months and also multivitamins because her levels of certain vitamins and folic acid in her blood were lower than where they should be. It’s been over three months and her blood levels have risen back to normal, but her hair hasn’t stopped falling out.

My question is this: what should she do next? It seems like the vitamins and stuff haven’t been working, which has upset her quite a lot, as it just feels like it’s never ending. She is waiting to speak to the doctor and she is worried it couple be some form of illness/condition.

Also, any tips on what might make her feel better/distract her from her hair when she’s in full stress mode would be very much appreciated. This is an awful time for her and I want to make it as smooth as possible :)",23Jun2020,1

I have a uni friend who has been thinking about pursuing further studies and the entire 3 years she has been trying to convince me to go to UK with her and apply to the universities in UK with her. She kept telling me all the cons about the country I was going to be studying at and how the university (which is the top uni in the country) might not be a good fit for me etc. Suddenly a few months ago she has been pestering me to help her with the application to the same university and same major as me. I was shocked. She spends 3 years trying to convince me its a bad country and uni and now she wants to apply.

I told her and she said it's a waste of money. A few days later she told me she ordered it. I'm like u told me it was a waste of money?

669,"I [M21] am moving into an off-campus house in the city with my friends this year at uni, and I’m super excited. We’re all getting our own rooms and the house is super nice. There were some issues when we visited to look around though. While going through the kitchen, we noticed there was some rodent poop on the windowsill, and some rooms, including my bedroom, had glue traps under the radiator. The worst came when we went into the basement to turn on the electricity. As I was switching the breakers, I looked down and my flashlight caught a glimpse of a dead mouse.

I don’t know if I’d call it a phobia, but I *really* don’t like mice, rats, or any rodents really. They’re gross, but the idea of them running around my house or potentially being in the same room as me without me knowing freaks me out. I’ve been lucky enough to live in places without rodent problems my whole life, so this is also new to me. 

It was also super embarrassing because once we got the lights on and took the mouse outside, we realized it was tiny. I was freaking out over a tiny dead mouse. But still, they scare me! Our laundry machines are in the basement, so I’ll be down there a lot, potentially seeing more rodents. If I saw an actual rat, I don’t even know what I would do.

My husband is leaving for military things but covid delayed it so we've been staying months longer then planned.

I was recently diagnosed with autism and ptsd when my mental health was declining. We've been married for a year together for 4 he moved in when we got married offered by my father until he left for military. If I'm honest I did not have a plan for my life I didnt know how to make a plan and everything is completely difficult for me, my husband told me not to worry about anything and leave everything to him and I just think that's wrong and I'm trying to help out getting a job ect because I want to save to buy him a new car like hes been wanting. 

It's hard for me to get a job and therapy hasnt been happening because of covid, he got a job for money before he leaves.

My sister who is married and left at 18 she does not have autism even though we are identical twins, I vent to her alot about my troubles and she completely understands and vents to me as well. Growing up I was shaded  I saw the world as fuzzy, not real but real. I am honest i was not an easy child, meltdowns, nonverbal, and overall aggressive.

My sister and my husband has recently been telling me how my mom treats me is narcissistic, she tries to get reactions out of me by smothering me, kissing me randomly, moving stuff in my room around or talking loudly at me. Shes been doing this since my diagnosis and I came out to her and dad about it. She denies theres anything wrong with me my dad agrees. Heres where my things are difficult.

I dont know what to do with my life, I feel like getting this diagnosis has helped me really understand who I am and why I was the way I was. Lately I've noticed things my mom does to me that I dislike and have been giving her cold shoulder treatment. Recently I had an outburst because she quoted my abusive past ex and the word triggered a ptsd episode and I started screaming I hated her and she knows what she did. I felt like a completely different person and like I couldnt control myself. My husband was mad when he saw what she did and later told me she laughed it off that I was childish and or a brat.

My therapist told me because of how I was treated as a child I need extensive therapy and have severe ptsd because of parents and ex. She said autistic people experience it worse then others and my feeling are valid but why do i feel so in the wrong. 

My mom told my sister what i did and my sister went off on me about our mom and how I'm lucky they allow me to stay with them at my age, but she was telling me she moved out at 18 because of our mothers behavior? She validated the way I felt and then told me things my mom did were narcissist. Then now shes telling me the complete opposite and has been telling me to respect our mom I'm to overly aggressive, how I'm lucky I have her, I do appreciate being allowed to be here and have helped them out with things, my husband pays rent here too.

She then brought up how I dont have a job, I'm in therapy and how I'm piggy backing my husband and it's wrong, I'm at an impass my husband says shes full of herself and I'm not a piggybacker but now that I think about it I feel like it definitely I dont know what to feel I barely even understand my own emotions let alone others.

674,"Long post incoming. Me and this guy have been close friends for 6 years. We also happen to be attracted to each other. We happened to be single at the same time, so he proposed we tried a Friends With Benefits situation. We both agreed on a day that worked for both us to meet up and have sex.

I prepped. I actually prepped. I did painful hair removal. I put on nice clothes. I worked around my schedule. I was in the car, almost in his driveway, literally 10 minutes before we were supposed we meet, and he texts me ,,hey, just woke up and not really in the mood, can we do this some other time?""

I know people are allowed to have sex whenever they want. I KNOW. It actually makes me feel bad about feeling bad or about the feelings I'm about to describe.

First of all, I felt like a cancelled prostitute. I can't begin to describe that level of humiliation. I feel so angry, I cried almost all day. I can't concentrate on doing anything and I have an exam coming up. 

I told him what he did was hurtful(that I know he isn't forced to have sex with me, but that he could at least have hanged out me rahter than pack me off home or at least reassure me that his lack of mood didn't have anything to do with me or JUST DO SOMETHING to make sure I was feeling ok). He said I had a right to feel bad, but refused to apologize for anything. He said that in his friend group, plans are cancelled last minute all the time and that everyone is A-OK with it, and that he assumed I'd be the same. He said we should end this since ""I'm obviously too sensitive and I take everything too personally"". 

I feel like there's a severe lack of empathy. Like, he's a psychology graduate. Couldn't he have seen it as at least a POSSIBILTY that I would feel bad and lift a finger to help the situation? He actually seems upset with me over being upset. I know most things point to ""just stop talking to him"", but he's been a dear and good friend for 6 years, who seemed to genuinely care about me (until today).

I try avoid looking at my family.

All kinds of serums- hylauronic acid, vitamin C, etc.
All kinds of eye creams.
I think weightloss would help but I'm planning to do that anyways in about a week, so I guess I'll see then.

I am semi-allergic to cats, and we have about 3-4, so that might also be it.

690,"This week I have read hours worth of supposed allegations and twitter fights against a certain actor. I have read back and forth of people either vehemently claiming the actor did some really bad stuff to people vehemently defending him saying they are all lies and the claims are just out to ruin him. Thing is I tried to google these allegations myself and the only time I could find “proof” of these claims were on someone’s twitter page and a website made by one of the people that was called something like red white and f you, if that says anything about this..? Maybe these people also have a fb page and podcasts on YouTube but these are all social media platforms and not credible news sites so this makes me confused and a little suspicious?

Bottom line is I have no idea what to believe, because if these allegations  were true, wouldn’t I find them posted more outside of social media platforms and self made websites? Not to mention one claim that was filed against the actor was cleared. And every other claim does not have any real proof (like a screenshot of a police report as far as I’m aware). Take with that what you will, because I am too exhausted to read more and try to decide if this guy is truly bad news since I cannot find a clear answer. 

I should mention too even if these accusations never existed, I wouldn’t care or like the actor anyway. I never admired him or will ever like him, but I only care because of one thing:

He was the voice actor of a beloved character and cartoon show of mine. The show has gotten me through such hard times and I would be devastated if I could not watch the show anymore because of this guy. I know it’s silly to hold a cartoon on such a platform, but it would honestly crush my spirit if it were to become something I could no longer support because I would now be “supporting the actor“. Meanwhile these claims are all alleged at this point, and yet I am still left with a weird taste in my mouth regardless, and I fear my favorite character is starting to become tainted. 

I am really confused as to whether this guy is completely innocent not, and I couldn’t care less normally, but because he just happened to be the man who does a voice on this show that was my saving grace, I am torn, and I honest to God cannot give up the show. So that leaves me with these questions:

-Can I move past my dislike for the actor (not including these possible allegations which does involve sex) so I can not think of him when I watch the cartoon?

-If the show gets a new season, can I confidently sit down to tune in without feeling like I am supporting someone who may or may not have done some really bad things? 

-Is it wrong for me to feel like I can still watch the show and possible new episodes if he turns out to be worse than just a weird man?

I don’t want to feel like I’m turning a blind eye on something that could be something serious if proven true, but since it has not yet since these claims were made, I am just worrying my brains out. 

This is so much more than just a show I enjoy- it truly is my saving grace for numerous reasons, so the idea of dropping it would kill me

694,"I’m supposed to attend these one off conference calls, and they’re scheduled weekly on either a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, which are my usual off days. 
So it’s been a couple weeks, and I asked my boss about it three days ago because I have things I need to schedule this week and he was like “oh yeah....idk I kind of heard that you of them here soon...” Well since he never got back to me, I figured I must be It in the clear this week, and scheduled some important errands for my off days. Then he just now texted me zoom links for this meeting and was like “here are your conference call links for today” When I told him that I have stuff to do and brought up the fact that I even asked and was giving ZERO notice, he goes “well I told you it’d be the middle of the week when they happened so you should have planned around that” which is maybe the most asinine excuse I’ve ever heard. What, was I supposed to just not do or schedule anything for my off days until he got his shit together?!?

I’m seriously contemplating just telling him tough shit on this one. I know he’s just trying to force me to do this because he knows if I don’t, he will have to explain to his superiors that he put it off and eventually forgot to find about these meetings for me, and he will look bad. He knows they won’t blame that on me. Its not my job to remind him daily about something he knows he’s supposed to do.

Just to give some context, I’m 20 years old (21 in August) living in the UK and I’m working as a children’s entertainer at an Alice in Wonderland themed park in Telford.

Recently I’ve taken on a team leader position, helping organise and manage the entertainment staff and I want to move off 0 hour contract onto a salary, but I’m not sure how to approach my boss or how much I should be expecting him to offer for me to comfortably move out of my parents house and live with my partner in a rented place.

Anyways, when i (16F) was driving home today about like a mile out from my house this guy in his truck waved at me (He looked about 30 maybe, black, but also looked pretty friendly tbh) and i ignored it because i had no idea why he was waving at me. 
So i drove home and was on my street and he was still following me, by the way i live in a super residential area and there were no cars on the road and no one outside. So i’m not showing him where i live since i was scared to get kidnapped and it was 8am in the morning and my mom was sleeping, so i kept driving around my neighborhood and he wouldn’t stop so i called my friend to ask her if i could go to her house and while i was stopped at a light he pulled up next to me on the wrong side of the road, and at this point there were people around so i rolled down my window and he told me my hood was popped up. So my question is: why the fuck did he follow me through a residential neighborhood just to tell me my hood was popped up a little bit, and he saw that i was a young girl earlier when he waved at me, and what should i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing calling my friend? or would it have put her in danger? hopefully this post makes sense and any replies will be super appreciated :) i’m still super shaken up and i wish i that i never popped up my hood!",23Jun2020,0
702,"My ineptitude with reading situations and reacting with the correct emotion has lead to conflicts with my friends and loved ones, which makes me hate myself intensely. I will be grateful for any help with advice, experiences or learning resources.

This type of conflict has happened with different people, enough times to see a pattern. For example, me and my friends would be talking all in good fun, usually some personal topic, and I wouldn't sense any warning in the other person's tone when suddenly they'd burst. There's been screaming, crying, calling names, and threats, all of this sometimes coming from most balanced people whom I had never seen act this way before. My problem seems to partially be that I get confused and can't always adjust my own emotions in time, I can keep smiling out of confusion (which is interpreted as me making fun of their reaction, and doing it on purpose). I sometimes have trouble controlling my display of emotion in general, often when I'm feeling scared, and when I'm confused I may get stuck with the wrong facial expression or show uncontrollable laughter or crying. In the situation this is without exception interpreted as intentional malice on my part, and obviously they're not wrong to interpret my irrational behaviour that way.  

So for me these painful reactions of other people come out of nowhere, or at least in the moment i fail to find a connection between my words and the reaction of the person. It seems as if we are talking/joking/debating about things until suddenly the person is seriously hurt, and the others condemn me and say that it was absolutely clear for everyone that there was a build up of tension that should have signaled for me to stop talking.

After a conflict like this me and the other person have always made peace because our relationships aren't about drama, and we value each other. I believe that post factum they understand that I had no intention to hurt them. But even if intentions matter, this doesn't undo what I have caused them to feel.

People often tell me to learn to ""read the room"", but i have failed to find literature or other resources that would help me understand how to work on my ineptitude.

Even though I've been told that I’m emotionally lacking and such, I don't believe I'm a sociopath or a hopeless case because I feel awful when I have hurt a friend and I want to work on myself and learn to be better so that everyone could be happy. But I feel scared because the way I perceive it right now, I have no control over these conflicts happening. I also feel disgusted with myself for being so inadequate and not knowing how to fix it. And I feel despair because after an incident like this I feel like the only way to prevent hurting my friends is to minimize the time I spend with them so that there would be less probability of it happening again. As time passes I tend to get socially optimistic again and trust myself to be in control. Then months pass and suddenly it happens again.

I want to learn how to “read the room” and to understand others so that I'll never hurt anybody in this way again.",23Jun2020,0

704,"this is going to be long so I apologize in advance. TL;DR at the bottom.



my brother (we'll call him d) and I didn't get along super well when we were kids, but as we grew up and matured, we became best friends. There's many reasons why we didn't get along until we were both older; he had severe ADHD as a kid and was just super mean and would basically beat me up after school every day when our parents weren't home. but eventually he was medicated and was doing much better. a year or so later, he stopped taking his medicine but was doing super well. he was fun to be around and we were usually together at least 4 out of 7 days a week. we got super super close. so, fast forward to about 3 years ago. he started hanging out with our step brother (30M, let's call him C.) C was always a bad influence on D. My mom busted D for smoking a cigarette when he was about 10, and C is the reason he even started. C is manipulative and talked D into stealing from family members (grandparents, aunts, etc) at a young age. C was never disciplined by his mother or my step dad, and was usually treated like he was perfection by everyone but my mother (his step mom.) Anyways, C got D started on pain pills, because D has back and kidney problems and is usually in pain. D ended up making some terrible friends; he was stealing from everyone, including taking a gun from my step dad that was given to him when he was a kid. He broke into my grandparent's home when therly werent there. He also broke into one of his friends houses with one of his other friends, who was addicted to heroin and he was known around the county for being basically a piece of sh!t. he got my brother started on heroin, and I tried warning my parents and his girlfriend about it. I was so frustrated because I tried warning everyone, but no one seemed to listen to me. long story short he ended up overdosing on heroin at the age of 22 for the first time, while he was driving to work. I was stuck at home with his 1 Year old daughter when my mom called and said he had OD'ed, and my parents and his girlfriend went to see him in the hospital. which of course upset me because I didn't get to see him and that could've been my last opportunity to. Anyways, my mom and I ended up in a heated argument because I was trying to express to her that I warned everyone that he was on heroin before this happened and they all just brushed it aside. of course she was pissed because she felt she couldn't do anything about it to begin with. a few days later, he stole money out of my locked car. I flipped shit. I confronted D in front of my mom and his girlfriend. of course he said he didn't do it, even though he's the only one who would've. My car was literally locked and he broke into it and stole a $500 winning lottery ticket I had. he also stole money I had given to my step dad, because he was supposed to go pick up a motor for my car, but D stole about $370 out of the $500 I had given my dad. He stole money on the day of the baby shower before my niece (his daughter) was born. that was at least $500. anyways, when I confronted him about breaking into my locked car, he of course denied it while my mom and his girlfriend sat there and didn't say a word. didn't back me up, didn't make any type of comment about anything. they just sat there in silence and watched everything unfold. a few days after that, was a complete sh!t show. I ended up getting into a huge blowout argument with both him and my parents and his girlfriend. they were enabling him; giving him money. basically letting him take things without questioning it. he was taking my step dad's old phone to pawn it off. he was taking my step dad's work boots to pawn them off. I questioned why he would allow D to take those items because he's obviously using them for drugs. ANYWAYS, my family and I got into a HUGE blowout. it ended with my mom blaming me for D's heroin addiction, and her reasoning for it was ""you call him a crack head and piss him off. it's your fault he's on drugs. it's your fault if he OD's again."" I lost my shit. punched a tree a few times and broke my hand. left their house and didn't speak to them for over a year. D ended up going to jail after being busted for breaking into yet another family's home while they were away on vacation. Eventually my mom apologized and I got over it, though I'm still mentally messed up from everything that happened even now. D was released from jail and sent to rehab, and just got home around the end of March. I still haven't reconciled with him. mainly I just wanted an apology from him for all the shit he's put me through, including being the reason behind cutting my whole family out of my life for a while. but I still haven't received that, so I haven't even attempted to fix our relationship because I feel it isn't my responsibility to do that. but we were civil. if we talk, it's just small talk. nothing about the past, no apology, he just initiates small talk. But anyways, he was clean, and out of prison, and out of rehab, and he seemed to be doing super well. He made a friend while he was in prison, we'll call him J. J was in a lot of trouble but got himself straight and was even doing tattoos. D, his girlfriend, and his child would go to J's for inkwork and to hang out. 

My mom called me last night. She said she had a feeling he was using again, so she checked on top of cupboards and found needles. (this was his old hiding spot.) she then told me that he overdosed in the bathroom Sunday night. the ambulance came, the police came, the fire cheif came. they brought him back. his SECOND overdose. he's 24. Anyways, they brought him back. he hit his head when he passed out and gashed it open. he refused to go to the hospital to be treated, because he wouldn't get to say goodbye to his daughter and he knew he'd probably be going back to either jail or rehab for violating probation. His plan is to withdraw at home. Im having a hard time with that because his girlfriend is constantly b!tching him out, my step dad is usually complaining about something, and his daughter is going to want attention. and I think it will all be too much for him to try to withdraw in that environment, and when it gets to be too much for him to handle on his own, he could easily contact someone and get some type of substance, since he's at home and not in a facility. And I'm worried he'll OD and won't be able to be brought back. I'm struggling with this because I still haven't reconciled with him, I haven't talked to him about anything that's happened because I don't want to bring it up. we still haven't fixed our relationship. I'm stuck with wanting to reconcile because I know if he dies, I'll regret never taking the chance to make everything right with him and I'll live with knowing I had a chance but never made it right. but at the same time, he's been so terrible to me for so long and I can't mentally make myself initiate the talk that is needed, because I want him to do it on his own terms. at least that way I'd know he was sincere. and I can't just text or call him now and try to work things out because I'm sure there will be an argument, and he's withdrawing right now. I don't want to stress him out and be blamed yet again for his OD. I know I need to talk to a therapist, and have for a long time, but that just isn't feesible right now. I need advice on what to do. do I text him and let him know I'm still here even if we aren't on good terms? of course I still love him, I know he's an incredible person and could be a wonderful father if it wasn't for his choices, and I know he doesn't want to be the way he is now. do I just send a simple text letting him know I love him and am here? do I stay out of it? I feel I shouldn't have to be the one to initiate the necessary talk we need to have to be able to fix our relationship. I'm heartbroken and worried he's going to die, and don't know what to do.


TL;DR: my brother is an addict. because of him I cut my family out of my life. reconciled with them but not with him; we used to be close and now we're not, because of everything he put me through. he OD'ed for the second time a few nights ago and was brought back again; choosing to withdraw at home; worried he won't be able to do it and he'll OD and won't be able to be brought back and I'll live with knowing I never took initiative to fix the relationship while he was alive, even though I feel it isn't up to me to fix everything, I'm struggling",23Jun2020,3

706,"Okay so over a year ago my mom got a new dog as younger brother wanted one. I'm in college and halfway across the country so I only see them once a year at Winter Break when I fly back. I guess in the process they got really attached to this dog and my mom especially really loved it. But three months ago he got hit by a car and she saw it and it was very traumatic for her. We've had a dog die in a similar fashion when I was still a kid but she didn't suffer like this before so it's hard to pick apart what she's really hurt over. 

I know it's been hard for her but I called my dad for fathers day and we were talking, and he mentioned how she is REALLY struggling and he doesn't know what to do. She is still really hung up over the dog and she will even come to tears randomly at work, at home, etc. He doesn't know what to do or how to help her and hes hoping I can maybe. My plan is to call her more often, at least once a week and just talk, but I don't know how to approach it.

Constantly buying them everything they could ever dream of even when I never even think to spend a penny on myself. I treat these 3 people better than anyone has ever treated me and maybe they don’t even deserve it but oh well I’m already in too deep and I honestly don’t mind but you know whats crazy just beyond fucking crazy- my partner and I used to have a decent sex life and now he doesn’t want anything to do with me because he says I make him loose all interest because I insist but I don’t insist I just am like wtf because I shouldn’t even have to explain why I would want to have sex with my partner- I mean aside from being physically attracted, theres the emotional and cognitive aspect as well but I am made to feel like he must think I am ugly. I don’t know what to do because he gets very angry any time I bring up the subject saying I cant expect him to want to have sex with me all the time and to leave him alone but damn I mean once every couple days isnt something crazy to ask for…For me I would want to every day but clearly for him he would want to umm like never??? I wouldn’t say Im overweight but I am definitely not skinny so I don’t know if its my weight?? Even when we leave the house I make sure to dress modestly and lower my gaze out of respect but when we are at home I dress somewhat provocatively and always try to look my best. I know he loves me but I wish he would show it like he used to. He says that the quarantine is stressful but I think thats a stupid excuse. I know as a woman I am expected to do so many extra things to help my husband and children, and I would be fine with that (keep in mind I am not just a home maker, I am studying to be a doctor) but I just can't do it all and push myself this hard if he won't even give me sex, because honestly I could be on a boat on vacation living my best life with a sugar daddy or something but I'm here dealing with his ass n his kids. Therefore, I really don't think its too much to ask for sex I mean damn. Ive even tried just popping up on him in nice lingerie and usually he just gets annoyed...How can I just make him want me? Furthermore, I will add that anytime I even try to kiss him he tells me to go away and that Im annoying him. Cool.

715,"Ok I’m a 14 year old boy. There was this girl who I really liked. Her name is Lindsay. A little background information I liked her in 6th grade when I was 11 and we almost went out but then I kinda messed it up but that’s a different story. So this year, well last year now since our school year is over, we were in 9th grade. On the first day of school in my 6th period the only person I knew was my friend Joseph, but like a few days later she transferred into our class. We got to pick our seats and she chose to sit by me. I thought Lindsay liked me because she would hold my hand, always try to play fight, laugh at my jokes even if I knew they weren’t funny, take pictures and videos of me and sometimes which was kind of weird grab my butt. She also randomly mentioned that she would have gone out with me in 6th grade if I didn’t mess up.  And then she also gave me her scrunchie. Which if you don’t know, usually when a girl gives u her scrunched it means she claims you or your dating or something like that. So I really thought she liked me back. But out of nowhere, she just started being mean to me. If I said anything, she would tell me to shut up. If I asked the teacher anything she would tell me to shut up. She would call me annoying out of nowhere. I could even be minding my own business and she would say something mean to me. And she would say things with aggression.

721,"I'm 17 m and just yesterday I finished my summer job planting trees because its seasonal work. It wasnt very fun but I made 12$ and hour which is better than any other job near the town I live by. Now my mom would like me to get another job doing construction for my great uncle. The jobsite is about 2 hrs away so I would have to stay in a hotel with my great uncle (I've only met him once or twice) and work during the week and come home on the weekends. I am unsure what the pay would be but it would be 12$ an hour or more. Some extra money would be nice but I'm not in dire need since I have 8500 in my savings plus 2 vehicles I purchased and I also live on a farm and have about 3000 -4000 worth of livestock.

I really do not want to work up there as I've been thinking the whole time while I was working at my previous job all the things I could do. I used to lift at our local gym but it's been closed since february because of covid, and it recently reopened.I also do cross country and need to start training for that. I have a July ACT to study for, which is going to be very important as its the last time I'm going to take it. I also want to apply for an ROTC scholarship which I need to be in good physical shape and I would like a better ACT score. I also like to hand forge knives which is alot of fun and also takes a lot of time and I could even start selling them online If I had some extra time to practice. I wouldn't make very much but it would be enough to pay for materials so I wouldn't lose anything.

All in all I have some things I could do so I would not be bored, but is it okay to reject the job offer even if it would pay alot more money than any other job near me? How should I convince my mom?",23Jun2020,1

724,"So I’ve been struggling over the past few years with being able to focus enough to finish a book.  I used to be an avid reader, preferring memoirs, horror stories, and fiction books about life in different cultures to anything else .  I think I read Lian Hearn’s Tales of the Otori series a dozen times.  Lately however, I can’t settle my mind enough to focus in order to enjoy a book.  I thought I was having multiple genre burnout so I tried changing genres.  It didn’t work.  I even tried turning off all of my electronics beforehand or listening to classical as I read.  The only book that managed to stick was an impromptu autobiography I managed to get through in one library sitting months ago.  

I’m somewhat of a book hoarder.  I have almost thirty unread books from the past few months alone that are just sitting on my shelf, collecting dust.  Every time I try to get a chapter into a book, my mind starts wandering, I get restless, and I end up taking a break to scroll through my phone instead.  It’s so frustrating!  I feel like I have the attention span of a toddler lol.  

Ideally, I’d like to get back to a place where I can not only finish a book, but also get back into practicing constructive reading in order to write personal reviews.  I really miss the art of reading for enjoyment.  I would like advice from anyone who has gone through similar concentration blocks as to what worked for them.

726,"On mobile, bear with me, tldr at bottom.

I (20m) live with my little sister (8) and my mum (41), until last month my mum's boyfriend also lived here (50).

I'm not going to sugarcoat it, he was abusive in every way. He controlled what she wore, what she was allowed to spend, who she spoke to, what she ate and drank and what she did on a daily basis. They are also drinkers, and when they drink, they fight.

Also, my mum's ex was fired from two jobs in four months for drink driving, he was a scaffolder and has a ex wife who got a restraining order against him for abuse to her and his children.

Last month I bought my mum a phone so she could pay online rent, a friend messaged her, my mum's boyfriend got angry, snapped her phone and they fought. I was upstairs keeping my sister out of the way, I came downstairs after he ran out the door and  my mum told me her pushed her onto a chair breaking it, he choked her, so she hit him with the broken chair leg.

Long story short, he was arrested and banned from our town, and my mum was also warned if she was to get back with him, child protection would have no choice but to remove my little sister. Sunday morning my little sister told me that my mum and her ex was facetiming, I asked my mum if she wanted to get back with him, she told me no, I told her if she did that I would leave and my little sister would be taken, as I don't want to experience that night ever again.

Today I found out she has been meeting him during the day, for the past two/three days and wants to get back with him, she doesn't know that I know as it was a mutual friend who told me.

What should I do ? 
I don't want to leave her and I don't want my little sister taken, but I may not have a choice.

I sanded a part of our ceiling which has been flaking for ages, a few years ago and just hoovered up the dust. It's continued to crumble though since and my siblings have played around the dust. In another room my parents got their friend to remove the whole ceiling outside my room when I was younger, I remember it being really dusty at the time. I recently realised that Artex could contain asbestos so I sent off a sample and it came back positive for Chrysotile. There was a leak in my room the other day and it started flaking, there's also cracks around every ceiling of our house as it's so old.

For most of my life I’ve been known as “that guy”. That being the loud, over energetic, inappropriate, stupid and clueless guy. I’m never able to stay still, yell inappropriate jokes or trending words/phrases, never shuts up and say stupid things or pretend like I don’t know something that is common knowledge. I do this to make others laugh, but I have stopped being Mr. Nice Guy and starting to focus on what makes ME happy. I hate setting myself up to be the punchline. Others ignore or interrupt me when I actually have something to say and I feel like my behavior has a part to play in that. Although I’m invited to things like parties I’m never invited to casual hang outs or things I actually want to do. I would like to be a lot calmer and cooler, not desperately trying to make a joke about everything. I want to be known for being open minded and laid back, that guy you can talk to about anything, knows when to be serious, that type of guy. I tell myself I’m going to change, but every time I’m around people I just start being “that guy” and snap out of it when I’m back to being alone and feel embarrassed.

732,"Hi, first I want to say thank you for anyone who read this.

I’m a only son (17,18 this year) I don’t want to write this in the first place but I just can’t anymore it’s thoroughly damaging my mental health.

So I was raised as an only son (I’m not writing my place of birth or where I’m staying to make this anonymous). Yeah so my parents have been fighting like from when I was 10 (rarely though) it all escalate when I was 16.

First I can hear their fighting like verbally abusing each other from my room (no hitting though just shouting) but the contents of those shouting is just so.... Mentally abusing me.

Well I was ok at first since it’s rarely happen but the problem started when my grandma dies (when i was turning 17 love you grandma) she was like one of the pillar that kept the family together and my best friend same like my mom.

My father then started to drink ( I know he was sad but he kept drinking lately like now he’s using her death as an excuse) my dad loves me SO much like he loves me dearly. He always ask where I am or am I ok and or are you hungry, but I just can’t connect with him on a spiritual level like after doing all of that I just can’t.

Recently they even fight in front of me. THERE FUCKING SHOUTING IN FRONT OF ME (sorry for cursing) like bro I’m your son why do you fight in front of your only son. Once it got so bad that I was afraid they were going to hit each other. I stood up between them and started to calm both of them down ( I took my mom to her room and told my dad to take a shower since he’s drunk IN THE MORNING!) then after that’s settled my mom stayed in her room and my dad started sleeping.

I thought I was ok at first but then tears started welling down and I cried like ugly cried. In front of their and my friends eyes I’m viewed as a mature person (BUT IM INLY 17!!! IM STILL A KID) but I kept on being positive, I kept on smiling in front of them. And worse of all I started to get afraid of both of them. Every time their going to meet in the same room my heart would just thump so fast. 

Let me just say I’m a positive guy (outgoing person in school, always nice to everybody (unless jerks) , I like to view the positive side of things. Oh yeah I can broke them off since I’m 6’1 lanky but I’ve been working out and my dad is only 5’9. My friends and best friends would usually ask me fore advice like dating,studying etc. They always says that I’m mature,I’m not mature I’m scared, scared of my own parents,scared of my own house and that has almost let me down to depression.

ALMOST but I found kpop a few months back and it started to cheer me up a bit (ONCE wya) but I’m just tired mentally I can’t keep up anymore, there is no positive emotion when I’m at home I always have to put on a mask in MY OWN HOME. I don’t want to ask my best friend since I know he’s having a hard time dealing with his own family matters. So I want to ask reddit can you please give me advice.... please

I just want to dissapear like really I want to run and just dissapear I’m tired emotionally and I can’t talk to them, they won’t listen to anything I said. HOW CAN YOU BE SO CHILDISH! 

Please give me advice

Sincerely thank you for reading this",23Jun2020,1

735,"For background, I (18F) have been in a relationship with my partner (17M) for a year now. The entire time we’ve been together my mom has made it very hard for us to have a normal relationship: she controls how long I see him and how often, she refuses to talk to me about him and has never made an effort to get to know him. Making matters worse, I have a chronic illness that prevents me from driving, living alone, and forces me to rely heavily on my parents for medical care. My mom and I were very very close before I got started dating my partner and she always let me make my own choices and do what I wanted to. 

Last night everything culminated in the worst way possible. She told me she hates my boyfriend and has always thought nothing of him (despite the fact she told me from the beginning she didn’t care and didn’t want to be involved). She has no clue who my partner is, what our relationship is like, or how much we care about each other. My mom also claims that since I’ve been in a relationship I’ve lost all respect for her and the mother-daughter bond we used to have. 

I love my mom, and our relationship has always been very important to me. Part of the reason this makes me so upset is because I know she would love my partner if she tried to get to know him. She’s always been involved in my life and previous relationship, but decided this once she doesn’t care and has made me miserable because of it. 

I feel lost and hopeless to do anything about this. I feel like I don’t have any power here. I’ve tried so many times to fix this in so many different ways and nothing has ever made a dent in her attitude. Strangers of the Internet, please help me. 

ps: his parents love me and I’ve always felt like a real part of their family. my mom has said terrible things about them and as such they are uncomfortable talking to her about any of this without it getting ugly. last night they offered me a place in their home. if I leave I’ll be sacrificing my relationship with my family and changing my entire life forever. but if i stay I have no idea what will become of me, my relationship, and my family.",23Jun2020,1

737,"I'm a 19-years-old male kissless virgin. I've had a couple girls hit on me in the past, but I've never really been interested in being with someone. If I wanna bust a nut, I can do that on my own just fine, and relationships seemed kinda scary. However, I recently posted in r4r saying I was looking for a relationship, and a handful of girls texted me. Long story short, it only worked out with one of them (and I'm glad it did).

Now, it might be that I've been craving for affection for a long time, but I really like this girl. We've been getting to know each other for the past couple weeks, and she's very sweet. Problem is, we often ask each other sex-related questions such as our favorite positions and such, and I didn't wanna ruin the mood, so I just pretended like I had experience. Also, we're horny mfs, so being horny together is important.

Some people think of us kissless virgins as kinda creepy, which I guess I understand. I don't wanna keep lying to her because I don't want her to expect me to be a bull in bed when I'm more like a fucking caterpillar. However, I also don't wanna stop being horny with her.

I know that I should tell her the truth, for my own sake, but how the fuck do I do it without cock-blocking myself?

***TL;DR: Met a girl, didn't tell her I'm a virgin, made her think I'm experienced in the subject, don't wanna keep lying to her, but also don't wanna come out as a creep.***

Also, this is my alt. She follows my main, which I think is cute. I don't think she uses Reddit much, and she for sure doesn't visit this sub, so I think I'm good.

Btw, while we're at it, when's a good time to start fucking? We live in the same state, so it's not hard for me to just drive there, but when's a good time for two people to start fucking? Also, she lives with her parents, so how the fuck do I fuck her? Do I rent a motel or something? Should I wait till she starts sending nudes? Should I practice with my pillow? Where the fuck do they sell condoms? Why was I never taught this stuff at school?

Also, I'm a little chubby because of quarantine, and she's athletic. Should I get fit before starting to have sex with her? Do girls get really turned off by chubbiness? I don't want her pussy looking hella dry like the Sahara.

***TL;DR - Part 2: Electric Boogaloo: How to fuck?***

Edit: That is one weird username Reddit chose for me.

Edit 2: Also, the reason why I believe some people associate virginity with creepiness is that a lot of people think virgins and incels are the same thing.

However, we’ve been together for 17 months and my resentment, jealousy, hurt and obsession over his past is getting worse and worse. 

It’s not just the number, but the nature of these encounters or casual relations. They play like mini movies in my head and even though it’s in the past, it hurts me a lot to know that they did happen. 

I guess I still have deeply rooted Christian and conservative values in me, I can’t seem to get over his sexual past. I have been consistently going to therapy for over 6 months, and I am still in the same place as before, if not worse.

My bf is saying psychiatric help is needed for my insecurities and obsession over his sexual past. 

Also I think it’s worth noting that he does treat me well and he hasn’t given me a reason to doubt his faithfulness to me. 

I also feel like I missed out and it’s “unfair” he had a variety of experience and exploration, and I didn’t. He insists that it’s the “grass is greener on the other side” syndrome and that he was lonely during all those years.

Right now I’m in a new school program and it’s a technical school and I’m going to become a Respiratory Therapist. I didn’t plan on going for that, but after I was talking to a counselor for a different program he steered me into this program and said my personality was a perfect fit and I took a test prior to getting into the class and had the right score to get into the program. I’m a single mom so I think he thought this would be a better option because you work fewer days (depending where you want to work) and get paid more. Of course that got me enthusiastic about the program so I went ahead and enrolled. Well it’s a couple months in and I’ve been experiencing bad panic attacks. I used to struggle when I was younger so I remember this feeling very vividly. It’s not only school that’s affecting me now but also just daily living. I have to go to the bathroom more frequently because I’m always uneasy, my hands and feet feel numb and I get shaky and I can barely catch air or speak correctly now when I’m in a panic state.

753,"I’m 14 years old. Most girls say I’m cute or above average looking. The school I go to has a lot of pretty girls. And a lot of them at first glance would want to be friends or maybe more than that in the future with me at first glance. But once they get it know me they change their mind. See most girls at my school want to date someone who is “hard” or “acts black”. Now I’m black but people say I “act white”. It really makes me mad when people say this because you can’t act a color. But most girls at my school ( well the good looking ones) want their boyfriends to act like tht. So I see myself conforming to how they want their ideal boyfriend. And also I don’t cuss. Never liked it but I recently started doing it because you really can’t fit in with the people I want to fit in with unless u cuss. And it’s hard. I can’t act like myself. And before anybody says anything, the girls at my school that would accept me for me are usually unattractive to me. And yes, I date girls for personality more than appearance. But they have to be at least 7-7.5 to date them. But the girls who would accept my personality are like a 2-3. Not to be rude but yeah. I just don’t know what to do.",23Jun2020,0
754,"She’s a very passive person, so she does stuff like clean up the most inconsequential of specs behind me or move my laundry immediately when it’s done within the 5-minute span it takes for me to get to it, then complain to my dad who then will complain about how messy and lazy and annoying I am and act as if it’s coming from him and not her. If I argue against him in her prescience she will look obviously offended and annoyed, so it’s very apparent that it’s coming from her. it's often things that objectively make no sense coming from my dad since he knows the reasoning behind them, but he’ll act as her mouthpiece anyways and just get angry if I call him out since he has no argument for it.

She has a very self-ritious attitude, as if I’m just a lazy nasty slob with no morals because I don’t waste my entire day creating messes to be cleaned up. Every time she cooks she gets food everywhere and uses about 50 pots, cooks for 2 hours, and I’m the one who has to clean even though I usually don’t even eat what she makes due to my allergies and vegetarianism. I suspect that a lot of her attitude about being morally superior actually comes from her being very religious and knowing that I’m not.

It’s been one small thing after another, and it’s really grating on me. The most recent is that she asked me fake-politely to move my “vegetarian foods” (I don’t have any that are specifically vegetarian, just a few cans of beans and some lentils) to a different area because they were taking up too much room. I offered to clean and reorganize the cabinites, which I did, and almost all of the space was taken up by her half-empty bags of nuts and coconut powder, cans of 2-year-expired condensed milk and pumpkin, bags and bags of pasta, and over 50 (I actually counted) containers of oil and vinegar. I threw out the expired stuff and empty boxes, and consolidated things, and what do you know?! Plenty of space. She just looked annoyed at the now-clean-and-organized cabinets, then my dad came out suspiciously soon after with a broom telling me to sweep the floor (it was clean) and complaining about all of the seltzer bottles I create in the recycling (most of it was their wine/beer/oil bottles)

To deal with feeling like an annoying waste of space, I isolate myself and I don’t eat. I don’t leave a semblance of having existed. It’s just always how I’ve dealt with feeling hurt. It’s that or anger. I’ve found anger to be healthier since you can actually do something with it, but it’s not as accepted, especially for a woman and especially by my “family”. I just get shut down. But if I isolate myself then my stepmother will act like somehow I’m doing something wrong and bad. Like it’s using up even more space. Like I’m just disgusting and lazy and don’t care about anyone else. Like I’m somehow being selfish. When I’m just hurt and hate myself.

It probably sounds petty but it’s very difficult on me to feel like a waste of space because it hits in places that I’m most sensitive in. I have very very few people who unconditionally care about me. Just my dad and brother. My mom died when I was 14, and due to the same feelings I was anorexic and isolated myself to the point of not having any real friends anymore. I feel truly worthless.",23Jun2020,3
755,"I got hired for a position about a month ago and have been working and doing very well since then! 

When I was interviewing and again when I was offered the position they asked if I had anything that would keep me from starting right away (like another job) I said “no but I do have a vacation at the end of July which may or may not be cancelled based on COVID restrictions) 

He said that would be fine both times and that we’d work it out. 

I am speaking with him today about the vacation and wanted to know what options I should discuss with him. 

Both my boyfriend and his dad will be there too and his dad will definitely have to work. BF is unsure if he will work since he will be starting a new job July 6th 

There is limited space to work and all three of us would have to be on the phone making calls. 

*What compromise should I raise with the issue?* should I suggest working Monday through Wednesday and take off Thursday/Friday(which are chiller days than the beginning of the week) or should I work the whole time just the bare minimum or ask for the full time off?

757,"I will do my best to keep it short, but I can't make any promises...

I am a 26 year old male from Toronto, ON and I currently hold a BFA in Dance from a private liberal arts institution in NYC. I am looking to transition into the daunting world of finance/business. After years of hard work, determination, burnout, and quite honestly, and loss of passion, I am ready to move into something different. I am looking to return back to school for the Spring 2021or Fall 2021 semester. My problem is that I have absolutely no idea how to go about it. Is there anyone out there who has experienced a major career transition (particularly from the arts into something very different)? I'm sure many of you may suggest that I stay in Canada for many reasons, but I can't help but want to return to school in NYC again despite the astronomical cost of tuition/cost of living. Would it be recommended to pursue a second bachelor? I have learned that my BFA doesn't hold much value- some schools in Canada have asked me to complete high school courses to even apply (the Canadian vs US admission process), whereas I could submit a stronger application to American schools with LOR, personal statement etc. Should I try to take some prerequisites/certificate programs at a community college in Toronto to ease my way into the field? My resume is full of part-time jobs that allowed me to work on my craft and nothing related to finance at all. I don't have a natural taking to math by any means. I am the type of person who is ""good"" at most things but haven't quite found where I belong after quitting dance. I attribute my work ethic to my years of vigorous dance training and most likely years of disapproval from my father. 

I haven't felt such a strong desire to change in quite some time. I feel ready to embark on a new journey and face new challenges. I would love to hear from anyone who has experienced this sort of shift/who has an education in both Canada &amp; US/school recommendations in the Northeast.

759,My sister is 19yo almost turning 20 and she doesn’t have her driver’s license yet. I constantly have to drive her places (mainly work) and have had to adjust my own work availability to be able to drive her to and from her job. The most annoying thing is that the place she works at is 5 stoplights from our house so it’s super close and yet I have to drive her almost every day. It’s upsetting because she has put zero effort in learning how to drive and her learner’s permit is expiring this year because of her procrastination. I’m tired of having to drive her all the time because there are other things especially on weekends that I wish I could do but can’t. My mom isn’t really pushing her to learn either so I’m basically forced by my mom do drive her. My sister spends hours playing video games on her free time but never seems to have time to learn how to drive!,23Jun2020,3

My question is how do you become comfortable around people that you have to continue (cannot cut out) seeing who made you feel horrible about yourself, give you anxiety and you feel resentment towards?

764,"Yesterday, my dad wanted to show me something on his phone. He gave it to me so I can see a video and a message showed up from a woman calling my dad ""mi amor"". (Our family's first language is Spanish). After I gave the phone back to him I paniked a little inside.

Being the nosy person that I am, I log into my dad's Facebook Messenger account from my phone to see his messages. (I set up his account and kept his password bc he forgets it). Sure enough, he has texted 5 different women recently. He compliments them and asks them for pics.

How could he do this?! He has a beautiful wife with an amazing personality who loves him dearly. He has an amazing teenage son, a beautiful teenage daughter, and me (almost 20 years old). He has a beautiful dog and a beautiful house. He runs 2 small business's with my mom. How could he do this?! He's willing to sacrifice everything just to text multiple women he doesn't even know?!

I started crying when I read the messages. The perfect image of our family that I had was destroyed.

My little sister, who is my best friend, asked what was wrong and gave me a hug. Although she's almost an adult (in a couple of months), I didn't want her to worry and I don't want to bring her into this so I just told her that I'm just not happy. I don't want her or my brother to think differently of our dad. I don't want them to think that our family is doomed.

Later that day, I see that my mom is upset. She is not her usual talkative happy self. She makes us dinner without saying a word. We all finish and my dad goes to console her and ask her what's wrong. I didn't hear any of the conversation because they both went upstairs to talk. Does she know?! Or is she having a bad day? When she has bad days she usually acts like this. But the thing is she was happy all day with the family and then out of nowhere she just stops talking. What happened, what changed?

My mom and dad are big believes in: ""If something is broken, don't throw it away, fix it."" That has always applied to their marriage. They've been together for 21 years now. I couldn't ask for a better family. I always see my dad treat my mom like a queen and my mom always treats hims like a king.

I feel like this is my fault. Am I too annoying? Is my anxiety disorder breaking up the family? Is it because of my many suicide attempts over the past half decade? Is is because I revealed that I was sexually abused by my dad's dad? Do I ask for too much? Do I not do enough for them? Am I not enough?",23Jun2020,1

I asked the office representative if I could turn in my keys, have someone inspect, and be omitted from fees occurred after I move out, and she seemed not to know anything.

774,"Hi everyone,

I've created a throwaway account for this post because my standard Reddit profile has identifying information on it.

I've been working at a seasonal job for five years now and I typically sign a contract for March to November. I absolutely love the work and the customers I deal with, but it's a family-run business and the family is known to be unprofessional, disorganised, and even unethical at times (forcing unpaid overtime, not giving days off, etc.). I wasn't sure if I was going to come back for another year, but I made the decision to do so because of COVID and work shortages. I was prepared to deal with the family's flaws and ways of doing business to keep food on the table.

Unfortunately, this year has been much worse than normal and it feels like it's a completely different family running the place (it's not). After a few months, I've determined that I need to quit for both my mental and physical health. I won't get into the details, but among other things I suffer with anxiety and it has been made worse by the work environment. I know the obvious answer when my health is involved is to just quit and move on, but this place is my only employer and therefore my only reference for the last five years. I don't know how I could explain to interviewers why I don't have a reference from somewhere I've been for so long, and I feel that it could jeopardise my future.

Because of the above, I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions about how I could break my contract without ruining my relationship with the family and therefore throwing a good reference out the window. We're very short staffed and I know quitting would leave them in the lurch, so I feel like I can't give a standard ""it's not working for me"" and still maintain a good relationship. I try not to let my anxiety control my life so I haven't wanted to use this as the reason I need to quit, but it's seeming like the only option at this point that they would maybe understand.

Any advice or approach that people can offer would be very much appreciated. Thank you for your time and your help! Take care.

TL;DR: I need to quit a seasonal job I've been at for 5 years but really can't afford to lose a good reference by breaking my contract early. How can I quit without burning any bridges?",23Jun2020,1

781,"Hello. So I got to college and I became close with someone I know since high school (we weren't close in high school)

Since new school means new self for me, I got confident and freely showed my personality (I used to be a bitter person and I don't get along with people), and my classmates liked me therefore, calling me the happy pill of the class.

(proud moment but I made a teacher laugh while he's saying ""I haven't laughed like this during my class in my entire teaching life!"" Man, I was really flattered.)

Going back to the topic, I was doubting this friend the whole time but I told myself that I should trust her as she is my friend (and she's a chill one so, no conflicts.) 

I was doubting her because she is best friends for about 6 years with someone I used to copy styles and talk bad to more than a year ago (I have done this with a former friend) and I know it was partially my fault but I tried fixing myself today and I am not that kind of person anymore. I was planning on apologizing to her best friend personally but can't because of the pandemic. (apologizing in private message doesn't seem sincere and she will more likely spread it to other people and humiliate me or some sort)

So to the present time..

They might have focused to who I am in the past and they did not care how much I have grown to be a better person. How should I react on this situation? What should I do?

790,"Okay, this is kind of a long story so I hope someone takes the time to read it.

I met my best friend at college, but when we both dropped out, we went back to our home states. We live hours away from each other, but we were talking over text a lot of the time. We were very close. 

He started to date this girl at the end of last year. I have serious trauma related to an abusive relationship I was in. I immediately start seeing red flags that she’s abusive. She monitors his phone. After he’d ask me for advice, he would come back the next day and say something like, “The situation was really my fault. I shouldn’t have told you that she mistreated me, because she really didn’t. She’s a good girlfriend and we have a lot of good times together.” 

But I wasn’t buying it. He would always end up taking the blame for every argument they had. She would say she wasn’t going to look through his phone, and she’d do it again anyway. He was even going to come visit us, but he wasn’t allowed to come unless she could come too. I voiced my concern for him. I told him that she sounds like she’s being abusive to him. I tell him that she is not welcome to come stay in MY home, because I don’t like how she treats him.

I would rather lose a friend than lie to them. So I was honest. Every time I heard about the abusive things she would do, and how he responded to them, I would get extremely triggered. Because it sounded so much like my abusive relationship.

He comes to me and he tells me that I need to be friends with her for this to work. I say, no, I cannot be friends with her. I will remain civil, but I will not be friends with her because I don’t like who she is. She gets my phone number, and she starts attacking me. She calls me names, and acts extremely ugly. 

Eventually, he says that we can’t be friends. He really just does whatever he says, so if she doesn’t like me, he’s not allowed to talk to me. We stop talking for 6 months. 

(For the record, I could have handled this first situation in a better way. I let my trauma response get the best of me and I was less tactful than I should have been). 

**4 Days Ago**

He texts me, and he says that he’s sorry for bailing on our friendship. He wants to be friends again. So do I. We catch up on what has changed in our lives, and everything is good.

**Last Night**

He says he needs to talk. He asks me where I stand with the situation from last time. I say that as far as I’m concerned, it’s behind me. I am capable of keeping things peaceful, and his happiness is what matters to me. I have moved on from any ill feelings, and we (me and girlfriend) can exist in separate spaces peacefully. I tell him that we will never be friends because of what happened, but I am willing to keep things civil. I’m proud of myself, because I think that’s a pretty good response. I thought that now it would be settled, and we could go back to being friends.

Wrong.

He then says, that he would like me to “apologize for my actions”, and that “if our friendship is important, his partner will be important too.” That if I want our friendship to go smoothly I have to make amends with her and we have to be friends. (It’s important to note that he has never said she did anything wrong, despite the hours of abusive text messages she sent to me). 

Wow, was I hurt by this. At this point, my trauma brain is falling back into a abuse victim mentality. I start to think “maybe I was being unreasonable. I’m acting crazy, I should just be friends with her. She’s probably a nice person but I’m just being unfriendly.” I see immediately that this is an indicator of how vulnerable I am right now. 

I tell him that I’m extremely hurt by this. That I can’t be friends with her because too much doesn’t sit right with me. That I was willing to put that aside to be his friend. That if he was going to give me the ultimatum, that I was to make amends with her in order to earn him as a friend, we could not be friends. That I thought he was asking me to accommodate her, at the expense of my mental health. And that he was behaving like he didn’t care about what I’m feeling about this. I told him that I can’t be friends with someone like that, and I’m sorry that that’s where he stands. 

He immediately backpedals. He says he doesn’t mean it, and that he wants to be friends. But that he’s stuck in a hard place because we aren’t. I haven’t responded yet. 

**I do have some theories about why this happened, so hear me out.**

She doesn’t allow him to have friends that aren’t *also* her friends. Because if he starts to question the way she treats him, he will be able to leave. That’s why she’s so obsessed with what I have to say about her. Because I call her out on her behavior.

He wants to be my friend, but she is putting pressure on him. He is trying to get me to make this accommodation to make *her* happy, not himself. 

She tells him how to think and what to say. She always has. 

**My Plea for Advice**

This situation triggers me beyond belief, and even from a distance, I feel this sort of secondhand manipulation. Because she is mistreating him, and in turn he is mistreating me. It breaks my heart to see him stuck in this, just like I was at one point. 

My question. Do I stop being friends with him? At what point do I have to make that sacrifice for my own mental health? 

TL;DR: My best friend is being abused and controlled by his girlfriend. I called her out on her abusive behavior. He gave me the ultimatum that I have to make friends with her if I want to be friends with him. He also said that if I care about him, I’ll do it. I know this is because she doesn’t allow him to be friends with people who aren’t *also* friends with her. I am an abuse victim, and I am falling back into that mentality even by secondhand contact with her. (See question above)",23Jun2020,1
793,"As you can tell by the title I recently lost my job for not showing up to a shift that I not only had covered but I had the day off. I've been working at this Kabob place since June 4th so it was very short lived, the only ever time I didn't show up for a shift was when I was throwing up so I legally couldn't come in, other than that I've always showed up for my shift other than last Friday. 

The reason why I wanted Friday and the following Monday off was because I wanted to spend the weekend with my partner since we only get to see each other every 2 weeks, the owner of the Kabob place gave me full permission saying ""I'll get your shift covered, you can have Friday off"" but just incase I still tried to get my shift covered (got them both covered). Come Friday morning I get a text saying I NEED to come in today because the manager (he's younger than me I'm 18 and he's in a position of power) is supposed to be going on a trip to VA and mentioned several times that he's going to see his ""dead ex's mom bc he hasn't seen her since his ex died"" literally mentioned it to make me feel guilty if I didn't come in after saying I gave short notice of needing the day off (I gave a week, he just now mentioned going to VA and his reasoning was ""I dont need to give notice if I have the day off"")

I said no because I had the day off and I had shit I needed to do, he goes and says ""either come in or you're fired"" and I said I'm already on the way to my bfs place (he picked me up) and I then said I'll talk to the owner when I get back and he then says ""No, the owner said the same thing"" so I texted the owner saying ""I don't need to come back"" no warning or don't do it next time or anything, even tho a girl that works there says she would take my shift. The ONE time I don't show up for a shift. My partner said I should file for wrongful termination and tell the BBB about them paying under the table (it's a certified business and the owner pays all 3 of his employees, yes 3 were understaffed and he fired me).

I don't really know what to do but I'm kinda panicking because I haven't told my mom yet but she'll eventually catch on when she realizes I'm broke, I have pets to pay for and I know my moms just gonna say ""why don't you pay for it yourself"" I've already applied for several jobs but I don't know if I'm gonna hear anything back from them. I don't think I qualify for unemployment and I don't want to get the Kabob place in trouble because it's a locally owned business but I don't think it's fair that I got fired with no warning or anything.  I'm hard working, I willing work the closing shift because no one else wants too, the owner has even said I'm a fast learner and good employee. 


TDLR: A locally owned company decided to fire me after not showing up for a shift that I had off and my partner thinks I should file a complaint with the BBB as well as wrongful termination

Any suggestions is greatly appreciated, I feel like I'm complaining but I'm really not trying to get pity or whatever I'm just at a loss of what I should do.

795,"Hello, i've always been lonely playing videogames with online friends but in the last couple of years i managed to get into a group of people i get along within this group of friends theres a girl that i liked for almost 2 years now and lately due to covid-19 we hang out on discord and my online friends met my IRL ones. All of my online friends knew i liked this girl and they were ""helping"" me. This one online friend (i'll call him T) had really good chemistry with the girl and they instantly became good friends. I was worried that T was interested in her and when i asked him about it he told me that he wasnt. My best online friend which i had known for 10 years (ill call him S) talked to T to be sure he wasnt going to do anything because he said that since she had been my crush for a long time he didnt want conflicts in the group. I didnt hear from S for a weeks and after that he came to me today and told me he started messaging her a lot behind my back and to flirt with her (S says she seems interestred in him) he told me that for 2 weeks they did 10+hour calls behind my back everyday and that he started ""Loving"" her in the last few days. The girl doesnt know about my feelings and i can in no way make her at fault here but how do i handle this situation.... he said this to me earlier that hes gonna come and live near us ( he was 900km away from where i live) so my best friend and the girl i like end up together and S Wants to stay friends with me.

The girl is the only one oblivious to the situation since she doesnt know i like her . S should be coming into an apartment with me and another friend this summer (we arranged this before everything happened) and i honestly dont know how to forgive him... Not only he lied to me but he was being an hypocrite with T all along..

796,"i knew this girl once, we both had feelings for each other but were never in a relationship, during our time when we had feelings, we both made alot of promises, things like i promise i wont ever leave, or like i would never hurt you, wrong i know but they were already made.

fast forward for like 8 months later (now) and i admit i did something thats not so good and nice, i opened her twitter account to look at her activity, i deleted eerything saved of her from my phone in an attempt to move on, it failed so i went to check twitter in a moment of desperation, she had tweeted  and i copied it.

"" don’t make promises if it’s too hard for you to keep them. don’t assure people you’ll be there all the time when you’re not sure of it, just don’t come into someone’s life to leave them with a fragile heart and a mind wondering if it’s possible to recover from such humiliation. ""

now i cant stop thinking about how much of a bad person this makes me feel, i always never open social media, this ""breakup"" had fucked me so hard and changed me to a different person, i even deleted all my social accounts so that i dont check, and still the time that i slipped it made me feel way worse.

i miss her alot, we had feelings for about 2 years, i know its alot and i am wrong for not doing somhting about it but i cant change the past anymore, anyway we stopped talking becasue she said that she doesnt have any feelings anymore and all that we had were merely crushes and that it was fun, it broke me so hard but i had to respect that, since i didnt act upon my feelings, it was her birthday in a week, and i didnt wanna ruin it for her, so i kept my mouth shut for 2 weeks,  a week after her birthday i told her that we gotta stop talking, but i told her that it was my fault all of this and i am having some problems with myself right now, she blocked me right away after i sent the message, she unblocked me after that to be fair.

however that wasnt the only reason, she also was going kinda cold about everything, she would get mad at all the small stuff and wouldnt wanna spend any time together, to the point where i worked summer jobs to collect some money, and since she bought a new iphone, i thought i would gift her some stuff, a neckless, a bracelet, my fav book and a pair of airpods, we never hanged out, she would always delay stuff and never wanna go out. 

the tweet might not be about me, its been alot she might have found someone new of course, but it still aplies, i promised her to be there all the time, and then i left, i feel so shitty, i wouldnt ever say that i would under any circumstamce hurt myself, but this whole thing have given me alot of suicidal thoughts.

how do i not feel this? is it normal? 

also she texted me a couple of times since, the latest being that she wants to part on good terms, that was like a month ago, i told her there were never any hard feelings and thats it,i never told her the truth and i am not sure if its the right thing. 

i wanna text her, but  i feel like, its not right, also i am afraid of having the same feelings and thoughts as those towards the end of our friendship, because this sucks but those feelings still hurts too, what do you think?",23Jun2020,2
797,"Hi all,
I (M23) have GAD (Generalized anxiety disorder) and am in a 7 month relationship with my girlfriend (F20). 
I need some help 

I myself trust my girlfriend with all my heart, she’s been there for me at times which were very difficult and has always been there for me if I’m having a bad day, she never questions it and offers her support without me even asking for it. 

My issue is, if she goes out to see some friends or has a girls night (clubbing banned for COVID and we technically cannot be visiting friends. This may also have an influence on my anxiety) I start feeling very anxious and I don’t know why. 
I know she isn’t going to do something behind my back and I my self trust her but I think my anxiety doesn’t ? Don’t even know if that makes any sense. 
It’s a pain. Cuz it’s just there. I can’t tell her not to go because 1) I want her to have fun 2) I don’t want to be controlling and to be quite frank if something happens it happens and isn’t meant to be.

800,Two night ago it was raining really hard and me and my wife started to smell smoke and burning rubber and found and outlet that was smoking but stopped after about a minute.  I called the fire department and they came out and used the thermal imaging to determine that there was no fire inside the walls and we were ok for the night.  The maintenance guy came out the next morning and discovered that rain water had gotten into an outside outlet due to a faulty outlet cover.  He replaced the inside and outside outlet but it still smells like burning rubber.  I’m worried that there is more damage to the wires inside the wall.  How likely is it that there could be another fire inside the walls?

802,"So I am a summer camp teacher/counselor (whatever you want to call it) to about 8/9 kids aged 4-5. We take all the precautions like wearing masks, eating snacks and lunch outside, have a cleaning crew that’s constantly cleaning everything etc. I went on break yesterday for an hour and another teacher came in to sub for me. 

Fast forward to this morning and as I’m getting ready for work the morning teacher (I take the afternoon shift) texted me saying that “whoever came into my room to sub for me yesterday was in contact with someone who tested positive.” 
I asked her if our boss told us that and she tells me no that someone who works closely with the boss told her but that she was angry that she came to work without knowing. 

So basically the boss isn’t telling anyone but made it awake through a mass text that someone we work with came in contact with someone who tested positive. Yet she didn’t tell me or my coworker that it was someone who was in our room. It makes me especially angry bc I bring my kid to camp with me and he’s in my classroom.

804,"Hi, so a little bit ago, I had made an Instagram post for the black out Tuesday. I’m white myself, but I wanted to show my support for all that is going on. Of course I believe that all lives are equal, but it’s just like the burning house saying. If one house is one fire, you wouldn’t say “all houses are equal” and spray water on the houses that are not on fire. Instead, you focus on the one that is on fire. 
Anyhow, I was on my phone and got an Instagram notification that one of my family members commented on that post. This member of my family rarely goes on Instagram, so I was surprised to see she commented. At first, she said “all lives matter”, but I didn’t respond to the comment or anything. She’s right, all lives do matter, but the other races and ethnicities aren’t under as much stress as the black community at the moment. I ignored it, and figured if she brought it up when I next see her, I’ll just tell her she’s right. 
But five minutes later, she comments “black lives matter is discriminating.” I know it’s not, but I just don’t know what to say. For some reason her comment really upset me. I’m scared that when I see her again, she’ll bring this up. And if she does, I won’t know what to say. It makes me really upset to hear her say that, and I want to explain to her how what she’s thinking is wrong, but I don’t think I can do it without crying or ruining our relationship, which I do not want to do.

805,"I don’t know where else to post this, I don’t know who to turn to. Basically me and my partner have been together for almost 5 years. In that time she hasn’t made any money from her work - art. Her art is beautiful and just breath taking, but no one seems to be buying it. She also suffers with severe social anxiety, so she’s unable to work a regular job, so I support us both. The issue I have is she won’t seek help for her anxiety as she said it’s only money related which I know it’s not, so I don’t really know what I can do to help her, I can’t make her art sell, I can’t make her get a job. I deeply sympathize that she has severe anxiety, I have clinical depression. However, I’ve received help as I knew I needed it for me and for her, how I was treating her wasn’t fair. 
I feel really really torn, I can’t spend my money without telling her, and when the subject of money is brought up I.e for healthcare or groceries shit hits the fan and I feel awful. I can’t mention that I need monetary support or freedom. I don’t know what to do she’s the love of my life, it’s just this one thing has such a heavy affect on me. I feel nauseous writing this.

807,"So I (f25) have this coworker (m24) I hooked up with at work party after a few drinks. It was fun for both of us, and after we had sex he told me how incredibly comfortable he feels with me, and that he would really like to take me out for a drink to see if there’s more for us in store. We had both been drinking, but this was hours after we’d had our last drinks of the night, so it wasn’t like he was saying this while drunk.

In the few weeks after the party, I tried setting up a date for that drink, but he kept holding off and eventually told me (only after me directly asking what was up) that he thought I was a lot more into him than he into me. However, he had also told me previously that he has pretty severe anxiety, and I felt like he was just making an excuse for himself so he didn’t have to deal with potentially messing up a budding relationship.

We never really talked much before (he’s a cook, I’m a waitress), and after all this he went back to basically ignoring me at work, but I would catch him looking at me sometimes.
This all happened somewhere at the start of this year. 

Yesterday he was having drinks and dinner at the restaurant with a friend of his while I was working. He was starting to get pretty drunk at some point, and when I was almost finished working he asked if I was going to stay for a drink after my shift. I did, since a coworker who was carpooling with me wasn’t done yet, and I had to wait for her anyway. His friend had left by the time my shift was done.

Then he told me that he really regretted the way he had been treating me, but that he is really scared of saying or doing the wrong thing that will push me away. He said he never wanted to lie to me, and that he wanted to apologise for hurting my feelings before.
He explained (still drunk) that his anxiety is really holding him back when it comes to relationships, and that he held back with me because he just didn’t want to fuck it up, just like I suspected.

I ended up bringing him home, since the friend that was his ride had left. He asked me if I wanted to come over the next day (today) and we could talk about all this more while sober, like I had told him I wanted. However he also heavily implied we would have sex again. I told him sure, I’ll come over, but decided to message him today to see if he still wanted me to when sober.

An hour before we were supposed to meet today, he still hadn’t replied, so I double texted; his response was that he had forgotten he was supposed to meet with his grandmother today.

I really kinda like this guy, but I’m really not sure if he’s telling the truth about his anxiety, and he’s a lot more easygoing and flirtier when he’s had alcohol because he can let loose a bit, or if he’s just a guy who wants to get laid after a few drinks and thinks I’m an easy fix, gullible enough to believe his stories as to why he hardly talks to me without alcohol.. 

My friends are all telling me to drop his ass, since it’s “not worth the drama, and if he really likes you he would let it show more” but I don’t know, I’m well aware of just how messy mental illness can be and I don’t want his anxiety to potentially get worse because of me..

at school, i always choose desks in such a way that i will feel safer if there is a fire or shooter, and i am so scared of people stealing my belongings that i keep them on my person at all times and freak out if someone so much looks at or touches something that’s mine. i always feel watched, and i feel that everyone hates me and wants to hurt me. i find it really hard to make friends because of this fear.

i am afraid of everything- other people, trees falling onto my house, every phone call, every doorbell ring, thunderstorms, disease, burglars, cars, heights. my fears control my life. i can no longer bring myself to hold glass or small animals out of the fear i’ll break/kill them on accident, i can’t hold matches- even unlit ones- out of fear of fire, i can’t even be in the vicinity of anything delicate without panicking. i find it hard to eat food at others’ houses and what others bring, because i always immediately think it’s poisoned for me specifically.

the constant cowardice affects my physical health, too. my muscles are always very sore because they tend to tense up from fear. i tend to tremble constantly, and i perspire very quickly. i always feel tired.

the only way i have to quell the fears is to do these weird repetitive patterns, which for some reason make my brain calm down. turning lights off in a specific way, tapping on surfaces a specific number of times, sorting things, and so on- but when i mess up these patterns, it makes it worse. i do these pattens not because it helps me feel fearless but because it makes me feel like i am in control of myself.

812,"TLDR: Roommates wife is rude and hasn't paid rent since she got here. Should i sue? 


Over the past 10 months my roommate (friend of 14 years) has had his Russian wife live in our house and she doesn't pay rent. The lease clearly states that any person who stays more than 3 weeks shall become a tenant and must be required to pay rent. She is from Russia and apparently designs buildings for work. She moved to come live with him in the states. He claims she can't work in the states because of government paperwork reasons and that it takes a long time to work out. I've seen her multiple nights working on blueprints and talking with colleagues about work. She constantly disrespects my brother (who is also a tenant) and I. She is always complaining about who is using his money and thinks that we mooch off him. In December she wrongly accused my brother and I of using my roommates car and taking his money and never apologized for it after I demanded from them that she do so. He only told me she's sorry but I refuse to believe him as she's never said it to me in person. And I haven't said a word to her since. 

I've had the suspicion that she has money and just refuses to pay because my roommate tells her it's fine, and quote ""I'm a Russian, I don't give a fuck"". She is rude, obnoxious, and plays the victim in every scenario. He is more worried about his money than his ""friendships"" and it shows. I've clearly been blinded by that fake friendship.

The reason I haven't told the landlord is because I couldnt move during that time and can't afford to break the lease, so I tolerated it for my sake. Now I have the funds to move and I want them to pay up. 
Our rent is 1350/m. I pay 450. If it were split 4 ways I would've saved a total of $1125 by now. And she would have spent $3375 in rent on top of that.
Considering our lease ends in August, would it even be worth fighting for? Should I have to pay fees even though they are responsible for breaking the lease?",23Jun2020,2
813,so there needs to be a little back ground clarity to understand this. my sisters birthday was early June and my friend was selling a used laptop and I suggested to my mom that we could spilt the price and get it for my sister for her birthday. she told me she needed to check her bank account and get back to me ok fine. so about last week she starts asking me about the laptop and all that jazz which is fine but i’ve been waiting for her to get back to me and now I’m kinda busy with school and work so I haven’t had time to get her to information she wants about the laptop. this morning she text me to call her when I can so I do and she ask me about the laptop and I told her I forgot bc i’ve been busy which is the truth I just haven’t given it much thought. so the next thing she ask is “are you okay?” I don’t know why but this made me kinda frustrated because I felt she was only asking if I was okay because I forgot something that she wanted not because she wanted to know if i’m okay. and even if she is asking she knows the answer to that bc that is something we recently discussed. idk maybe i’m just being an asshole which is likely and I know i’ll apologize but any thoughts or advice on this would be helpful bc this fucked my morning all up.

815,"So lately my roommate has done/said some things that make me question her sanity. For one, she likes to put up a bunch of post it notes with little instructions on them. When I asked her if they’re hers, she told me they were already here from before. Which can’t be, the instructions are too specific asking me to do things like move my things or leave the thermostat at a certain temperature. 

The kitchen is right in front of her room so it’s really easy for her to tell when I’m there. I turn on the lights and make quite a bit of noise when I’m cooking, but she’s emerged from her room a few times exclaiming that I “scared her”. 

She has cats she doesn’t pay the pet fee for, and likes to give me these weird almost-threats. She said if I let maintenance in, I’ll have to hide the cat or “we’ll both have to pay money”. I looked on my lease, there’s nothing saying I’m responsible for pets that aren’t mine. So either she was mistaken or lying so I would help her hide her cat. 

Then she sent me a text at 5 am asking me to look for a pill on the floor or her “cats will die”. I’m thinking, if it’s so urgent that her cats are in danger, she would call. Not text me at a time when I’m not even awake. It’s just these little threats that are so weird. “We’ll both have to pay” or “my cats will die”. Who says that?!",23Jun2020,1

817,"Hey everyone, 
I hope y'all will excuse the formatting, I'm on mobile. I (21M) have been with my gf (23F) for over a year now and it's been going great. We are moving in together soon and have long term plans, we've met each other's families, all that. There's one thing that bothers me though. She has a long list of past hookups and other experiences. Because we were good friends before dating and also had a FWB thing going as well, I heard about a lot of it. She claims she's been with 25-30 people (although I think it's a bit more probably), had threesomes (one with two guys), had ONS, tinder hookups, sugar daddies. While we were FWB she hooked up with her plug (that's also when she had a threesome). I keep trying to get past it but idk how, idk what to do. I feel trapped. I really do love her but idk how much longer I can deal with these feelings and thoughts about these things. We've talked about it before but really she just gets upset so I stopped bringing it up but it still bugs me. This especially bothers me because I've only had sex with 3 people, one being her. Sometimes I just can't help but feel anger, resentment, and like I need to ""get back"" at her. I really don't know what to do and I don't want to ruin a good thing.",23Jun2020,1

First let me explain a few things. I've been friends with 2 identical twins for a year. Even though we've met a couple times (we usually go on walks or watch movies), I'm ashamed that I still can't tell them apart from appearance. They both have different personalities, but on the outside, even their voices sound the same to me. It gets kinda awkward when I don't know if I'm talking to the right person. I don't want to upset them, so we never talked about this. My best friend, who has known them since childhood, automatically knows who is who at first glance. As you can see, I'm not very good at spotting physical differences in people.

Hi, I (44F) have a SIL (37F) that I have never met in person coming across the country soon. 

Our only interaction was on FB after she friended me. I happily accepted and began benignly commenting on her posts.

After less than a year she attacked me in the comments... her post was a meme joke and I joked along in the comments (I think I’m funny). Well, she somehow took offense to an obviously not offensive joke- not directed toward her or anything, just like “haha yeah”.

Her attack was long winded and mean and intended to sting. It didn’t really bc she was out of left field... but it was alarming and rude. I replied an apology and said I had no way meant to offend her and she didn’t need to be so rude. She blocked me. 

Seeing as how off the wall she was in that fb business I assumed anyone who saw it would see that she was the rude one and that I was innocent and caught off-guard by her unprovoked attack on my character. But my partner told me that his mother saw it “her way”
- saying that it was their opinion I was an intellectual snob. 

So a couple years later here we are and I’ve been notified that they may be coming soon for a visit. SIL has a violent past with assault charges and nothing was ever resolved between us. I have a desire for no drama- I find it exhausting. But I have done some inventory and I don’t agree that I’m intellectual or a snob - lol. I certainly haven’t done anything to her. 

How would YOU handle this?

I feel like if I avoid them (what I wanna do) it will be drama and if I engage it could be drama... ugh",23Jun2020,2

I posted this on r/neckbeardstories but a person there told me to post it here to get better help or so.

Thanks for your attention too! If you can please help me out in some way,  go on and say something. I dont know if this person fits the ""I'm a neckbeard"" checklist but under my opinion... this person is atleast a lvl 10 neckbeard or atleast desperate like one .

「Last year 」
I don't remember when exactly but around autumn of last year I was using a app I use where the main concept is basically meeting new people to talk and do lives from all around the world. I live in a rather small island so rarely I saw people from my country since most people dont use apps like this and rarely speak English. Ever since little I've loved using this type of apps to practice the languages I know. 

I remember swiping until I saw a profile of this guy (for the sake of privacy we will call him Jay) Jay was rather the typical guy. Jay liked baseball, anime, movies and video games. I love that too so I decided to add him and start talking. At first we were just having normal conversations. He eventually asked me if I'm half Asian (he asked me because it was in my bio but since I'm half asian, I dont look like your typical azn girl) once I told him yeah he started obsessing over that. He wouldn't stop talking about Asian stuff, anime,rpg and hentai(YES HE DID TALK ABOUT HENTAI, I WISH I WAS MAKING THIS UP) I was like wtf at first. I kept talking to him because I'm usually always polite, sweet and kind but I was feeling VERY uncomfortable at this point. 

Eventually he started talking about how we live almost at the same town and how he plays baseball. He eventually started asking me out by saying ""go see my baseball game"" I was like kinda shocked. I didn't thought a guy from my town would ever ask me out because usually guys see me as a friend.  I didn't say yes because my mom and dad rarely let me go out (now I'm finally grateful for it. They were indeed protecting me from weird people) I would constantly say stuff like ""pls, wait"" ""I'm sorry that my parents wont let me"" and etc. 

「3 months later」
Eventually we just stopped talking an never met after I told him that he made me uncomfortable. I thought I wouldn't hear about him. I WAS SO WRONG. I always get scam calls or calls from unknown phones from different countries (usually from the US) I thought at first nothing of it until one day a number texted me on WhatsApp saying my name. I was so scared. I got a panic attack just wondering who this strange person is. I eventually got brave and decided to ask the person who it was. The person basically said ""you are cute"" and kept on saying weird inappropriate stuff and sending me porn. I was in the edge of crying because this person was harassing me non stop even after blocking it. Eventually the person said something like ""Jay gave me your number and told me to send you gay porn and make you feel bad"" I was so mad. I texted Jay furious and immediately blocked him on every social media and I changed my usernames in Instagram and Twitter. I was finally relieved. 

「2 months later 」
I get another text from a random number on WhatsApp. This time it was someone with a naked girl as their profile picture. I was so annoyed and felt gross. It just disturbed me. The person started saying racist things and making fun of my facial features. I immediately blocked the number and reported it too. 

I hope that's the last I hear about that weirdo and hes  perverted sick friends.

I would gratefully appreciate any tips or advice on how to handle or get rid of this situation. If I can do anything legal, I guess that would be great.

826,"i just joined a call with him and i was in the middle of saying ''good morning'' and i can't even finish my 2 words before he cuts me off and says ''not a good time''. that's all he says. not good morning. not. how did you sleep. not i love you. just cutting me off. i left the call after that bc i could hear that he was watching youtube and that's the reason it's ''not a good time'' bc he thinks youtube is more important than me. this is hardly an isolated incident tho. he does this so often where he just ignores me for youtube or whatever he's doing. i literally can't even finish my sentence.

last night i told him about how i have not been feeling well and my depression and dissociation has been acting up lately. and he told me that it's just my right brain talking to my left brain. WTF kind of conspiracy shist is that. yes i am depressed bc my ''2 brains'' are talking... what the heck. i just wanted support thats it. i offered to send him a video or article on what depression and dissociation was like and he said he wouldn't read or watch anything on the subject.

we've been together for 2 years and i honestly don't know what to do. i feel like he doesn't love me.

it's not just those 2 things though there are lots more things. like when i told him about the time i was groomed by an 18 year old when i was 14 and he called me a slut for rest of the night even after i told him that it hurt and to stop.

and the time he told everyone my family secrets and said he was gonna blackmail my mom.

and the first time i saw his dick i was 15 and he just took it out without asking me and i was very uncomfortable but he kept going.

and the time he asked me repeatedly to see my private parts after i said no and it reminded me so much of what happened when i was 14 that i cried.

and the time i told him i was struggling with self harm and then he continued to make tons of jokes about self harm around our friends.

i just don't feel loved at all :(",23Jun2020,3
827,"TLDR at the end. 

We were the kind of best friends who considered each other sisters. She was from a divorced family and my parents were separated across 2,000 miles. She was one of my first friends when I moved states and went from being in the sixth grade at a grade school to being in the sixth grade at a middle school. Moving had completely rattled me and I’m so thankful for the friendships I made after starting new. I don’t regret any part of our friendship. It was beautiful. She introduced me to so many things that I still love today.

Essentially during our senior year there was a bit of drama between her and another good friend of mine. Always because of boys and multiple times. This caused a lot of strain on our friendship and our trust. She didn’t trust me and I didn’t like that she was dating a friend of mine because of how I know she viewed guys. “Abuse them, use them and loose them”.  I’d heard these words out of her and her mother’s mouth. It’s heartbreaking to think that your best friend thinks of guys being toys she can bend to her wiles. It was a reoccurring thing our senior year and definitely the pressure that pushed a rift between us. 

It was a couple months into my freshman year at college and she was at home waiting to go to basic training. I was honestly so proud of her for finding something she wanted to do after graduation, because I had understood how lost she had been on the subject in that months that led up to finishing high school. But our relationship was still struggling. We hadn’t really gotten the chance to build our trust back together and it was clear in our texts.

I was trying to plan coming back home for her going away party and I could tell there was tension. She voiced how she didn’t trust me anymore and I wanted to know if she even wanted to be friends anymore. I was willing to work on our trust but to me she seemed stuck and her messages just went in circles while never answering if she wanted to still be friends. I put my foot down, told her that if she wasn’t going to admit it then I would save us the trouble of fighting because she seemed more interested in that than fixing things. I told her that I loved our friendship and that I was proud of her and that I would miss her but that it was for the best that we didn’t have contact anymore. I was a crying mess. I sent her the message and turned my phone off. Later that night when I finally turned my phone on I had a friend deleted our messages and block her - I didn’t even want to know if she had responded. I had made the decision to completely let her go.

I remember Skyping a high school friend a couple days later, telling them what had happened. There response really shows just how close her and I were. “You broke up with her?” I remember laughing and saying that I guess I had. It felt like a break up. I had ripped away a person I had cared about so much, a friendship I expected to extend through decades and I was left feeling a sense of sadness that had turned into anger. I later found out that at her going away party she had talked shit about me only for her mom to speak up about how I had always been there for her. 

Since then I will occasionally have dreams with her in them. It’s like my subconscious is working through my grief. At first there was a lot of guilt, things being my fault, yelling. Then after a couple years I began to fight back, I would allow my anger out and I would tell her all the horrible shit she would do. Eventually when she would appear in my dreams she would be apologetic, sad and have remorse for what happened. At first I still held my ground and rejected her apology. It felt good, like I had reclaimed some of my own power over the situation. Most recently though they have been about us reconciling with what happened and forgiving each other and I’m stuck wondering if that’s actually how I feel. 

In the past nine years she has reached out a few times. The first time was when she finished basic. I received a call from a number I didn’t recognize and because I was out with my grandmother I ignored it. Later I got a text asking if the number still belonged to me after a couple exchanges I realized who it was. I wasn’t rude but I would definitely say my responses were distant. There was nothing I wanted to inquire about and all I can recall is that after a couple of exchanges the conversation died. Since then she reached out in 2017 and again earlier this year on Facebook messenger. Both times I chose to ignore them because I felt extremely conflicted about answering. This is mainly due to basically having been able to keep tabs on what was happening in her neck of the woods. My other best friend from high school has stayed good friends with another girl from our friend group. This girl was also really close to the person I stopped talking too. From what I have talked to them about the girl had let her back into her life only for her to be fairly cruel to her and the girls fiancé, ultimately ending their friendship. My best friend advises that she seems to be lonely and this is why she has reached out to me and others and that it doesn’t seem like it worth my time to give her any attention.

I’m reluctant though. Part of me knows that it’s the right thing to reach back and reconcile the past. That it was almost ten years ago and I barely remember the actions and arguments. We’ve both grown up a lot and she’s even married now. At the same time I feel like I’m scared of opening my heart back to someone I cared about only for it to get ripped up again. I’m still close with my main friend group from back in high school and they were never really close to her so they really couldn’t give a shit about her.

I understand that the outcomes really come down to this:
We reconcile and work on building back our lost friendship. We reconcile but things don’t really work out but we are on amendable terms. We reconcile but things don’t really work out and we end up fighting again. Or it just doesn’t work; and I find I still carry too much grief and resentment.

I guess I’m looking for people who have been through something similar or an outlook I haven’t considered. I’ll admit I’m scared and that it’s holding me back but at the same time I don’t know what I would say back to her.

TLDR; Had a falling out with my middle/high school best friend and we haven’t spoken in 9 years. She has reached out to me a couple times and I know from others she is trying to reconcile with people but I don’t know if I should or if I even could.",23Jun2020,1

833,"So I (23F) was working as a waitress in a fairly expensive restaurant before COVID-19 hit, and now, as of maybe 2 weeks ago, I’m back at work. A lot of the staff doesn’t want to come back, because they’ll make more money on unemployment, but I knew that if I declined to come back, and my boss reported me, I wouldn’t be eligible for unemployment anymore anyway, so I decided to go back. 

Because we only have like 8 servers total, all of us have to work almost every single day, and even at 50% capacity, the shifts are absolutely exhausting and relentless. Sure, I’m making good money, but I am so tired, and everyday I get to the point where I am so stressed that I consider quitting. When we had a reasonable amount of servers on staff, each of us didn’t have to take on so many tables at once, and only on holidays, or a really busy Saturday night, would I have those moments where I felt overwhelmed. Naturally, it takes a toll on you when you start feeling like that every single day.

My manager doesn’t want to hire new people because our staff trainer left, and I’m not sure how much longer it’s going to go on like this with so few people keeping things afloat. But I know I would be fucking the whole staff over if I quit, even though it’s really fucking with my mental health, as I have an anxiety disorder, and even with meds, all of this is getting to be more than I can handle.

On the other hand, I have two Bachelor’s degrees that I would really like to use at some point. I went to school for PR and Media Arts &amp; Design, and though I’m entry-level at this point, I wouldn’t mind making a little less money if it means I’m not on the verge of a panic attack while at work everyday. I’ve been applying to things (since before COVID) and the jobs exist where I am, it’s just even harder now, because people don’t want to train anyone right now (sounds familiar).

At this point, I feel like I’m just stuck. I’m a smart girl, and I want to work in the industry that I’m passionate about; I didn’t go to college JUST to throw thousands of dollars down the toilet. But I feel like I have no control over any of this. I’m trapped in a shitty job that, even if I could leave, everyone would be really upset with me. I already struggle with being sort of a people pleaser- I have a narcissistic mother, so it’s been engrained in me to put my own feelings aside most of the time in favor of making others happy. So this is just a huge mess and it’s been weighing on me a lot. 

What should I do?",23Jun2020,1
834,"The least they can do is shut the gate, right? 

Kidding aside-

We just bought a new home in a new city. There is an apartment complex that butts up to our back fence. Apparently when this house was being flipped the fence was installed. However before that there was just a dinky chain link fence that had a huge cut out. People from the apartment complex would cut through the yard instead of walking around the block. 

Now that our home is no longer just an abandoned house this is obviously a problem. I do NOT feel comfortable with strangers jumping our fence and walking through our yard. 

It also presents a problem because I have 3 dogs and when I go to let them out in the morning I do not want to have to walk to the opposite end of the yard and re-close the gate that they keep leaving open.

836,A girl I used to be good friends with cut me off recently and admittedly she had good reason to cut me off. I was the one at fault and I said some disrespectful things to her so I won’t front and act like I did nothing wrong. The thing is though we both used to go this one yoga studio. It’s been closed for a while but reopened recently. Sometimes I would go with her but other times I would go by myself. The problem is I haven’t seen her since the fallout and I’m not sure if I’ll see her there which I’m worried could lead to a confrontation if she does end up there.

She is 24, has no job, no car, no license, and no money. In addition to being I would say barely functional in terms of her mental health. I believe she has a high school diploma but no work experience outside of various minimum wage jobs. She refuses to go back to her parents house , there is a childhood history of abuse there. There is no one else she knows who she feels like could take her in.

840,"I will start this off with saying that he's trying to quit 15 years of smoking. That makes him even more of a dick. He is also not an empathetic person. Probably a combination of bad upbringing and ""that's just the way he is"". He's like this not just with me but with anyone. He doesn't get worked up for his friends misfortunes; watches movies as a series of events but doesn't really get an emotional reaction; most times anyone (including me) tells him something bad happened he doesn't really know what to do so he just does what he knows he's supposed to ""oh I'm so sorry that happened"" ""oh I hope it gets better"", gives me a hug or whatever. But it only sometimes feels genuine. He's just kind of going through the motions.

NOW... The twisted side of this is that he somehow spun this around in his head as a good thing, because he can be ""objective"" and doesn't need to rely on emotion (the ""lesser"" thing) to make decisions or conduct arguments. That's a different can of worms for a different post. 

The current situation is that he tends to be a dick about my fears. I have a lot of anxiety about certain things and sometimes it just feels worse than other times. He doesn't understand or empathise at all. 

He likes to bike, he helped me buy and improve my own bicycle, he even bought my first SH bike. He wants us to go on rides together and I go sometimes but I also avoid it. I don't have great physical endurance, I have pretty crap balance, and I'm *TERRIFIED* of traffic and of being in traffic. Seriously scared. It's gotten better over time, after going for rides for the past 3 years, but I'm still not ok. I don't know traffic rules. I have bad reflexes and distributive attention. 
We live in a country with roads full of potholes, fucked up manhole covers, and speeding drivers. Every time we go in the street I think about every single way I could die. The first time I went somewhere alone on my bike from his parents' (which is *out of town and far*), it was horrible, I was so stressed and scared I thought multiple times of tying my bike to a random tree and taking the bus. I did not bike anywhere alone after that. 

This issue is a constant irk for him, he is annoyed that I got the bike and I'm not riding it, that he wants us to bike to the city (we have to live with his parents atm and as I said, it's far from everything). That I'm annoying and I need to get over myself cause he wants us to be able to go together places. He says ""it's all in my head"" (like yeah literally that's what anxiety is), and just makes me feel bad.

Today we went to a store that's a bit further away. He asked if I was OK and I made a comment of just being stressed about the traffic. That was enough to annoy him. He just rolled his eyes like I was a dumb baby afraid of the spoonful of food. The rest of the road was me trying to explain why I'm afraid, him saying ""OK, I guess that makes sense"", then proceeding to keep making me feel bad. I tried telling him (AGAIN) that him making me feel bad won't make me better or make me try to prove I'm not actually scared, it'll just make me not want to ride with him anywhere. He replied with rolling his eyes and ""yeaaah cause now you're so inclined to ride with me or literally anyone''. And that was it. I haven't tried to talk to him sincer we got home.

He does not understand the concept of being afraid of a thing he's not afraid of. He does not understand something that isn't like him or that he hasn't felt before. He has fears too, but God forbid you compare them to my own, cause my own are just ""ridiculous"" and ""make no sense"". Cause him not sleeping in his bedroom cause there was a stink bug in there makes total sense. At least my fear comes from a lifetime of getting hit in the face whenever I tried to perform a physical activity and tripping or hurting myself on literally any surface.

He literally can not comprehend the concept of someone being scared of something  *HE* isn't scared of.

Now... How the FUCK do you explain something like this? How do you get at someone who is incapable of fucking compassion? I am NOT good at ""emotionless cold discussion"". I am a very emotional person. I get really hurt when he's mean to me. I don't know how to deal with that.

TL;DR: Boyfriend is unempathetic and doesn't take my anxieties seriously because he has the compassion of a rock. He's also extra dick-like because he's trying to quit smoking. How the fuck do I get through him quitting smoking if he's gonna be this way?",23Jun2020,1

845,"I need some advice with a really complicated situation so this might be a bit of a long post.  

I'm eighteen and in my first year of university.  I had to move out of home about a month ago because of problems with my parents.  

I had a relative offer me his apartment (to sublet) for an indeterminate length of time because he was going to move into his girlfriends house. I knew his place wasn't that great but hey,  cheap rent and he offered to help make it easy for me.  

Well, it wasn't.  I got there and the pace was full of cockroaches and it was trashed. Filthy and so much crap everywhere, I had to spend so much time and money cleaning up the place. I was pissed but I finally got it okay. 

He also came by like two weeks later without my permission (I didn't even know he still had a key!) and came inside and touched my things and used the bathroom and even left the seat up, which is disgusting.  I felt so violated.  

I message him and say that's not fucking acceptable.  He ignores me.  

Well he decided a couple of weeks ago that he would need the place for a week (7 days) and that I would just have to leave for that amount of time.  I was annoyed but reluctantly agreed on the terms that the place would be as clean as I left it and he would leave my stuff alone.  

While I'm away, after displacing me, the man has the audacity to harass me and call me like three times in one day because he couldn't find something in the house he left behind.  He even harassed my mother! And sent me threatening text messages saying I better move out if I won't answer him.  After weeks of him ignoring my texts,  he has the audacity to threaten me over not answering his harassment.  

Well a week later I come home and he's still there. Keeping in mind he said he'd leave by Sunday and I got back on Monday morning, so he should have left a day ago.  The place is unbelievably filthy and trashed and he looked clearly wasn't well, it was really fucking bad. He gave me some cash to find somewhere for the night and I left again,  very pissed off.  

Then that night he says I won't be able to come back until the next day but later in the afternoon.  So I come back and he's fucked up the house again. 

Also he sent me texts telling me to 'shut the fuk up and be grateful' before he left. 

I'm here now and I'm just so fucking angry. The place I've lived in for only a month is yet again filthy after I did so much work to make it liveable.  

The worst bit is the fact that he's supposed to be a recovering addict but I know that in the week (and two extra stolen days) he's had drugs here.

I found lighters,  loose leaves of his 'herb', a plastic food container that's clearly had cannabutter made in it. 


Plus a bunch of powdered chalk. 

Plus a piece of paper with his pounds to grams conversions on it (honestly that's just fucking lazy). 

and the worst one of all: 

A USED FUCKING NEEDLE!!! 

Right now I am just beyond enraged. All of this abusive,  manipulative, immature shit from someone who's supposed to be be twice my age but can't even act like an adult or stay clean.  

I'm going to university housing tomorrow to see if I can get a room to stay in (sort of like dorms).  

But the advice I'm looking for is this: should I have called the police?  My mom safely disposed of the needle for me but we only took one photo of it and it wasn't very clear. I'm now thinking I should have called the cops and had them search the place but we took a look and couldn't find anything else more substantial (actual hard drugs) and I was just so exhausted from all the travelling I've had to do with all the drama. 

If anyone has any advice it would really help me feel a bit better.  Thanks.",23Jun2020,1

847,"The title doesn’t really explain it well but I am 21 (M) and I’ve never been sporty. Drama student go figure, always found it a bit hard to get along with other guys, that whole deal.

The problem comes with whenever my old group would hang out, it always involves stripping to shorts and playing some football for hours with punishments, complicated rules and often ending in challenging random massive groups of other lads to come and play against us that always ends in insults and rough play.

I can’t stress how much I hate it. I suck at football and always have and have never fit the “lad” stereotype, for that reason I’m more often than not the subject of teasing and insults from other guys.

Now, the guys in my group are lovely, very good guys. But to the point that they feel they have to cater for me by giving me pity points and allowing me to shirk rules of the game due to my lack of ability. That’s really nice of them but the whole deal just isn’t my thing.

854,"Since quarantine, i've been strictly hanging with my family and my girlfriend (and her family). For the past 3 months, i haven't seen my friends. My friends have been able to go out for the past month or two (with covid restrictions relaxing), and always ask me to hang out. Originally, i would say no because my mom didn't want me going out with them during quarantine, however, she became more lenient once the restrictions started to relax. Now, she says i can go out, however, my girlfriend and her mother would prefer if i didn't.

Here's the problem. I was told by one of my friends that four of my friends are starting to get upset at me because it seems like i'm ditching them for her. They think this for a couple reasons. A: i tell them i can't go out and then i go to my girlfriends house. B: i am literately the only person in our friend group that isn't allowed to go out what so ever ( so it seems like i don't want to hangout with them and i'm not trying to see them).

For the sake of my friendships, i really want to see my friends so i don't drift away, but i don't think my girlfriend will take it likely, and i may not be able to come visit her house for a couple days if her mom doesn't like that i'm going out. I've been dating my girlfriend for almost a year and i don't want to mess that up either.

856,"Jobs are not easy to come by with the pandemic, so I was thrilled to find this position that I am a great applicant for. I have an internal referral as well. I was walking on trails at my old university last week, and a biker stopped to greet my dog. He commented on my appearance, then asked if I went to the uni. I told him I did, told him my degree, and turns out he works for the company I had applied to in the same division. I told him I had just applied and thought it was a good company. He was nice, so I gave him my number and continued on.

The next day, he texted me saying he was glad he met me... then continued to say he was very excited about getting my internship started and had a meeting with his manager about it. That threw me for a surprise, both because I had just met the guy, barely talked with him, and whatever was happening seemed unprofessional from his end. I hadn't asked for his help nor told him exactly what jobs I applied to. I replied just saying that I wasn't expecting that at all, and asked if there was anything I needed to provide him (resume, CL etc.). I ended up forwarding him my resume, but stayed cautious about what was happening.

Two days later I'm walking on the trails again, and he texts me saying he's biking on the same trail and wanted to meet up to go over my resume. I was still cautious of this, but I told him I was walking and only had a few minutes. Ran into him a few minutes down the trail... with him carrying flowers and chocolate and a graduation card. It honestly creeped me out and just seemed very extreme. He gave them to me, walked with me while spewing resume tips, then when we were near my car I told him I had to go ASAP. He told me we'd have to on a coffee date sometime soon, I laughed it off and went straight to my car to leave. 

Since then, he's texted me about meeting with the hiring team for the position and ""being close"" to securing my position, told me he handed off my resume and CL to the hiring manager, and that we should meet up again. I haven't responded and have no intention to, and no longer even walk on the trails. 

I'm a mix of creeped out by these interactions and upset that a good potential job opportunity is gone for me. I haven't heard anything from the company directly, only this guy's accounts, which seems off to me, and the situation doesn't make me feel any better about it either.",23Jun2020,1

Anyways I got this app the my friend used for dating (spotafriend) and I wouldn't recommend it. I found a few friends, but most were horrible interactions 

Besides all that, I was still determined to put in effort! I found someone and he seemed fairly interested in me and vise versa but now that I'm going into it I'm kinda put off? Maybe I'm just being a scardy cat or something but I just have this urge to ghost him and go back to how I was a few days ago. I guess I'm still shook from my past relationship? 

I'm not sure, but, I know that even though I have this itching impulse to do it, that I shouldn't. He's a really nice and fun guy and I really want to be friends with him and see where that goes! 

Does anyone have a word for this or how I can get over it? He's really sweet, and I don't want to ghost him but I noticed that every time I tried to date in the past I've always ended up pushing people away.

863,"Tldr; my life has been a mess for years and I don't know what to do anymore.

My life has been a mess for as long as I've been alive, but this'll be long enough as it is so I'll start when I was 12, I was a somewhat smart 6th grader so I always had free time to do whatever I wanted while the class was finishing whatever they were currently working on, I listened to a lot of 90's rap and I thought I could make a few songs, I wrote like 3 or 5 throughout the rest of the year, i never thought it would go anywhere but it was fun and I had nothing better to do.

7th and 8th grade were ok, at that point in my life school was my happy place away from home, my parents were divorced and I'd go to my dad's place on the weekends, they'd use me as the messenger so they could argue with each other without texting, my mom's husband, who to this day i still don't consider my step dad, would yell at me for no reason and I just hated life, nothing was enjoyable for those 2 years.

High school started and life started getting good again, I stopped seeing my dad, the only connection we had was that he paid for my phone that I got a month before 8th grade ended, I was in a class called latinos in action and l was more patriotic because of it, life finally felt good, i was happy for the first time in a long time, i met a girl in my lia class, we became good friends, after a while I asked her out, she told me her parents wanted her to be 16, so I decided to wait, on valentines day that year I got her a giant cupcake with a plastic rose on it, she told me she loved roses, i made sure to remember that.

That same year I got back into my music, I synced up my phone amd saw my old songs, i read them and they were really good, i realized I had a chance at making rapping my career, I went for it, over the course of that year I made like 20 songs, around the same time I found out a few people somehow stole my music, i put weeks of my life into figuring out how they stole my stuff, I never shared entire songs, only a screenshot to snap and insta, the only thing that I could come up with is that they hacked my phone, way back from when I was 12, because a few songs I wrote back in 2016 were stolen and posted in 2017, I still don't know, but thats my best answer.

I had my phone taken away 2 weeks before 9th grade ended for reasons I don't wanna get into because of how long this is, I had it taken away for 9 months, I only got the phone im using now back in February because I got a job and I was paying for it, I missed 1 of my 4 high school summer breaks, I missed out on hanging out with friends, I missed out on all the memories I could've made just because my mom took my phone.

Sophomore year was decent, I was back in my lia class and although I didn't have a phone at the time, life was somewhat good again, I was talking to all my friends again, getting closer to her, when I got a phone again I went right back to my music, i wanted to buy recording equipment but I was stupid with my money and didn't save, I found out that she started dating someone that lives 2 states away over summer, that hurt me slightly because she was still 15, but I talked myself into believing that it was because her parents didn't know, on valentines day that year I remembered that she told me she loved roses, so I got her a bracelet with 12 roses, around the same time I found out she was single, so I took my chance, prom was around the corner so I decided to ask her, over the past year or so i became an amazing chef, im going to be on guys grocery games when the world opens up again, so I decided to make a cake, icing and everything, from scratch with fondant spelling ""prom?"" It was a Sunday when I decided to ask her so I texted her asking when she would be at church, she said 12:30, so I went to her house at 11:30, she said she was already at church so I left it at her door and went to work, when I was there she texted me saying that she was having a bad week and that made her day but she already had plans, that hurt but it is what it is.

A few weeks after that our class went on a college tour, on the bus ride she was talking about prom, i couldn't hear her but someone yelled out ""wait, i thought (my name) asked you to prom"" so that let me know that she told people, but with that guy asking, everyone in the class knew, besides that the rest of that day was terrible, the tour was nice, while I was walking home with a friend he asked if I saw her story, I said no, he showed me that some kid asked her to prom and she said yes, she blocked me from seeing her story so I wouldn't know, she didn't have plans, she just didn't wanna go with me, I cared enough over 2 years to do everything I did, and she didn't even care enough to be honest, im only 16 but I mean this, i loved her, i wanted to marry her and spend the rest of my life with her, I thought about what I wanted to name our kids for fucks sake, i loved her, and she didn't even care enough to be honest,she still has the pan because I didn't wanna ruin the cake to take it out, im a better cook than baker, i don't wanna talk to her just to ask for it back, I went to work that night and I got fired for something that wasn't my fault, I've been looking for a job but because of the pandemic I haven't gotten anything.

And here's where I am now, just a 16 year old trying to get my life together, I don't know what to do, and I don't think I ever will, I just want my music to take off but with it being stolen I doubt it, and i need to do like 22 packets if i wanna graduate.",23Jun2020,1

I’m struggling with what to do. Currently I work as a garbage man. We don’t have the robotic arms to pick up the cans for us, we have have to pick up the garbage by getting out at every stop and throwing it in. Also I’m a “seasonal” at this job but do the exact same job as the full hires. Worse pay, no benefits, or insurance etc.. I recently got hurt on the job earlier in the year, stepping out of the truck and spraining my ankle. Fast forward and I’m back on the job for a month and hurt the same ankle again on the job. I’m so sick of working at this job and I really want to quit but since I’m hurt I don’t think I can. I’m currently on light duty doing some bs work. Considering I need money to pay for rent and bills, obviously I can’t just up and quit. Now with that being said what I really wanna do, which is also my passion, is making YouTube videos and streaming on twitch. I’m not big enough on twitch yet to begin to consider replacing it with my current income from my regular job. I’m currently an affiliate on twitch, which means I still make money but it’s not where I need to be right now. As for YouTube I’m am very small with 30 some odd videos and still working that angle. Honestly though guys, I’ve just had it with the job I’m at my wits end with this place. Like I really badly just want to quit and focus all my energy into making videos and streaming but if I did that I would be putting more stress on my fiancée, and have not much money coming in from twitch and I feel like it would turn into a big mess. But I want to follow my passion and do what I love. Idk what to do.. I know I just need to keep streaming and work on these things more but I’m just tired of having to deal with my shit job and I’m doing  what I can with YT and TTV but I guess it’s not enough. Do I sacrifice every second of my off time working on something for my dream? That would mean I wouldn’t spend any time with my fiancée or family or have time for anything else.

865,"Hey everyone, 

I've smoked weed since I was ~13 years old (20 now). I absolutely love it-boring days become more fun, music is better, food is better, sleep comes easier, and it's nice to just pop out for a smoke. Over the past 2-3 years I've been smoking every day, however this hasn't seemed to hinder my success in any way (high ACT score, good scholarships, good attitude/performance at work, working out 6 days/week, etc.). I typically only smoke at night, and in all honesty, I'd never seen a reason to stop. Until recently. 

Since I started college, I've suffered from a general lack of motivation. I've felt depressed since I was quite young (pre-teenage years), but it never seemed to hinder me the way it has over the past year or two. I've never spoken to anyone about this besides my mom and an ex girlfriend, both of whom encouraged me to talk to a doctor or psychiatrist. Unfortunately, it's extremely hard for me to open up about my feelings, and I worry that I might open up to a doctor and have them write me off or judge me (this sounds stupid in writing, but I genuinely can't get past this mental barrier). I'm 99% convinced I have depression as the symptoms fit, my biological father was bipolar and depressed, my mother used to be depressed from ~11-mid 20's, my grandmother takes medication for depression, and my grandfather's side of the family has a history of depression (therefore I suspect a genetic link).

It's been hard dragging myself out of bed in the morning, much less studying and showing up every day for class. I feel lonely, apathetic, and detached from the world. Honestly, life feels like a chore that I wish I didn't have to do (I'd never kill myself because it would absolutely ruin my family and I love them too much). Additionally, I used to be near the top of my class all through K-12, but I feel a general fog around my mind now, meaning I sometimes have to put more effort into things that may have come easily in the past. Additionally, I want to refresh my Spanish and possibly learn a new language, however I'm worried that it'll be much harder as my short-term memory isn't quite as strong anymore (in addition to the motivation issues and general mental fog).

I want to get better and be able to accomplish everything I want to, I'm just not sure if that means stopping smoking weed, getting help for depression, or maybe both. What's really causing these problem? 

I'm wondering if anyone's had similar experiences, or if anyone just wants to throw their two cents in, I'd very much appreciate it.

867,"Ok, first of all I might say that this is not an intersting problem and all but if you could help me I'd be really happy!

Ok so First you need to know is I'm 13 (that's really important). So in 2018 I've met a guy in the scouts, and we were friends. But soon I would fell in love with him, he has everything I would wish for in a boy, he is kind, handsome, smart, cool, he play games, he watches anime, etc. But then I found out he actually live in another city. Wich is a big problem since it's pretty far away and I'm basically really young. After this I slowly gave up.

So time passed by and He called me again, I was like really nervous. He said basically about an online relationship (that never works) we could have, of course I said yes because I was still into him. The problem is that yesterday at night I found out his age... and well we could say he is a little older than me maybe... like he is 17?? In my country at least it's not considered pedophilia and my mom also said that's not a big problem. But in my opinion I would only date someone to make both of us happy, right? And in my opinion the only one who would be happy with this relationship would be me, as I'm way too young I wouldn't be able to give him all he needs.

869,"This realization of mine has genuinely deteriorated my mental health for quite some time now, I am slowly getting out of it but it’s still on my mind everyday and I don’t know how to stop focusing on it now that I’m aware. 

I really don’t even know how to explain this without it sounding ridiculous. 

Basically, I crave male attention but at the same time it makes me really confused?
My childhood was quite comfortable, however I did recently realize that I never really received as much affection? I got attention, but not affection. To be honest I can’t even imagine myself being affectionate with my family, we just aren’t like that. 

I was always sort of a tomboy as a child, my mom didn’t let me wear my hair down until middle school because it was hard to look after apparently. Same goes for skinny jeans, she never liked skinny jeans and thought they made me look too skinny. Eventually of course I started wearing them and she changed her mind. Basically I was kind of prohibited from doing girly things I think .... Not on purpose , tbh I don’t know why.
My dad used to get mad at me for painting my nails or doing my makeup. I was strongly encouraged not to shave my legs until last middle school as well because “hair grows back thicker and I wouldnt want to deal with that”. 
So despite their intentions being good, It prohibited me from being as feminine as I would have wanted and I honestly kind of resent them for this. 

Anyway, In the last 2 years I’d say I “found myself” and developed my own style, personality, etc. I’ve figured out what compliments my features and it made a *drastic* difference. I’m a lot more confident now, and I also have noticed an influx in male attention ...

Deep down... I find myself wanting to be noticed? I want to be pretty. I want people to think of me as pretty. I want people to be extra nice just because I’m pretty. 
But at the same time, this thought *enfuriates* me. I basically got what I wanted, but now I’m almost mad at the fact that it’s true...? That most men garner to those who look pretty. 

However my self-esteem is still very low (my self-worth too judging by this post, lol) but paying so much attention to the way I look and the way people treat me has also made me aware of all the other pretty girls and it’s now made me jealous! I am suddenly now jealous when I am with my boyfriend and I see a pretty girl. I start to wonder if he thinks this way too... if he sees her like that and would be extra nice to her because she’s extra pretty. 
But then I think, I only want him to treat *me* like that... even though I still subconsciously crave male attention .... 

I feel so selfish. And I am so confused. I question my self-worth on a bad day. I just don’t feel equal. I don’t know where all of this came from. I don’t know if it’s from lack of affection as a child, or whether it’s because I was ugly as a child, or if it’s just how the world works and I’m only aware to it now. 

My thoughts on the way most men see women is like a rollercoaster. I like it sometimes, I want it sometimes. But sometimes it just makes me so passive aggressive and I develop the whole “men suck” mentality. 

This also leads me to another thing that confuses the hell of out me. Men are usually seen as dominant and once again, sometimes I like it ... I would much rather be submissive than dominant .... BUT WHY? Sometimes I realize halfway through, that I enjoy being dominated or having a man take over for me whether this is in a sexual context or just an everyday context type of thing. 
WHY DO I LIKE IT? IF IT ANGERS ME HALF THE TIME?

I don’t understand. This has sent me into a deep depressive episode and I only am getting out of it slowly now... clearly not fast enough if I still have enough passion to make this post. 

I just have never been more confused with myself. Why do I subconsciously crave the things that make me angry? I feel inferior to be thinking this way. I want this to stop. 

I want to stop basing my self-worth on whether or not I’m attractive and fit enough for men. I fucking hate this. I hate this a lot. I am so torn and most importantly, severely confused as to where this came from.

870,"I'm a teen male. (16 if it matters. 17 on the 3rd of next month) Ever since this whole covid thing started, I've been feeling more and more lazy and shitty. I'm not depressed, at least I don't think I am, based on my previous experience with it. I'm not in the mood to write a long story, so I'll try to keep it simple.

So far, I haven't had very good luck since the end of 2019. Even in January things started not going my way. Grades dropping, started seeing friends less, etc. I was laid off from my job with a vehicle insurance to keep paying, and I'm still looking for another. I had a few job interviews, one specifically for a job I was really interested in. I thought the interview couldn't have gone better, but I never heard back. And I recently broke up with my girlfriend, because she realized she wasn't ready for a relationship with me yet.

With all of this going on, I guess I've become addicted to my bed, if that's a thing. I spend all my time here, amd whenever I need to get up for any reason at all, it causes me to become extremely angry and a bit aggressive. I struggle to contact anyone, I don't want to leave my room, hell I rarely even want to turn on my computer or Xbox anymore, and when I do it isn't normally for more than an hour. It used to be a lot more than that. I lost the spark and the joy to do anything. Often times I barely want to eat, even when I've got a stomach ache from hunger.

I know if I ask what to do people will say 'get outta bed, go do something' and I have been trying to force myself to more often. The problem is I just don't get the same happiness from doing anything, and I get irrational anger when I have to get up. Is there any other way I can help get that motivation back, and maybe ways to block out/cope with this anger?",23Jun2020,1

874,"I'm going to try and keep this post as short as possible. I just recently in the military as an E1. I make about $650 every 2 weeks and I'm in the market for a car. I literally just need something to drive around in. I really want to hit the beach as well as some other spots around town but I don't have a reasonable way to get there. I could take a taxi cab but they are really expensive here and I live on base. My only option is to walk (2 hour walk to the beach) or get a friend to take me. I know 1 guy who has a car and he might take me but I really don't know if he'd be up for it since he lives off base.

My real dilemma is this: I am planning on buying a car, but should I take a loan from my bank and finance it or just buy a really crappy car?. I've got some money saved up but not enough to buy a car and still have a reasonable amount left over for an emergency fund. My bank already approved a loan for me, and the interest and monthly payments aren't too bad. In a little over a month I will be going on a bunch of detachments so I don't really have time to keep saving up money. I'm thinking about putting some money down on a loan and just getting maybe a $6000-7000 car. I have no real credit history yet (20 years old) and this would help build credit but I'll probably be paying on it for 3-4 years. I'd really be cutting it close for the next few months on my E1 salary, but I'll be promoted in the next few months so my paycheck will slowly get better of course. I'm single so I don't really have any expenses besides some student loan payments which are pretty low.

876," Before you read this, I want you to know that I completely understand that my feelings are a result of my own ego. My girlfriend has had sex with 17 people before me, I was her 18th. This was over a 3 year period of which she considers to be a very low point in her life in which she considered sex as very fleeting and casual and never attached it with the idea of love. I don't believe she is lying because she has always been very honest and I have never had a sign to distrust her.

We have been together for 3 and a half years now, whilst her sexual history bothered me at the start of the relationship I soon got over it and it hasn't bothered me until recently. I don't know why. We are moving in together (renting) in 6 weeks and maybe it has something to do with this but I'm not sure because I have always been excited about it prior to the past couple of days.

**How do I come to terms with her sexual history and not be bothered by it?** I constantly have visions of her having sex with all of these guys and it is just constantly tormenting me. She has told me before that our sex has blown any other sex out of the water because we love each other and know what we both like in sex. I love her a lot, this is the only bad part of our relationship and I know she hasn't done anything wrong.

I haven’t been around anyone but my wife. My wife still has her job, but her job is in the medical field, so they’re pretty good with sanitation, and there’s limited exposure to being around anyone who isn’t a coworker.

My mom works from home and my sister works at a convenient store. I recognize my sister’s job is really the risky one, but she plays it as safe as she can. They live with my 100 year old grandmother.

I couldn’t forgive myself if I took the plague to them. It’s actually really bothering me, because I see people cramming into stores all around me, or people hanging out with large groups of friends, and all I can worry about is them getting sick.

I don’t think I’m “living in fear” or anything like that, I just don’t want to do something stupid.

883,"I’m going to keep this short because I could go on a 20 minute rant if I’m not careful. I’ll edit in more information to any questions asked. 

Essentially, I live in a basement apartment attached to a 3 story house. My upstairs roommates or ‘neighbors’ as I refer them to have 5 children all under the ages of 10. 

A couple months back, we had a confrontation of sorts because I told her that her kids were waking me up every morning when she lets them into the backyard (that directly faces my bedroom), and that I’d appreciate if they could try and keep it down and have some respect for our boundaries. The thing is, I can’t tell her not to put her kids back there because it’s noon and that’s a reasonable time, I would really just like for her to think about it in my situation. She took this to mean, “your kids can’t go in the backyard at all”. I told her that it wasn’t them being out there that was the issue but more how they behave when they’re out there by themselves. She got extremely defensive at this point and brought up one of her kids being on the autistic spectrum, which really didn’t have anything to do with my complaint. I just wanted her not to let them out there every single day for 2 weeks so I could actually sleep in one of these days. She also knows I have 10 years of health history related to migraines  and sleep/energy problems. I have to hear the kids alllll day whether they’re inside our outside. And when they’re outside, it’s twice as loud and in my space. 

I thought she understood maybe a little better but today in particular has been especially bad with being woken up by screaming and jumping since around 8:30 am, and then letting the kids out in backyard around 10 am as well. I want to say something to let her know just how loud the kids have been today but I’m not trying to start more personal issues. Is there anything I can say/do? Or am I just being unrealistic to expect her to control her children a certain way. 

TLDR: My upstairs neighbors/roommates kids run, jump and scream at 8:30 in the morning. Have a history of letting their kids in the backyard where my basement apartment faces and letting them be as loud as they want before 11am. Is there anything I can say to help her understand without offense? Or is this just something I don’t have the right to complain about?",23Jun2020,1
884,"I work in a hospital setting, working with patients directly. I'm often the first person they see after being admitted to the floor and one of our facility's policies is that we obtain an ""admission weight"" on any new patient admitted to the floor (this is fairly common practice). This is uncomfortable for a lot of patients, particularly older females who may have a bit of weight to lose. All of this is important, I promise!

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I suffered a miscarriage that has left me bloated and uncomfortable in addition to, if I'm honest, super depressed to the point where I'm eating my feelings a little bit. I've gained some weight (primarily in my abdominal area) which I'm not proud of, but others at my work are struggling with weight issues and they don't seem to have this issue (or maybe they do but don't discuss it). With this new weight gain, I have noticed an uptick in people, particularly late-middle aged to older ladies, commenting on my weight, usually while I am weighing them, and asking questions like ""oh how far along are you? Are you pregnant?"" or ""at least you have a good reason for being so heavy!"" It blows my mind that people I don't know could be so invasive and rude, as I thought it was in good taste to NEVER ask a woman if she is pregnant, but I'm also not THAT heavy, I think its just the residual bloating that has led people to believe I'm expecting. I quickly explain that no, I'm not pregnant, and then try to change the subject as quickly as possible. Usually they apologize, but every so often I'll get someone that really pushes the subject, saying things like ""oh well you should DEFINITELY take a test,"" and I want to die a little inside because I did recently and got the result I have been hoping for, only to have to have it taken away unexpectedly.

Every time this has happened, I have wanted to run out of the room and sob my eyes out, but not all of my coworkers know my story and its certainly not something I feel comfortable sharing with management. It also makes my subsequent interactions with these patients super uncomfortable, especially with those who bring it up again and again. I have even gone as far to tell one of them ""that's not an appropriate comment,"" and they complained about me when my unit director did her patient satisfaction rounds. It seems I can't win- either I have to fall victim to these well-meaning but hurtful comments, or I have to call these patients out and risk getting in trouble with management. I am not super keen on discussing this issue with my managers because 1. I do not know them that well and 2. One of them (there are three total) was not super understanding when I had to take off while actively miscarrying- they wanted a doctor's note listing specifics as to why I couldn't work for two days, whether or not my condition was contagious, etc.

Even though I went through the physical act of miscarrying a few weeks ago, I keep being retriggered. I understand the patients are, for the most part, well meaning, but these comments are extremely hurtful and I have had to face them sometimes several times a shift. I am actively working on losing the weight I've gained, and I know most of the patients that make these comments mean well and aren't intentionally trying to hurt me. My few coworkers that DO know about what I'm going through have graciously offered to take over caring for these patients, or weigh them, or have offered a supportive shoulder, but it seems unfair to expect them to pick up my slack. How do I convey to patients, who I haven't met before and are already undergoing stress, that such comments are unwelcome and extremely invasive and hurtful without getting myself in trouble or irreparably damaging that relationship?

889,"My(20M) father is an amazingly competent individual. In every job he has worked, every social circle he has become a part of, and in every game he has played, he is extremely efficient to the point his abilities are irreplicable. As a brief example, for the tech company he is working for he has a mental model of the entire code base of the project he is working on, and can answer any question about the project in a minuscule amount of time and effort. He worked his way up in the company from a contract employee to the Chief Technical Officer.

As a side effect of his general modeling ability, he has the tendency to work his way into systems such that they completely fall apart without his presence. The problem I'm facing is that this has happened to my head. I have developed a massive, deeply entrenched inferiority complex towards him that makes it incredibly difficult for me to follow the path I want to take. His advice is impossible for me to ignore, so I am left in the dubious position of following his recommendation and continuing the problem or not following it and feeling like an idiot for not doing so, especially when it doesn't work out in the end. Even following his advice, it is often said from the perspective that I work mentally in the same way he does, and I simply don't. If I make mistakes that he didn't account for I feel ridiculed when he points them out as if they are obvious. A secondary issue that turns this into a feedback loop is that stress turns me into a massive procrastinator and makes it hard to actually follow said advice.

It feels as if he expects me to be a clone of him, and my general inability to do so has made it incredibly difficult to proceed due to fear of failing that image. How can I get rid of this inferiority complex so I can get on with my life and gain some emotional independence?

898,"Background: This surgery occurred last October of 2019. Previous to the surgery I was having minor breathing issues for about 5 years due to a deviated septum from a broken nose / football injury. The medical term for the surgery is a Septoplasty with turbine reduction. 

In short, the surgery did not provide the outcome I desired. At this point I've given the surgery ample time to heal and my breathing is 0% better (Doctor said 90% chance my breathing would improve). This is a well known doctor in a well known hospital.

About a week after the surgery I was rushed to the Emergency room for severe bleeding. The EMT's administered a blood clotting agent via IV in the ambulance. By the time I arrived at the hospital the bleeding had subsided and they cleaned out the clot and put some packing up there. Wanted me to stay overnight but I released myself. 

I went back for a check up about a week later after the ER visit and the doctor said everything looks normal and is healing correctly. I made him well aware of the ER visit and asked what could have gone wrong and he said nothing, the surgery was successful, could just be a leak from the turbines healing (basically dismissed it). He seemed to rush out of the room pretty quick though.. 

Breakdown of the costs (very close estimates):

Septoplasty with turbine reduction: $8,200. My portion after insurance did their thing $2,100. I've started paying some of this on a payment plan. Still owe $1500.

Ambulance for ER visit $780. My portion $520. I paid $120 and they sent the bill to a collection agency already, not sure why so fast. Collection agency mailed me asking for the other $400.

Anesthesia $1200. My portion $700.  Have not paid any of this. Just got the bill on this one, not sure why it took so long.

She has also planned it out how she'll transition to her new life by concocting all these lies to cover up her secret. Now, this has put a ton of pressure on me because I am also currently in law school and I might be at risk of failing. In fact, a lot of us are.

909,"It's hard to know where to begin.. I'm a 33F
Last year I finished up my first year teaching after a rough year of grad school after a tough end to a relationship and moving back in with my parents. I pushed myself through all of it, even though I knew my mental health was suffering.

I thought that at the end of it all, I'll finally get financially stability and just move out on my own. I was actually looking at houses because I had a good salary finally. 

The beginning of the 2019/2020 year was really rough. I volunteered to help with a lot in my school to keep me busy and involved because I really wanted to make a difference and push through to be successful. All my lessons were interesting, the kids were engaged, and I was proud of all of the work I put in. But it was taking a huge toll on my life. I was in survival mode. Everything I did was work. When I came home, I was sleeping 10+ hours every night otherwise I'd get a lot more impatient, which I felt was unfair for the kids.
I kept this up until October. Something didn't feel right. I checked myself in for inpatient treatment at a mental health hospital. But I was eager to leave because it was a humiliating experience and I had parent teacher conferences to get to. I was on new meds so I thought everything was going to be okay. I mean, that's what everyone kept telling me.

I kept it up for a bit. Halloween kept me mentally happy because it's one of my favorite holidays, especially as a teacher. 
In mid November, I hit a wall. I remember in my first period class, I was looking at one of my seniors and realized that I didn't have anything left. I looked at her and felt terrible because I wanted to give everything I could for this student but I felt so empty. I excused myself to the hallway and absolutely lost it. I didn't know what to do but I didn't feel safe with myself so I checked myself into the hospital again for 8 days this time. That was the last day any of my students saw me. I still feel so guilty for essentially abandoning them without any explanation. I think about them and miss them everyday.

After a couple of months of thinking, I came to the realization that I don't want to be a teacher. I'm very introspective and overthink everything, and saw that my dream job was far from what I thought it would be. What bothered me the most was the lack of support from my adminstration, and all of the ridiculous things they asked me to do. If I were to teach again, it would be independent and not through my certification. I just can't. I've been explaining to my therapist that I just give too much. I don't have a healthy way of having a career and a life, especially as a teacher. After my experiences, I felt that being a certificated teacher was not for me, and that the system was not set up for student success. I thought I could be there as a guide or a support through the bullshit that students have to deal with, but I just couldn't live like that.

I've worn many hats in my life, many passions and pursuits, but I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. I feel like I don't have purpose or motivation. I don't feel like myself at all. Even though I had a lot of free time, I continued to isolate myself like I was working. I also quit this youth program I helped run for over 15 years. Even though I was shy in high school, at that point in my life I felt.. popular? Err I'd say more connected with people.

Not anymore. Through the holidays and my birthday, I spent it isolated. My family never understood. When I left my youth program, no one from there ever spoke to me again, and what killed me was how few friends reached out, even my best friend. I remember end of February crying myself to sleep because it was the worst birthday I've ever had in my life. I thought things were shit then and that things couldn't get any worse. I was fucking wrong.

It was March and Corona virus was starting to affect everyday life. The job interviews I had cancelled on me because they were closing down. I already felt like I was in quarantine for months. People were increasingly in less contact and I was even more isolated. I didn't understand how people could post ""check on your depressed friends"" on fb, and then say nothing to me. For awhile I did try to reach out. But some people didn't respond. I felt forgotten.. or hated. Anxiety is a bitch and I continually reaffirmed the lies I told myself. Everyday feels like an internal war, but the expression I carry is blank. Not to mention I've been struggling with my meds. Every single SSRI I've taken has given me horrible side effects. I'm working on SNRIs now, but I've been waiting for a psychiatrist for months. Turns out my PCP accidently prescribed me meds that interacted and made my anxiety worse. I've been going through withdraws because I'm coming down from cymbalta. My whole body feels like it's been shocked all the time. You know that feeling when your skin jumps because someone scares you, or jumping in a cold pool after being in the hot tub. I feel like my brain chemistry has been fucked with so much, I'm definitely not as sharp and my memory is so bad. I couldn't teach now even if I wanted to.

Ultimately, I ended up checking myself in to inpatient treatment a total of 4 times, 2 ER visits and my first ambulance ride. Mind you, through all of these experiences, I was having trouble coping because I felt unheard, especially by mental health staff. I'd get a good staff member every once in awhile, but for the most part, I've felt dismissed by everyone in my life. I felt like I was written off as miserable. I was usually a happy go lucky, bubbly, see the positives in everything, and it felt like everyone expected me to be that way. It felt unfair that for a moment I wasn't allowed to have weakness. I felt like I wasn't allowed to complain.

Through all of this too, I have a tough relationship with my family, especially my dad. I didn't have a name for it, but a therapist helped me realize that my upbringing and family dynamic have had an effect on my mental health. A few months ago I actually discovered r/raisedbynarcissists which made me feel like I wasn't alone. I finally had an identifier for the relationship for my family and that it can get better for me. Someone posted [this article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-narcissist-in-your-life/202003/the-12-dysfunctional-rules-the-narcissistic-family) that made me pause because this was my family to a T. I guess I'm the scapegoat. Still trying to figure that one out.

Politics has been an issue in the house. I went to a lot of anti war protests and was the politically active one in my family, even though I kept to myself around then. For some reason, 2016 was the year my dad decided that he was going to be a flaming Trump supporter and watch fox news everyday. He tries to pick on me all the time because he's just lumped me into the ""other"" category and assumes I'm the indoctrinated evil that fox so fears. Idk. I think it's a dynamic that needs to be shared because living at home with my parents makes me feel crazy. My whole family thinks I need to repair my relationship with my dad because he going through dialysis 3x a week, has had a heart attack with 4 stents (I saved him, that's another story) and right now he's living 4 years passed when doctors said he's going to survive. He's maintaining, but not getting better. I think bringing home a bag of McDonald's a couple times a week could not be helping with that.. he's starting to come to terms with his mortality. My mom says he's really trying to make an effort to do better with me. She pointed out that I'm not seeing it, but he's really trying. 

I struggled to get unemployment for awhile. I waited 10 weeks and finally got a lump sum. My account was flagged for fraud so I had to wait another month for that to get settled. It literally feels like one road block after another when I usually pride myself on being prepared and doing what needs to get done. I've been frustrated as hell. I finally got a giant lump some and paid down all of my bills. My savings carried me far enough, but it was nice to get back on my feet a bit, even though I'm still not working.

This last weekend was my dad's birthday/father's day. I paid off my car a couple of weeks ago (I posted about this recently) and this freed up my mom's credit. So dad really wants a fully loaded 4x4 and the one he wants is 44k. My mom said he could look but not buying this weekend. The one he wants is way too expensive so he finds a Porsche for 15k cheaper. I confronted my mom because I said the family can't afford it. Dad's not even working because he's medically retired. I'm like what, does he want to go to his dialysis appointments in style or something? Who knows how long he's going to be around and he wants to stick our family with a sports car to deal with when he dies? I was angry. I told her to stop enabling him. Just because he's made poor choices through his life doesn't mean that he needs to continue making them though his death. He's not thinking about us at all and it pisses me off because he's drilled ""family first"" into our heads through our lives. I've seen the opposite. 

After that, I went to my friend's to get away because I needed out of the house. It's not like they were worried about quarantine because they have been going to casinos and stuff. So fuck it, I can hang with my friend. 
Later that night, my mom called me crying saying that dad fell backwards and stepped on my corgi. He attacked my dad and sent him to the ER to get 9 stitches on his forearm. He told my mom on the phone that my dad declared that my Corgi is no longer welcome in the house and I had to figure it out. I said that it was an accident and he's a dog, you can't reason with him. I told my mom that if dad is making ultimatums like that, then I'm leaving and going no contact. He's essentially telling me to give up my 8 year old child that I've had since he was a puppy and he's lived at that house most of his life. He would rather destroy his relationship with me than let us live there. My mom is devastated. My corgi is Grandma's little boy, and I'm a good buffer to have in the house because I actually do things around the house and keep things clean, while my dad does nothing. My mom is very career focused and can barely coddle my dad like he wants. She's sick of his shit too. I pay rent too, so that would also put my mom out 500 a month. Things have been tight since dad had to retire. Which is why the Porsche infuriated me. And now.. this. Fml.

I'm at a loss. I haven't been home, I'm staying with a friend.. my dogs are with an ex, and dad is not budging. My brother's are letting my dad cool down before they try to reason with him. My mom has hardly spoken to me. I don't know what's going to happen.

I just feel like the world is continually throwing punches my way when I feel like I've been doing nothing but trying to make things better.

I don't know where I sit with people in life. My therapist thinks I'm an awesome person and she really enjoys talking to me. I've got 5 people in my life that I talk to, but they all have they're own messes. I mean it is a shitty time. But where do I sit? I have no idea. I'm struggling to think that I fucked up big time somewhere but I don't know what it is. I've always been so nice that I've been taken advantage of. I was the obedient kid, and as an adult I spent so many hours volunteering. I think I'm highly accomplished for my age, but I didn't really believe it until my therapist told me.

I feel like I'm trying to find my own voice. I'm not sure if the people in my life are there because they want something, want me to act a certain way, or just can't handle what I'm going through right now. That's what people have told me. No one knows what to say, so I just sit here alone with my thoughts because I feel like the only person I can express myself to that will listen is my therapist. Am I insufferable? What did I do to deserve to be so alone and feel abandoned. Now I'm wondering if I'll even have a home at all soon. 

I just don't even know what to do about myself or my life. I feel trapped.

If you read all this, thank you for listening. Even someone reading what I have to say makes me feel a little better. I hope life won't be like this the rest of my life. I don't know what the future is going to be like. It's incredibly uncertain. I feel like I'm just sitting here waiting around for something to happen and it's not a way I want to live.",23Jun2020,1

(i wasn’t sure how to word the title) so a little background before the story
basically, my mom and my aunt don’t get along. they’re civil but my mom is the one who holds the most hate, while my aunt has just given up on trying anymore. my aunt is also more like a mom to me especially after i was kicked out. 

~story time~ 

so i’m currently 7 months pregnant and due early september. my mom, aunt, and in-laws all want to be there (which normally i’m okay with but obviously not possible because of COVID). well, i would prefer it just be my husband and my aunt in the room with me/first faces baby sees because i know how supportive husband will be and how much help aunt would be (she’s had five kids 15-22 and remembers how all her births went). 
the issue is though, my mom has already booked the time off to be there and i feel like she would be almost too pushy. i feel like she wouldn’t be as helpful and supportive, and if i pick my aunt over her then it will ruin our already not the best relationship. 
husband and aunt are both 100% supportive with whatever i choose and understand how my mom can get. 

i guess i should add that my in-laws will be up beginning of next month to help set everything up and are a phone call away once baby is born; my aunt is also just a phone call away once baby is born and mom is gone because she doesn’t want any stress added if her and my mom cross paths

Im a hs rising sophomore, and this mentality sprung up when i was in 7th grade. I tried really hard, but wasnt doing the right things. My mom was pushing me to do the things she thought was right, while all i had to do was finish the homework to a mediocre standard. I got D's and C's in all my classes. Fast forward 8th grade, I had a revelation. I don't have to try so hard to get straight A's. I just have to do the bare minimum. So I did. I got straight A's, with one B. Now in 9th grade. I have taken this mentality to the next level. In a dragonboat election, I tried really hard on my speech, better than any other candidate... failed. However, in school, I was the most disorganized person (in my perspective) in my school, and scribbled swastikas and other edgy things on my classwork, because it didn't count towards my grade. Got straight A's. I ran for class president, done all the wrong things (put the poster up before the election), but I have also tried really hard on my speech. However attending the speech as voluntary, so not many people came. I lost the election.

938,"Tl:DR I told my cousin I sucked a guys dick (I'm a guy) cause I thought I could trust her. She's now threatening to tell everybody.

So a while back, me and two friends were watching a movie, before coronavirus hit, and at the time, I had a crush on one of them but didn't know, and they were cuddling and !making jokes and excluding me entirely and even jokingly insulted me, though I didn't take it very well. I felt like a third wheel and it sucked. Anyway, we get back to our friends house and were all being stupid and saying a bunch of gay jokes. I'm Pretty stubborn and true to my word. One of us said ""I bet you won't suck (friend 2's) dick"" (this isn't the one I had a crush on.  Anyway, since I felt like a third wheel all night, I did it and we all agreed to not talk about that night. 

Anyway, a couple days ago, I'm over the guy (mainly cause he sent me screenshots of his conversations with his now  bf [friend 2]) and I tell two of my friends and my cousin cause we were all sleeping over and watching movies. They were surprised but I felt good to have it off my chest.

Days pass and now we're visiting family. These past couple of years my cousin was being a bitch to everybody and she would now always tell me to shut up when I just wanna talk and it's really annoying. She even made me consider suicide (I didn't go through with it because I'm probably going to start dating this one girl soon) and she was just generally really rude and hypocritical. I feel a bit petty and start joining in on some trash talk happening and she whispered in my ear ""shut up before I tell everyone that you sucked (friend 2's) dick"". I was taken aback.

Now I can't stand up to her because even though my family knows I'm bi, they wouldn't like that I did that. It would especially tear my dad apart because he is a devout Christian and doesn't entirely believe in that stuff (he still accepts me though)

So reddit, what should I do because I'm stuck between a rock (telling my family and being able to stick up to my cousin) and a hard place (not telling them but never being able to stand up to my cousin)",23Jun2020,0

That they would contact me once the freeze had ended to schedule for me to actually come there.  This was back in May. How long should I wait to contact them, or should I wait till they contact me?

940,"We adopted a kitten about 6 years ago and within a month her expressed extremely dislike to being kept inside. She would constantly paw at windows/doors and try to escape. Once she got all her shots and was old enough to go out we gave up and started letting her out. 

Ever since that day she has spent every single day with our dog Marley. Marley was a very large dog but very gentle and immediately took her in as his own. They came in and out together, slept together every single night, ate together, and she even followed Marley when he went on his nightly walks. They were inseparable. 

Marley was almost 10 and we knew he was getting older but didn’t show any signs of it being close to the end but he had a sudden seizure on Sunday night and died on the way to the vet. The cat wasn’t there when he died. We did let her see the body shortly after but he was still warm at that point and I don’t think it registered in her brain that he was dead. Instead she just sat there and rubbed on him trying to get cuddles. He is now buried.

Our cat seems so confused. I can tell she keeps looking around trying to find them as they are never apart for more then a few hours.

944,"Hello, all,

I'm currently worried about my workplace. Last month, despite the current global issues, my workplace decided to take a step that went against my ethics. This did not directly affect me or my position, but rather the livelihoods of others in another department—some of which are currently financially struggling already. My workplace is not struggling financially, so it makes no sense to make this decision.

Meanwhile, in my department, where everyone works at a computer and can accomplish all of their tasks remotely, we've been told yesterday that we have to return to work next week. Considering that my department is small and that we can space out pretty well, it normally wouldn't be an issue. However, my wife and two of my coworkers have auto-immune diseases. In addition, I have minor breathing issues. I don't want to return if it's not necessary and neither do my coworkers, but the current administration do not care and will not listen to anyone about these concerns because they're too focused on keeping damage low from the upcoming protests from our other department.

I don't want to sound ungrateful. I'm very thankful for my current position: I have a fairly good paying job for the first time and I'm actually saving money. I've come from nothing, growing up in a section 8 to going into debt like many, many others to pull myself into a better position. I felt like I won, at first, but now I feel like that isn't the case. My job is going against my ethics and unnecessarily placing me and my family at risk.

Now I'm at my current position: conflicted about whether or not to leave and pursue my dream career as a teacher and writer or stay and try to accomplish the dream in the background while I put my ethics and safety concerns aside. What do you think? Leaving my job would mean far less security, as before my wife and I barely got by on her wages alone while I went back to college and worked odd jobs.

To close, I want to note that I've started a teaching certification program recently and I've already written a novel, I just have to finally get around to editing it.",23Jun2020,1

The trip is also just to scope out Oregon as I might consider moving out there one day (more on that later) and for an adventure. 

I'm paying for everything myself but the only dilemma I have is how to tell my parents I want to do this.

958,"So, at risk of sounding conceded or delusional, I recently re-discovered how I identify in human society in such a dramatic, life-changing way; that the only way I could describe it as is existential. 

This has resulted in my vision of life to shift to an almost entirely non-objective, un-biased view-point. As if to say I can now see with a clear lens, where previously it was filtered.

The effect of this has allowed me to engage in conversations that have been beneficial in both parties involved, but more importantly in my opinion, has allowed me to be able to challenge others to try and take themselves to a third-party perspective when inquiring about life's conflicts.

I want to be able to continue this style of conversation, but am currently limited in the number of people I can help and be helped by.

My parents messed me up, instead of teaching me how to handle life and what to do, they taught me to be a people pleaser and years later do not believe me when I blame them for it. I had to grow up quickly so any immature bullshit annoyed me. I was no longer a smal girl but a woman. Even my sexual urges began a bit ealier. I was perfect but i could not make friends. This and my hyper emotionality and my mental issues led to lots of bullying.

 I am trying to not be so naive bur i am really inexperienced because i spend my life indoors a lot. My mother is still fearful and not good but she has cancer and i do not know what to do. It has been more than a year. My father has depression but he has had it for more than 8 years so i do not know. I find it disgusting how adults treat me. I was an adult ever since i was 9. Maybe not emotionally. Because i lash out and then keep every emotion in and lash out and then keep evey meootion in. People do not want to be friends with me. I lose hope. 

I have made a few attemps for suicide a few years ago but now i am more calm. Sometimes i think of cutting off my legs because of how my mother father and my bullies turned me into a social invalid who does not understand sociao interaction and is always hurt. Retaliation even a little led to physical abuse, whether from bullies or somewhere else. I cannot stop seeing boys as the bad because...well...my opening to porn was rape, many drunk and not drunk men have catcalled me as a teen and boys usually bullied me.

 Only one or two girls have bullied me in my life. I do not understand why guys hate me so much and why no one dates me. Why do the girls who have the personality of a caedboard and dress like wh$$$s are dateable. I am losing hope. Al of my life is work, homework, work. I do not have friends to go out with. My parents have also been very strict. My mother has alwaus tried to be my friends which is disgusting since i cannot shre my sexual urges with her. I have sometimes talked about sex to my father but it is still disgusting. I want to cry. They are both bad parents but like they gave me what i need. It is just that i am 18 and am now stuck with my mother because of her cancer. She might die. My father is a complete moron. What woild i do with him?

963,"As the title implies, I (26m) am not sure who I should reach out to first.

A little background. My mom and my birth father were never really together. I was told they were intimate twice, then my mom found out she was pregnant with me. When she told my birth father, she also gave him an “out.” She told him she wasn’t sure if she was going to keep me or not, but that she’d let him know. Obviously, she kept me, but she told my birth father that if he doesn’t want me she won’t hold it against him and let him go. He decided to leave (they were both in the military, so he was already on the other side of the country when she told him she was pregnant). She never sought child support because she knew that if she sought support it may give him rights to me that she didn’t want him to have since he told her he wanted nothing to do with me.

My mom told me a long time ago that she was trying to keep track of him in case I ever wanted to reach out to him or anything, but honestly I’ve never felt he urge to know him. However, a year ago my mom told me she’d recently learned that he had another son who is 5 years younger than me. There were a lot of emotions and a bigger meltdown, the meltdown being an entire life’s worth of pent up sadness and frustration of the abandonment, which I never honestly realized I was bottling up.

After a few months of thinking, I decided that I owe it to myself to reach out to my half brother to see if there’s any kind of relationship we can have. Im not so delusional to think he would want to, but I want to at least reach out to try...

That’s where my question comes in, should I reach out to my birth father or my half brother? I don’t know if my HB, or even my birth father’s wife, know I exist. Obviously it would be a shock to all of them. My birth father may even try to bar me from reaching out to my HB.

If there's one think that I know I want, it is that I want to make money from home and not work a 9-5 job and suffer like the rest of the world.  I know that making money online requires a niche and a passion, but this is the problem.

I am very passionate about fitness, but I haven't built myself to any sort of considerable size yet to qualify for giving people fitness advice. 

Lately I've been trying to learn how to code so I can start my fitness app as well as develop video games (I've loved video games my entire life). However, I am hesitant to diversify my energy into these fields because one thing is always in the back of my mind: ""He who chases two rabbits catches neither."" I know that if I chase one thing, such as coding, my passion for fitness, would slowly die out. 

My question is: Is this the wrong mindset to have? Should I continue to divide my energy into these two fields? With working out, it's a little tricky. I feel like all I can do is put my 1-2 hours in the gym for 4 days a week and after that just read articles or watch videos on how to gain muscle/get stronger.  I can't really allocate 14 hours a day to fitness related activity/research. But I can allocate 14 hours a day  to coding projects and learning.

So, i'm white. My mom was always kind of a free spirit/hippie type and as far back as I can ever remember, she would smudge our home, and us. I was raised to believe that it's a way to remove negative energies and make room for more positive.

975,"Hello,

As a background, I am from Mexico and my family is very traditional. The type were mom's forgive their sons and husbands for their fuck ups but women are subjected to a double standard. I moved to the States when I was 16 and now I am 25. I live in Texas. 

That being said, 9 months ago I started dating a man from rural Tennessee. He cool, but he is very blunt and has been honest about being a certain way in the past. I am very sorry for what I'm about to say, but I think of it as he used to be white trash. He has cleaned up (in all the sense of the word) and joined the military. He is big and boastful, loud and short tempered, but he has always treated me like a queen and we never fight. I strongly believe it is because we have a really good communication channel. 

Now, the important part. 

I have always felt a lot of control from my mom. I think she is okay, but throughout the years she has proven to have toxic behaviors that I am trying to counter now as an adult. Its kinda stupid of me, because I shouldn't be allowing her to affect me and control me the way she does even though I am an adult now, but its been so long that I just do it automatically. 

My boyfriend has made a point to show that he and I are a team and has my back. Since he has been independent at a young age, he doesn't understands why I put up with it. He doesn't says anything in front of them, so at least he has found the patience to bite his tongue for my sake. 

The issue is that I really don't know what's okay and what is not anymore, and that scares me. 

I feel good standing up against my family, but then I feel guilt creeping up and I start wondering if I did the right decision or not. If I'm being disrespectful. My mom keeps suggesting that he is too big and since he is white (yes, she racist) he is going to hit me someday due his short temper, but I have no reason to believe he will except for what mom says. He keeps telling me not to allow what she says about me and us to affect the way I see things, but once again, I just don't know how. I feel bad because I am not standing up for us, but what if I'm wrong? What if he turns out being a bad person? As I said he does has a short temper and he has told me (although I have never confirmed) that he used to fight quite a lot and on purpose. But once again, he has never raised a finger against me or anyone for that matter and in fact pampers me quite a lot. 


As you can see by the block of text, I am very disoriented and lost. I don't know what to believe anymore. I guess I just wanted someone to give me their thoughts on the situation. I considered telling my best friend, but she is really passive and probably will hear me only rant without adding anything about it. 

If you got this far, thank you. I will take this down if necessary though.",23Jun2020,1
976,"I'm (22f) so conflicted about this because I do believe that the person dies intend to hurt me in any way but I've become increasingly more uncomfortable in our friendship. It's to the point that seeing one text of her (even if it's about the most mundane thing) fills me with anxiety and resentment. 


She's been through a lot and also have had mental health issues plus a shitty home situation so I've always tried to be understanding and I realize now that for that reason I've basically made the friendship about not upsetting her and just trying to keep a safe distance from her. I'm also extremely conflict avoidant, and that definitely causes me problems in communicating properly.


Some of the problems that bother me are that whenever she has a fallout with other friends (she's had to deal with some toxic friendships as well, not to say that she's completely free of blame) or a breakdown, she basically texts me things like 'im such a shitty person, why are you still friends with me?' or other variations of this + she is constantly asking me my opinion of how right/wrong she was in a situation like in dealing with other people, e.g. she would be like this and this happened without telling me she talking about a thing that personally happened to her to see what ""I would do"" or what I considered right. I feel like I'm always cornered into multiple conversations like this. 


For a long time (not so much now) she also would just put her thoughts unfiltered in my dms, just strings of messages of her intrusive thoughts, cursing and ranting about nearly everyone, without thinking, then later apologizing about how she's 'insane' and if I sure I still wanted to be friends, jokingly.


I think what makes me really uncomfortable is that she has this weird idea of me, she thinks highly of me and anything that doesn't fit in with that image is ignored. She always talks about how good a friend/person I am, often in front of everyone and constantly ignores my boundaries. I feel like she's constantly infantilizing me and it really irritates me. I have social anxiety and am rarely completely comfortable even with good friends. She used to constantly touch me, by suddenly poking me, touching my hair, etc. It annoys me even more because she does it in front of our other friends (who never get this treatment btw) and I just have to laugh awkwardly. I don't have a problem with hugging other female friends of mine, but with her I'm definitely not comfortable. I've told her I'm not comfortable with people touching me just to put a stop to all that, and haven't told her that it's her that makes me uncomfortable.
 

At this point, she's had a fallout with most of our classmates and her friends, and frankly I'm afraid of saying anything that'll cost her mental health. I just want to quietly disappear from this friendship tbh and do not want a confrontation


This was one long rant, I hope it makes sense and I look forward to your responses.",23Jun2020,1
977,"Don’t know if this is the best place to start, but I’ve been an engineering student since I enrolled n school, and have been taking classes on and off these past few years. It’s been a year since I decided to take a full course load, and with the completion of this Summer semester I don’t know if I’m on the right track. I grew up messing around with my family’s computer and learning how to set up basic home networks, torrenting, re-installing windows whenever the PC bogged down, really basic stuff. It always gave me the feeling like I was in one of the sci-fi movies like Robocop, Judge Dredd, Matrix, Iron man. 

Once I got past high school I had went from wanting to be a cardiovascular surgeon, to an investment banker, and finally to a mechanical engineer, which led me to decide to pick that major going into Community College. Along the way I felt fine being in the classes, but so far have had only taken one engineering based course working with Arduino and one programming class in Python. They were great experiences, but I felt something was missing, I wanted to get more hands on, and felt inadequate to follow the example of all these people on YouTube apart of the Maker community doing literally mind blowing designs and projects. 

Something that really inspired me was watching ted talks. The first one I stumbled across left me in awe, and it was who I believe to me to be the closest thing to a person like Hank Pym or Tony Stark, and that is Hugh Herr. It was so enthralling to hear his experiences, and listen to how he was motivated by his situation and the likelihood of others to experience the same, and improved upon an existing concept of prosthetics to help people. On his website he is just as resourceful, posting all his published works, and so much of them are well explained and have graphics depicting the whole system of bionics and how his prosthetics aim to function. 

Then there was Richard Browning and Franky Zapata, who both have built flight systems which just blew my mind, and left me further intrigued by how much there is out there even from people with non-STEM backgrounds. There are a few others I could list, but all in all I feel my experiences have been dull. I haven’t learned to properly use CAD, any Electric Circuit theory, have had no experience machining or CNCing, I just eel I’ve done a whole lot of nothing. 

I only have about just under 2 years left of school after I transfer, and just wants to find a way to make a career out of trying to be a really^infinitely dumbed down Tony Stark or somebody who works with borderline practical applications on theory’s, sees something in the world and applies it to another situation, prototyping, working with raw materials, learning about sourcing items, Design, making projects progressively to scale, using code to implement actions on or through objects. I just want to know what I’m learning leads to something I have been wanting. 

Do I need to do more, pick a new path, find out ways to inexpensively do projects, etc? I don’t know so far these past couple months I have been Salvaging printers to get the dc motors out of them, and light fixtures and stripping them for the cables. I felt that was a way to start getting into the more detailed side of things. So far, I have no idea what I’m doing, I just feel I messed up bad, and feel I can’t go anyway but forward. Sorry for the rant 

TL;DR
Picked a major, feels like I’m not doing what I wanted, even though I thought it was the best option. Looking for a resolve.",23Jun2020,1

991,"I’m 21 F. I’m currently a student and living in a dorm. I’ve never had the best of relations with my parents but it was never this bad. Growing up my mom was very toxic and told me stuff like “you’ll never be as pretty as the white girls” and always called me fat to the point I got a very bad eating disorder. My dad was always too busy with work and never really cared. Throughout my childhood they both verbally and physically assaulted me. Despite that I always loved them and loved spending time with my mom even though she never liked spending time with me. I would love to just sit in her room as she worked but she’d always kick me out so I spent most of my childhood alone. It’s gotten to a point where I forgave them for all that stuff and moved on. 

Once I hit college I lost a bunch of weight and actually looked and felt pretty for once. That’s when I could feel my mom growing apart from me.(I don’t think that’s the reason but just something I noticed).  She’d want me home less and less and 2 years later I’m barely ever invited home. When I do go home I have to leave in around an hour and it is very very uncomfortable because it is obvious that my parents don’t want me there. My dad usually doesn’t care if I am there or not but it’s my mom who usually has a problem with me being there. She’d sigh very loudly whenever she passed me and she’d get really quiet and not say much whenever I am there. 

If I ask “can I come home today” she says no. I sometimes ask her if I can come home for dinner because I didn’t have enough money for food that day she’d say no or bring it to my dorm instead. She didn’t even come to cut my birthday cake for my birthday. I had to cut it with my roommate and when I asked if I could bring her a slice or if she can come pick some cake up for her, my dad and my sister she said no and never ended up coming over. 

As of right now they just bought a new house a month ago. I’ve asked to come over to see it multiple times but they keep saying no. For some reason my mom just stopped talking to me and is mad at me. She doesn’t answer my texts or calls or anything. She is legit mad at me for no reason because everything was fine and one day she got into an argument with my dad and hasn’t spoken to me properly since.  

She also says a lot of negative things about me to my 11 yr old sister. She tells her that I love no one in the family, that I feel jealous of my little sister so I hate her and she constantly tells my sister not to talk to me. She’s done that ever since I was growing up. Whenever I got into an argument with  my mom in high school she’d tell my sister to stay away from me and every time my sister would try to talk to me my mom would yell at her really loud and tell her to go upstairs. Now that I am out of the house she does it behind my back and I’m 99% sure has told my sister a lot of bad things about me. They also go on vacation without me and leave me to house sit and pet sit so that’s really the only time I am invited. They’ve gone to key west, Arizona etc without me and whenever I ask if I can come they say “next time we need someone to look after the dogs”.

993,"Hello friends. My wife had a really messed up childhood and I had a relatively normal, well off choldhood. Lately she's been having a lot more trouble coping with these things and I want to help in any way I can.

I'll try to be brief but she's the 4th of 6 siblings. Her father died when she was 4 in a military accident. This impacted her family in many ways. They were in foster care and with abusive extended family for years before returning to her mom's custody. Her older brother RJ is a schizophrenic and one of her younger brothers Tyler is mentally retarded. Her two sisters have moved out and my wife lives with me in our normal, clean house with our 8 month old son. She's been out for 4 years since meeting me.

Her three brothers live at her mom's house across town and basically live in poverty. It's unknown if her mom and dead beat step dad keep up on their meds but the house is so filthy that i've never been allowed inside in 5 years. I'm told it basically needs to be condemned. It has bugs, questionable plumbing and garbage everywhere. Her mom blames everyone else and is insanely lazy, having not held a real job in over 20 years. They get by on money from the two mentally unfit kids but they often overspend and need money for food or to buy new clothes because they won't wash existing pair. 

Anyway she basically has survivor's guilt because she got out and they all live in Hell of their mom and step dad's creation. The two unfit boys love there and her one normal younger bro. The three boys are all basically adults now fyi, ranging from 17 to 25. 

How can i help her get better? Obviously therapy but she still resists me on this. Are there any books or ways of coping anyone else has used? I've never seen a situation like this and cannot understand this survival mode mentality going on with her always needing to protect them and empathize to the point of tears. I don't want our son taking something negative away from all this as he grows. What can I/we do? How has anyone else come to terms with similar backgrounds?",23Jun2020,2
995,"Hi, posting from a throwaway account. The actual story isn't as deep as the title is, I'm just not creative. 

For context in 8th grade my best friend moved away, and in 9th grade I lost all my friends. In 10th grade I started homeschool because of the events in 9th grade. While I was going through everything in 9th grade, I met this really great group of online friends. We've been friends for a year as of March, and I love them all. One of the friends will be called Apricot.

I haven't hung out with anyone in real life in a year. I'm usually fairly extroverted and enjoy being outside with people. The events in 9th grade scared me and I haven't been able to bring myself to meet new people since then. However, the friend that moved in 8th grade (I'll call her Hope) messaged me recently and asked if I wanted to go camping with her and some of her friends. I'm so desperate to leave and be with friends, I told her I'd just need to know when so I can talk to my mom about it.

Hope told me the date, and it just so happened to be Apricot's birthday. Birthdays are really important to me, and it really hurts when I can't be there to make someone feel special. I love to spoil my friends, and go all out on their birthdays. Our friend group already celebrated one friends birthday, and before the trip I'd get to celebrate another. I'd feel awful if I didn't get to do the same for Apricot's birthday.

I'm having trouble finding ways to justify the trip in my mind. On one hand, I'd get to go out and have fun while I can, I'm only going to be 16 once.

The problem is they are in there yard 90%(feels like) of the time in the summer with music playing 100% of the time so it is heard in my yard clear as day. They're semi retired so a side from driving a school bus for 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the middle of the afternoon there pretty much always home in the yard playing music. The music starts around 9am when hes done driving the bus. I dont want to make things awkward but my wife in particular is getting quite annoyed. Specifically because the music is not of our tastes. The have one Sirius station they listen 70's on 7. I know this because I can hear them announce it on the station. I'm 35 my wife is 30 and we are not big into 70's music especially the disco. I would greatly prefer to just here the quiet sounds of my neighborhood. I also cant have my backyard windows open because I can hear it in the house. They dont play the music late at night it's usually off around 8pm. Am I out of line if I say somthing to them very politely? Or is this just somthing I kind of need to deal with?

The message was basically me making fun of her for being fat, I used a lot of really mean nicknames and it was way over the top. I understand that sometimes it's normal to joke about things like this with close friends, but that was just way too much and it was an audio message which ,unless deleted, will be there forever.

It really doesn't represent my beliefs and even though I trust this friend a lot, I just can't imagine what I'd do if the girl listened to it.

1007,"Academically, I'm above average. I am a second year med student and always excelled at school.
I'm also good socially, I always have a group of 4-5 friends and I was high school president. I was never severely bullied and was always given lots of social attention.

However, everyone around me is always comparing me to a robot. My boyfriend is always frustrated that I never know what to say or do unless he explicitly tells me what to do and exactly how to do it. I can never say the right things when he is upset or angry or just needs encouragement. My sisters are always angry at me for not understanding how to help around the house on my own. I know how to do chores perfectly well, I just don't know when I'm expected to and to what extent I should do them ( like do I just do the beds or do I wipe down the windows and arrange the closet too?). 

I work so much better alone and the presence of people that I have to work with hinders me so much. I'd rather take on a much bigger load of work than share a smaller one with someone else.

My tone of voice is also often too loud when I don't even notice. I am usually joking or smiling and my friends or family would be upset that I'm yelling or raising my voice.

I am never too picky or start any arguments or disagreements. I'm very very very tolerant and can forgive and overlook almost everything without much thought but I find that people have a hard time accepting my work or actions. I always fall short on something that really annoys them and I can never learn or adapt to anyone.

I'm terrible at keeping in touch with friends. They usually text me to check up on me but I never know when to text or what to say. I'm always there if they need me but they'd have to text me first and no matter how much I want to change that I just fail at texting first.

When I'm hyper-focused on something it's very difficult for me to do another thing simultaneously and people find that weird.

I'm often misunderstood and can't get my thoughts and feelings across properly, despite being good at public speaking or explaining formal data.

I'm just tired of feeling so stupid and incapable. I hate being called a robot. I wish I had intuition like everyone else, instead of needing detailed instructions.

1008,"I graduate next May, so not exactly an immediate issue, but still something I think about.

I had a best friend in high school and I treated her like shit, so we fell off. The same deal happened freshman/sophomore year of college. I just didn't really care - a lot of people wanted to be my friend and I didn't want to be tied down to one friend. Looking back, I was more than dumb.

You can find friends or acquaintances anywhere, but a true close friend is one in a million. Now, I'm rooming with my only ""close"" friend who actually isn't a great friend, and her best friend. They have their own circle, but I don't really have anyone. Think this is some well-deserved karma.

On top of Corona, my university is doing a hybrid online/in-person semester, so I won't have nearly as much opportunity to meet anyone. I think I really fucked up, and now I'll have no one leaving college and going into the real world.

Has anyone ever left college with no friends? Did you make real ones afterwards without using some online meetup device? Not judging it, just prefer to meet people face to face. I'm just concerned, and even my sister asked me the other day if I actually had any friends.",23Jun2020,3
1009,"Long story short, after I graduated highschool I went to college, literally only went to one class, then stopped going and later officially dropped out. I didn’t care about what I was learning, and was so suicidal at that point that I refused to do anything I didn’t want to do. I started feeling a bit better, so I took a Nail Technician course because I enjoy doing my own nails. I was almost complete with the program, then we shut down bc of the virus, and an hour or so ago I found out that we are returning to class in 13 days. 

I hate the course. Well I like learning, but I hate doing other people’s nails. I’m also autistic and have zero people skills, and majority of the beauty industry includes making small talk with your client. I understand that I can overcome that and be able to hold small conversations if I really wanted to, but I just don’t. I don’t care to at all. I should have just left doing my own nails as a hobby. 

I know I should just suck it up and finish and get my license. But I don’t want to do anything with it. I know that I do not want to work with people all of the time. My school is a 50 minute drive and I’m terrified of driving. I got over this by staying at school for the entire day so I could space out when I had to drive. Now I can only go to school for 4 hours at a time. I know it’s kind of goofy but I am not making a 50 minute drive two times in the span of 4 hours to go do something I couldn’t give a shit about. 

I want to quit so badly. But I already quit an EMT course. I already quit college. And now this? I’m making too many expensive mistakes. I want to do something like graphic design or something similar, but I have no idea how to tell my parents that I once again failed at picking something I actually care about and that I’m going to need them to spend more money on me to go to school.",23Jun2020,1
1010,"Hi everyone, as stated in the title, landlord won't turn on our AC because he says ""the vents need to be cleaned out""

We are a small family of 3, wife and me with a 6 week old baby. Recently here in Montreal, we've been going through some heat. We got our first few hot days in May, and we asked the landlord to turn on the AC (as he has complete control over our thermostat) and he tells us that he can't because the vents needed to be cleaned, and an appointment would be 3 weeks. That was a little over a month ago now, and it's been in the 90s consistently for about 5 or 6 days now, and a week before the hot weather hit we asked if the vents had been cleaned and we could have our AC. He tells us he never made the appointment and he would call to make the appointment.

A week later, hot weather hits, and I'm watching my son sweat and cry because he can't be cool, and me and my wife agree she should go stay with family with the baby because it's simply not cool enough for him. It's been reaching 95, 96 degrees. I stay here to take care of our animals, and I've procured a few small fans to help keep us all cool(er). We ask him a 3rd time, and he says that we just need to borrow an AC from someone. We live in the basement unit, and none of the windows are able to house a window unit, and we can't afford a 300-500 dollar AC that sits on the floor.

When we moved in, he told us through a video call that part of our rent went towards AC, however on our lease agreement it never mentions AC and we're not sure what we can do to i guess fight back against it. The stairwell has AC, and I'm pretty sure all of our upstairs neighbors have AC too. When we mentioned it, he told us ""they are on a different system"". Now, I'm not an expert in HVAC, and I'm from Arkansas, so maybe things are different, but I've never seen a house with multiple HVAC systems in one house. Now, again, that's just in my experience. We've learned our lesson for the future, but I'm honestly unsure of what we can do to get the landlord to turn it on.

Any advice?

Last saturday I went to the gym way earlier than usual and met a good looking girl. I went to squat and she went to me and asked if we could swap squat racks, because she wanted to do some sort of exercise. I said yes, she smiled at me and we swapped. 

She then proceeded to act weird, as in: Look at me while I was taking breaks, take weights of my squat rack (not the bar), although the squat racks right next to her had more than enough weights, walk after me when I changed rooms / position without doing anything (basically just walking past, look at me, walk back), aswell as come back to my squatting rack, looking, and then leaving again.

I’ve definitely noticed before that his blinking patterns seem a little more intense than the average person but I never actually thought anything of it. But recently, as we lay in bed and sort of just stare at each other’s faces I’ve noticed that sometimes the blinking is very intense, rhythmic, and usually accompanied by head twitches or eye rolls. It was particularly strong last night after we had sex and I’m wondering if that could be a trigger. 

I would like to reiterate that this in no way is bothersome to me at all. I genuinely don’t mind it and even think it is unique and kind of special to him. He is still the cutest thing in the world to me and this in no way changes how I feel about him. However, he does seem completely unaware that he even does it or at least is pretending to be. I sort of mentioned something about his rhythmic blinking last night because it was more intense than normal and he had no idea he was even blinking. 

I’m really wondering if this is even a topic I should approach at all. It doesn’t seem to interfere with his life at all and since I’m not sure he even knows, I guess I’m wondering what the proper protocol would be here.

1031,"Okay so here’s the deal. I just moved into my apartment this past May. My landlord waited until after I moved in to make numerous repairs on the place like fixing the leaky roof on the porch, getting a new dishwasher, replacing the screen on my back door, replacing the shower head, connecting the stove to gas, and what have you. Now he is fixing the garage and the drive way to the garage so that I and my neighbor will be able to park there.

In light of renovating the garage, my landlord wants to add $50.00 to the monthly rent payments. I think that the pricing is fair and I can definitely afford the monthly expense. 

My worry is that this is being requested via a simple email message. I would feel MUCH more comfortable if there was an official rewrite of my contract and that this expense was added on. That way I’m not roped into a contract change in such an unofficial way. Also, its very off putting that he stated that the ‘’old lady’’ that owns the property is ‘’spending a fortune’’.

Bit of background, but question is at the bottom:

My (24, Ireland) girlfriend (25, NC, USA) was previously working as a nursing home worker. Unfortunately she got into an accident in 2017 and wasn't able to work there anymore, and since then she's had a couple of jobs in a warehouse for a large online shopping company, and as a delivery driver for an app called Door Dash.

Before the pandemic broke out she had already left the warehouse job and was exclusively working as a driver to support her and her infant son. That was grand for a while, when each delivery was paying at least $6USD per delivery, but coming to the end of 2019 and the start of 2020 there was a huge influx of new drivers to the Door Dash app, driving the pay for each delivery down to about $1-2 per order.

Because of this, she started taking less and less deliveries as they simply weren't worth it. Then of course the pandemic broke out and I told her not to go out for the sake of her own health and that of her son's. She tried applying for unemployment, however this is where my understanding of the whole situation is impacted a bit by me being a non-American. Door Dash still had her on their payroll, meaning she was not entitled to benefits. She then tried to appeal this and was told she'd have to have a hearing over the phone to present her case.

She was given a date and told they'd be calling, but when the date came (last week) she didn't hear the phone and missed the call. She has now been informed that she is not entitled to benefits at all and that the decision is final, without the possibility of appeal.

Because of this, she had no choice but to try and go out doing deliveries again, despite the health risks, and she has just discovered that Door Dash have blocked her access to the app. She cannot sign in, change her password, anything. She has no income, and of course it's almost impossible to find a job rn with thousands being laid off every week.

Basically my question is:
 is there any way she can apply again for unemployment? She doesn't think so because Door Dash has now effectively let her go because she wasn't delivering, but I think they blocked her because she applied for payment in the first place. Honestly, I don't care why she's blocked, I just want her to have some sort of money coming in.

Any advice would help immensely. Thank you.

Over the last 15 years or so my (23F) older brother (29M) has shown some strange behaviour that I’ve largely ignored. Recently he told me he’s been watching and listening to lots of true crime content involving pedophilia which has sparked my current concerns. 

Here are some examples of why I am worried:

- Between the ages of 9 to 12 years old he molested me several times - something I have never told anyone, and have never let on to him that I remember
- Three years ago, he started a romantic relationship with a 15 year old girl in his church youth group - at which he is a leader
- That relationship was shut down by the girls parents and the church elders, but he was allowed to remain on as a youth leader
- After this he began studying to become a Teacher
- When he speaks about teaching he always brings up the fact that there is a lack of male teachers and hopes that he’s able to make a difference in young people’s lives
- He is currently in a relationship with a 19 year old girl - also from the church. She looks a lot younger than she is - people who don’t know them often assume she is his younger sister not his girlfriend

Rather than working a regular job forever it would be nice to go take some courses and get a degree in something to make a career in. Problem is idk what? Or where to look and find options and interests. Only thing I have been considering is web development but i have no idea if thats a career i can live off of. I dont want to pick something im stuck and miserable with. Is there any kind of place I can visit that can sit with me and help figure it out what might work best for me as a career? Do counselors/therapists help with that? I just wanna do something with my life rather than working random jobs at retail or a factory. Thanks for any advice!,23Jun2020,1
1047,"I (19m) ordered a THC vape off of Empire Market, which is due to arrive this Friday. I currently live with my parents, however I will not be home to receive the order and they will be.

Here is my problem. Cannabis is firstly illegal in my country, and secondly if my parents found out I bought any kind of vape, I would be almost immediately disowned. The problem is the fact that they will undoubtedly question what the package is and I have yet to figure out what I should say about it. 

Despite this, I seriously doubt they would open the package. I get off work at around 1pm, and they're planning to leave the house for 11am, so there is a chance that it will not be delivered by the time they have left (best case scenario).

Any suggestions as to what I should say it is? Ofc I wont open it infront of them either way. I also can't arouse suspicion by saying its none of their business as they will know somethings up. Thanks.

Tl;Dr: bought illegal vape off dark web, what can I say it is to my parents if they get a hold of the package since I'm fucked if they know its a vape.",23Jun2020,1
1048,"[image](https://imgur.com/gallery/yBAqSZV)This is a quick sketch to hopefully paint the picture a bit better. Sorry it’s not great, I’m clearly not an architect. 
- the grey shaded area is everything i own, the 2 grey triangles are my gates and he rest is labelled.

So, i live in a flat above a takeaway that is my(well actually my dads, who i live with as i’m only 16 but i’ll just be referring to it as mine for ease) property but rented out. My family has owned his property/yard for 100 years and is actually the oldest house in my town, the town is a pretty small market town in a rural area. To get to my house in a car you have to go through the shared access and it is a very tight squeeze, you have to be in a small car and my family and the business below are the only ones able  to park a car after getting down the lane. 

Opposite my house, used to be a bank with a flat on top with a separate owner. This bank has been sold for £55,000 to a property developer who lives 3 hours away in a big city. To develop the building he needs to acquire planning permission. His plans have been rejected once and revised ones are currently pending these are likely to be rejected as he has plans to build in places he does not own. Our main complaints are: the automatic bollard at the start of the lane , as is already tight enough and if it ever breaks down it means i am stuck in the yard with the car or i am stuck outside, same with the business below. I’m pretty sure this wont be permitted because it is shared access, everyone who uses this would need to agree with it. 

Secondly, is a wall he wants to build. This is the red rectangle on the image. Around 2 feet of this wall used to exist but my dad knocked it down over 10 years ago which is allowed as its within our property and which we have the deeds to prove and we have sent to the council. The bank owner however, thinks he owns he back wall of my sheds and so thinks he can extend this wall further than it originally was to restrict our access, and for no beneficial gain. Yesterday he came with some planning person, not sure who, and basically said he was going to build this wall in august, despite it being in our yard, also claiming he doesn’t need planning permission for this. 

So my main question is: is there any legal action (UK) we can take to stop him building this wall?

Just some extra info to prove this dude is an absolute prick: his front door is obviously at the front(on the left) on the high street and it has a letterbox, he however nailed another letterbox right next to the person who owns the bank flat’s door, she by the way has a restraining order against him as he was harassing her ( shes also around 70 and lives alone) and he also claims he owns the attic of the building, which he does not as the flat owner has the deeds to prove and he has no access to, so he wants to build stairs up to the attic so he can access it. 

To summarise: There’s a prick going to build a wall in my yard, what can i do to stop this?",23Jun2020,1
1051,"(13 female) So my birthday is in a few days, my mom asked me what I wanted. I said I wanted video games or money. My mother then proceeded to say that I’ve already spent sixty dollars on games this week (I had her permission). She said she would not give me either of those because “ I have nothing to show” from video games. But gaming makes me happy, that’s what I like to do. She called me lazy, and said tell her something else I wanted. But I don’t know what else I want. I’m not into the typical girly things like makeup or nail polish, yes I like them but they don’t define who I am as a person. I play games a lot and would her money’s worth out of them.

1052,"Hey guys, so my anxiety and depression is at an all time high but I really need advice on this. 
Background— so I come from a very strict immigrant family and took a break from school because of some excruciating mental health problems (that they were not supportive of, and barely acknowledged). Even so, my financial support comes mainly from them. I was hoping to transfer and restart school this upcoming fall and my application and decision have been looming over my head. Not to mention problems with sending my transcript in the process. Anyways, my parents have made it clear that if I do not get into this program at this new school they will put me out of the house and likely disown me. My question is whether or not I should disclose this information with my admissions counselor/school? Would it be worthwhile? (Note: my application besides these factors doesn’t have any glaring issues I don’t think)",23Jun2020,1
1053,"Ever since the knocking began, I turn all the lights off to keep from drawing attention to the house as a preventative measure when I stay up late to watch television. When the knocking commences, I cover the window with a thick blanket and try to be as quiet as possible, staying close to the gun cabinet and telephone. Is this the most appropriate response? Is it better to be loud and have the lights on to ward off whoever is outside? Or do you think that the light and noise actually draws them in? What confuses me is that, if they're alerting us to their presence with knocking, they aren't trying to be sneaky about watching us and are giving us time to prepare for any potential attempted break-in. It leads me to believe they do not have the intention of hurting us, merely watching and frightening us.

A Little Bit More About The Knocking:

This happens to me approximately one night every one or two months, but my family has described experiencing the same thing when they stay up late, so I am uncertain of the exact frequency overall. The knocking will occur intermittently throughout the night, always on the same window. You can hear the distinct sound of an impact with the glass.  I believe this window is specifically chosen because it is the sole window with transparent curtains, meaning, when the television illuminates the room, a person in the yard could easily see in to the house through it. The house itself is very high off of the ground, so high that only a tall human or a bear on its hind legs could reach the window, but bears here are very scarce, leading me to believe it is the former. Additionally, there are no trees in our yard to tap against the glass. The knocking is forceful, so forceful that it sometimes shakes that entire wall. On one occasion, the knocking jarred the wall so much that it pushed the couch against it (with me on said couch) in to a reclining position. It was terrifying. Further confirming my suspicions that a human is responsible is that our ""visitor"" was playing music one evening in an apparent attempt to frighten us. My mother and I were up late one night. All of our neighbors had rented a large house together elsewhere and gone on vacation as a group, and only our household remained at the time. It was three am and we could hear loud carnival music (like something you'd hear in a vintage circus) playing in our front yard. We did look out the windows that time, but we couldn't see anyone.

We live very far off the road on private property, and none of our few neighbors are wild or have children or teenagers who may be playing pranks. The only strangers we've ever had on the property came to rob houses or were doing drugs and got lost. No routine visitors, you know? I just really want to know the best way to deter this trespassers without endangering my family or being over-dramatic.",23Jun2020,1
1054,"So basically... I have caught my self on several occasions making facial expression when I watch a video or read something on my phone . For example someone is smiling or doing something with their face on a video and I catch myself doing it too. Even if it is someone I despise and they are on video laughing , I will smile . Other times I make up scenarios in my head of something sad and when I snap out of it I realize I have made myself look sad and act as if that scenarios is really happening at that moment. Thankfully I don’t do it when I’m talking or with people but it still bothers me.. so I just wanted to know if anyone else is experiencing this as well or know what it might be..",23Jun2020,3

1056,"Okay so my little brother is 5 years old, nearly 6 actually but unfortunately he has speech and language delay and we can't really communicate with each other. It's been so hard for me because it's like to talking to a pet who will only respond to certain commands.

Now the problem now is that he's been crying and he showed us his tooth that I just noticed has a really bad cavity. He doesn't brush his teeth because like I said, it's like talking to a pet and he'll do anything he want because he doesn't understand us. He's a walking disaster, he kicks us or lunges at us when he gets mad. I feel so bad when he cries because he's obviously in pain but I really can't do anything if he doesn't want us to brush his teeth. I asked my mother what we can do about it and she said that we only have to ""leave it alone"". I don't want to leave it alone. There must be some way to ease his pain, surely?

edit: I'm not sure you guys understand. Think of him like a pet. He doesn't think like a child, he doesn't know what brushing does for him. He doesn't know anything at all, I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know what can kill him. He doesn't even understand that he needs to eat.

1057,"I am a Scout and I recently completed my Eagle project, which was building two massive cabinets to store costumes for my school theatre. 

After my project was approved by both my troop committee and my city’s council, my adult leaders kept changing large aspects of my project. This continued until the official build day. Afterwards, one of the leaders came over after the project and told me that he wants them to be sanded and painted. Now, the project beneficiary (the theatre) asked that they not be painted. 

I think this is ridiculous. The project was approved to be building the shelves. There was not going to be any painting or anything like that. Also, unlike the build day, I will have no volunteers to help do this. I would have to do all of this by myself. What should I do?

He would constantly talk about how he doesn’t really talk to girls and how it’s hard for him to have future relationships due to his self esteem. He would even say I could be his “wing man” as a joke. 

Today, he tells me that he’s been in a 6 month relationship this whole time. He told me the reason he didn’t tell me was because he didn’t want to scare me away from being his friend. Apparently his girlfriend doesn’t like how much I text him (I don’t blame her and I’m so sorry I didn’t know). I told him to apologize to her for me and that I didn’t know about the situation at hand. 

The problem is he desperately still wants to be my friend. Which would’ve been fine if he was honest to me from the beginning. But now I developed feelings (I never told him) for him and I don’t wanna sabotage his relationship at all. And I don’t know if it’s even a good idea for me to be his friend after how much he skipped over the truth about his relationship.

1068,"Okay so. I'm a 16 y/o trans guy, I've been out for 2/3 years and most of my friend group only know me by my chosen name. I stealth a lot and I came out after four months to them, much to their surprise.

A bit after that, a close friend of mine wanted to come out as a trans girl. I tried to help the best I could but I think I made it appear too scary for her since she quickly claimed it was just a phase two weeks later. I'm not sure if I influenced that or not but it definitely made me feel guilty.

Then a couple of months later, she comes back and says she wants to try again. I implored her to take it slow and steady since she doesn't want to scare herself again. My Mami and family are very accepting so she comes over to my house to use her chosen name and dress feminine.
My problem is that she comes to me with questions I don't know the answer to. Being a trans girl is different from being a trans guy and I want to help her the best I can, helping her with coming out, name changes, appearances and even giving her clothes! But she comes with me about questions I don't know the answer too and I feel terrible when I tell her I don't know. I try to direct her to the right areas for help but she's... Not using them and still coming to me. 

It's also slightly dysphoric for me to talk about this to her, I'm not sure why but I've been feeling heavy sickness whenever we talk about feminine stuff. I'm not usually dysphoric all that much nowadays but it's definitely something. However, I don't want to taint her transition with my influence again but I've been keeping quiet. I wanna be a support system for her but I don't want to scare her away again.

Anytime I say something to another coworker he just cackles at me and says ""its cause he's white don't listen to him."" He also says I get treated better at work because I'm a ""white boy""

One day I got bored and asked her what the difference was between a therapist and a psychologist. I asked this because during a previous session I took a test and tested positive for multiple mental illnesses, so I was just curious. I don’t remember the exact words but she said 

“one helps someone through life. They set a goal for you and help you achieve it so that you can become a better you.”

I told her that that sounded incredibly dumb and I had no interest in that. She then explained to me that that is what she did. 


At first I though that was kind of funny, but then I realized I probably should not be laughing about that mistake. 

Come to our next session she explains that she can’t help me due to my ideas of my future. (I didn’t know that was all therapy was). 

(I am more of someone who likes to live in the present. So I don’t think about the future too much)


She no longer sees me, and I’m kinda bummed out. I never really liked her, but I liked talking to someone. And I liked the idea of her not being able to tell anyone anything I say. 

It took years (and a doctors recommendation) for my mom to finally be convinced to allow me a therapist, but now that I told her I need a new one, she doesn’t seem interested in helping me. 

I more want a psychologist now, because they sound more fun and understanding, but I don’t know how to get one. I am 17, so am I even old enough to order one? I just need advice for moving forward, because my mother and father seem to avoid this conversation.

So then like i said mixed signals, slow slow replies then again fast replies we went out 5 times and it was a blast sooo...did i do something wrong? Should I text her?(its been 4 months since we last saw eachother or texted...

Sorry for the drama and bad english, but I really apreciate every one of u who will read this and maybe help if someone had the same experience?

1088,"There is a cat my neighbor just recently took in, who apparently was extremely abused, and ran out of his house into the closed area covered in buildings. 

It is always incredibly scared, and the first time I see this and which is proof that she was abused:

This cat which is always running away from anyone, if you catch her or drive her into a corner, she will just put her head to the ground, and cower in fear, no fighting back.

Anyways, it ran into the closed areas, which are kinda big, and keeps jumping from area to another, as soon as I take 2 steps near her. She won't approach me even if I carry food. And unfortunately the closed areas are full of stray cats which will attack her and have been, I just ran down to the area to scare away the stray cats, but it ran away too.",23Jun2020,1

1092,"Hello! I just adopted a 9 month old Golden Retriever. Cooper’s a lovely boy, but his previous owners - they were caring - instilled some bad habits. I’ve since managed to teach him to sit on command, and he does it anyways when he wants to be pet. However, I feel like I’m getting nowhere with anything else I try to teach him. 

Before I start with questions, I understand that he is an energetic puppy, and he hasn’t been neutered yet (Idk if that affects anything other than reproduction). I’m also a first time dog owner, so I appreciate all the help that I can get. Also all these things are eventual goals and I don’t expect him to learn these quickly. Above all, I want him to be happy. 

Some things/commands I want to teach him:

* Heel
* Come
* Stay
* Down
* Up
* I want him to know that he should not jump on everyone he meets
* He shouldn’t chew on everything (we’ve had to put away so many things that he tried to put in his mouth)
* I want him to be able to walk without getting distracted by *everything* (a sniff here and there is okay, but he shouldn’t be stopping every two seconds to investigate something)
* I want him to not chew on his leash and harness every time we put them on, or if he sees them while on a walk
* I want him to eventually be able to walk and play unleashed without running away or running and jumping at other people
* Not to be clingy and follow us everywhere, especially at night if we need to use the bathroom or something
* How to stay alone for a while, because we need to go to work after the lock down. 

My hope is that a lot of the distraction will fizzle out as he gets older. But thank you for any advice! Also, [here is a photo of him.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogpictures/comments/heo67k/my_boy_cooper/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)",23Jun2020,1
1093,"Just for a bit of context, I (14M) know this girl (14F). Let's call her E. E is a very toxic person. She seems nice on the surface but she has a record of calling anyone she disagrees with either a white supremicist, racist or a nazi, has attempted to break up relationships for her own benefit, has bitched about her friends and has sent one of my friends,  a 13 year old girl,(Let's call her A) into an alcohol addiction.

Furthermore, I do not want to hang out, or speak to E. But I csnt cut ties with her, since I am very good friends with her a few of her friends. Let's call these two people B and M. On there own, both B and M are cool. I get along with them great, B is one of my best friends aswell. However when they're with E, she practically controls them and makes them say  and do stuff they don't mean just because she is. B has even admitted to me that E can be a bitch and is responsible for what happened to A.

I have a feeling what happened to A will happen to me soon, as I am ""friends"" with E even though I hate her, and I feel one day that an argument might get out of hand and she'll start bitching about me and spreading rumours like she did with A, but I'm too scared to cut ties in the event she tries to steer B and M away from me

1094,"Sorry if this is not appropriate

I feel like I can't breath. These days I keep thinking about it more and more and I don't really know why. I have been fortunate enough to have a peaceful life. And up to now I don't think I have gone through any major change that is the cause for these thoughts. I dreamed about death and disturbing things like my body parts being cut off recently, every damn day. The thought 'i want to die' keeps appearing throughout the day and I don't know why and how to stop. I don't watch horror movies and I'm scared of them, so it not because of any movies.

Friends say dreams that contain death aren't bad, but I just want my dreams to stop being disturbing and left me awake being what the fuck. Just, I try to do things to be happy like chatting with friends and meeting them, but that thought keeps overwhelmed me and i don't know why it kept reoccurring now. I'm usually not thinking like this. And now I'm trying to sleep but my chest hurt and I have difficult breathing but I don't have any illness ever.

One thing i think is the cause, but it's kinda petty and trivial on my part. It's I thought I was kind of being brushed off by others around me. Like they don't take me seriously? I have problems communicating because i'm shy. Some people around me have a habit of speaking for others, and it makes me closed off to others, since they don't listen to me anyway if I speak or not..  Yeah, it's petty but it's probably the only thing that bother me recently.

Hey! 

I am so depressed right now! My family ( my mom) is stressing me out! I am living with her and every hour she checks on me and what I’m doing ... I hate this!! I sometimes prefer sleeping just not to exist, she’s religious so she asked if I prayed, did the dishes and so on! I want to experience things on my own, I want to have freedom in my life! I feel so bad and I stop doing everything when this happens... I just feel bad. 
She’s having problems with my step-dad and she’s hiding so many things so i can see she’s insecure and throws everything on me! I hate the stress she’s putting on me and my little sister... I hate it! 
I’m passing through hard times too, I am still deciding to apply for college abroad and figuring  it out, studying here in college, working on myself and personal project. But this is making me feel so unproductive, so unfree, so .. so.. 
I have no one to tell this, I feel like my friends can not do anything about that because they simply are not living with me and can’t imagine the stress I feel! 
Each day, I feel that I want to move abroad for this one important reason and that’s to have freedom and live on my choices and I de stress. 

I am so afraid that this will continue to make me feel this way ... I am so desperate... if you need more infos and why I feel this way I’d be glad to .

For a long time he was made fun of, for his stutter, and his aloofness. I sort of felt pity for him and although I knew he wasn't a good listener (more of a 'cool listen to my story' type), I thought he was decent and I would stick up for him. Our foreman would berate him in front me me which made me extremely uncomfortable and I'm sure over time caused my friend to resent me.

Fast forward two years, I'm dealing with bad depression and stress from new life changes and it shows in my work. Many don't understand mental health problems until they go through it and although I've been attending therapy and began medication I'm not there yet. My foreman, my friend, and myself had a meeting and it was decided that my friend would help keep me on track. Like when there is nothing to do, I would go to him to see where to help out.

Immediately after that he did a 180. Actually, not fully. He is always watching me and is either incapable of communicating well or he finally has a place to take his anger out on me, and it also seems if he's disrespected by others he is prone to outbursts. He gets in my face and yells at me, and I'm so not used to it that I go into shock and just say yesh, ok, and if I try to explain he's like just do your fucking job don't make excuses. I'm easily hurt and will dwell on it until work ends, but sometimes it happens 3 - 5 times and often he is just incorrect. Angrily telling me to stop cleaning and work because there is so much to do, so I get to work quick and 20 minutes later I'm done.

The weirder thing is he still treats me like a friend when he wants to tell someone something. He's not even a fucking supervisor, I feel like my boss punished me by putting the one guy who would have any ill will towards me directly in a place to ruin my day. I shouldn't let it, but it does. He'll be like let's go have a cigarette and I will and we will talk about our shared interests but I've put up a giant wall now and don't trust him. He admitted he's narcissistic and has no empathy or sympathy and I don't know how to deal with it. Moving positions is hard, I have a lot of specific knowledge that I've worked hard for.

But I'm actually frightened when he approaches me, 50/50 he's going to get in my face or tell me some weird shit about his wife or father in law. Do I stick up for myself?

1119,"Hello, advice redditors!

I am a 26 year old individual who just wants to ask people within this community about their opinions.

I have wasted 5 years of my life studying biomedicine. I never learned to properly do experiments because I get too nervous for trying to achieve something in a laboratory. 
I studied almost everyday at least 3 to 5 hours. Although, I recently graduated my university receiving a masters degree. I do not deserve it, since my supervisors did it for me - I was too much of a mess up.
The reason behind this was that when I started to do my thesis, 2 months prior I was diagnosed with clinical depression, and at the start of my thesis my father had a serious car accident, cat died, grandmother got cancer and I was overall stressed of my performance at school.
Despite these accidents, I went to do my project, but I failed every single experiment out of around 30. (Hence why my supervisors did it for me). Although, my Pi told me that I have great ideas and know alot.
I have been really confused and sad over the past 5 years. I do not know what to do with life. The studies I did for 5 years, is a waste if you cant do any of the experiments - probably will also fail at work.
Further, It takes so much effort just to talk to people and learn to socialize (One of my teachers asked me if I am okay due to me looking really sad even though I felt neutral).
I do not know how to find a job, I dont know how to enjoy life, I dont know how should I proceed. My memory has gone down a lot, I think I am getting stupider by the month. I am cinsidering of getting another degree (computer science), but I will most likeley fail there also. Even if I dont fail, the chances of me having a job is minimum due me not knowing how to socialize, bad memory, declined cogntivie thinking.
Also, I am little bit afraid, namely I wish to live alone ( never wanting a partner nor a friend in my life). Me wanting to be like this and knowing that it is considered abnormal puts me into this fear that maybe I should change myself.
I have tried to push my self over the limits. Doing sports, forceful socializing in parties, learn as much as you can, eat proper food, find new hobbies yet everything is boring.
None of the activites have not provided me anything - no joy nor further step of me getting a job.

My question is that how can I proceed or change my life in a way so I can enjoy it and how to continue from this point(job or computer science?).
I am asking this because every single variation or an alternarive is just meaningless and if not, its probably unachievable, like every other thing I have tried.

I try to take my attention away from the dominating thoughts but they always creep back. For another example, I have insomnia and whenever I can’t sleep at night, my brain drifts off to horrendous thoughts, such as loved one dying or being in pain or my future being ruined. Honestly, the list could go on and my brain seems to feast on my fears and insecurities when I have these thoughts.

Hello all, I hope this does not violate any of the rules but I am in dire need of help for my older brother. 

He has been an alcoholic for about ten years. I had cost him 5 jobs, three girlfriends, his emotional/mental/physical help. I have exhausted every option trying to find him the extensive help that he needs, I got him into therapy sessions and he is now on medication to help with some of the underlying drinking issues. But he has been recently worse than ever before and I’m afraid his addiction will soon cost him his life if I cannot help him, he has attended AA meetings however our state only offers online meetings due to the quarantine which has made him fall off the wagon harder than ever before. 

I also helped get him a spot at the only free rehabilitation facility in the state of michigan which is the Savation Army Facility in Detroit, which only lasted a month and he relapsed shortly after. My family is not wealthy and unfortunately I do not have the resources to help him pay the $20,000 to get him into any of the rehabilitation facilities in my state. My question to this group is this: Are there any facilities in the State of Michigan or throughout the county that would fit his current situation? He has been unemployed since November and Medicaid does not offer any coverage on any facilities to my knowledge. Are there any non-profits that help people cover the cost of treatment? Are there any facilities that offer some sort of financing to help foot the cost?

For background:

I've had a lot of stuff happen in the last couple months. Well, I guess not a lot, but it certainly feels overwhelming.  I've started to accept that I'm most likely transgender (hence the therapy) and shortly after this realization my fiancee left me (not because I'm transgender,) and that's the thing that's been getting me down I think, though the former has certainly been a stresser as well.

My ex left because she felt like I didn't give a shit anymore. Honestly, I was dealing with a lot in my head, and when I tried to open up, she seemed to think that I was trying to make it all about me, as she was going through problems too that I was trying to help her with.

She ended up dating another person within a couple weeks of leaving me, and wants to keep being friends. I've spoke with her quite a few times since we broke up, and the last conversation has really screwed with me. She came over, explained that her boyfriend was a rebound, that he's a habitual liar with no ambition, yadda yadda yadda. Admitted she was still in love with me. Truth is, I'm in love with her too, but she's broken up with me at least 5 times, and I know better than to go back. The problem is that it's so, so hard for me to stop thinking about her or to otherwise try and move on.

I started drinking again to try and get her off my mind, I've considered getting into weed/kratom/basically anything else to try to take my mind off stuff, and I know that that's not the right thing to do, but I don't know of another option. I think I'm depressed. I had a passing thought about suicide (not an attempt or even serious consideration, but it did come to mind.)

At first I was trying to get into my old hobbies/start new ones, and hang out with friends, and I'm still doing that, but it feels like a crutch because I know I'm using all of it as escapism. I have a huge problem accepting that I'm not okay, and I feel so weak for letting this get to me. I feel like a failure, even though I know that I'm doing what I can to try and get out of this okay.




The question: 

Do you all have any suggestions on trying to get out of this fog? I feel like everything I've tried has been futile or wrong. 

Thank you",23Jun2020,1
1127,"My whole life has been like this. I am a 16 year old living with my mom,She suffers from high blood pressure and has anger issues. She gets mad at the SMALLEST THINGS.

My uncle recently just bought a monitor so I am in my room more frequently. 3 hours of playtime isnt even that much. Yesterday I went out for a 2 hour walk to ease my mind but the moment I come home, ranting and piling me with chores. If i stand up for myself she hits me with ""you are a loser"",""why did I even have you?"" ""You are useless"" stuff etc. I was literally thinking to run away from home because this has been going on for more than 5 years.

1129,"Our daughter (will be going to grade 2 next year) has demonstrated an active, constant and very enthusiastic interest in learning to add very fast. We want to nurture that new-found interest without it becoming a task. I am looking for something that is an outside-the-box way of introducing, teaching and fostering her new-found love of multiplication without using worksheets, flashcards or memorizing through constant verbal repetition (I had to rote-memorize them by chanting them twice every day - once in the morning and once in the evening and it made learning a task, made it boring and something I did not look forward to, but did anyway out of for fear of retribution).

We’ve spoken many times about how he needs to be able to open up to me and express what’s been clouding his mind. But he doesn’t and the he explodes his frustration and annoyance on to me. I’m at my breaking point. I’m sick of feeling like I don’t mean anything to him when he gets distant and quiet. No matter what I try he continues to say the same thing: “ I want to my peace”.... LIKE WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY TO THAT! I want to sit down and tell him that he either tells me why he’s been ignoring me or I’m through. I’m tired of the same thing. He says yes I’ll talk to you instead of bottling up my emotions but he never does, he just puts all his frustration into me making me feel like absolute shit. I love him to death but I don’t know how much more I can take of this. I’m finally at that point where I’m ready to let go of us. I’m sick of pretending like I’m okay and that he isn’t affecting me. It’s been almost a month or two that he’s been incredibly distant. He acts completely normal around his family, but the second he comes over and “wants” to hang out he ignores me, and stays silent no matter how much I try to spark up a conversation.

1132,"It’s like I’m an old person trapped in a young person’s body. I’m 20, I’ve been living here practically my entire life and my neighbors moved here roughly 5 years ago. They were fine up until two years ago. We both live in houses so it’s not like I can report anything to anyone. 

Long story short, they cut vines that were cascading on OUR side of the fence at 1 am and proceeded to talk shit about my family the entire night until 3 am. These vines meant the world to my mom and she was in complete shock that they did that unprovoked and out of nowhere. 

They invite their loud ass family members over every single fucking day and I’m over it. They stay outside the entire day. It’s as if they don’t actually live in the house. They also did this DURING quarantine, when it was really bad, because of course they don’t give one fuck about other people. They practically live outside. I know there’s nothing wrong with having your family over, but all they do is scream at their children, the children scream as well and my bedroom window is RIGHT NEXT to their backyard. So I hear everything. All fucking day. When the family members leave, my neighbors sit outside and talk shit about other people all night. It’s really like clockwork. 

Not only that, but their children not only go on my lawn, but other neighbors lawns and pick at our plants and throw it on the floor. My mom is in love with plants so this is an obvious issue for her. My neighbors are extremely anti plant yet they suddenly decided to copy the layout of our front yard and add plants to their front yard. The husband literally stands in front of their house and just stares at it. I really can go on and on but I’ve really had enough of these people. I have a music speaker, but I really don’t feel like playing music for 8 hours straight every day. I really don’t. I feel like I’m slowly losing my sanity and I’m about to snap and curse them out or ruin their plants the way they ruined ours. I’m so over this.",23Jun2020,1

Honestly I'm terrified, I signed up for it and now the idea of being in a facility with teenagers and peers in general is hitting me hard. It's just a community college I'll be getting a associates degree in business management. I own my home about a mile from the college so at least I won't be living on campus. I really just dont know what to expect and its messing with my head.

How hard is college compared to high school? I did fine academically in High school but that was some time ago.

I have some social anxiety, not crippling, but sometimes distracting. I guess I'll just be going up there for classes so maybe it won't be a big deal?

1135,"There’s this guy (20M) who I (19F) went to school with and still have him as a snapchat friend. We don’t talk at all, but I see his posts on his story, and recently they’ve become more alarming and scary. He often posts photos of himself with a caption “HMU! Bored..” and various things, always asking people to talk to him. 

One night he posts a photo of himself saying “Im bored please HMU” so i thought, typical- does that all the time, people do that all the time, nothing to worry about. The next snap on his story was him chugging a bottle of whiskey by himself, and the next snap was a selfie that said “suicide is painless!! Lol!!” I thought it was weird, even told a friend of mine to see her reaction, seemed odd. 

Then today, He posts a selfie saying “ Someone HMU! Could use a friend” and then one that had the anonymous answer box with a caption labeled “keep my mind occupied! send honest messages!” 

I want to take this opportunity to help him out anonymously but I just don’t know what to say. I know that I can’t fix the situation but when I get involved in tricky spots I usually end up being manipulated and I just don’t want to go down that route, but I also don’t want to watch him potentially kill himself just because no one reached out. 

TLDR; A guy I sort of know is openly suicidal and seems like he’s reaching out for help, I want to help but also want to keep a safe and healthy distance, what do I say?",23Jun2020,1
1137,"(I'm on phone so yeah grammar) I'm 13 and live with my grandma since my mom and me at a young age (not minor young but young) so my uncle which at the time I was born was 13. uncle 1 has been known to be a pretty cool, while uncle 2 to has been more reserved  and you dont really knows he's there sometimes.
Now recently they got an apartment with uncle 1 and his gf and uncle 2. Now this gf is not the best at staying thankyou and is a little clingy she didnt grow up in the best home. Her dad was a racist and her mom was extremely timid, so saying thanks isn't really in her vocab.
One day her dog crapped on himself so she just walked out and uncle 2 had too clean him up and he is a fully grown Newfoundland I love him but that's a lot of dog
And for the clingy part uncles 1&amp;2 went to a sandwich shop and over the course of 15 minutes she called him 12 times. My uncles love each other so when one is mistreated it almost makes them sick and both of them are pretty beefy
Anyway one day uncle 2 was sitting up front eating and and uncle 1 and gf were fighting and that transformed into the asking uncle 2 about the relationship.
Uncle 2 told them that he doesn't feel that uncle 1 should be taking this and that gf was being to harsh uncle 1 was offended by this and repeatedly pushed uncle 2, while he was trying to leave. This turned into a big fist fight where uncle 2 won and turned around to see gf smiling talking about calling the cops so he ran to our house about 2.5 miles away.

What should I do",23Jun2020,1
1139,"Hey Reddit...
I just really need to vent somewhere so here we go

I am currently 18 years old and living in Europe as the son of immigrants. I have 4 siblings who were all born in my home country, I am the only one that actually spent his whole life in Europe. In my early years I think I spent a pretty careless childhood. My dad at the time was too old and unqualified to find work, so it was my mother who worked really really hard and made it possible for me to even be writing this right now today, so I hope the following words do not come across too harsh.
She just really wasn’t that great of a mother in the traditional sense. I spent most of my time growing up around my siblings and the thing with older siblings, at least in my culture, they are basically just as much of an authority as my parents are. My dad was an alcoholic who brought more problems into the house than he could solve, so I had to rely on others. My two brothers took a liking in trying to raise me to become a copy of their own. Trying to enforce their ideas and views of the world onto me. It has been that way for my whole life. The psychological terror I was exposed to during these years has dramatically
Impacted the way I developed as a person and the way I view the world today. It would take too long to thoroughly explain what I mean by this but I think the main point stands: I just really didn’t ever have a family that I could rely on and this hasn’t changed to this day. 
So now, as an 18 year old who has just finished high school, gotten his drivers license this year etc etc I should be feeling on top of the world. I don’t tho. Quite the opposite actually. I have very low self esteem because of the way my brother treats me when I don’t do something right. I’m not very gifted when it comes to things like building a closet, or just any mechanical feats in general. I have two left hands, as some might say. And he lets me know what he thinks of that very clearly. I have developed an anger and hatred towards my family that is rooted so deep within me I think it cant be stopped from growing or even removed at all. In my eyes, they are the enemies that make my life as miserable as it i feel it is. 
To add, my family is Muslim, kind of religious, especially my brother.
He tries to take the role of a father for the family since he passed away when I was 12. By the way, the passing of my father left me pretty cold too, to this day I don’t think I have even ever shed a tear because of it. 
I do not believe in Islam. Or any religion, really. So this creates another huge Hotspot for conflict and distress within the family. I feel like there are just tons of grey, heavy clouds weighing down on my mental. These clouds do not pass, they just stay as they are and don’t leave me space to breathe. 

I suffer from an existential crisis at the age of 18. I doubt that there even is a point to existing on this earth. I am in a lucky position materialistically and regarding my opportunities in life, I just can’t seem to bring myself to take up those opportunities because of the dark cloak that impaires my Vision on the world and leaves me in a state of constant crisis, probably even depression.

I really don’t know what to do at this point and I have probably not thought of everything that there was to write down in this post.
Idk, maybe someone has advice, maybe someone can learn something from this. I really just have no one to talk to, so this is my way of letting it all out.

Thanks for reading.",23Jun2020,1
1140,"I have this problem right now where my little brother is involved in every little aspect of my life. I feel like I have absolutely no independence from him and I just want space. 

I share a room with him, so I don't have my own personal space at home. It wouldn't be as bad if he didn't leave the room an absolute tip and then ignore me when I ask him if he could pick his stuff up that's been there on the floor for a week. We also share a playstation so whenever he's on it I can't play my guitar or piano without being bombarded with him yelling at me constantly. If I'm not on the playstation I feel like I just have to stay silent.

Not only that but he also hangs about with all my friends. He barely ever goes out with the friends he has in his school year so I can never socialise without him being there. He plays with my mates on playstation and has the fucking audacity to slag me off and chat shit about me in front of my own friends. He even organises to go out with my friends by himself, which I can understand he has the right to do, but it just feels a bit like he's taking them for his own. 

I hope I don't sound petty here, it's just that I'm 16 and whenever I try to have some fun in life it gets smothered by my brother being there too.

1148,"I (19M) had planned on going to college in fall 2020 since I just graduated this year. Now, what with covid-19 and everything it's been very hard to actually get any help with the whole process. My high schools' college advisor does her best but she can only do so much with the limited time and resources. Had the pandemic not happened I think things would've been fine and I could have talked to her in person and it would've been so much easier.

&amp;#x200B;

Now a few weeks ago I sent an enrollment deposit to a college but a lot has gone wrong since then. I really did plan to go there in the fall but there's several concerns on my mind now. The first being that the college is not planning on having online classes and I'm an at risk person as I have asthma and a weakened immune system. The second reason is that I'm overwhelmed by the process and don't  really have any guidance on it. Right now, the college I still might go to has told me that there are several important forms due tomorrow and one, a medical info form requires a medical professionals signature. It's kind of impossible right now to get an appointment with my regular doctor atm and even if I could it's very difficult to actually get there because the only vehicle in my household is broken down right now. There's no way I'd get it done by tomorrow. Now, maybe they'd extend my time but that's not even the only issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

My next issue is that a family member who's taken care of me most of my life wants to come with me to the college, not to go to college himself but to be nearby in case I need it since the nearest family member would be about 6 hours away otherwise. Now, I don't really care if he does that, actually I want him to because I may need the help. The thing is, he wants me to help him look for somewhere to stay nearby to the college. He wants me to do that because he knows that during breaks and such I'll be staying with him so he doesn't want to get something I might not like.  The issue with that is he doesn't want to start looking until August as he usually goes to a different state for work during the summers. That only gives us about half a month (cause we probably wouldn't be coming back until mid-August) to find a place, move our stuff there, and get settled in. It's simply not enough time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of waiting until next year to start college. Taking a year off to get my head together and sort everything out sounds kinda nice honestly. I don't really *want* to do that but I feel I should. I'm just worried about the consequences of doing that. First off, my enrollment deposit for the college I sent it to. I know I can't get that back, and I knew that before paying. That's wasted money right there. The second thing I'm worried about is whether I can apply to the same colleges again if I decide I do want to go to any of them. The one I sent the deposit to I really like, but I just feel I need more time to get things my head together.

today i was doing my own thing while she was doing something on her phone and when i looked she was scrolling up on her camera roll and i saw familiar pictures that had my face and the writing you see on snapchats. i was confused. but i later did my own secretive thing had her open her phone for me to ‘look at her insta’ and then went to look for those pictures. i couldn’t find them and tried to look in deleted when i notice the hidden folder. i scrolled up and there they were. she had about 20 of my snapchat memories saved on her phone. ones of me complaining about my mom, rants about friend stuff, and basic teen stuff you want to keep to yourself. 

i honestly couldn’t believe my eyes because why would she need them? is it for blackmail so she can show my mom? the thing is i would never go to my mom and tell my mom her personal things but it’s very clear she does. she even has the passcode to my phone which i’m inclined to change now because i don’t want her going through my stuff.

Is there a way to deter them without harming them? Or to not come off as a threat at all?

1165,"For the past few weeks I’ve been looking into purchasing a kitten. Last night I found an ad on Kijiji for a kitten that was on sale. 

The price was a little high but pretty reasonable even though the person said it didn’t receive any vaccines.

The seller had pictures on the ad and even sent me some other pictures/videos so it seemed pretty legit, which is why I then sent them a $25 deposit to hold on to the kitten for me.

A few minutes ago I was on Kijiji just looking around and saw an ad with the same picture as the one from the seller I am planing to buy from. The ad said NOT to be from the seller.

I messaged the person and they told me they purchased a kitten from that person and has speculations that they are an illegal breeder. They said they lied about deworming and defleaing the kitten and the vet said the kitten is actually two-four weeks younger than the person claimed. They also said the kitten is having trouble eating and is not litter trained. Basically there’s a lot of things wrong with the entire situation and the person is pretty hostile if you ask too many questions.

If I do purchase the kitten I could take it out of a bad situation and try to provide it with rehabilitation but the cost of this might be to much for me. Although I already put down a deposit, do you guys think I should go through with purchasing the kitten or just leave it and report the person?",23Jun2020,1

1169,"CONTEXT FROM EARLIER POST: 

I had an online friend, who never really asked me super inappropriate questions or requests, but made me uncomfortable with his behavior, his constant texting, and the way he seemed to trust me way too easily. I felt as if I was forced into this friendship most of the time.

But since this friend essentially never did anything significantly wrong, am I in the wrong to block him and just not talk to him?

edit: thank you to everyone who responded. I’m glad that we settled things on a good note (for the most part) because I got to tell him honestly about how I felt. We’re currently not talking as of now but I wish him the very best

-
CURRENT: 

My other online friend convinced me to give him one more chance and I did, easing into the friendship. At first, everything was fine. We joked around like normal. 

He began teasing me again, which I didn’t mind at first because that was our friendship’s dynamic. But whenever I teased him back, he took it to an extreme personal level. Then he’d remind me about how he has anxiety and depression and how nobody really supports him. 

I’ve had my own story with clinical depression in the past, so it wasn’t like I was clueless on what he was going through (but just fyi, I know all depression cases aren’t the same). But to bring it up as a way to guilt trip me into thinking that he could treat me a certain way but I couldn’t reciprocate was just so unfair and absurd to me. 

At some point, his teasing got even more offensive so when he didn’t stop I snapped at him and told him to quit it. He immediately shut down afterwards and after calming him down for a good half an hour, I got him to come back but it definitely didn’t feel like a win.

Also, since he has depression and anxiety, I told him that he could talk to me anytime about it. But then he would constantly jump the gun and pry on why I never talked to him about my problems and that I should tell him if something wrong was happening. I reassure him that I would but honestly, I don’t know if many people would be comfortable sharing their problems if they felt so pressured about it.

Also, I feel extremely uncomfortable about how easily he still trusts me. Since he lives two states away, I told him that if he ever visits my state (thinking that this would be far out in the future) I would treat him to food. But he (for real) seemed as if he was looking into plane tickets that day as soon as I told him. Maybe it was just me being overly cautious but I feel like if we don’t know each others’ faces yet, we shouldn’t be jumping the gun so fast like that (keep in mind, we’ve only known each other for a few months) and committing to a trip to another state. He also says things like “you know I’d do anything for you” so easily but to me, it seemed like he meant it. I don’t know about most people, but that’s difficult to say to just anyone.

I removed him from some of my social medias, just because I gave him another chance and I felt uncomfortable again. But now, he alerted me that he was in the hospital due to a medical condition and how no one was visiting him, and I feel guilted into the friendship again because I feel the need to be there for him. I texted him “are you doing okay?” and he hasn’t replied and now I feel like a hypocrite because I’m worried.

I feel like he depends on me a lot emotionally, more than before. If something happens to him, like if he self harms or even worse, I would feel fully responsible for it. But at the same time, this is an emotionally exhausting friendship that I gave another chance to and it just isn’t working out. Should I keep being friends with him or just call it quits?",23Jun2020,1

Her problem is that she doesn’t know if she will ever be able to accept herself if she turns out to like girls. And is becoming depressed and has even talked about not wanting to live anymore. I’m trying to help as much as I can but I don’t know how to help anymore. I also can’t deal with her breaking down everyday anymore. It sounds mean and I feel bad but I’m not a professional that can handle all of this and I have my own things going on too.

1172,"I have a toxic “friend” who is always making passive aggressive comments heavily implying that she’s better than me.
How do I stand up for myself against these comments?
Any time I tell her to stop she says that I’m getting “mad pressed over a joke”, making me seem oversensitive in front of others. The only way I’m not labeled “mad pressed” is if I let her walk all over my reputation without saying a single thing in defense, which is just what I’ve been doing for the past year, staying quiet as she insults me. If I ever make a point back to her, she gets super offended and start comparing how every aspect of her life accomplishments and wealth is better than mine.
I hate her comments. With every argument I lose, and every time I don’t stand up for myself, I feel so much regret and embarrassment. I want to get revenge by making her look bad as well but I don’t know how. I also want to cut her off afterwards but I don’t have many friends and I’m scared I’ll become a loner as I’m not very social.",23Jun2020,1

There's a tender situation going on in my life where I hate myself and I don't think my opinion matters but my emotions are really on the line over the out come.  I go from telling people look here's how I feel and what I want to happen to sorry it doesn't matter it's not really about me.  And then I go on to say it's not about me cause I'm fine in life or at least I can be I'm adaptable. my opinion in life doesn't matter I'm really only here to help others and maybe u shouldn't even listen to me cause I don't matter and then I go into a downward spiral and then breakdown saying what have I done why can't I just be honest.

I can try and be fine with whatever but I seem to be getting the point across of i don't care don't even worry about me, when I don't want that. I hate myself but I want something for myself I guess... I don't want to be selfish but I don't also not want to care about what I care about.

If u ask I'll probably tell u what in the dms but if u got done basic help that can work for this regardless of what it's about I'd like to hear it.

1174,"I’ve been in dark places before. I’ve cried myself to sleep, I’ve raged until all I could do was sleep. This is not one of those times.

During the before picture of this horror film, I worked for a nonprofit organization. We help people who have disabilities find jobs, keep (or re-establish) their independence, and ensure their voices are heard by our government. It’s not a perfect job, but I love it. I’m good at it.

But we all know the after picture has been painted very differently. I’ve been contracted out (read: volunteered) to work in a call center for a state in which I don’t live. A call center for people who are applying for unemployment benefits of which I have no understanding. With a day and a half of training and a government unwilling to do... anything.

It’s been... well, hell would be polite. I’ve had people scream at me. Curse at me. Break down in tears. They’ve gone hungry to make sure their kids are fed. They’ve pawned their wedding rings. They’re living out of their cars. They’ve threatened to commit suicide. 

I get home every day and I’m exhausted. If I could cry, I would embrace it. If I could get angry, I would welcome it. But I don’t feel...anything. I have dinner, shower, then take two Benadryl to sleep. I wake up and do it all again. I’ve tried talking to my boss and HR. If I don’t fulfill this contract, I become one of those people who’s lives hang in the balance of government assistance.

This is one month in to a three month contract. 

I’m not exactly looking for advice. Sympathy would make me puke. But I’m asking for you to leave a comment telling me of a time when you thought hope was lost but you overcame it. Give me pictures of your pets. Or your favorite funny movies. I don’t have much in the way of family anymore. I don’t have a support group to lean on... and this is making me realize how much that needs to change. So, random internet people, can you help me out this time?",23Jun2020,1

1177,"Hi ^^

English is not my first language so I'm sorry for the grammar mistakes and spell errors in advance and I wrote this at 3 am so I'm really sorry if any parts are to confusing :/

And I'm so so so sorry if this sounds like im trying to play the victim I just don't know how to express myself in another way and if you don't think this friend is toxic please tell me so I can know. I have a pretty weak mind so ye hehe maybe they aren't toxic at all 

So I have this friend, I'll call them A. Me and A met in 6th grade and we have been friends for almost 3 years now, when we first started hanging out we connected instantly and I felt like I had known them for ages. They were a pretty good friend but we didn't really do anything outside of school and never really texted a lot but we still were close friends. Recently they stared to change pretty drastically personality wise, they have been really toxic(some examples are that they always point out my insecurities, I've tried to open up about my eating disorder but they just make jokes about it all the time now, compare my anxiety/depression to hers, play fighting all the time when I've told them to stop it hurts but they don't which has resulted in scratches, bruises and scars)and they have themselves admitted to being toxic but they haven't put any effort into doing something about it. They have gotten a little bit better but recently we talked about which gymnasiums(the Swedish version of high school) we wanted to attend I brought up a school that is one of stockholms most popular schools and they just laughed at me and said that I'm to dumb, my grades are shit(I have difficulties with concentrating so I struggle a lot in school) and that a school like that would never accept someone as dumb as me. I've struggled a lot with relationships and trusting people in general cuz at my old school my old friends that also were reaaally toxic started spreading rumors about me and my whole grade turned against me and I'm afraid history will repeat itself in this school. The thing is I don't know what to do, I want to try to make new friends that are like me and not will judge me for everything I say and do but I know that they will just come back to me and just say that I was using them for not being alone at school and that I promised them I would never leave them. So if u have any advice u would like to share please do so anything would help c:

I’m going to be a freshman next year, and I want to be my own person, not “Sam’s little sister.” But I don’t know how. Sam has always been better than sports wise, as he’s been doing baseball since he was 7, and I was even forced to do softball for 2 years until my parents realized I wasn’t Sam. I’m not Athletic and I tried every sport as a kid so my parents would notice me. I eventually ended on Show choir, but they still don’t care. They say it’s too expensive, it’s around 250 a year. Which I would be fine with, besides the fact that they spend almost 600 a year on Sam’s summer and school baseball.

1183,"I'm the type of guy to binge read reddit posts without an account but right now... I really need some advice so: Have you ever gotten a job that you personally love but others won't be supportive about it? More specifically, your parents or family?

I turned 18 a couple of months ago, growing up I love cars, and as a job I wanted to work at a dealership. I got a job with a dealership yesterday. Since I'm a ""part-timer"" and still in school \[studying for my bachelor's\], I wouldn't be able to sell cars or do anything fancy but that wasn't my preference anyways. My job is classified as a ""Dealership Porter"", I get to move cars from one spot to another. And not as in around the lot, usually from one dealership to another when we trade or exchange cars. And I love it. So I drive on all sorts of roads: streets, highways, etc.

So my parents were curious about how the first day went and I break the ice giving them my position and everything, along with the cars I get to drive \[which I thought was awesome\]. Almost immediately they became concerned that I would: get into an accident, I'm still an 'inexperienced driver' \[I've been driving since 16 and had my license for over a year fyi\], that insurance wouldn't cover me \[the manager notified me the dealership ensures their own vehicles and I'll be fine if I'm not at fault if an accident occurs\] -&gt; parents then argue that the dealership will purposefully screw me over if I get into an accident. Lastly, that I had told them I would take a ""desk job"" \[which is somewhat true but at the time, I applied for whatever was open and I chose this at the end... smh\]

What kills me, even more, is that I'm trying to pay for tuition yet my parents are the ones that mostly pay for my college - I pitch in whatever I can and that's the reason I wanted a job. I get food, a roof over my head, and a bed to sleep in every day/night. I'm 110% grateful for this but it's killing me that they don't understand that I feel confident and enjoy driving cars \[especially newer ones\]. As much as it hurts to write this, it seems as my only option is to quit the job I just got because my parents, ""don't feel safe about it"". And reading that out loud, it sounds so stupid. I guess one should never get too attached to something they love or have a passion for, because at the end - it doesn't always work out how you imagined it...",23Jun2020,1
1184,"So for context I’m about 5 hours away from home right now staying with my dad for a bit, keeping in contact snapping my friends, talking on discord, and Sunday I’m talking to one of my buddies, ask him if he wants to go on a camping trip in July sometime. He says he’s already going with the 3 other friends. I ask when and shit, he knows nothing (classic) so I snap one of the other guys and he says ya campsites have a max of 4. So they didn’t even tell me. No invite, nothing. Looked at the campsites where they went and since it’s bc (I’m in Canada) it’s $50 a night for just a tent site no electricity, so for only 5 days (they’re going for 7) it’s $200 for me. For them it’s like 90 something since they’re splitting the cost. Said fuck that I’m not spending $200 for 5 nights so my only other option is to camp on crown land. I’m totally fine with this I love camping and escaping civilization but I’ll be like 30 min away from them as they’re getting a campsite inside the city. They’re also splitting gas (I’ll have to pay for my own) and I’ll also be driving alone on a 10 hour total drive. I want to go but I don’t want to be the fifth wheel. I’m good friends with all of them (I think) and I don’t know why they wouldn’t tell me or anything. They’re offering no help or solutions in what I should do. Does anyone think it’s worth the effort? Basically I’ll be able to spend the day with them as one of the guys family lives there but if they choose to go to the campsite then I can’t go with them.

1190,"I’ve always been very anxious, depressed and bipolar on some days. It started in 4th or 5th grade and I was once sent to therapy when a teacher noticed my grades and condition, but my strict Asian family didn’t believe in mental illness and further didn’t want to believe their little ignorant naive daughter had issues. I lied to my therapist until they said I was free to go and lost my only chance for a proper therapist until I can get a job. I was having suicidal thoughts and isolated by other kids, it didn’t help that my social skills were extremely lacking either. A few years later I fully recognized that I have severe mental problems with anxiety and depression that often times caused me to zone and dissociate so much that days or weeks often go by like a blur, it was like I wasn’t there living my life just existing and not really enjoying anything, It felt like I was able to occasionally snap out of my trance and enjoy a few moments before falling into the back of my own mind again.

In 3rd grade I was molested in a storage room of the gym where we kept supplies, in 5th grade it happened again at a different school when I was in a classroom alone with a teacher. I think this is what predominantly caused my mental issues, however there was never any penetration and the assault only lasted briefly. Something that’s always stuck to me and caused my self esteem issues was when the teacher who harassed me also told me was unattractive and “quite frankly ugly” and he wouldn’t touch me had it not been for my “asian features” (he had a fetish for Asian ppl I guess) Further I’ve never actually had panic attack or felt bad about the event itself, I mostly feel numb and feel like what happened to me wasn’t a big deal until recently my emotions have become very uncontrollable whenever I think about what happened (I’m 18 now). Is it possible to only feel the full effects of a event later in your life? I have a fear of men with loud voices and aggression, my father was a strict military man who often inflicted physical punishments and made me very afraid to ask for small things, I have a fear of interacting with people and strangers, teachers in general after what I experienced.

I told him it’s fucking bullshit. So pretty much my dilemma here is what do I do? My boss agrees with me that it is bullshit that I have to wear a mask, considering that I’m the only confirmed negative person on the crew. I got really upset at work and gave my boss and earful about it.

1193,"This is a really stupid story but Im kind of torn and don't know what to do. for context everyone involved is in highschool and so am I. yesterday morning I posted a tiktok that was pretty political and a kid in my grade commented on it and was replying with some points that came off as racist and I was in awe by some of the stuff he wrote. I don't think he thought before writing these comments down and didn't take a minute to realize that anyone on the app can see what he wrote since my account wasn't private. 

I screenshotted two of the comments he made and basically posted it on my private story on Snapchat which only around 5 people can view and wanted to make sure other people were seeing what I saw. and if they thought it came off as racist as well. this resulted in a lot of people reposting what I posted and now it's going all around my school and even some other schools and this kid is getting tons of backlash and is being pinned as a racist. he deleted his comments and I also deleted the tiktok but many people already saw all of the things he said and it became too late to undo it.

the comments he made were very rude and disrespectful and hiddenly racist but this isn't what I intended to happen at all and now a lot of people are mad at him. people have even begun sending him death threats and are banging on his garage in the middle of the night. this lead to his friend trying to defend him but then he ended up getting exposed for sexual assault as well as another kid getting absolutely screwed over because he used the n word in a group chat like a year ago. 

this kid is totally innocent and I feel horrible for him because he's literally only ever used that word once and he literally shamed himself for using it before it was even posted and now people are basically ruining his life along with the other 2 and all of this cancel culture bullshit makes it so stupid.
