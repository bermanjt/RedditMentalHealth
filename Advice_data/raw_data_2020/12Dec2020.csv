0,"My Mother took up a job at the Food Lion Deli earlier this year to get away from her job as a housekeeper, which she was for over a decade. She wanted to not come home physically exhausted anymore, but now she sometimes comes home twice as exhausted and stressed. 

She is not a very tech-savvy person. She uses her cellphone, but that's about it. Working at Food Lion requires her to use their specialized computers for a myriad of reasons, and she doesn't have a single clue how to navigate them. She also has trouble accessing her company app and website to find out about her scheduling, off time, paycheck, etc.

Most of her coworkers are extremely lazy, unapologetic, assholes. Some only work for about three hours a day, and some don't bother doing anything at all, which puts a bigger workload on my mother. There was also one time where they brutally insulted her based on her ethnicity, accent, appearance, and other things when she tried to ask a few of them for help. 

To make matters even worse, she took up a manager position after only about a month or two working there, despite the fact that she was clearly not ready to take on that level of responsibility (and still isn't). Her coworkers don't listen to her and she's too nice to get them to work or report them to her supervisor.

I keep telling her to quit and go to another one where one her friends works there and could help her out, but she doesn't want to give it up because she would lose the extra three dollars the manager position pays. She also says that Food Lion is full and she would still have computer troubles over there.

My mother is also very stressful about everything and blows everything out of proportion, not just work. A part of me feels like she could learn the computer systems and is just making it much harder than it needs to be, and another part of me thinks that her workplace is just genuinely awful. The amount of stress she puts on herself and her very poor diet make me afraid that she's going to end up in the hospital if she keeps this up.

Sorry for such a long-winded post, but it's such a multi-faceted problem that I don't even really fully understand myself.",12Dec2020,1

5,"I (21F) have this friend (35M) I made at university a couple years ago, we have some classes together and we both always get to class some minutes earlier so we talk everyday before class + he sits practically next to me so me and my group talk to him during class too, I actually consider him part of my group of friends or I did before this year.

A couple of months ago I posted a photo on instagram and he commented something mean about my looks but he's a bit awkward so I thought maybe he was trying to do a joke or a ""roast"" and it didn't come across correctly so I let it be. About a month ago he comments on my new post  telling me my clothes are ugly, then comments on the same post telling me I'm ugly and that I shouldn't post so much, I deleted these two. Now this week I posted a photo and he commented telling me that my hair is horrible, I just ignored it this time.

This year we don't share any classes and we do everything online so I haven't crossed him around university and I feel like it would be very awkward to DM him and ask about all of this. He did comment something kind of rude last year in one of my photos but it was the first time so I didn't care, now not only he's doing it again but he's doing it regularly.

I've been trying to build a theory about this and I remembered the conversations we've had, he has bragged about having two girls attached to him, he has also complained about girls not wanting to date him or being all wh*res and he has also said that we should go out for a coffee sometime (which I didn't take as a date thing really we were just talking about coffee) -  tell me if I'm dumb for this but my current theory is that he was trying to flirt  and wasn't really responsive so now he's mad¿? I'm the only girl in my year so all of my friends are guys and I don't think me being friendly towards a guy comes across as being interested but maybe he got that impression. I'm open to questions and theories, I haven't mentioned this issue to anyone but the comments are really giving me anxiety.",12Dec2020,1
6,"I've been friends with a guy for about 4 years. He seemed cool and understanding for as long as I've known him, but now I have some reservations about him. I started feeling differently about him when I came back home to spend time with him and my other friend. As we were about to exit my car, I reminded him to put his mask on because I didn't want him to get sick. He looked me in my eyes and said, ""friend, Covid isn't even real."" Immediately, my heart sank because, in my mind, I thought he was enough of a critical thinker not to believe in conspiracy theories. I believe in the science of it, and I expect my friends to feel the same way about it. 

I proceeded to ask him what he was talking about just to be sure that I wasn't hearing things. He then said, ""The government is making all of this up just to scare us."" At this moment, I stopped listening to him because I had nothing else to say and stepped out the car. When we were in the store, he was babbling on and on about how people should protest against masks because this ""bullshit is not real."" I was trying to accept his views, but I was getting mad from his ignorance. I told him that there were already people protesting against  wearing masks, and they're also getting sick from the ""fake virus"" too. 

After I left him, I let everything he said go because I had better things to do. The problem became later on when he told me he had a crush on me and wanted to ask me out at some point. I told him I was flattered, but I know he's expecting something of me and is hoping that I say yes. I honestly would have said yes if he didn't bring up his disbelief in Covid. Now, I don't even want to be friends with him, and I don't know how to break things off or if I even should. I have such a negative view of him now that I don't even like speaking to him. Am I overreacting or do I need to be blunt with him?

tl;dr: I'm contemplating cutting off a friend for his strong disbelief in Covid and the fact that he wants to date me is making it worse. Am I overreacting?",12Dec2020,1
7,"TL/DR: I have not been good at keeping friendships with people and my lack of friendships are making me feel worried about my future.

Hey Reddit,

This is a throw away account and I am a 27 y/o Male living in the North East of the US.

I am honestly just feeling lost with life lately. I am sure everyone felt similar at some point. Back when I was in high school I was not the most popular person around but I was friends with everyone from different groups at the school. I had friends from my sports teams and friends that I played games with. 

When I graduated and went to college hours away I started to drift away from all those friends expect for 2 of them. During college I was not a partier, I had a couple friends who were close and a friend from high school went to the same school. At the time I Was going through a rough breakup with my long distance girlfriend, and I just felt so confused at the time, I started to struggle with school and eventually had to leave the friends that I had made to move back home. 

Once I moved back I noticed that I just stopped connecting with the friends that I used to have in my life and did not try to make any new ones. I was still close with 2 friends from my high school and we would hang out all the time. But for me they were all of the friends that I had outside of people I met while playing games online. Eventually I met my now current gf and drifted away from one friend. All throughout this time I have just never had a strong grip on what I wanted to do with my life. I flirted with so many potential career options but it felt like nothing stuck.

A year ago my gf and I moved to the West coast for a new job opportunity for her. I eventually got a role at the same company and my coworkers there became friends to me and I was looking forward to every day at work. Although I still did not know what I wanted to do with my life I was feeling happy at 26 years old. This entire time I have been my own worst enemy financially making okay money but never saving to the point where I just closed my savings account because I have been constantly withdrawing from it and saddling myself in credit card debt and personal loans (never enough to cripple but enough to be a thorn in my side)

Now 2020 happens, we needed to move back East due to family concerns and I had to quit my job in the process. I am back in my home state and I feel alone because I lack the friendships that I had made over the last year. I finally feel like I know what I want to do with my life but I also feel like I am running out of time. I have reached out to a few friends I used to be very close to back in high school/college but I both feel this fear of not having friendships or making an impression on peoples lives. I also feel terrible because for the last 5 years of my relationship so much has fallen on my significant others shoulders and I just want to start really taking the burden from her.

How can I reach out to old friends and reconnect, how can I make new connections, how can I truly improve myself, how can I help myself to continue moving forward and not let every change effect me so much. 

That was super long and basically my life story in a nutshell, to any one who reads and the offers me any advice I truly appreciate you.",12Dec2020,1

I want to help keep order in society. People generally do take action when a crime is being committed. I am seriously and deeply wrong and misinformed. I know it is wrong now because I am not a cop.

I'm a bible-believing Christian of the pure sort, the ones that \*actually\* believe in loving your neighbor no matter what they look like, where they're from or what they believe. The kind that believe in doing whatever you can to help your fellow man because that's what we're duty-bound to do.  The kind that actually understands that intelligence and wisdom aren't a liability, but an asset.  My mother is not. She's an idiot.  Truly.  Uneducated.  A bit slow.  Her love is conditional.  I don't even know how else to explain it.  She has, for most of my life (34F here) put her ""faith"" above pretty much anything else, including me.  She is a Trump lover and doesn't GET why anyone would disagree with her.  She literally describes facts as opinions and says things like, ""You have to respect everyone else's opinion,"" even when it is utter, disprovable (is that a word?) bulls\*\*\*.  And yes, while I believe in the power of prayer, THIS pandemic...this HELL we're living through, is not a ""prayer over science"" sort of situation.  I will trust God but I will not IGNORE the experts that actually understand how viruses work and spread. And I'm smart enough to know that. She is not.

I just had a massive argument with my 70 year old lunatic bible thumping mother who doesn't give a s\*\*\* about keeping anyone else safe.  I'm the person that has to say ""wear a damn mask,"" or ""stop going to gatherings,"" or ""stop traveling unnecessarily,"" etc.  She thinks that God will protect her and that I'm NOT at risk because I'm 34 and healthy; except I'm NOT healthy and have not been for a long time (overweight - but getting fit thank you - ex smoker, ex drinker, heart and lung issues...and did I mention overweight) which she knows and it irritates the crap out of me when she spouts her BS conspiracy theories. She is literally putting me at risk on purpose (we live together since my father died) just for the f\*\*\* of it. Because she can't think about anyone but herself. I don't mean just irritates me, it makes me livid. Like to the point where I want to go ahead and publish her email address here on Reddit so that smarter, more informed people who have been affected by covid-19 can send her a ""friendly"" reminder about why it's important to take precautions and why this isn't ONLY about her!  

I'm literally seeing red right now after our shouting match and listening to her bs apathy.  I have NOBODY to turn to about this.  My options at this point are like...to pack my shit and live in my car. Because I can't take this anymore. The stupidity alone will kill me :'(

Oh yeah, by the by, her last words before I slammed my bedroom door like a petulant child (being an ex-cutter and survivor of suicide mind you) were, ""It's almost like you have a death wish or something...""  Yeah. Really.  I mean.  

Since I really don't have much to lose at this point, please help and tell me what to do...  My sh\*\* is packed and ready to leave this hell-house.",12Dec2020,1
16,"I am bi or at least bicurious. I watch all types of porn, yada yada yada. Recently I have been finding almost every single male that looks like he could be in some of the porn I regularly watch attractive. I build up this weird infatuation towards them and think about them all day and it is really concerning to me that those feelings don't go away after a while. I don't think its healthy to feel this way toward every white guy that looks like he could do porn.

My question is, I now have confidence, do I confront my past bullies and let them know what they put me through so they are aware of what suffering they have caused or should I let it pass as they probably have all matured.

I wanted to know if there are any guys who have a similar problem. They could have issues, such as being gay, or wanting to live how they want, but want to still keep their family around. As for my family, they want me to get married. Apparently I can go and live on the moon so long as I follow their rules and marry a guy. But... I want to live my life outside of the country with two friends of mine. My family would never approve, so I thought... Maybe I could make it work both ways. I could marry a guy from a Muslim family, and we could compromise on some things for the relationship to seem real to our families. Then, he could live the life he wanted and I could live mine. Since I don't want any children, I think it could work. It's a crazy idea, I know, but right now I can't think of any other way to have both things: my happiness as well as my family's happiness. Can you all help me? I was raised in a way where I was quite sheltered so I am unaware about a lot of things. I didn't even know there were groups and communities which aid women who are non-Muslims until recently. Anyway. Apologies for the messy layout, it is late. I really am hoping to get some people who will read this and help in some way. Just by chatting, letting me know their thoughts and opinions, maybe even recommending some sites or something.

21,"Messy i know. This is dumb and long and on my back up account. 

Take it to the beginning, about 2 months ago. I’ve got a friend who’s married, her husband isn’t from where we live. We were all hanging out one night and friends husband said “you’d really get along with my friend Jacob” and my friend, we’ll call her Sarah, said “omg she totally would” and went on to show me Jacobs social media and tell me all about him. After looking at his online accounts i saw that he was in a relationship. I mentioned that to Sarah and she said “he’s so unhappy dude and only with her because they are living with his family and have kids together.” They both lost their jobs due to covid, her family isn’t around so i guess they live with his. So whatever we talk about him and the night goes on. 

A few weeks go by and Sarah is up my butt about about reaching out to Jacob, she wants me to follow his Instagram and like a few pictures. I told her no, I’ve been in this situation before and it never ends well. Well low and behold i got drunk one night and liked 2 of his pictures, he requested to follow me and that was it. About a month later he replies to something i posted in my story about the elections, and from there we just talk. Not everyday, but often enough i guess. Then it gradually turned into everyday, a few messages here and there, song recommendations and a few jokes. We’ve been talking everyday all day long now for a bit. Needless to say i like the dude. I like how he thinks and how he expresses himself, i like the music he listens to. He’s cute and funny. He likes talking to me also. 

He’s told me about his relationship a bit. Basically, and from only one perspective of their relationship, he says the entire relationship has been rocky and toxic. 6 months into it he broke up with her, she told him she was 3 months pregnant. He told her he would help support her, but didn’t want to be in a relationship with her. After they had their baby they were so happy they decided to try again. A few months later she got pregnant again, the rest is history. He says he’s incredibly unhappy, he’s told her that he doesn’t want to be with her because they aren’t good for each other, but she has no family and nowhere to go. She is still out of work (he just found a job) and completely reliant on him. He doesn’t want to kick the mother of his children out with nowhere to go and nothing to her name. He says that after he’s saved enough money from this new job he’s going to help her get on her feet so they can just co-parent together and nothing more. Our friend Sarah has told me all this also, she’s known Jacob for years because of her husband. 

All of this started out kind of as a silly thing, Sarah wanting to see “where this goes”. Well here it is. I dig this guy, but this obviously cannot be something. Not just the fact that he lives in a completely different state, which would be difficult enough, but his relationship aspect of it makes it difficult also, or impossible i guess haha. I do enjoy talking friendly with him, i can see us developing a friendship. But I’m also attracted to him and want to flirt with him. I have made sure to not cross any boundaries, i don’t flirt with him outwardly or make any crude remarks. I try as hard as i can to be respectful. But As odd as it is to say there’s a connection there. I don’t connect to people easily, I’ve dated plenty and am confident in who i am. I just haven’t hit it off with someone i want to keep around for longer than 3 weeks. Maybe the distance puts less pressure on this, i dunno. 

I’m stuck in what i should do, if anything. Jacob tells me “i like talking to you, i feel a real chemistry and I’m curious to see where this goes”. I want to see where this goes also, but I’m worried it’ll go in the dump and get messy.",12Dec2020,1

26,"PART 1 BACKGROUND: I  (21) transfered to a university  from community college this past fall in a covid safe area. The apartment building I live in is designed for students and have good rates for rent. They had a system that was kind of like tinder but for finding a roommates. I planned on moving into a 4 bedroom, 2 bath and ended up finding a group of girls who seemed really great. Two of the girls had known each other since freshman year and the other girl was a transfer like me, lets call her D (20). Before we even moved in, D made it a big deal that she wanted all of us to be really good friends and do all these activities together, which seemed somewhat normal. But I should've known that was a red flag because that was a hint at how controlling she was. She was also dumping all her trauma on us automatically and also going into her sex &amp; dating life when all knew about each other was names and where each person came from. The day we moved in, she brought enough stuff to take up a multi bedroom house ,not a bedroom. That tipped off her hoarding (both stuff and food)  &amp; shopping habit.  Me and D ended up sharing a bathroom, she took up 3 shelves while I took up 1, and same went with a cupboard in the kitchen, where she took up 2 giant shelves and I take up one.Within the first week, we came up with basic rules and expectations for the apartment, and also what we're doing to keep covid safe. D made it a big deal that she was working for family who was limiting their contact with those outside of their family and that she would be limiting her contact too. That didn't last long. She started inviting guys she met on dating apps pretty soon after that and would go out with friends who were refusing to wear masks in our apartment. My other roommate had a job that put her at risk for possible exposure  &amp; often didn't leave the apartment unless it was work, food, or other essential trips,and I didn't have any other friends in the city and would often explore on my own as a form of alone time. My other roommate &amp; I tended not to say anything because when we tried to confront her about other minor things, she would flip out and gaslight us. So when she wasn't home, we would wipe down the whole apartment. D has a habit of constantly cleaning out the fridge and throwing away our stuff so she would have more room for her food; she would go grocery shopping a few times a week and not eat at home often. We have a friend pod our some people who live in our building and she would often try to make us feel guilty for hanging out with them or wanting to do activities in the city with them (none of the activities or the amount of people we were with or doing  broke any CDC guidelines). And when D did come with us, it would always be about her. The topic always turned to whoever dramatically older guy she was dating and her past issues. Also, keep in mind we all moved to this city for school, but D refuses to do any of her school work and brags about how she has done any work or attended classes since the second week of school, and feels she has full range to be loud and treat us like her personal therapists whenever she wants, even though all of us have heavy class loads and loaded zoom schedules. The word No and I'm busy are not in her vocabulary She also had an issue cleaning up after herself and I often took charge of cleaning our shared spaces..  Her habits were annoying but I knew this was just a roomate arrangement and I would not have to deal with it next school year.

PART 2, THE INCIDENT:This where the beginning of the end starts. Since we moved in, we made it clear what our schedules would look like through the holidays. I was very straight forward with the fact that I would be flying home before thanksgiving, come back after the holiday, and spend time back at the apartment for 2-3 weeks before going back home for the holidays and come back sometime in January depending on covid.Less than a week before I was supposed to fly back home, keep in mind that the CDC had not deemed flying unsafe during this time yet, my roommate and I are at the apartment  doing school work and attending classes while D was at work. My roommate gets a text from D saying that someone that the family she works for had been in close contact with had tested positive for covid and that they didn't know when was the last time they saw this person and they could've been exposed. We started freaking out. While my roommate was in class, I started making calls to see where we could get tested ASAP. I ended up being able to talk to a nurse at our school health center and I explained the situation and the timeline we somewhat had. She reinsured me that there's a high chance that my roommate and I don't have it because we've never been in contact with the family, and if any of us were to have it, it would be D. My roommate and I were not able to get rapid tests because we weren't directly in contact or had symptoms , but we were luckily able to get standard tests and we're told to we'd get results within a few days. A couple hours later, D came home and said that she gotten a rapid test because she had a sore throat and the family she worked for got tests too. She was told that no matter what her results were, that she was told to self isolate because she had a sore throat and that she would be getting another test in a few days. She went into this huge rant about how this is making her rethink who she hangs with and how she doesn't really know what they're doing to stay safe and that she in putting too much at risk. My roommate &amp; I were surprised at the sudden turn for her and we both agreed that we'd stay in the building until our results came in. I told my parents there was a possibility that I wouldn't be able to come back and explained the situation to them.  D got her results back within an hour of being home and tested negative, but made it clear she was going to self isolate. The 3 of us spent the evenings in our rooms doing whatever work we needed to do for school. Later that night, I got a notification from our tracking app ( we live in a big city that can be sketchy at times) that D had left the apartment . Thought it was odd because she was supposed to be self isolating but I thought she was going to get something out of her car or something. A half n hour later, I asked my other roommate about it, and she had no idea she left, so we checked the app and she was across town, at the house of the guy she's dating. Both of us were pissed. My roommate had to give up two of her shifts because of this scare because her job wouldn't let he come in without negative test results and I was trying to escape this craziness and go home. We texted her and asked her where she was and she tried to convince us she was in her room still.... she eventually admitted that she was at this guy's house and that she would be back in the morning. My head was about to explode. She was being reckless at multiple people's expenses.

PART 3.THE FREAK OUT: luckily, my roommate and I tested negative. I was able to fly back home and while I was back home, the CDC announced that it was no longer a safe option to fly. As soon as that was announced, D put us in a group chat and started talking about how I need to self isolate as soon as I get back and listing all these things she wanted me to do, and kept pushing it on me when I wouldn't answer back. I was getting frustrated with her pushing it so I told her that I didn't want to talk about this right now and will come up with a plan closer to when Im supposed to leave. Apparently that was me giving attitude. I ignored her and went on with my life for the time being.  She texted me a few days later and asked if I had a plan, and I told her what it would be. That wasn't good enough. So I would ask what would make everyone most comfortable. Me not coming back at all would make everyone most comfortable. I only had a week's worth of stuff with me and left many important things back at the apartment, such as medication and stuff I would need for school. I explained this to them and they said they could get the building to unlock my room and they could send me my stuff. I was not about to let someone who is not honest about their actions and hypocritical about mine touch my stuff and also spend hundreds to spend two months worth of stuff to another state (at this point I had made the choice to extend my holiday stay to February due to treatment for a health problem). I proposed that I would fly back, get a rapid test, self isolate and spend a day or two getting my stuff together, and fly out at the earliest possible date. Again, not good enough. It came to the point where my only option was to drive close to 12 hours to get my stuff. Not thrilling but it was better than nothing. While we were going back and forth about this, I asked that when the rest of apartment gets a covid scare, will they be held to these same standards. D was insulted that I would expect them to be held to the same standard. It was a mess. Less than a week later, I make the trip and arrive at the apartment to get my stuff. No one even acknowledges  I'm there but I didn't care because I was trying to get in and out within about a half n hour. Everything is fine until I got to shared spaces I share with D. All my things had been moved in the bathroom to a corner and she took over all the shelves and she had moved her food onto my shelf. I was pissed and now glad I didn't have to live there for two months. But deep down, I was hurt. I bending over backwards and spending way more money than I should've just to make her comfortable. Later that night, I texted D and said my feelings were hurt and I didn't appreciate her taking over my spaces. She flipped. She started talking about how awful I am and that I expect too much of her and how she's gone out of her way to be super nice to me. I went off on her, basically listing everything I talked about about above. I got a text from my roommate saying that D was freaking out and having a meltdown, and asked what happened. I explained and she understood, but put an emphasis that a conversation would have to be had. I agreed, but I also feel weirdly guilty. Should I just had not said anything and moved out (which is a option I was exploring before all this happened) or was it good that I said something. I don't know what to do and I don't think I can emotionally handle living with her",12Dec2020,1

28,"I am asking if its possible to fall in love with someone from redit. From the POV of a 3rd wheel basically! So a guy i am crazy about is set to meet his penfriend who he ""met"" via reddit. They live in different continents, i am merely just a passing tinder match to him, that he met after the two connected. I am really a heart of icy type of women, but some how after every date he took my breath away and i felt like i let him into my inner sanctum (I'm blushing!) Then he casually mentions his penpal he's meeting in December. I only know about reddit because I asked how they met, so forgive me for feeling like im fratinising with the enemy! So my question to you is, could you see yourself falling for somone youve never met irl, but talk to on reddit. I am very much a citizen of the world and spend as much time outside, pursuing hobbies and intrests, where as this guys prefers company all the time and happily lives in an internet world. I am just trying to understand, if you can really fall for someone you've never met before. I think im wasting my time, but if he could just explain what the 2 of them have at least I could make an informed decision. To give him his due, he has been honest about this imminent liaison, but i cant bare to ask how he feels about her or where i stand for that matter. I think he really liked me, it feels like he admires me like a rare bird of paradise, but also totally ok at crushing my wings. I am way  too mortified to ask my friends who would just be like ""dude???! Your self worth!!"", and totally prepared for the ensuing roasting .

Long story short the time I was living with them we got into major major issues that ended up them getting me my picture ruined and put lies on my name. I come back to my country and I was mentally upset in life in general at that point, was taking therapy and medications. Probably the worst phase of my life and didn't have many friends. My cousins who I was living with had friends who made fake accounts using my name and picture and were trolling people that I was close with using my name cursing them out basically giving me a bad look. I hated them so much and still do for it. Only made my mental health worse. My dad goes back to his home country to meet his sick mother and his mom died and my moms sister's family (the family i hate) came to visit him out of pity. I hated it. I felt betrayed that my dad even met with them. It hurt a lot. I let it go eventually. Years go by and my dad and sister go back to their country and they apparently get dinner with them? Adding more so on to the betrayal I felt. I told my family eventually if they want to keep in contact with them, it's their choice. I cant force anyone to talk to anyone. But if you do you won't ever get the same version of me again. They said they understood. Last night my mom was showing me a picture of a family member and I scrolled on the pic by accident and there was another pic of the family that I hate's new born kid. I was so confused. Even after my family saw how much they affected my mental health. They didn't care. I tried so hard to fix my mental health yet they chose them over me.

It was an open casket and I saw her lying there. People said she looked beautiful and as if she was just sleeping but that’s not what I saw at all, I couldn’t stop looking at everything about the body that just proved that that was in no way the woman I knew, just her abandoned body.

4  months ago i was diagnosed with mental illnesses and depression, my  best friend was there for me but now when time has past by my best  friend desided to leave me.

I lost my other 2 best friends 3 years ago they commited suicide.

I  met my ""current"" best friend 2 years ago after my other friends  committed suicide and now that my ""best friend"" desided to leave me it  feels the same as the suicide.

I  dont have any family, my mom left me when i was a child and so did my  father. I have done therapy for a long time but still its not a  ""friend"". I really dont know what to do, i really dont know where to  find help, it just would be nice if i had someone to talk to and someone  who makes me smile.

Its really  hard to go outside, i dont feel good around people in public, im afraid  to meet new people but speaking online feels better and maybe it helps  me to go out there and find new friend, if anyone tries to find friend  live anymore in these days.

If you read this im happy to hear that, if there is someone who knows what to do or even wants to chat that would be nice.

Thank you.",12Dec2020,1
38,"I'm 29, and spent a good 10 years of my life emotionally involved with someone who kept lying and manipulating. It started when I was 16, we were together for a couple of years, then split for 4 years during which he kept trying to contact me, back again for 2 years, two years later back again for 1 year or so, and I broke up for good with him two years ago.

He lied about things big and small, from telling stories that happened to his friends like they happened to me, to lying about his whereabouts. He knew how to manipulate me and even made up a story about seeing his ex being raped in front of him because he knew I'd pity him. He kept me away from meeting his friends and family and denied me many of the things I asked for, but whenever I broke up with him suddenly everything was possible (except meeting his friends and family). I forgave him many times, and even when I told him I knew the truth and would forgive me he'd lie again. Now I believe he couldn't stop lying not even he wanted to.

My relationship with him is over for good, but it still has a big impact in my life. I still can't forgive myself for letting this go on for so long. People warned me he'd hurt me in a way I'd totally forget who I was before and that is true. I was very open hearted, joyful and sociable back in the day. Nowadays I can't trust people. My two significant relationships after this guy weren't good and that didn't help: one guy cooled off to me (it happens, no big deal) but the other wasn't over his ex and he was chasing her behind my back. I turned very revengeful and bitter and did my own nasty things to the manipulative ex. I do have opportunities to meet people but I can't make friends, when I think about it I realize I'm not tolerant of people, thinking deeper I feel I'm just afraid to trust. And I refrain from discussing issues because I believe say what they want to say and they will hide their true motives from me.

The anger and resentment have cooled down but I still don't know how to process this experience and it impacts me in a big way. I didn't even discuss this fully with my friends because I feel very ashamed of putting up with some of the things I put up with it. I have worked with three therapists before (still seeing one of them) and I can't even open to them about the full experience. Any advice, or experiences you'd like to share?",12Dec2020,1

My first few months working there one lady announced to my work place that I was lazy and she doesn’t know why I work there. I don’t even work the same position as her and I’ve never had a conversation with her before. I have a coworker that is very bossy and likes to yell at me almost every week. The other day he verbally harassed me during my lunch time and I reported him to my boss. I’m very introverted and quiet I also kind of have an avoidant personality but even though I like to keep to myself I’m never rude to anyone. 

I use to think earlier this year that maybe I come off as rude to others because of how quiet I am but even if I do Idk why people would be so mad at someone that doesn’t really talk. I have never had a conversation with anyone except a few people at my job i don’t work the kind of job to where I need to talk to my colleagues I could go the whole day without talking to anyone and it wouldn’t be a problem. Also my coworkers don’t even talk to me either and if they do it’s to be rude or passive aggressive about something.

I recently finished high school, that was the only thing that stopped me from leaving my hair to grow free, so now I have it a lot more large than the average of the men from where I live. Since I decided to let grow my hair, my mother has criticized me, saying commonly that having my hair and beard longs are things that make me look 'bad', ""as you would have a bad education, ""as you would stink"", ""as you would be unadapted"". She really thinks that, if I don't look like the man on the TV (combed hair, perfect clothes and shined shoes), the people won't be serious or considerate as valid my work, opinions, and ideas. That doesn't happen only to me, she also critises my little brother and other people. 

The matter is, that I don't stink, I try to be a polite and good person, like everyone else. I get a shower myself every day, I shine my shoes (cause I like to do it), I try to keep my clothes without stains during the day, I try to help in the home and work as much as I can, I try to study...

I’ve decided to be an electrician and have been working as one since late February. The virus screwed everything up and my employer was letting a lot of people go so I made a bad decision and left the company before they could fire me (I was told I was going to be let go). 

My next employer was good but after a few weeks he ran out of work and I’ve been sitting around the house since. Found a job on indeed and started Monday. Not making much money but it’s kept me busy and learning. 

It is just me and the owner. We have been wiring whole houses and I get paid by the day. Usually my days start around 6am is when we meet and I won’t get home until between 7 and 8 pm. I’ve just had a newborn baby and barely have time to spend with her and my wife. I have enough time to eat dinner, shower, and sleep. 

I enjoy the work and have been learning a lot. Working with the owner is actually pretty enjoyable. He seems very cheap, says how nice of a house he has, how he won the lottery, etc but can’t even afford to pay me a reasonable amount. 

Fast forward to this morning we went to a hardware store outside of our city and he needed to get quite a bit of material to finish this job we went to today. He loaded the cart himself which i thought was odd. Then we went to self check out and I realized, but wasn’t sure, he wasn’t scanning everything.

Later on I checked his receipt and he spent $270 but I know his material should have cost around $600. As I said I am on probation and don’t want to go to prison for this. I like the work but barely have time for my family or going to the gym. I’m only being paid $100 a day and being worked pretty hard. 

I don’t have many bills currently and could afford to not work I just enjoy working and providing for my family makes me feel better. Maybe I could use some wisdom and advice to help me make this decision. I’ve already decided to stop working for him to maintain my freedom but should I tell the hardware store what he did to make sure It can’t be held against me later?

56,"Hey everyone. So I have been really working on myself recently and I realized that I have never really set boundaries for myself, specifically pertaining to friendships... As I was coming up with a list of boundaries, I had a certain friend in mind. And before I absolutely bash him, I just want to make it clear that he is extremely important to me and I value his friendship so much. But we are very different. I’m extremely introverted and anxious... I don’t like to be around people that I don’t know and I hate doing things out of my comfort zone. He, on the other hand, loves to be around people and do crazy things, like exploring abandoned buildings, going to places that he knows are not safe, and other stuff that I just purely do not enjoy or feel safe doing. There are certain things that he likes to do that I wouldn’t mind doing, but my mom is really protective of me and she would throw a fit if she saw me going to these places (she tracks me). He doesn’t understand that and tries to pressure me to go to these places, even though I have said no, that I can’t, multiple times. Whenever he wants to do something crazy, and I say that I don’t want to, he starts to whine and says things like “oh come on, it’ll be fun” or “ugh, *my name*” or something along those lines. I feel guilty for saying no to him, but like I said, I’m a very anxious person. There have been times when he has asked me to do something I didn’t feel comfortable doing, and said no to, but since he is driving, he goes to those places anyway. I feel like I am being unfair to him because we do things that I like to do all the time... but I don’t want to make myself miserable. Sorry if I’m being over dramatic, but i am tearing up right now while writing this. He knows that I have anxiety, I have told him straight to his face, but he just doesn’t understand. Do you guys think that I’m being unrealistic for having those boundaries? I feel like as his friend that it is important that I do things with him that he enjoys doing, too. Not just us doing what I want to do all time. Should I just try to live a little?",12Dec2020,1

58,"I've thought over it a lot, I'm just not ready to visit a therapist unless I think something is wrong with me or whether I'm just finding excuses to not leave the house.

Here's a run-down on my mental state: The best way to say it is I'm afraid to leave the house, but it's not agoraphobia, I won't cry or have a breakdown leaving the house I just don't feel safe anywhere but my room.  
However, the reason I say it is 'the best way' is that I don't think I feel anything, I'm not attached to this house or this place or people in general, I just have no response to anything whatever happens, happens.  
I haven't spoken to my mum who I live with about any of these concerns and I think as the days go by she gets more fed up with my 'lazy' attitude, I do try to help her and I do my best to remember to do basic chores I just forget so easily and I'm self-conscious about doing it in front of people.  
I think I used to have bad social anxiety in high school because I skipped, ditched, hid in the bathroom, anything to get out of being in a room full of people but at a point, I just stopped caring?

I've heard so many different people normalize mental issues and that it's easily fixed but I don't know where to begin seeking help if there is something wrong with me or how to ask for help from anyone, I think I just really need someone to start me off somewhere.",12Dec2020,1

65,"Basically title is TL; DR.

I (31, single, no kids, US) have already made a few longer term goals and achieved them, so the issue isn't on setting/ achieving goals in general. Not posting bc I am unhappy, or anything... just have lived my life mostly based on making goals and now I'm like wtf.

Long story short: worked on the books since 15 yo, got my Associates right out of hs. Worked full time, then went back to school at 25 to avoid student debt. Still worked full time, school full time, exhaustion full time... the whole 9. 

Now have my own small, modest home, depend on absolutely nobody for my bills, 0 debt with what I would consider halfway-semi-ok savings considering my setbacks and delayed achievements. Blah blah blah. Aka I feel that I'm fairly decent at setting goals and eventually achieving them. Maybe not the best but not the worst either, idk. Like not a millionaire or anything but I've worked my ass off and I'm at least making it by ok for now.

Idk if its my age, or the fact that I'm tired from working so hard for so long, or whatever the case may be. But im just feeling anxious and so many other related emotions. 

Like, is this all there is? What other longer-term goals do I set from here? I mean I'm saving for retirement (best-case scenario/ main goal: 55; acknowledged, more realistic possibility: 62) but still..... what else in between? Thats almost 25 years, best case considered!

Like yeah, vacations here or there over the years, but with covid that's not a realistic main goal for the closer-end of a long term goal. 

Have some savings toward a trip; i do like to see new places, but really all I want is to go on is this National Geographic cruise to the Galapagos Islands. Dont really like cruises, but its fairly inexpensive for one person considering what it is (like 4k for the week including flight). Maybe a couple other places overall, but I also don't want to base my entire goals for the next 20-30 years of my life around travel and retirement. Isn't that what retirement is for?!

Don't really care about a relationship either, or kids. I mean I guess it might be cool if it happens, but overall I really am ok with my life. 2 cats who I adore, a few close friends, don't totally hate my job but obviously open to improvement/ upgrade as anyone would, I feel.

Looking for insight on how to make attainable longer term goals and such as a fairly established semi-young adult? Or else wondering if this is all there is to work hard for? Stability and modest lifestyle? I have ADHD and i need something to do to improve or i go crazy af. Any advice?",12Dec2020,1
66,"Title. I'm 27 and still live with my parents. I was suppose to move out with a now ex girlfriend in early 2021, which obviously is not happening now.

I would like to think that my life is ""going good"" otherwise besides this (e.g., have a master's degree, have a good job, contributing towards retirement, have a savings, fairly good with my money, try my best to stay """"""""attractive"""""""" etc.).

68,"I've tried writing this post before. I have to complete it this time. This is from my perspective. 

This goes back a very very long time.

2017: 
My sister starts to go out (AGE 12), and have fun. Pretty harmless. She starts to argue with my parents, one time even running from home. (Parents ran out and found her after 30ish minutes). My brother is 5 at this point, and generally didn't get affected (I think).

2018:
We move house, she hated this concept as she would have to move school. When she moved she got bullied, started cutting her arm, and probably fell into depression. My parents noticed, and started talking to her about it. She went to our school counselor around every 2 days-ish. She eventually started getting angry and started shouting at my parents a lot. They shouted back. Loud bangs could be heard from her room presumably from doors smacking etc. My sister started telling them not to hit her and that she would call CPS. My parents denied ever hitting her in the near past. This happened every 2nd/3rd night. She would still attend school regularly and not miss any lessons. My brother was in bed at the other side of the house, but could still hear the bangs and crashes due to the sheer volume of them. He never said anything about them (He was 6 and probably didn't know what to do).

Later that year, she got a boyfriend, and told my parents after keeping him secret for a while. My parents thought that 13 was way too young an age to be dating, and wanted her to focus on her academic projects. They argued and fought over this for months, after finally my parents allowed it. This is the first example of my parents compromising and loosening up. I started crying when these fights happened and I just wanted us to return to the normal us.

She also had a sleepover with a friend. They strolled our street at 3AM(I think), and saw a pretty bush in the neighbors yard. They jump the fence, take pictures and go back. Next morning, my parents drive to the police station to explain why my sister had committed a crime. Trespassing. It would be on her record permanently, although there wasn't a punishment.
 
2019:
She got friends in her school, and was more happy. My parents and sister were still arguing/fighting. Swear words started being tossed from each party etc. She missed a few lessons here and there, nothing that serious. The fights were louder, sometimes went outside,   where the neighbors could hear them. Doors were broken, and shelves were torn. Around the end of the year, my parents rounded up me and my smaller brother up separately and talked to us about the situation and how my sister was going through a phase, and that they're trying to do the best for us. They started allowing her to go out with friends late on weekdays, and often she would come back home later than the deadline of 11:00-12:00ish. This would cause argument. She would also ask to be picked up regularly because she was too tired to come back, when it was already the time that she should have been home. I cried every night of the arguments. I wanted us to be normal. I wanted them to communicate their issues properly. I could only imagine what effect this would have on my 7 year old brother. Sleeping to bangs and crashes and swears, alone in bed with no one to talk to. Eventually, my parents signed my sister and themselves for family counseling. This started to work well, and they argued a lot less frequently. 

They then stopped going. My sister started going out until 12-2 on weekdays and was never home. She started missing more school and a few assignments. This angered my parents who wanted her to focus on her academic future. (She was always quite a good student).

2020: 
The fights got extremely severe, my parents started getting hurt. My sister started getting hurt.
My sister moved to a really expensive school (best in the country) as she didn't like the school she went to.
She started missing quite a bit of lessons and assignments, and my parents felt that swapping her to this new school was useless.

This is when the severe part starts.

My sister started taking drugs, smoking, and drinking.
She was only 15. My parents found this out when they saw a pack of cigarettes in her purse. They also eventually found some weed and hash (I think). This is illegal in my area.

She was going out everyday even during corona. She was going to 10+ people parties even when they weren't allowed. My parents let her, as she would totally freak out if she wasn't allowed to. (My parents are UN workers and have extremely strict hand-washing and sanitizing regimens throughout the house). My dad sanitized everything twice a day, for 9 months.

My mum's brother then died. He was really close to her and quite close to us, so she visited her home country for a month for the funeral.
There weren't any arguments between my dad and sister when my mum was gone. (My dad got a new boss and works 10-8 now, so when he was done, he didn't have energy and just watched TV in the living room.
My mum came back.
My sister kept going out
This led her to get corona. (2D ago) She self isolated in her room, with food being left at her door, like it was supposed to. The whole family is wearing masks in the house. We all tested negative. (Minus my sister ofc). 

TODAY:
My dad opened my sisters door to give her dinner, only to find a drug mixer. He got extremely angry as he thought she stopped doing drugs, smoking etc. (My dad's been an avid cigarette smoker for 5 years and has been trying to quit for the family's sake for so long). {He one time nearly choked while smoking a year back}.
My parents went crazy.
They shouted and shouted, but couldn't fight as my sister had corona and didn't want to spread it. 

I am crying so hard rn while writing this post. All my emotions boiling up in the past 3 years is literally killing me. I'm thinking about how negatively this would affect an 8 year old kid, if it affected me, a 13 year old male, so much. I want my brother to have the happy childhood I had. I want this to stop.

I have an extremely high likelihood of having Asperger's syndrome (High severity of autism, no physical changes, just mental). I don't know how to tell my parents. They're too distracted with my sister, and I don't want to bug them even more. But I also want someone to talk to. This is killing me.


Thank you.",12Dec2020,1
69,"Okay so I’m going to be very blunt. I’m a sexual abuse survivor. Both my father and brother molested me. My brother first when I was 6 and my father when I was around 12-13. I told my mother about my brother (thank god she believed me we never got along her but that is one thing I am thankful for) and he was sent to juvenile detention and has since apologized and I have forgiven him. On the other hand my father... never apologized and when confronted he said I was lying. I went to the police for weeks did reports and met with different detectives but no charges were placed and he was really a free man. About a yr later he died in a car wash bathroom of an overdose. It’s been about 4 almost 5 yrs I believe and I’m still in the recovery process... fast forward to now I’m happily been in a relationship for almost 2 yrs with my amazing boyfriend but he told me something recently that has been eating me away. I feel bad for saying this behind his back but I just have no one else to talk to about this. He told me that he and his girl cousin would play games like “mommy and daddy” when he was around 5 and she was like 8. She would touch him and kiss him and he said it felt wrong but he did it back to her anyway. Eventually she stopped and they just “grew up” and never mentioned it again.... 

Now with MY past I have been so traumatized that I get ptsd from just smelling a cologne similar to my fathers and the fact that my bf told me this and has not told his family is very hard to handle. I TOLD my family because I just couldn’t take it anymore and the fact that he’s able to just live like nothing happened scares me. He’s friends brothers who at the time we’re teenagers showed him porn when he was 8 and he told me he’s been sexually active since a young age. I’m scared about when we do have our kids, the fact that he still hangs out with these people that in reality exposed them to pornography which is a serious crime and just continue the relationship. I’ve tried to bring it up but in his defense he said “it never really bothered him” and “that’s how boys are” but as a survivor I CANT accept that. I don’t want to push him because it really happened to him and not me but I’m a empath and I can FEEL that it DID have an impact on his life I just don’t know how to say it to him. I’ve been through many different therapist and psychology classes due to the fact that I was placed in foster care after I revealed what my father had been doing and in order for me to return home to my mother court ordered we all take classes so I learned quite a bit about how predators prey on their victims. So with ALL this knowledge I have I feel like a soda can being shaked and is about to pop especially with the holidays. I haven’t met his cousin but I already told him I don’t want to even be in the same ROOM as her and that I think he should tell his family but I can tell he really doesn’t want to bring it up. So what do I do????",12Dec2020,1
70,"My friends and I have hung out pretty regularly for the past few months with me seeing my best friend almost everyday. Ive also been doing some solo traveling around the states here and there before I move out to Asia in March. 

Last month I visited Colorado and the night before I drove out things were normal. The four of us were making plans to hang out the following weekend when I get back. I ended up getting injured in a car accident while I was out there. I messed my knee up to where I tore 2 ligaments and broke a bone. 

For the first two weeks post accident I was in a wheelchair and unable to really leave my home. I figured my friends would make plans to come to my place but I never heard anything. Two days later my best friend told me he now has a girlfriend and offered for me to come over to his place for dinner to meet her in which I declined cause I couldn't leave my home. I haven't heard from him since. 

I later found out my best friend had a recent death within his close family so I reached out and told him if he needs to talk or anything to let me know and he never responded to me. I haven't heard anything else from him or the other two but they all still view my snapchat and Instagram stories. I'm also about 80-90% they aren't hanging out with each other. 

I'm sorta mindfucked/confused right now. Literally everything was normal right before I left and now nobody is talking. I'm mostly shocked about my best friend going silent.

71,"I M28 randomly came across a couple of them on dating apps over the past 5 or 6 months. I told myself I wouldn't because the goal is a real relationship. I kept telling myself that if I do this, it could somehow mess up my chances at the real thing or if I did get a relationship, I'd have to tell her eventually which could screw it up later. 

But after a couple of failed dates, failed matches, convos that fizzled out + a pandemic + becoming more bored, I think I need some skin contact. They're good looking, affordable prices, claim to get tested for Covid and STD's(Could be lying. I know).

I have plenty of savings. I know people are struggling to just get by so I feel a little selfish for even considering this. Not that it justifies anything, but I did donate a good chunk of cash to some people who needed it.

I've been semi-productive with learning investing, 3D-Art and doing some things to stay fit. I had to stop going to the rock climbing gym due to Covid which was one of my bigger outlets.

I don't even know if I'd have sex. Maybe just cuddle and smoke a joint.

72,"So my paternal grandmother is like 92 years old. She has dementia but refuses to go to the hospital or nursing home to get treated. She currently lives by herself because my parents are in America and the rest of our family that is in Korea doesn't see it as their responsibility since they're daughters and my dad is the only son. Because of this my mom has to go to Korea to take care of my grandma and my grandma is incredibly abusive to my mother. Like abusive to the point that I've fought with my grandma over it. I have 3 aunts in Korea but none of them see taking care of their own mother as their responsibility b/c my dad is getting most of the inheritance money, he has a wife who should do it etc... 

I have no idea what to do. I know I'm only the 20 year old ""kid"" but I can't stand to see my mom become a slave to an emotionally abusive and horrible person who she isn't even related to. The stupid traditional rules of Asian mother in laws abusing and treating their daughter in laws like slaves infuriates me. My mother sacrificed so much of her life taking care of me and my brother and now she has to slave for an old woman who disrespects her and treats her like trash.

I'm ok with her wearing them walking in and out but she will not turn them off inside the building. She will sit there even when the lights start to dim with them blinking. Last year at one of the concerts they were still on 2 songs in and someone yelled to ""turn off that light"" and she still wouldn't until I made her. She says Christmas concerts are more casual but I feel like it's still the symphony. People are there to watch a concert, not have an 8 inch tall tree blinking tree distract in a dark room.
The concerts are approaching and I noticed a new headband has been purchased. I know she's just doing this for attention but it's embarrassing to sit next to her while people glare at us. I find it hard to concentrate when I'm wondering when she will try to turn them back on.

75,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

When I was a kid, my brother used to molest me from touching my privates to touching his privates on mine. I was extremely young from 5-11 I had no idea what he was doing but I knew it felt wrong. I didn’t know about sex until I was about a l it take bit older and when you’re a kid it feels like people older than you know better than you and wouldn’t hurt you bc he wasn’t hurting me physically I didn’t know what to say. He stopped after some time and I’ve never mentioned it to him. I think it stopped after I told my mom about a teacher in elementary school who did the same to me and I told her a close family/friend was doing the same but I was too scared to her it was her own son and that she would hate me but I think she might’ve known but didn’t want to believe it. One day she caught him getting close to me but not quite doing anything extremely inappropriate (we were just cuddling but I knew he wanted to keep going bc that’s what always happens) and she happened to see and say “what are you guys doing come down stairs”. Idk if he stopped bc he realized it was wrong (hopefully) or if he was scared to be caught. I’m now 22 and my aunt had kids close to the age he molested me at. My aunt lets him babysit with his girlfriend bc she works weird hours and they love him. He lets him watch tv and play video games which is exactly how he caught me as well. He would steal my attention with things kids liked and then use that to pull my pants down. I’m now really worried he might be doing the same. I’m sure he’s not and that he’s become a better person but I don’t want them to go through the same trauma that i did. No kid should have to deal with someone sexually abusing them let alone a relative. No one believes you or let’s if pass bc it’s not like it’s a stranger who is easy to prosecute.

76,"I don't know how to properly word this so you understand the full situation. I don't think anyone is really a bad person just deeply flawed individuals who refuse help and I want to know what can I do to navigate this situation until I can remove myself from it. Also further advise (Don't say therapy) would also help.

I am in my early 20s and I am stuck at home with my parents because of university. My parents are constantly fighting. I have two older sisters that also contribute to the overall discontentment within the household but I am going to just focus on my parents since I am the one stuck with them. I am not perfect either I am fucked as I grew up with these people too lol.

My parents argue almost everyday from I was age 9 or younger. The arguments are just over the dumbest stuff like objects being moved or some unimportant stuff not being done. My father gets loud and curses constantly and my mother never admits she is wrong.  This arrangement has been bearable but recently it has become emotionally draining for me. 

In the last 5 years or so my mother has slowly start to complain and half ass things that she is doing (She is a stay at home mom). She will complain that she doesn't want to cook and clean, we (my sisters are included in the we) will suggest to do it but she will be ungrateful and complain. She is constantly complaining and nagging. She has slowing gotten super involved in church and start to neglect her relationship with my father and it has slowly eroded. 

My mother had stage two cancer and did surgery to remove it. We have taken up the slack and my father would go all out with carry her to the hospital and her care. However, he would frequently complain about my mother basically ignoring him. He is not perfect as I have stated before he is insecure about his lack of education and (being a armchair psychologist) is search for approval and acceptance from others even though he tries to appear rough. At the end of 2019 or at the beginning of 2020 he has started to act strange he would ask me how he could lock his message and he changed his phone code (I knew it before). I suspected that he was cheating and my mother suspecting something as well. As he couldn't sleep and would frequent cry. He would start saying things like he is not loved by us , that he is gonna just leave the house to us and move out and he is gets more love from strangers. This would be normal but he frequently pushes us away or gravitates towards strangers as he treats outsiders gently but would frequently embarrass us in public, shout at us and doesn't take advice from us.

This has been all over the place because my english is not that good and I want you all to understand the situation even though i would need a couple more paragraphs. Anyways he is cheating as he is sneaking around the house whisper on the phone and I have seen the woman he is talking to. We(Sisters included) had a 'family meeting' he said he was gonna stop and my mother said that she would try to do more in the relationship. However it has only gotten worst, i think he despites us and maybe he is going through a mid life crisis or something. He erupt into loud and hurtful worst at the simplest things and he is acting like he doesnt care.  Im stuck in the middle of this as im the one who is most frequently at home. I want to know what can I do to get through this situation this situation has made me lose respect for my father and im starting to dislike him. I already hate my mother because of her narcistic ways and my sisters are like strangers. My family is a bunch of pretenders just strangers living stuck together by blood .

83,"Hello, 

Earlier I posted this topic where I explained that I have a male friend (I’m female) since university, he liked me couple of years ago we got into a huge fight about that because I didn’t like him he got mad. (In real short). So about 2 years ago we somehow started talking AS FRIENDS I said that real clear and became sort of friends not a lot but still. He texted me like crazy I found that annoying but ok I just thought maybe he’s just like that.. I answered I liked him as a friend.  (still it was just way to much, texting all day, sending funny pics, asking 5 times a day where I was etc)

so he visited me last week end became really touchy, touched my hair stroke my arm, but I didn’t want to make a scene because I’m busy and just didn’t want to go into this thing we did a couple of years  ago again (because it was really stressful for me he called me many many many times; send letters etc it’s was just weird)  

So I decided to let it all “melt down a little (haha how do you say that in English? Just to let it be for what it was) and answered to his text but way less and just hoped it will all be “normal” because I didn’t want to have a serious conversation with him, because I don’t want that simply and I don’t own him that. 

So he already asked me a couple of times what’s wrong? I’m feeling so insecure about this situation blabla, a tried to call me twice a day, but I kept telling him, I’m just busy please.... 

So 2 weeks passed by and he asked me can we talk, called again and I said I was at friends, so then the whole drama started again. 
 
He asked me to hang out; I asked him to postpone a couple of weeks bc I’m busy. He said hmm maybe and that he felt weird about the past weeks. So I said I’m just not on my phone so often, I don’t texted my female friends that much why should it be different for you? He said yes maybe that’s the thing. 

So this is what makes it really confusing for me: he literally said: 
I like our friendship, but I can’t help it to think about you in another way. We talked about maybe in the future being more than just friends. We had a fight over that in the past, I don’t want to loose you as a friend. (I really made clear I didn’t want to be more than friends back then, I really really did) 

So I expected this, but I don’t want this; I was clear in hints and in words that couple of years ago. So I said: I don’t want that I don’t see you like that, I feel weird about our friendship bc you seen me different that whole time make me feel uncomfortable. I think we should leave each other alone. (In a nicer longer way but that was the main message)

He replied; thx for being honest. I see it as a friendship as well, it’s different than the last time, it’s more like friendship feeling now. You don’t have to be afraid our friendship is different now. I’m so happy we spoke this out. I get that it feels weird for you, but to me nothing changes. I thought we should talk about this as friends, we never spoke about our love life’s with each other and we should be able to talk about it. I want to explain to you how I feel, maybe in we can meet next week. I’m sorry I don’t want to loose our friendship. 

sorry for the long post, but I’m SO confused right now....... what would you guys do?",12Dec2020,1

I’m 20F and he’s 20M we are both in the same course he’s the best BF I could ask for he’s smart/funny/spontaneous/loves me and amazing as a person I could spend this entire post raving about him I know he loves me and I love him I know hes not just with me for sex cause we didn’t do for 6 months cause I wasn’t ready he never pressed it I told him once I wasn’t ready and he never brought it up until one time I decided to have sex with him He often takes me on spontaneous dates out and I do the same I’m his first gf and he’s my first long term bf 

He’s met my entire family as I’ve had him stay with me in the country I’m from since he’s isn’t from there(I’m American and he’s Ukrainian  who lived in Europe most of his life) we both go uni in Europe 

I’m very close to my family they knew about him almost as soon as I met him and met him pretty early on in the relationship my parents really like him but he isn’t close with his family at all he’s got a wierd relationship with them like he was abused by his dad with who he lived with and he doesn’t doesn’t like to talk with his mom 

But the thing is though he says he isn’t close with his family I’ve seen him spend an hour on the phone to his dad and probably 2/3 to his grandparents to who he’s close. He says it’s a different kind of close as he hates sharing his personnel life(as in friends/emotions and stuff lien that )  with them he has told me that I probably know him better than his entire family combined together 

The other thing that kinda bothers me is he doesn’t ever post picture of us together on any of his social media’s and refuses to be in tiktoks i make like I know he’s still a bit insecure about his looks because even when I met him his Facebook had a photo of him when he was about 12 where u couldent see his face sane for Instagram so I know hes not a shutter bug he takes pictures with him only when I ask because I love to 

Though I did meet his two best friends maybe a couple months into our relationship but that was due to them living in a different country 

But I’m not sure what to think of this on the one hand I get it to an extent but on the other I mean we’ve been dating a year plus now my family is starting to ask me why I haven’t met his

86,"Hi I'm new to reddit, i 22 (F) have been experiencing clear multiple sclerosis symptoms (diagnosed in August) since March. The thing is ,there are times since I've had these symptoms I've woken up with nail marks on my palm, these are really defined marks. I have constant numbness in my hands so maybe i don't feel it as much.
The number of marks has ranged from 1 to 40 plus...yea 40 plus (no lie) seriously looked like some demonic stuff with the marks even going up my fingers themselves. They hurt when I wake up and take awhile to go.
I don't really have long nails or anything so I must be putting in some amount of force.
They never cut skin or last the whole day.
Is mostly on my right hand which is my dominant hand.
I don't drink, smoke or do drugs. 
I consume caffeine but only in the morning mostly.
I have between 7-10 hours of sleep on average.
My sleep pattern tends to be not so great and tends to pick sleeping during the day.
The marks happen maybe once a week to few weeks.
I just woke up with 2 marks , its 2am and i went to sleep at 9pm so 5 hours of sleep in.


So my question is - Why is this happening? How do I stop it ? is this related to my MS ?",12Dec2020,1
87,"I know this will probably get lost in this thread but here goes nothing. 

So here’s a quick little run down of my life. I am currently 19 for reference. 

Growing up I was an only child, my mom, dad and my grandparents (moms side) lived in the in-law attached to the house. Small town less than 8,000 people. Meet my best friend in the 1st grade. Started playing trumpet at grade 3 and all got  diagnosed with dyslexia and ADD. Parents were divorced by grade 4, joint custody.  Mom ended up getting married to the Music teacher of my school. Middle school grandmother passed away due to cancer. High school was high school, did marching band for 6 years 7-12. And was president of the AV club for 3 years. I also did the robotics club. I was a shop kid in high school couldn’t stand to be in a desk all day. 

So, my problem is my best friend cousin. Call her O. We have had feelings for each other for as long as I can remember. Probably around grade 2. We’ve dated too many time to count. On and off through middle school and high school. But the last change I had I blew it at a party. I was black out drunk and my ex was there and she found a way to convince me to sleep with her. I woke up the next day hungover and slowly started to peace the night back together. I was supposed to hang out and drive with O to see her college. But I felt too sick to drive. So I told her I couldn’t. Then before I left my friend house, my ex called O and told her all about last night. I called O on my drive home. And when I found out my ex told her I pulled over and cried. I don’t cry. O is probably my best friend and i couldn’t stand the thought of loosing her. We ended up not talking for a few months. We used to talk on FaceTime every night and text all day. And without that I felt empty and didn’t want to do anything. Now 4 months later I have her back, well just a friend now. We still talk mostly every night. But now I guess she’s talking to a guy who we went to high school with, he’s doing the Army to become a police officer or something not sure. She told me the other night that she doesn’t like him, they haven’t even had their first date and they could only talk once a week when he was in basic but now his home. She knows I still have feeling for her, I’ve told her that before several times. She usually turns it into a joke and we laugh. I really like this girl, she is the only person I can really be myself around and there is nothing more I could want to have her back in my arms and watch a movie. Sometimes I think I’m crazy still trying to hold on to something. I know what life is without her and I’m so scared of that happening again. I love her. She is beyond beautiful and smart and funny, and she has the cutest little smile when she talks about chemistry and biology. She loves to try to teach me what she learned that day, and I try to teach her something about  engineering. Me thinking about this hurts me but do I keep playing the waiting game or do I try to move on and forget her.",12Dec2020,1

89,"Hi I'm 17 and a college student

My mother has her moments, when she drinks a lot she tends to get shouty. She doesn't abuse physically. She starts a fight with me or one of my siblings and doesn't stop until hours later. She starts name calling, accusing and saying everything we've done wrong. I know it doesn't sound like much but it drains you and messes with you mentally. This has been going on long before i was born. She's led me to depression and therapy, which didn't help because i can't say certain things. I think i start to have moments where i feel like im  having a panic attack. But she's still my mother and i love her ,other than when she drinks we're okay

I can't approach her on anything because she'll get hysterical-ish and compare or blame what ever i say to her self. She's been getting worse lately with the shouting and she never remembers any arguments she has in the morning.


So the options i have in my head at the moment are:

1- go to the park the next morning and pretend nothing happened like normal.

2- talk to my best friend in Foster care and ask her about care. But i can't because then my mum would be by herself and go deeper into her own hole and won't last. And i also don't want to leave my home but i can't stand it anymore.

3 - go back to therapy. I went there for 3 years doing school and from experience if i go there again my mother when she has her moment will go on about how ill say anything or all the bad things to my therapist. Also they wanted to involve my mother if i were to continue back before i left which is not a good idea.

4 - go back to life and college and move on



Thats it really. Any advice or opinions would be helpful. Really. I'm just drained at the moment and i don't think ill get good sleep or a good day for the next week, I'm posting this at 2:23am",12Dec2020,1

This person also once tried to convince my mom to drive them home (like 2+hours outside of Ottawa) and even though she said no, they kept asking the entire time they were there, and just kept upping the amount they would pay her for the ride and that she could ""bring all her kids too""... They 100% creep me out but because English is my mom's 4th language she doesn't grasp all the nuances.

My parents run a small restaurant downtown.

Said person also grabs a take out and asks for a drink (opens but never drinks) so they can justify not wearing a mask while they wait. And if they're not talking about how the virus is fake, they'll claim to any customer that the virus will kill you and all the 5G conspiracy theory. I am literally at my wits end, what can I do to ask them to stop affecting customers while they're there? Would it be wrong to ban them from the business which could lead to negative press?

* I've found myself contemplating the death/mutilation of myself/others in great detail.
* I've been considering suicide as a viable life option.

101,"Backstory: I'm an international student in Canada (originally from Singapore). On a very tight budget. I'm worried about my future stability and whether I'll be able to sustain financially long enough to finish my degree. I haven't been able to find a job (not sure if its because of the pandemic or not).

When the pandemic started, all my classes went online. I then got an idea: Why not just ask my uncle (who lives very close by in the United States), if I can stay at his place until regular classes begin? I could save over $6,000 in rent and expenses. Plus travel money because I won't have to fly all the way to Singapore and then back. If I am able to save that much, I have a really good chance of being able to sustain myself until the end of my degree.

And this isn't a distant uncle. Family tree wise, he's the closest uncle I have. Almost like a 2nd Dad. I've stayed at his place a couple of times before and every time he visits us with his wife and 3 kids, he stays at our house.

So I asked him if I could stay at his house until my classes began. About 6 months. Because of the border rules, It is a little tricky. I can enter the USA but I can't go back into Canada until next year when classes begin. 

He said he'd think about it. And then later he said No, because of the duration of the stay. He said that he was ok with short term stays (like 2 weeks or a month at most) but this was too long and he wasn't sure about it because he's working from home and his 3 kids are also doing online school from home. I then later told him that this wasn't just for fun, the money I could save would really help me because I'm at risk of bankruptcy and not finishing my degree. Again he said he felt really bad but he just wasn't sure about it.

Later he said he'd help me out financially but I don't think he really means that, and he's just saying it out of guilt.

I'm just feeling really conflicted right now. I'm angry but at the same time I feel like I have no right to be angry because I'm not entitled to stay at his house. Some people have called me selfish and entitled. But how? I'm not asking him to sacrifice his life or his wife or kids life for me? What exactly am I taking away from them?

I don't even get what the big deal is. He has a spare room at his house, all I'm asking for is that. I told him I'd run errands for him and help him with whatever he wanted. I don't understand how me staying there is going to make his any more difficult. He knows its a desperate time for me. If I'm not able to finish my degree, my life is over. No 2nd chances. If I was in a stable position, I would not be asking him.

She's certainly accidentally installed her fair share of malware, but she regularly read anything out of the ordinary as someone on the other end actively messing with her. 

Things evolved as I left for university. She believed that *they* were sending veiled death threats. As a stay-at-home mom, she had all the time in the world to browse the web. A handful of posts on a message board ended up catching her attention. Family members would suspiciously match the description of the people in these posts, and one post even described the same city I was heading off to for school. It was hard *not* to fit some of those descriptions, and the city in question also happened to be one of the largest in the country. Despite this, my mother interpreted this as the hackers subtly hinting that they knew every detail of our personal lives.

By the time I finished school, it was no longer about a group of hackers. The police and government were in on it--they were following her. Fast food workers were screwing up her orders on purpose, so they were in on it too. People were constantly secretly breaking into our home, but they never took anything and only moved things around. If something didn't go the way she wanted, it was someone actively trying to ensure she didn't get what she wanted. I couldn't convince her of how unlikely it would be for the world to conspire to expend incredible resources in an attempt to mildly inconvenience her every now and then. My father set up additional security cameras and locks to help ease her fears about people breaking in and helped her feel more secure while online, but it seemed like nobody wanted to have a conversation about whether or not things were actually happening as she claimed. 

2020 hits, and we're all stuck indoors. The constant talk of the virus has increased her interest in health, and she spends even more of her time browsing symptom checking websites and believes that everyone has every disease that matches any one of their perceived symptoms. Later, she starts accusing my father of poisoning her and claims that her symptoms match the effects of certain poisons she recently read about. Despite this, she refuses to go to a doctor because the poisons can't be traced and the doctors might be in on the conspiracy against her. Over the years, she's joined groups who think they know better than doctors: ""they only spend a few minutes looking at patients, but we spend countless hours researching."" 

My word is worthless because I'm too young/stupid/brainwashed to understand. Her husband's word is worthless because he is supposedly trying to kill her. Friends and family can't understand. She knows better than anyone who is capable of helping her because she knows what she sees and knows what she feels, and that's assuming these people weren't already believed to be part of the conspiracy.   


What can I do? What should I do?",12Dec2020,1
117,"I think my advisor maybe a racist. He would create unnecessary barriers to destroy my academic career. I am trying to apply to medical school and he is the one writing my committee letter (a committee letter is basically a package about me sending to all medical schools). Is he giving me signs to just give up? I am almost done with the process with all classes finished this semester (with 3.91 GPA and planning to take MCAT in March)

Background about myself: i am an asian immigrant who moved to the country in my late teens (i am us permanent resident), but have quite a bit of accent due to the fact that I didn't live in the US when I was young. 

Some of the reasons I think he might be a racist:

1. He would give me different rules when compared to other students. I didn't know about it until I started talking to other students and realized how many bullshit rules he made up just to make my life more difficult
   1. he made me take all the hard science classes in the same semester (say like i would take orgo, bio, physics, labs, etc.) and refuse to let me make my own schedule. If i am below certain number of science classes per semester, he say I would not be qualified for committee letter. By making me taking all the heavy lifting classes in one semester, he is trying to destroy my GPA. But I worked my ass off and got 3.91 so far to prove him wrong. It was a lot of sweat and sleepless night and definitely not psychologically heavy. In talking to other students who have gone through or going through the process, they were stunned that my advisor doesn't let me customize my schedule
2. he belittles me whenever we speak. As first i thought maybe he is just a plain mean person and hates his life. But then i realized some students (white students in particular) told me he is very personable. I tried very hard to get to know him but even if i say hi, his response would be ""okay"", ""hmm"", ""okay"". I feel like I am talking to a wall. Eventually i gave up and only go see him if it is a ""must""
3. Recommendation letters: he told me I ""must"" not have more than 2 recommendation letters from professors. He told me he would throw away my letters if I ask more than 2 professors and absolutely won't read it. In talking to other students, I realized he told them they could ask up to 4 professors and he would pick the best three from them.
4. I also talk to other minority students, they have similar experience with me. In fact, my first day at school, I heard the stories about him making a minority girl cry and she was able to switch afterwards. But that's the only time I heard switching advisor was possible. I can't possibly cry to make this happened now.

There are just so many wrongs with him advisors...what should/can i do?

I feel like i am in a dilemma because I can't really change my advisor. Reasons being:

1.  there are only 3 advisors responsible for pre-med in the department. And pretty much I can't switch advisor unless I am close to the other two. Unfortunately, i don't know them personally. Also, it would probably raise a red flag if i request to switch and they might think something is wrong and it will definitely pissed off my current advisor. 
2. I cannot file a complain about my advisor until as least I get into medical school (hopefully i will/can) because he is writing my committee letter. So my entire future is hinged on him
3. Even if i switch, they told me the final committee package will be reviewed by all 3 advisors so essentially if i started complaining that there is something wrong with my current advisor. It might not look good on me and who knows what they will put on my committee letter.

I am torn and I don't know what to do. I feel like I should smitten him until I cross the bridge, but on the other hand, I am angry because I have to be a sucker and let him bully and belittle me while I smile and thank him for his ""work"". I can't really do anything because of this power dynamic and also no one knows he is that kind of ""racist"" people behind close door when he is with students like me. He puts on a facade that he is nice and caring. I just want to have someone who truly wants to help me to write me committee letter, but I feel like it is impossible at this point.",12Dec2020,1

That being said I grew up to be a well rounded gay pretty open minded person if I do say so myself lol. Where I’m struggling is going to see my parents less frequently because of COVID and me being “essential” I do have regular contact with coworkers who are also idiots.

Well I was visiting safely on the porch and made a comment on one of my crazy coworkers thinks the mask are a “government control experiment” and laughed and they looked dead serous and said “but yeah it is” and my heart just kind of sank between that and their recent voiced support of trump.

125," I don't know all the details of what they say to her because she becomes too depressed to talk to me, but it's enough to push her to suicide.  They make her feel worthless, they blatantly love their other children more than her right in front of her, and I'm pretty sure they even somewhat neglect her. They tell her how she's a horrible person, and how she means nothing to them. She's told her mom that she was having really bad suicidal thoughts, and her mom just ignored her. It's like her mom just didn't say anything and hoped her daughter would finally just kill herself.

However sometimes I do feel pretty lonely. Not lonely as in no friends lonely, but lonely in the romantic sense. I used to have a girlfriend, and to make a long story short, I tried really hard to be a good boyfriend but she wouldn’t tell me what her problems were and just cut it off even though I really wanted to fix them.

Since that bad experience, every now and then I would go on incel forums. Not because I agree with them, I just wanted to see what people said, probably as some way to cope. It became more and more frequent, though.

As I browsed them more I got this skewed vision of women in my head. What I’m about to say is not what I believe, or at least, it’s not what I want to believe; I’m just trying to give a clear message of what I’m feeling. It’s just a prejudice that’s developed in the back of my mind the more I browse these forums.

My mind has kind of been shifting more into the incel view towards women, that they don’t really care about personality, but almost exclusively about things like looks, social status, sex appeal, etc. That you can be a good communicator, and a good person, but they won’t like you because you’re xyz or they’ll eventually leave you. It’s not that I really believe this, but it’s just on my mind a lot and it’s like a prejudice. I feel really bad even typing it out.

How do I get out of this hole before I turn into an actual misogynist? I know how bad this sounds, but I don’t know what to do.

There’s no connection between us. I tried to catch up with him talking about the government and religion but I think he never tried to do the same with me.

I can’t let the fridge door swing open, I can’t lean on our railing, I can’t walk too loud, I can’t eat too loud, I have to constantly be busy, I can’t do nothing, but apparently I work out too much and he doesn’t see why I want to “look like a man”, when I just want to be more muscular. Everything has to be picked up to the point where the toaster has to be in a cupboard because it looks too big on the counter (the counters huge). He’s disappointed if I forget to push in a chair, if I haven’t cleaned the house in a week, if I leave a cup on the counter. Nothing I do is good enough.

143,"My roommate gets way too angry over simple things such as interrupting.  But I also think a big problem is they don't know the difference between interjecting/interrupting, and they have a very over inflated idea of what's interrupting.  If she is telling a story she constantly will tell a bunch of small side stories that don't need to be explained to understand, but I will say something like ""I hate when that happens"" or ""oh man that's so cool"" while she is talking as quick little comments.  The problem? She considers that interrupting, and will pause for 3-5 seconds and wait to make sure you aren't ""cutting her off"" again. 

I can't help but do it because everyone else I know interjects little comments like that all the time as a sign of listening and empathy.  She also sounds like she is done talking, and takes long enough pauses to seem like it as well.  Yet, when I start to talking I got eye rolls, and many other body signs of annoyance.  I will even stop when I notice them and apologize, but she makes a big deal about it.  It's so frustrating.  I think the biggest one is as long as she isn't doing, literally, nothing she considers it interupting.  If she is reading and I have to ask her something, interrupting.  Watching tv, and you pop in the room to show you want to say something, interrupting.  She always shows frustration of it through verbal or physical indicators.  It'd be different if I was interrupting phone calls or meetings, but that's not the case (minus when she talks to her sister on the phone for 4 hours straight)

Wtf do I do?  It's now at the point where I just tend to avoid talking to them.  But the issue is she will come into my room while I am gaming, watching tv, clearing thinking, working on something, anything! And just start talking.  Doesn't even ask if I have a second, or wait for me to pause.

I have mental conditions that cause social awareness to be a bit more challenging for me compared to most, but never in my life (in my 30s) have I had someone so regularly show annoyance with my ""interrupting""(or just tell me I interrupt too much) .  I have two friends that tell people to stop interrupting when they do it(they are very blunt) that have told me less than 5 times that I am interrupting while she shows/says it almost every time we talk.

144,"I've been doing some chainsaw work recently and noticed that my left hand, specifically my thumb and forearm, have been sore after and get pain from gripping the handle for very long. I am an avid ps4 gamer and the first thing that came to my mind was maybe I hurt my thumb from pressing in my joystick too much. So I searched it up and learned of gamers thumb. I would like to know your guys' personal thoughts on gamers thumb.
P.S. I don't believe that this is serious enough to take to my doctor yet as it doesn't occur anytime besides immediately after and during holding the chainsaw so it isn't as serious as some people who feel it while gaming. I really just want to know if it is gamers thumb, how to prevent it, and if I should be worried.",12Dec2020,1

my (f16) sister (20) has always had a habit of being toxic, then denying it when i, or anyone, brings it up. shes the oldest of four, and hasnt exactly had a fantastic life, but her life definitely hasnt been hard. she has trauma, yes, but i dont think it would affect the situation too much.

eight days ago, on december 3, i hit my one year clean. im so proud of myself and incredibly happy, because its been tough with everything my family's been through (i won't go in depth, but please believe me, its a lot.) i used an app to keep track, and it stopped giving me notifications, so i only realized today that i hit one year. i took a screenshot of the app, and posted it on my instagram story. admittedly, i should have posted a trigger warning or something of the sorts, and i regret not doing that. but not long after i posted it, my sister replied to my story and basically said that i should take it down and either censor it when i repost or just not post it at all. i apologized and told her i meant to post it on my close friends story, and just reposted it onto my cf after taking it off my main. she said it was no problem, and that was that. the rest of today, ive been anxious, easily upset, and havent been able to focus or really care about anything.

whats bothering me is she didnt say anything like congrats. i dont even care if she doesnt mean it, i could convince myself she did and thats what matters to me. im scared that if i do confront her about it, that she would say i expect too much from her if i ask her about it or something, im not really sure. should i tell her how shitty she made me feel, or should i just ignore it and pretend it didnt happen?",12Dec2020,1

147,"So, up until I was roughly 10 years old, I was better at expressing feelings (i.e. crying, saying ""I love you"", etc). 

But around then, I noticed a slow turn towards becoming more secluded. Like, I'll say things like ""goodnight"" back to my parents or something, or even hug them, but only if they say it first. Showing any emotion except for happiness or anger became more and more uncomfortable. 

Even taking a compliment is hard for me now. I'm always convinced that they're lying or I don't deserve it, or that I'm being a narcissist. I enjoy getting attention, but not for too long, or else I feel like I'm being too prideful or something. I can't seem to let myself feel good about anything without somehow convincing myself that it's wrong.

When I was 8, I tried to learn how to swim with the help from my family, but I felt to weird and exposed to do so, and I've only began trying to relearn right now.

When I was 12, I went through a whole religious crisis without saying a word. I was worried that my family would get mad when I told them I was scared of going to hell, so once again, I internalized everything. 

When I was 13, I was trying to tell my mother about something that had happened earlier that day, and when the conversation got deeper, she said to me in a mocking tone ""Are you gonna cry?"". She might not have realized it, but that just reinforced the fear of showing emotion. 

it was around then that my friends also began to notice my behavior, although unfortunately being a guy emotion is already greatly looked down upon. We would joke around a lot, but it felt weird to be open with each other sometimes, and it didn't help that some of their parents were crude and patronizing as well. 

Now, fast forward to this year, and another log has been added to the fire. 

Now, being a teenager, I've began throwing around the idea of being in a romantic relationship. Yes, I'm aware that they don't work out most times, but I still think I being in one would be a good thing. 

I began taking a liking to one person in particular about a year ago, but wanted to try and be friends with them first because I had no relationship experience. Given I was still in 7th grade, I didn't feel ready for something yet. I've discovered that I don't do well with people I barely know.

Now, the 2 of us are decent friends, and I had considered upping my game and trying to pave the way for a relationship. But then lockdown hit.

I've considered trying to talk to my parents about this sort of thing, but this is where me having a hard time showing emotion kicked in. Something about telling them about any potential love interests terrified me, and I still don't know why. 

So, seeing no other option, I decided to do some research on forums on the best way to go about a relationship, and trying to work up the courage to talk to my parents about it. But that only made things worse.

In recent months, we've began speaking more and more, and I was getting hope that things might  advance.

I didn't realize when I first tried getting to know her, but it's considered deceitful and cowardly to befriend somebody before trying to make a move, at least according to Quora. Sure, I had began to try to get to know them before considering making a move, but at the same time, the fear of loosing someone like that from my life horrifies me. I had no idea what I was doing was wrong, and now I feel like it's too late.

I'll admit, the thought of being able to ask her out has helped me get by in the last couple of years, and now i feel like I've wasted 2 years even though I haven't even tried anything yet. 

And it can all be tied back to my inability to be vulnerable. It's not like my family is abusive, either, they're great. I'd considered confiding in friends, but once again I just can't figure out how to articulate these types of things properly.

Plus, don't even get me started on the stress of the last 9 months. As mentioned above, I had been considering making a move, and I seemed to finally be making progress on talking to my family and being better with emotional talk.

But the stress of lockdown and all the news of the pandemic undid any progress I might've done. I still talked to my friends and the aforementioned love interest, but I felt as if I had to wait to do anything until things got under control.

And I'm aware that idolizing a relationship is unhealthy, but I don't know anymore if I'm idolizing it or just enjoying the thought of it. This person has treated me with genuine respect, and even though I try to avoid emotional talk on my end, she's been very supportive. Sometimes I wonder if I'm only attracted to her because she's nice to me and faking it. 

So in essence, a decent chunk of problems I'm having can be tied back to an inability to be vulnerable, and I was wondering if maybe any of you guys might have some advice. And I do apologize for the r/relationshipadvice aspect of this, It's just been on my mind for a while too. I would also like to apologize for the poor grammar in this post, but I can't exactly think of the right way to word some of these things, ya know?

148,"An old friend added up the costs of random things he had bought for me over the course of our 5-6 year friendship (coffees, food, random small gifts) after he decided he wanted to pursue a romantic relationship and I declined. It’s a good amount of money. I obviously said go screw yourself and blocked him on everything. He’s shown up to my apartment twice in the past 4 months or so and vandalized it, and threatened robbing/hurting me multiple times. 

I am a 23yo anxiety filled mess, so I am obviously very effected by this. I have not posted on social media in months in fear he’ll see something of value in the background, or something as simple as dying my hair (he had mentioned it before I blocked him and said “if you can buy hair dye you can pay me back”). I want to post pictures for the holidays, I want to be normal. But I can’t. 

I want to move to a different town (he and all of his friends are in the same town as me) but I fear they would find me anyway (it isn’t that hard these days) and continue to harass and vandalize property that isn’t even mine. 

I have contacted police, and because it isn’t my property, I can’t place any sort of restraining order, and I can’t wack them for the vandalism. They basically said wait until he actually does something violent/robs me, and we will take action. 

It’s been about 4 months since this all started. Should I still be on an online hiatus? Am I over reacting? Please don’t say “just pay him back”, he wants thousands of dollars and I work minimum wage, I pay all of my own bills, and I refuse to pay a guy for not banging him.",12Dec2020,1

He kicked my door which caused me to have a panic attack. After a few minutes he ""apologized""; ""Im sorry your generation is a bunch of thin skinned babies that need a foot up your ass to do anything in life"" 

That happened on November 11, its been month now and I cant bring myself to hug him. I was the first one to hug him when he got home, I ran out excited, smiling, arms out for a hug, now I just cant do that. Since that day he hasn't tried to fix or show that he cares and it hurts a lot. It made me realize that I dont know my dad at all, he never wants to do anything with me, only my brother. I dont feel comfortable going to him with my problems, I didn't even tell him that I'm pansexual, my mom told him.

The other night he asked me if I was on drugs (im not) and he said he was worried because someone had said that I was on them and thag my girlfriend was giving them to me. I couldnt hang out with him for a week because of work and he didnt hear from me, thats why he was concerned. I told her about it and she got furious and said that hes just trying to drive a wedge in between us and hes a piece of shit and all this stuff. Ive told her about how close we are and i talked to him about it.  She said she doesnt want to hear his name or see him or shes gonna tell him what she thinks of him and go off on him. Me and him go to the gym together and usually hang out for a bit afterwards. She just called me and asked where I was, i told her i just got done with the gym and was gonna eat and then od be home. Then she got really short with me and hung up. She said she doesnt want to hear about him, so i dont say anything about him, and now shes mad at me? It doesnt make sense and i dont know what to do.

159,"For a while now I have been struggling with conflict within myself about whether or not I should go see my family. First off, my family is nowhere near perfect (but in reality, whose is) and they have made their own fair share of mistakes. My wife and I seem to not be on common ground about me visiting my family, more so my mother than any of the rest (due to some of the mistakes she has made). I have never been the one to cut family out for any reason, as this was a huge issue in my past with my family completely falling apart when I was younger (I won’t go into detail because it really does pain me to think about it). Every time I bring up going to visit my family, or even the two of us visiting, my wife becomes irritated and insists that I’m giving my mother “what she wants”. This is said, I’m guessing, because she has never really liked my mother based off of my mothers past actions. 
     
I will agree with her on some fronts that my mother has been a bit of a rude person, but on other fronts, I don’t really agree because I have seen multiple attempts at communication and kind behavior. 

Recently, there was a massive conflict between all of us, me, my wife, and my family. This is where the conflict in me really sits. My mother suffers from Bi-Polar disorder, depression, and anxiety. It’s a like a light switch with her emotions. So, one second could be great, the next could be a complete mess. Most of the time my wife has been around her while she’s not in the best mood (that’s not my wife’s fault, it just happens to be when we used to visit them together). My wife and I got into an argument with my mother about her (my mother) apologizing for her mistakes and rude behavior towards my wife, to which my mother proceeded to lash out and overreact. While there is no excuse for that, I have no idea what Bi-Polar disorder is like besides what I’ve seen from my mom, so that could very well have been her reason for lashing out. 

Now, this weekend my family is having a get together that I would love to go to and spend time with them, but I am having this conflict in me about going as it seems to upset my wife, but she also tells me “you. An visit your family without me. Not that I need permission. She tells me it’s disappointing that I’ll still go see my family after my mom lashes out.

I am having such a hard time with this and any time I bring it up to her, she always tells me “I really don’t want to get into this”.

TLDR: I’m having conflict about going to visit my family because it seems to upset and disappoint my wife. My mother has not been the kindest towards us, but I don’t really want to let one persons actions punish the rest of my family. I want to see them as it is a family get together this weekend, but I don’t want my wife to be angry at me for going since she refuses to go with me anymore.

We had a son there (which wasn’t a planned pregnancy) and then I got stationed in the states. I recently got out of the military and I got a job as a police officer. The whole time while I was in the army and currently, she has been a stay at home mom. (She’s a wonderful mother and person)  but recently she’s been telling me that she feels like she has nothing going for her and that she’s basically a waste of space. As well as that all she is as a person is a mom and she hates it. I recently asked her if she resents me for the career decisions I’ve made, such as joining the army and she told me that in a way she does. She hates that she’s a stay at home mom but With my schedule and the cost of day care (we don’t live any where close to family for baby sitting) we both agreed that she won’t be able to get a job until my son is school age, Which will be next year.

165,Trying to make this as brief as possible . I am 23 yrs old(M) from the NE who is trying to decide about moving away from my home area I’ve lived my whole life. So one of my college roommates moved down south after graduation last year. It’s in an area I love and visit at least once a year since I was a kid. My other roommate and close friend is also moving down in a few weeks. Both have tried to get me to go move down and I really would love to. The problem is about 18months after graduation I still don’t have a full time job. Partially thanks to Covid and my own personal struggle to find something that fit me. The problem is my actual best friend is a 23(F) who is also trying to move to this area. I used to be madly in love with her which was not reciprocated. We both have had a lot of complicate history because of our deep deep friendship and the complications of my affection for her. It’s a lot better now but I still have struggles with it sometimes. It’s a weird dynamic but we are genuinely as close as two people can be and have mostly put my “old” feelings past us. I can’t bear to lose her completely in my life even if it’s just as friends and frankly she can’t either. She also wants me to move down. Money is tight so it won’t be for a bit. But I am worried if I do move people will believe the only reason I’m going down is for her. And Idk if things would suddenly get a lot worse for me if I moved down there at the same time and it’ll deepen/reopen my feelings. I would be living with my (M) roommates again and would be closer living proximity then we are now. I’m also worried if I don’t move it’s the beginning of the end of our friendship as it won’t be the same separated even tho we are in constant contact. To be clear I absolutely wanna move down there regardless of whether I ever knew her and have talked about wanting to move for forever. I just need any advice or words of encouragement/discouragement. Any opinions harsh or not would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.,12Dec2020,1

im so tired of her yelling and cussing at me, that i've just learned to be quiet and take it when shes pissed of at me. i NEVER swear back at her, or talk back because i know thats what she wants me to do, &amp; it'll just give her even more reason to swear at me.

last night i was warming up something to eat in the oven, and she comes around the corner and starts going off on me about how im not trying hard enough in school, even though i get decent-ish grades(80% or above in everything), and i said ""okay i get it"" in a calm voice at first, yet she just kept going on and on and im so tired of hearing her voice so i yelled back(i never cussed) and said ""i get it"" even louder so she'd just stop. but nope, i ended up not eating at all and just went back to my room for the rest of the night:(

ever since i woke up, i havent said one word to her and im giving her the silent treatment until she apologizes. i cant get in trouble if i dont talk, so thas what im doing.

today around 30 mins ago, im baking brownies in the oven and my mom is standing infront of it, on her phone looking at something, when she could literally be standing anywhere else in the house. im still not talking to her, so i opened the oven up a tiny bit to look, and she gets so extremely mad, slams her phone down and says ""speak to me like a normal person dont stand there like an idiot"". i could go on, but this is long enough.

i just dont know what to do, every single thing seems to set her off, and my dad isnt really a big help. he told me ""dont take what mom says so badly"", and thats about it. advice please???",12Dec2020,1
170,"The Basics: So my car insurance is about $480 every 3 months, I’m a teen guy so I expected it to be high. My mom told my dad, just for context they are not together, that we would all split it three ways so about $158 each. 3 months ago my first payment was due and my dad didn’t have the money to pay for it so my aunt offered to pay the full amount ($480) for the first 3 months, covering all our asses. I’m 16, I just started my job in October so I didn’t have the money to pay for even half of it so I was definitely ecstatic when she payed for all of it. Now on December 18th another payment is due and we’re not going to ask for my aunt to pitch in this time. My mom is asking my dad to pay for 1/3rd and he said no since he asked my aunt to pay for his half for 6 months and he says he will repay her which I highly doubt but ok. Now I have $330 in my checking account, my mom asking me to pay for half of the insurance and her being pissed at my dad because he hasn’t pitched in a dime for insurance. So now I’m fuckin stressed.

Extra Info: My mom told my dad 6 months ago all the info he needed to know about for the insurance. The two of them are fucking horrible at communicating and take turns ignoring each other which makes me the middle man, relaying info between the two. My dad works for himself and gets jobs here and there which was going alright for a while and now it’s kinda fucked up bc of COVID so he hasn’t been able to do much. My mom who works for the state has had steady income because she can work from home. This is just fucking frustrating because my dad refuses to get a different job and I’m not gonna tell a grown man how to fix his financial situation.

Idk what to do , should I just pay for half and be fucked until my next paycheck or should he pay his half or what. Advice would be much appreciated",12Dec2020,1

My partner and I have been together for over a year and a half at this point. We have had our ups and downs, like any healthy couple, and are going strong and very in love. He has recently received the news that he has gotten into the army and beginning training early next year. Although it was a shock at first as I expected another month before he is going, I now feel a pressure of time. We have a few weeks before we are going on holiday with his family for a few weeks, then I will only have a fortnight after we get back before he starts. The training base is a 5-6 hour drive away and I am unable to go with him. He will be there for 3 months, and then another (closer) base for another few after that. Once he is fully trained he will be placed at a base somewhere within the country, but it is unlikely he will be placed in the state we live in (we don't live together). Currently I am a full time university student and have another 2 years before I finish my degree, I would consider changing campus if it was for the same University but unfortunately there is only one I can study at, making me moving difficult and unfortunately not really an option. Hence, we will be in a ldr during his training and most likely for a lot of his deployment at a base. 

So my question is, what advice can you suggest for a ldr, preferably related to military but any is appreciated.",12Dec2020,1

176,"Hi, recently I have been trying to fill my days, i have very little things to do, feel lonely and realised I don't have any passion!

I see people being so creative, being passionate about all kind of things, they know movies, analyse them, read books, paint amazing art pieces, collect old stuff and restore them. And me? I am bad at every manual thing, dont know anything about movies or books and dont want to know more, I am not sportive, i kinda just vibe 24/7.

&amp;#x200B;

This pushed me to ask myself: What am I good at? What do I like to do?!

The answer is that I love social activities! I love running into new people, I am the creep who comes up to talk to you in the bus for no reason! I love listening to all kind of people and learn more about them. I also realised I love to chill, just walk around a beautiful place, sit down somewhere beautiful, and look around. I used to go watch bees everyday in a forest near my house, I often go walk around beautiful places often.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering, is there any hobby/activity that could combine those things?? Naturally I would say backpacking? which is a bit hard with covid right now... but I am open to anything that comes up in your mind!

178,"2 days ago I was on a walk in my neighborhood and my friend pointed out a kitten stuck in a tree. We tried to coax it down the branch a jump. It didn't. We rang the doorbell and asked if that was their cat. They said it wasn't. They said hopefully they find someone who would get it.

The next day, I drove by to see if the cat was there. It was not. So I'm guessing they got the kitten down somehow.

Today, I was on a walk with my friend again. We passed the house and the kitten came out of no where and started following us. We tried to get it to go back but it kept following us. We got pretty far and a car was zooming by and the kitten almost got ran over. And then we picked it up and put it down. And then we took/led it to my house. It stayed in the back yard. We gave it some water. We went inside to eat. And then came back to check it. It was gone. We found it under my friends car. Then it climbed up the wheel and disappeared. He had to go home at some point. We had to get the cat out of his car. So we popped the hood and there it was near the engine. We got it to come out from under the car for a bit but then it ran back under and in the wheel again. We coaxed it out and grabbed it and put it in a box. Then we moved it to a bigger box. We poked a lot of holes and taped the box shut. We left a bowl of water and gave it some meat(checked on google). 

Neither of us can keep the cat. We don't really know what to do from here.

I know I think I fucked up by letting it come all the way to my house. I didnt want to leave it stranded in the street. I felt like I needed to save it since it kept following us.",12Dec2020,1

I was thinking I should make a new account and keep my current Twitter private or just get rid of it all together. Or clean up my current social media and change the tone of it.

184,"I need some serious advice. I'm a freshman in a pretty well respected university in Canada. I hate every aspect about my life right now. I know being online isn't a good representation of how university really is, but I've always hated school. 

In high school I wasn't a good student. I had good grades, but I did the absolute bare minimum to be considered a participating student, and I don't think I studied for more than one or two exams for all of high school. I was fortunate enough to get good grades without having to try. 

Now in university, I'm doing well in in three of my classes, and doing poorly in my fourth. There are classes I can tolerate more than others, but **I hate everything to do with academia and school in general.** Shitty and rude professors, cocky class mates, uninteresting and motivating classes. It seriously makes me feel physically sick when I think of school, and I'm not exaggerating that. I don't understand how people can do 4+ years of this. It makes me feel dumb, unimportant and overlooked. I have nothing fulfilling in my life right now. 

I could just drop out, but I really want a financially successful future. I'm not talking about billionaire rich, but I've seen what having to worry about money has done to people. I don't ever want to worry about money in my life. University, to me, seems like the main way to attain this (at least to me). 

I should also mention the family I come from. My parents didn't force me to go to school, but it was expected of me. My dad has a B.A and an MBA and my mom has a B.A and BFA. They're both well educated individuals, and expected me to follow suit. Also, I'm lucky to have a college fund that my dad started. He has nearly 100k in there between my brother and I. That's a fuck ton of money to devote to someone, only for them to not use it. I don't want to disappoint them. I don't want to rely on them forever. I want to own a house someday. I want to take afford to to take a nice vacation every once in a while. But, I don't see how I can survive this for another 4+ years. It's mentally torturing me. The stress and anxiety I feel around exams is crippling. The rest of the time is pure anhedonia. 

I plan on finishing my first year at the very least. I've made that promise to myself and my parents and I plan to follow through on it. After that, I don't know what I'm going to do. I really need some guidance right now. Anything can help.

I never really had the best life, a lot of rape and toxic family and the 2 people that have been me since i was days old, my best friends, overdosing a year apart, and my own drug issues. I haven't really been stable.

When i was a kid, i would go on reddit and kik and stuff and i ended up getting groomed by a 32 year old man. I try to be weary of older people online now.

I wasnt doing well one night. Every person I had that was there to support me was asleep so I joined a random discord server I found by googling ""discord servers"". I didnt wanna talk about my problems anymore, I just felt so alone and wanted to talk to someone.

A dude dmed me and after talking for a bit he told me he was 17. I felt so emotionally fucked over that I didnt care, at least he was there for me, right?

A few days pass and I realize hes.. super weird. Jokes about fucking my corpse, asks about my body type, etc, etc. He talks in tone where it feels like you can trust him but it also feels really wrong. It felt the same as how it felt when i was being groomed on kik all those years ago.

I text my best friend, ""Im pretty sure im being groomed rn, hes 17 idk what to do""

He... congratulated me? He was like.. ""Oh are u guys dating? Can i meet him?"" 

My friend is 13 too but i know he dates older people, like 15 and 16 year olds but.. it felt so wrong. Why is he congratulating me?

189,"Me (M26) and my current gf (24F) have been living together since February this year. We were actually high school sweethearts my junior year and we stayed together until the start of my senior year in college. We broke up due to family issues and other personal reasons. We almost always got along, and there were other factors that made me break up with her. Fast forward to 2019, and I hear she's living in my same area again. She had moved down to move in with her new boyfriend in 2018 (her parents house was about two hours away). He was abusive mentally and briefly physically and long story short, she left him and moved back in with me. We are officially back together at this point. 

Right now things are fine. We have a lot of other stuff going on in our lives to worry about, so we do pretty good in enjoying each others company and supporting each other. We have our disputes sometimes but we're otherwise really good around each other. We do almost everything together now. I recently went through her texts, because I had this gut feeling. I saw a text thread with a coworker of hers, who is married. They've been texting back and forth sometimes and sending photos, from small teases to full nudes. Nothing overly explicit or graphic.  For context, she does some cam work and has ""boyfriends"", which she has communicated and overall I'm cool with it. But this is a coworker of hers who I've met a few times and it kind of feels like a betrayal. She has said in the texts that she's spoken for whenever he would hint or insinuate sex to her. If she's not at work, she's usually with me and I know her pretty well, so I honestly don't think she is physically cheating on me.

195,"Earlier this year, I just started working at a Sam’s Club as my first job. As a college student who is planning on going abroad for a semester, I need the money, which led me to choose to continue to work during the following semester “part time.” 

I applied and started working in our pick up area for our online orders. However, as we are are short-handed and that I am a big guy, I found myself slowly being pushed outside into doing carts until that was my job and no longer worked indoors. I understood this is where I was needed, and was up to the challenge even if this was not what I was hired to do. Considering the choice of words my manager used when hiring me, I can’t help but wonder if she intended to chuck me outside the second she saw me.

However, it was what followed that really began to make things awkward. I had made it clear as I was being oriented that I would need to drop from full time to part time when the school semester started and gave my schedule to give my manager more than enough time to figure out when I could be scheduled. I did make a mistake in not telling her when I started until the week before and as such, she could not grant me part time hours on such short notice. That is fine but as the weeks progressed, I was not given the reduced hours I needed as we were so short staffed. After I was moved into carts, there was only me and another guy for the whole week. I asked for the bare minimum hours they could grant me for a part timer in my availability sheet, yet for the first 4 weeks of the semester, I was given 34hrs a week instead of the 18-22 I asked for. Next two weeks were 28, then a 24.5hr week. Then finally, on the week OF midterms, I got what I wanted, 16.5hrs, but by this point, I had been so overworked during the first half of the semester and behind on my classes. My hours creeped back up for the last half of the semester but were more closer to what I wanted but so much time had passed that I didn’t have the time needed to catch up. This change only really occurred because we FINALLY got more hired cartmen, and I only got my hours as low as they were for midterms because I discretely threatened to quit if my requests for lower hours were not granted

For many, I am sure this amount of work while in school is something they can handle but for me, this was the very first semester working while taking classes and had to completely reshuffle to try to survive on both ends. Without a doubt, I should have quit the 3rd or 4th week of the semester after it was clear that my manager would continue disrespecting my time but I continued to hold on as I was told that we were about to get more help which did come a few weeks later than I hoped. I also stubbornly refused to give up my first job after such a painfully long search for one. I had fallen so behind in my classes that I had to drop two of them by Halloween as it was clear I could not catch up. And since I didn’t drop them sooner, those were weeks of work split between my classes that could have been invested into the two I kept. While my hours remained more tolerable at the end of the semester, family drama and a death of a grandmother made it harder to use what time I had left to finish well with my other two and I had to drop one last one at the end and will need to get an incomplete on my other and finish my final paper over the break.

On top of that, I have had to call in and show up a bit late for the sake of my work or my sleep deprivation finally got the better of me. This got me to accrue enough attendance points to be walking a knives edge now until next year when our points reset under fear of termination if I have to call in for any reason, if I have the audacity to get sick or be just a fraction of a bit late. I do not think I could feel anymore punished for daring to be a student with commitments while working there.

My manager is full aware of what over scheduling me had cost me academically. In her defense, she is really nice (like a mother) and appreciative of the hard work I put in, and I understand that she was put in a position where if I did not show up as much as she needed me to, the store could not survive. I do try my best to go above and beyond, to be the a shining example of the “legendary” customer service we try to aspire to have. I know everyone likes me there and several of our customers know me as well. I won’t know how much the management appreciates me as we do not practice employee of the month as we are too busy to bother with it, and my request to bring it back up a few months ago for the sake of moral seems to have been ignored. Maybe I will find out when I ask for a raise to help make up for what I had lost this semester and for the hard work I put in. Depending on how well that goes over, I will decide if I want to stay employed there, as I am at my wits end. I know we have an ethics hotline and I have debated calling them multiple times but never did out of fear that it would make things extremely awkward between me and my manager as I would at least try to remain on good terms with her.

I definitely should have headed the advice of one of my former workers before he left. “Don’t let the management push you around.” I didn’t understand what he meant back then, but I think I do now.

TLDR:
After everything, I wonder if there’s anything I can do beyond asking for a raise or quit, as I do feel owed something for being over-scheduled to the point that I needed to drop multiple classes; was led along that help would be hired sooner than it did; and being made to do something I didn’t sign up for; all the while trying to not complain, and work my hardest.",12Dec2020,1

Well... Yeah. Anyways my main issue is that I can't stop thinking about the B's he did. I feel like I deserve an apology, but I know he won't. Its honestly really infuriating and it makes me feel like I waisted my time.

199,"So I overheard my parents talking. My mom basically said that it enrages her that I am looking forward to study in another country. Mind you the this was something I worked my ass off for 4 years of High School with top grades and extracurriculars. Anyhow, she says that this is an act of narcissism and that I am full of myself for wanting to opt for a uni outside the country. She thinks that I think of myself as a big shot but that I am no better than her and that I ought to settle with studying in a public uni in the third world country I reside in. 

 She said that she wishes me to be ""dragged by life"" and that I fail miserably to ""learn my lesson"" (Whatever that means). It honestly feels to me like she plain just hates me for wanting better for myself. But maybe, I am wrong?

Is this normal parent behavior? What do you think is her motivation behind saying such horrible things?",12Dec2020,1

201,"Hello everyone! So a bit of backstory, the day after thanksgiving, my coworker was exposed to covid. Come December 4th, we find out and he gets tested, comes back positive. We all get tested as well since we’ve been in contact with him every day since he got exposed. Everyone’s including mine come back negative. Three days ago, on the 9th, I get a sore throat. I still have it and it hasn’t gotten better. Today, the 12th, I go to a clinic to get tested for strep. I get tested for that and for covid again. Everything negative and they’re gonna send my sample to the lab to get it checked there as well, so I’ll get another result in a few days. So I have two negative covid tests. My doctor tells me he’s pretty much positive I do have covid and the test just isn’t accurate yet because the symptoms are new. He wants me to quarantine for a week, so no work. I want to follow my doctors advice, but the fact that I got two tests that came back negative, and the only symptom I have is a sore throat, which can be a multitude of things, it doesn’t seem right to me. I don’t know what to do. Normally I’d just trust the doctor but this isn’t sitting right. Currently I plan on waiting until the lab test comes in, and then get another rapid that day for a newer result. What should I do?",12Dec2020,1

203,"This orange cat, who I found out today was a male cat named Simba, has been running around my neighborhood since November 2019. Then over the next seven months I've seen it in a distance pawing at the garbage in alleys, I honestly thought was a stray seeing how thin he was and with no collar. Finally comes onto my property August this year and I call the Humane Society to pick him up. A month later he's back in my driveway except he has a collar with a tag the Humane Society has given him when I surrendered him, which is not okay because local rules state you need a tag with your information on it or a chip. Plus the shelter holds the cat for three days and if they're not picked up they get adopted so that's telling that they cared enough to get him in three days time. I let the cat keep appearing on my porch from time to time. Eventually this past September we had a few days of cold so I set up a shelter for it too. I have been feeding him to get some weight on him. Eventually it starts snowing mid November, Simba still outside on my porch so I decide fudge it and bring him in,  him and pull all the ticks off him because he always seems to be covered in them. Within 12 hours he's clawing to be let out and I mean half hour non-stop crying to be let outside (I've had him put in a separate room because of my other male cat who is territorial). I try again a few days later and he craps on the floor and then wants to be let out again. Then I try a third time, this time he starts peeing on the walls, I assume either to assert dominance over my other cat or to get my attention to let him out. I mean the begging to be let out doesn't stop so I let him out once again, and every time I try ignoring it he either pooped on the floor or started peeing on the walls. He's been showing up more often and often sleeping on the porch which is chill with me. However I notice Simba is now sneezing more and occasionally wheezing which is concerning to me so I called the Humane Society this Wednesday to try and get in contact with Simba's owners, I explain what's going on read the tag number from the collar because thankfully I took a picture of it before the owner removed it back in September, they explain that Simba's owner who lives on the same street as me has an issue with him escaping from the house and that they would contact the owner to pick him up. Y'all I kept that poor thing trapped on my porch for five hours waiting for Simba's owner to come pick him up. Eventually I had to not keep him trapped on the porch because I do not have a box for him and in the five hours being on my porch he pooped on my porch twice, owner never came. Thursday he isn't there. Today Simba is back I call again asking if I can get their contact information to call them directly, Humane Society explains that for legal reasons they cannot even give me Simba's owners phone number.  They say they simply try contacting the owner again and give them my phone number. I never even got a phone call. I'm really unsure what to do, this cat has runny stools and seems to be getting a respiratory infection or something. I'm feeling so guilty but I can't take this cat in because my cat and Simba are being territorial towards one another. But I cannot let Simba potentially die on my porch like this. The Humane Society also said they are not accepting any cats at the moment either.",12Dec2020,1
204,So I work 40 hours a week currently 10 hour shifts. I ask my sister who dropped out of college doesn't have a job and spends most of her day sleeping gaming occasionally cooking and watching whatever the fuck on YouTube to do the dishes and do some of the house work I'm to tired or in various amounts of pain to do I mean its pretty fair I did all the crap when she was living dorm life or going to highschool because it was too stressful on her even though I was in a difficult college program that is also stressful because my cousin doesn't do jack shit around the house other then complain and keep her room clean even though you know she gets to live here rent free and you know only has to take care of herself doesn't pitch in other then screaming and yelling and sticking her fucking nose in business it doesn't belong in(shes also married and has a full time job and her husband has army retirement and va benefits so they could easily move the fuck out). Reasons I haven't moved out are pretty clear im a full time student and I need to stay on my uncles health insurance because of chronic illness. I also injured myself badly enough doing my last job which if you've seen my posts you know what that was so yeah. Today my cousin stuck her nose in shit acting like its her job to get in-between what me and my sister do again most of what I ask isn't a lot and I do fun stuff with my sister all the fucking time not kidding. But cousin bitch instead of you know going directly to the person she wanted to do a job went through my sister who didn't say jack for something she as a person with two legs can do. The job you ask drag a trash can from the side of the house into the back yard so its more convient for her to use. I'm sorta pissed because her excuse for not asking me directly is im out of the house a lot which as an adult with a car that I own and pay for is my fucking right I also picked up the grocery list with my fucking hard earned money you know stuff I work for but I picked up stuff she complained about not having. She also has a car and a higher paying job then mine so she could also hypothetically pick up groceries she also only works 36 hours a week so she has more time then I do but she never leaves her fucking room unless she goes out with my aunt or her mother in law a woman who has probably given me a form of ptsd or made what I had worse so fuck me I dont ask for much.,12Dec2020,1

Some time ago I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/walnutcreek/comments/ilwvrx/recommendations_for_family_law_attorney/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) to help out a family friend who was going through a difficult separation.

This woman immigrated to the US from Peru after marrying a US citizen because she fell in love. They had a child together and the situation took an ugly turn when the now ex started to display some undesirable behavior in the relationship (I am not a 100% familiar with all the details).

She ended up leaving and moved to a place of her own, starting from scratch all by herself, and eventually custody of the child was awarded to her. Her mother traveled from Peru the minute it was feasible due to COVID to help her out and keep her company as she was all by herself here.

Today, out of the sudden, her mother suffered an aneurysm and is in very critical condition in the ICU. I can only begin to imagine how difficult it must be for her who is all alone and does not speak English. Not to mention, the financial and legal implications that this situation brings. 

I'm not really sure how to help her out. 
I guess my hope is that someone can shine a light on how or what I can do to help her out from far away, especially with the paperwork and finances. 

Any ideas? What would you all recommend?

215,"TL;DR: Auto Shop left interlock wiring in car and told me it was removed, now causing trouble with my car starting/battery getting a charge. (I think)


This is weird and I’m not sure what I can do.

Start off by saying I had to have an interlock (dui) on my car late last year, and it was removed late last year as well, and it was installed on my 2020 Mazda3. The men at the shop took a long time installing it, as the car was new and they weren’t used to it, however it was installed and later removed by the same shop. It’s been quite a few months from then and I had to jumpstart my car, which is weird for a brand new car, it started and I had no new issues the following few months, assuming I had just left a light on. 

Few months later, my car was running just fine until randomly one day,  I try to get into my car for work and it’s dead. Like dead, dead. I had a friend come by to jump and it was hooked up for about 20 minutes before the battery was charged enough for me to turn the car on. Which was so strange, as I had just driven it the night before.

 I go to work after it being on for an hour and I go to check on it about an hour before my shift is over (12 hr shift), car is dead AGAIN. Got jumped, left it on about an hour, drove it home and it was fine. No dash lights or any issues. Turned on again for work the next day and drove fine. 

I check on it periodically throughout the shift and it turns on 3 hours later, no issue. About mid shift, I go to check and it’s sputtering to turn on and finally turns over but then includes a battery light on dash and screen says “no charge to battery, contact dealer”. I get it to the dealer next day and few days later they call me and tell me that the interlock wiring and barriers and all that is STILL in the car causing a weak charge and causing the car to stop turning over.

I called the car shop and of course they tell me a ton of stuff that it could be other than the junk still left in the car, to which I listen of course and understand but also doubt. Regardless if it was their stuff interrupting the charge or not they STILL left foreign shit in my car after I was told it was removed. 

Now, I’m having to pay my dealership to remove the wiring that I was told was already removed and I’m wondering if I have a case here to get reimbursed by the auto shop or anything at all? Possibly the company the interlock is from? Because the interlock company assigns people the different places near them that they work with that specifically do the interlock stuff. It’s not just random, so they would know the shop that I’m referring to. 

Long post I know, but if anyone has any idea I’m grateful to know of anything I can do, or if I should even bother. As since covid year has been rough, money-wise, now I’m having to pay almost $500 to get something removed from my car, that I thought was already gone, I don’t think I have the extra hella dollars it costs for a lawyer.

Overall I feel like I can read a person like a book by just puzzling them together in a way?

Im an out of state student at a university on a scholarship to only pay in-state tuition. In order to progress in my major there’s one specific class I need to take which isn’t online, only blended (its a production course). Right now i’ve registered for next semester but i’m hesitant on going because money is tight and i’m worried about covid (my only way to school will be through the subway which is often packed). My first route would be to try and be as safe as possible and get the semester done and come back home for the summer.

My second route would to be going to my local community college and getting a certificate relating to my major over the spring and summer semesters. I would save a lot of money by not needing to pay rent, it would be a lot safer because I wouldn’t have to commute or be in class and  I would be able to work full time at the job I have now. I’ve talked to advisors at my current university and my scholarship will be safe if i defer my enrollment. 

Now logically the second option is best because i’ll save money and be safer but staying at home is slowly killing me. Like most college students, after being away it’s hard to lose your freedom but I feel i’m not far from my breaking point and this is the biggest reason i’m considering not staying. I feel stuck because everyone i’ve asked has told me to stay but i feel they could be biased and i would really appreciate any objective opinions.

Thoughts?

234,"I use this program called Schoology, where teachers create and link assignments for students to complete. If you complete or don’t complete the work, the marks it as so on assignment page. My parents know this and regularly check my Schoology, but for the past 2 weeks I’ve stopped doing most if not all of my work and my parents no longer check, I have no energy and all I can do as lie down in bed or look at my phone.

237,"Two months ago and my loving girlfriend had a bit of an issue. Her roommate was good friends with someone I used to hang out with quite a bit. Long story short the guy is a total asshole, quite frankly I don’t think I have ever disliked someone so much. The guy and his buddies stayed over at their apartment for two nights while on layover. My GF expressed to me that she didn’t like the guy and didn’t want him at her house. That night he got everyone extremely drunk and made mixed drinks throughout the evening. My girlfriend expressed to me how drunk she was at the time. He said he wanted to kiss her and she was in a place of vulnerability because we are in a very long distance relationship, she kissed him back. She’s moving here soon and we’ve been together for eight months. She gave the guy a blow job for about 5 to 10 minutes and then told him to finish on his own. The problem is that she seemed to leave out the blow job and only told me that they kissed. I found out a few days ago from the guy that she blew him. I’ve cut ties with the guy but I am still So in love with her. I want to marry her. She has cried and cried over this and begged for my forgiveness. She says she doesn’t even know why she did it. She finds the guy very unattractive as well. We are both extremely honest with each other all the time and this just seemed to be a very bad decision on her part. How should I handle this? It’s hurting me so much and we have talked about it repeatedly. She tells me that she’ll never do anything like that again and that she never has done anything like that in the past.

238,"Hello guys, I (16f) and am in high school. I go to a local public school, and my older brother (18m) drives us to school. This year has been stressful due to the global issue and online school has put me though the ringer. I failed atleast 2 core classes and 1 elective class. 

My school does this ridiculous thing where if you have an empty block, and a teacher has not alot of students in an entry-level class that lines up, theyll just shove you in there for funzies. With that said, I was placed into a Law class (which I loved and got an A the entire semester) and a Marketing class. 

The Marketing class was basically an Economic class (which is required, and I took last year) but its run by a woman who does not teach. She has to have some kind of concentration deficit, because she never stays on topic. She never actually teaches anything and rambles for a majority of the 1.5 hour class. Like imagine signing up for a math class but all the teacher talks about is old romance novels about math teachers. Anyway this teacher sucks, I hate the class, I don't learn anything, and I've explained this to my parents multiple times. 

My mom seems to be a bit understanding, but my dad has a rule that we can't drop classes. Which I think is a dumbass rule, but its supposed to teach ""responsibility"" but it really just makes me dislike my dad and not want to talk to him about my problems. It also really stresses me out wayyy more than necessary because he also has a zero failing rule. If I fail a class, I get in trouble. Get my phone taken away, get my driving privileges taken away, etc. I think these rules are dumb because nobody is paying for this hs education of mine, its no prepy private school, and not meeting these requirements makes me feel like shit and a waste of space. Also I have 2 older siblings that have both never failed a class (my bro and a sister thats graduated hs) being the first one to fail a class was big enough (""your sister never failed any classes in hs""). The fact that I've failed 3 classes in one semester makes me so ashamed that I want to crawl into a hole and never leave.

So this brings us to my current problem. This class only meets in person for me once a week. Last week, I got so stressed I had a panic attack and had to excuse myself to the restroom. I decided right then and there I couldn't keep taking this class. I hated it so much it made me not want to go to school. I got in contact with my counselor and changed the class next semester. I don't know how to talk to my dad about it. He wants me to get my grade up in a class I'm not even taking anymore. I don't know how to bring up the fact that i feel inadequate and stupid. I've argued with him and my mom about (dropping the class) for 5 months but it always ends in me being shut down or sent to my room. I feel like an asshole for changing my schedule without permission but I also feel like we should have seen this one coming. 

After my panic attack I also decided to go back to therapy. I feel like Im going crazy. I don't think my dad knows how much that class effects me. I feel like i have no time or room to breathe. 

This is also not the first class this has happened to. For my freshman and sophomore year I took engineering. I didn't want to take engineering, I don't plan on being an engineer, never have. I hated the class and the teacher. I was still forced to finish the year. 

To clarify: there is no parent requirement to switch out classes. My parents just try very hard to be involved in my schooling. They know what classes I'm taking and what assignments im missing and even if ive been counted absent. 

So I guess my question is: did I do the right thing by dropping the class ""behind my parents back"" and how should i bring this up to them? Should I be feeling bad about my choice? 

Almost any advice would be helpful here. Thank you.",12Dec2020,1

I just focus on homework and I want so badly to be outgoing, go places, have friendships. But I have none of that. I’m in bed on a Friday night. Picking off my freshly-coated nail polish.

Waited 5 days with no update, so I messaged the seller (cossky, 98.3%). They replied pretty fast, and said, “Hello, about this costume, the factory are making it asap. Normally the tailor needs about 15 days to make it. Hope you can understand. About the shipping, Logistics providers have increased freight,due to the effects of the Coronavirus,so you need to pay an extra US$15 for your order. Then we will ship it via DHL for you. 
Can you accept that?
If yes,please pay it by this link: (insert the eBay link they sent here) 
Waiting for your reply
Best regards.” 

Why are they asking for a second shipping fee *after* I asked? Is it so they can cover the cost of having the costume made? They supposedly offer services to have the costume custom made, so I assume they’re making the costume, but I can’t tell because I ordered by the size chart they provided.

246,"Started a new job as an air duct cleaner bout 4 or 5 months ago. i trained for 90 days. training was basically them (the owner and manager) putting me with one of the techs and telling them to show me the ropes. But of course I was never allowed to get hands on experience, only watch, because if I fucked something up, then the tech would be the one liable and would have to pay. 

and we are talking about technical shit, btw. taking apart mother boards on HVAC units, pulling the blower motor out (fan + motor), cleaning it, then putting it back in and wiring the motherboards back together again. I had to fight tooth and nail to be allowed to do three, maybe four motherboards before i was sent out on my own. so in other words, I was sent on my own to do a technical ass job with almost no training.

So i've been making a lot of mistakes. Then the manager gets on my ass about it super hard. in the past 10 jobs i've done i've had 8 callbacks where other techs had to go and fix something i messed up. one or two of those have been because of me not being careful enough or double checking my work. i admit that and owned up to it. but the other like 80 percent of the callbacks have been due to inexperience.

so my manager, who is extremely short tempered anyway, has been getting more and more frustrated. its at the point now where he openly mocks me, shows disdain, and completely disrespects me. For example, today I went in to the office to hand in a check and some cash from some jobs.

I did a job for 189, was given 200 in cash, and the extra 11 dollars was for me as a tip. So i told this to the manager. he had attitude and said that he didn't have change, he's not a store. i should have stopped at 7/11 or a gas station before i came to the office ""but i guess that didn't register with you"". He knows I have ADHD which affects my executive functioning. ( **Executive function** and self-regulation skills are the mental processes that enable us to plan, focus attention, remember instructions, and juggle multiple tasks successfully.) 

That hurt pretty bad. i feel stupid a lot of the times because i struggle with doing simple things that most other people can do easily. so that sucked. and he knows i have adhd and i have those struggles.

He also asked me a question, i can't remember what exactly but lets say it was something like ""zach, were those checks from yesterday or the day before"" and i couldn't remember (adhd affects short term, working memory as well) and he was like ""I DONT KNOW I DONT KNOW I DONT KNOW"" in a very... dumb/retarded sounding voice.

those were 2 things out of like 10 that happened in the maybe 10 minutes i was there to give him the checks and cash. its constant. i cant ask a question or damn near be around him without him being extremely hostile and disrespectful.

after the ""i dont know..."" and the ""register with you"" and 10,000 other snide, foul comments he's made, i've had enough and i've decided im going to confront him about it.

247,"This is kind of a weird advice request because it’s about video games, but my online friend group is such a huge part of my life that I’d really appreciate help on resolving this. 

So my friends and I play a multiplayer RPG called FFXIV and one component of it is something called “savage raiding” (aka just hardcore fights). They require a lot of time and effort to do (weeks, sometimes months) and a very important part of it is coming prepared to do the fight. The universally agreed upon “raid etiquette” for the fights are “watch a video guide (don’t have to memorize it, just get a feel for what’s ahead), wear the correct gear for your class, have a fairly good idea on the ability rotation for your class, and bring the fights food and potions for a health &amp; damage boost”. Each fight requires a party of 8 people so within our larger friend group we have a few different 8 person parties. I am in what I’ll call Group A while the person I’m having a bit of trouble with is in Group B. My group has been doing savage raids for about a year and a half now and Group B just started about 2 months ago so people from my group usually sub into Group B to help with content. From running with Group B, a few of us have noticed that they’re able to do the mechanics correctly, but don’t necessarily put out the amount of damage required to complete the fight without people from our group. More specifically, there are a few members in that group that don’t follow the raid etiquette and are showing up missing one or all of the things mentioned above. 

A new raid tier dropped earlier this week so the topic of bringing the correct gear came into the conversation. While we (Group A) addressed it to all of the raiding groups including our own, one person from Static B got very upset that this got brought up. The other members of Group B were really receptive to the advice and took it with open arms, but the one person (I’ll just call them C) took it super personally (... and also went on a 7 minute rant regarding the matter). We just dropped the topic because we didn’t want to upset them any more and at the end of the day it’s just a game, but a few people from Group B approached us afterwards and said that they were frustrated that C was holding them back. 

My group and I don’t know how to approach the situation without coming off as an asshole. The reality of it is that if C maintains not following raid etiquette, they’re really screwing over their team. Under normal circumstances everyone can afford to make mistakes and still complete the fights. If someone is underperforming, another person has to perform better than usual to cover for it. If C is underperforming (which they are because they are extremely undergeared and also not doing what’s needed of their class’s role), then their party members can’t afford to make mistakes on account of them. We want to relay that to C in a way where it gets through to them, but also doesn’t make them feel bad, but it feels impossible when they lash out at the first sign of a suggestion. We also thought we could phrase it in a way where they could come to us rather than us pushing it, but they didn’t like that either. At this point both our group and Group B are really frustrated and don’t know what to do about C. We can’t (or don’t want to at least) give them the ultimatum of “just try to meet the bare minimum or you can’t be a part of the group” either. It just sucks and I don’t know what to do.",12Dec2020,1

I have been in school for 4 years and have worked my ass off extensively for this Bachelors degree but this last semester really kicked my ass. One of my finals it was either make or break my grade. I really tried. But I’m more than 95% sure that I did not make it enough to pass that class. The thing is my family and friends already know I’m graduating and have made plans and pictures have been taken already. If I don’t pass this class I’m more than sure I’m gonna have to take it this coming semester. The thing is that with this whole COVID thing there’s not an actual Graduation but just a virtual ceremony and not only that but I won’t be getting my diploma until I pay off my account balance.

It started when she left for an extended period of time (about 3 weeks). While she was gone I started having a lot of dreams about her (not necessarily sexual but definitely romantic) and realized that I was developing feelings that went way beyond just really missing a friend. She came back yesterday and I’m wondering if I should tell her how I feel or just try to ignore it and move on. 

I feel like I need to tell her even to just get it out so I can move on if she doesn’t feel the same way. For context, I left for two months (August, September) and she was one of the main people who convinced me to move back in and seemed to take it the hardest when I left. I think we are pretty close and have the kind of friendship where we make fun of each other a lot but can talk about serious topics easily. She brought me a rock from when she was on her trip. I don’t collect rocks and I don’t think she gave anyone else anything from her trip. I’m not sure if she feels the same way but I think it’s possible.

I’m not super concerned with the fall out if she doesn’t feel the same way because I think she’s the type of person who would understand it’s not the end of the world. I am wondering though what people think the best way to go about this is. Should I just directly tell her how I feel or if I should I be more subtle about it or even tell her at all?

We have had our ups and downs as far as boundaries are concerned as well, as I made it very clear from the beginning that I was not interested in a relationship outside of friendship with this man and sometimes that was difficult for him to deal with, specifically when he saw me in relationships with other people that weren’t going well. This caused a lot of tension at times, and forced separation between the two of us was usually the best solution.

This man also struggles with many addictions and health issues that he ignores. He makes $70,000 a year in an excellent job as an engineer, but he’s a chain smoker, a power drinker, a hoarder to some extent, and a diabetic with uncontrolled blood sugar so dangerous that he asked his doctor if a human could actually learn to live with blood sugar levels over 600 (where his tend to stay). His seemingly Devil May care attitude about his health and mortality is something that has caused a lot of problems between us as well, as he will come to me for advice but then feel as if I’m over bearing when I encouraged him to follow it. I will admit, I struggle with addictions as well, I’m no angel myself. I know that I can be bossy and bitchy and come across as a know it all. These are my issues and I own them and do constant daily work to fine tune my outward projections.

Several times over the last year there have been multiple incidences where my friend and I will end up in a disagreement because of his completed anxiety, paranoia, general aggression, unwillingness to get out of the past, his habit of testing people, his jealousy and possessiveness, etc. etc. During these times his general course of action is to blow up in my face, send me several short novels filled with his rage, anger, and unforgiveness, and then block me for days at a time. I have let them know that this hurts me because it feels to me as if only his opinion is what is important as I don’t get a chance to speak my opinion in the conversation once I’m blocked. This is happened to the point where I almost feel as if this person is not even worth it as a friend. And then I immediately feel remorse for saying that because he is my BEST FRIEND And I understand that he is a very lonely individual with a very low self-esteem, and that I am a person that he feels very comfortable with being himself which is a good thing for his mental health. There was a time when the good outweighed the bad but now it seems to be that the bad is quickly outweighing the good and I don’t know if I should end this friendship for good or try to help him see that we have to compromise here.

263,"I'm 24 and I've been struggling with awful mental health problems for most of my life. I've been really struggling as of late, I failed a course at college, and I've been neglecting my physical health a great deal. 

My family does have a big history with depression and runs through the veins of both sides of the family pretty severely. I would say I'm suicidal to a degree but its never been an acted on urge. I've been getting worse and worse as the day goes on, and I'm really upset and miserable. I've been terribly unmotivated on top of all this.

I need some goddamn help and even being thrown in a psych ward sounds good. I really might hurt myself and I'm fucking scared because I feel like if my mental state does get worse I will.

Hey, I am completely lost and have no idea what to do with my life at this point. I posted this on [r/ApplyingToCollege](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/) and [r/USF](https://www.reddit.com/r/USF/) but it was removed.

I applied to USF early decision and believed I had a decent shot at making it. I'm in-state and live in the same city as the school.

My GPA was probably the thing that held me back, as it was only a 2.6 unweighted. Weighted it was a 4.3. I got a 1430 on my SAT, superscored. I was in my school's band as well. I did not include my community service hours as they have not been verified yet, but I have over 200. I also was in FBLA and won districts for my category Sophomore year, but didn't include that, and know I feel like I should have. I have taken 6 AP classes and passed them all, and am taking 7 this year.

I knew that I had no chance of making it into most colleges, so I applied to USF as it was my local state school. I knew that my GPA was pretty low for the school, but I thought I had a chance with my SAT and with the AP classes I've taken.

I checked my status and was devastated to see that I was denied. I applied with Information Technology as my intended major.

I have no idea where to go from this point. I know everyone will say that the best route is community college and then to transfer, but I come from a culture where that would be unacceptable. My parents would quite literally disown me, which is why I haven't told them yet. I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like a complete failure.

I was hoping that someone would have any advice on where to go from here. Maybe re-applying or going through the appeals process. I feel like I should have submitted an essay trying to justify why I did so poorly. I had to deal with a lot of problems that I didn't seek out help for partly because of my culture. Also, I fell into a massive depression around the beginning of the pandemic, as my family's business needed me to help and I really fell behind on school.

Honestly, I don't have anyone to talk to about this. My parents would get unbelievably mad, and my friends would probably think less of me for getting rejected from a school that should have been easy to get into. I feel like the dumbest piece of shit in the world right now. I know it's my fault for screwing up earlier in high school, and now I'm facing the consequences. I'm honestly just so done with everything right now. I don't want to do this anymore.

I would really appreciate and help or advice. Thank you for reading this.",12Dec2020,1

267,"My friend of 2 years has been married to a guy for 10 years. In the 2 years I’ve known them, their marriage has been so toxic. He’s an alcoholic, and has some other issues that require him to be on meds which when he doesn’t take, he gets quite violent and unpredictable. I’d be talking to her on the phone and I’ll hear him yelling in the background and it’ll turn into a full on screaming match sometimes. Then, about 6 months ago she calls me crying because he had gotten another DUI, and tells me about a series of physical fights they had. She sent me a picture of a pretty severe bruise on her hip she got from him throwing a chair at her (she’s told me she also gets physical with him). Her parents, other friends and I all tried and tried again to get it through to her that it’s just not good for her, but she’s feels it’s her duty (as his wife) to stay with him. They came to an agreement that he should go away to his brothers for a couple months to take a break and for him to sort himself out.  She was doing so good with him gone, and seemed to be in a much better place. Well now he’s back, and she tells me things are good, but she does not seem “good” at all. She’s not in a good place, and isn’t talking to me half as much as we were when he was gone. Tonight on our 15 minute long phone call (we used to talk for at least an hour), she told me how she’s super pissed at her parents because they “hate” her husband. This has come pretty much out of nowhere, where her dad is concerned at least because they have always gotten along so well. It worries me to see that she’s isolating herself from her family now in favour of her husband who clearly is not stable. 
If you have read this long, thank you so much! I would be so grateful for any advice you have on how I should deal with this? (I’m worried if I’m too assertive she just will stop telling me things that are happening and I’m the only one she tells so I can’t lose this line of communication) I just don’t know what to do anymore... it’s exhausting and painful to see her struggle with this :(",12Dec2020,1

I don’t mind it on a daily basis but every Friday at the end of the day or in the evening there’s an email from management complaining about the drama in the workplace, threatening to make changes to classroom placements (it’s a childcare centre), and expressing disappointment in small or large things. In this current email they vaguely said something about people not being committed and  “you know who you are”and that those employees should consider leaving. 

I feel that this is very toxic and does not promote a happy workplace. Every single Friday I go home happy and then receive the email and get stressed for the whole weekend. What should / can I do? I can’t really leave as I need a job close to home and don’t have many qualifications.

270,"I had a casual thing with a guy about 2.5 years ago, it lasted about a month and ended because he didn’t want to be serious, I did, but he was a jerk about it, made me feel like an object. Let’s call him Bird.

Anyways fast forward to now, I’ve worked on myself, finished school, entered my field and I’m ready to get out there again.

I happen to start talking to a guy and it’s going great- but I realize he’s friends on IG with Bird. Is it a coincidence? Is there a deeper plot at play? Who knows lol. They are eerily similar, down to age, ethnicity, program of study, and physique. Not unusual to have friends similar to you thoug I’ve done a pros and cons list, would appreciate feedback. 

Pros: 
•Keeps me entertained during covid
•Nice to talk to males (all female friends)
•Need male interaction (2.5 year hiatus from dating, I hate the dating apps and they’ve done nothing for me thus far)
•Would like to enter the dating scene again

Cons: 
•May be trying to game me (is Bird’s friend, they’re plotting on me)
•Too analogous to bird (I may be getting throw backs because they’re so similar)
•Getting triggered by experience with Bird (all this thinking back to that situation makes me remember how inadequate it made me feel)",12Dec2020,1

272,"I'm in my late 20s and I know people are going to say I'm a horrible person but yes...I am trying to break off a friendship I've outgrown from my middle school years.

I'm growing apart from someone who I was very close friends with since middle school and she constantly wants to facetime me every week and talk for hours and we literally have nothing in common anymore and I don't enjoy our conversations either (she will keep me on facetime for 3-4 hours to talk about her own interests) and i just feel like our friendship has run its course.

She is unemployed and still lives with her parents who do everything for her and I work a very stressful and time consuming full time job (I am also in school for my masters) and am starting a family with my husband. I have tried telling her that I'm too busy to talk or hang out and that due to the stressful nature of my job, I want to be left alone on my days off. She still hasn't accepted that and will text, call and email me multiple times a week and even send letters to my house telling me that she misses me. I don't mind having a short conversation over text or phone but she always asks over and over, when can we facetime, every time I answer her when she reaches out. And she can't take no for an answer. And then I'm stuck facetiming with her for several hours while she talks about her interests and it's a one-sided conversation. Whenever I talk to her about my adult problems, it goes right over her head. She has never had a real job or paid bills in her life.

In addition to us growing apart, I've noticed she is pretty needy and immature and has sometimes made racist comments about my husband or other ethnic groups who aren't white in a joking manner. I told her it offended me but I don't really think she understood. Her parents sheltered her a lot growing up too and I just...idk I feel like she just repeats whatever they tell her.

273,"Please bare with me for this is a longer post, I’ve also rarely posted anywhere on Reddit so I apologize in advance if I’m a little off.

I work for a care home with adults who have autism and behaviour. The autism ranges from each individual, but they are all in the home for a reason: they need 24/7 care and support from dedicated staff.

I’ve been at the home for a little over 2 years now, and have reported several allegations of neglect and what I consider to be severe abuse, as well as sexual harassment towards myself from other staff, to my direct manager. None of these allegations have been handled appropriately, and I’m growing increasingly suspicious that they were not even followed up with and essentially thrown away to cover things up. 

To paint a picture, each individual (4) have their own apartment style room with a bathroom, bedroom and living/dining area, and there is a small kitchen/sitting area where staff are mainly.

Regarding neglect, the home is not up to an appropriate living standard whatsoever. I had taken it upon myself to patch holes, repaint, and scrub walls in order to prep for this. This is NOT my job, I did it because it needed to be done and I care. The home is a mess, several individuals living spaces have feces and other substances STUCK to the walls (I had also found a pile of BM under one of their mattresses), I had cleaned all of this up myself of course over the span of two days with no help from other staff. The neglect, in my opinion, is mainly from staff. But that being said, the manager is aware and no changes have been made. This is now a management problem.

Regarding sexual harassment, I have reported 3 male staff members for such. During my latest reporting (again to my home’s manager), I had actually reported 2 staff at once - one of which was much more worrisome and pestering than the other. The latter individual was not mentioned to HR by my manager. When I had met with my manager and HR to discuss this, I had asked “what about the other person?” to which my manager responded “they’re on a leave” and HR had asked who was it, what happened, etc, implying that they had not been informed of this individual and my report prior to  me saying something. Leave or not, this in digital was still calling and texting me even though we had not worked together for several months - this was still a large concern.

Lastly, abuse. In may of 2020 I had assisted an individual with their hygiene routine (shower) on a Friday. Come Monday, I had again taken lead on this (I was off on the weekend). I had discovered a massive black and blue bruise/cut on their bottom/thigh area. It broke my heart. This was not an accident. I immediately asked other staff if they knew of this, if reports were done, etc. Nobody knew a thing. This was not reported and kept hidden. I sent a photo, IR, and body check form (paper) via text and email to my home manager. I had originally checked off “mark, not suspicious” on the IR for I never wanted to imagine any of my coworkers or people in this line of work would ever be capable of such a thing. I had later come to my sense and phoned my manager telling them I want to change this to an abuse allegation. I was not told to write a new IR or take any further action to rectify such. I was told I would not be informed of any following investigation related to the matter as it was confidential, which is understandable. But what’s not understandable is how the coworker who had done this was never laid off or reprimanded for anything, meanwhile staff at other homes are being fired for “shoving” and racist remarks. Further, and I’m not sure how true this is but I do believe it, the staff responsible allegedly told another “the manager covered for me” regarding the abuse.
I know exactly what happened that weekend. I’m not a dumb girl, I’m intuitive and can place the pieces together more easily than people give me credit for. This was excessive forces at the very least due to staff not following protocol, not to mention the fact that there was no paperwork done. Side note, I also have reason to believe my manager has an inappropriate relationship with this staff member, putting them in higher up positions over me, having private meetings constantly at the home (where I have also heard them saying negative and frankly false remarks about myself), etc.

Currently, there has been a bit of a shit show at this home the past few months. 3 (especially one of them) of the most kind and hardworking staff members were laid off due to allegations of bullying from other staff members who had come together to file this report in the hopes of getting these people fired. These allegations were false. These staff members reporting have been the ones reported to the direct manager for neglect, abuse, and more. But they took their report higher up, hence why something was actually done. These staff members were laid off for 1.5 months. Now, they’re back and not happy. The main individual who had reported these staff members (who has been reported frequently for all of the above) has now been laid off for the time being due to allegations of harassment, and nothing more. It’s likely they’ll be back. 

Basically, I know what the right thing to do is, but I’m scared. I feel that the timing isn’t good and things won’t be taken seriously. This will throw the entire home for a loop. I believe several staff and my manager need to be fired or removed to a different location, at the very least. I’m worried what with everything going on, these allegations again will not be taken seriously if I report it to someone above my manager. I’m also worried that these allegations may seem petty. I am, after all, accusing my manager of covering up a severe abuse allegation amongst other allegations of neglect. I’m also worried I may be essentially ostracized at work if it comes to the attention of certain staff that I reported these to a higher manager.

My question is, should I wait until this current instance is over? Has anybody been in any situation similar and have any advice for me? I’m a young woman in my early 20’s, and have never had to experience something like this before. But the people I care for deserve a voice, and I wish to lend my own.

Thank you all in advance!

274,"Might not be the best sub for this question, but I'm honestly curious about it, and I would like to start this off by saying that I by no means asked for money in this situation, I had never gone with my mom with the intention of joining in on her gambling tonight... I just wanted a chicken sandwhich from the gas station 🤷‍♀️

Anyway, onto the actual question. So tonight my mom was going into town, and she asked me if I wanted to go with her, I've been having a craving for a chicken sandwhich for a while now, so I said I would. We go into town and she decided to stop by the casino instead of going into town (I don't even remember why she wanted to go into town to begin with tbh) and she decided to throw a 20$ at me, I didn't really care about gambling, I don't really find it that fun, but she told me to play at the machine beside her so I did, lost it, whatever. So we went and got food, and got ready to leave, *she* decided to stop at a new machine and play again.

Once again, I'm playing on my phone (I had something I had to do for my group on a mobile game, so that was my focus), and she decided to throw another 20$ at me, hossed at me to go sit down at another machine and put it in, so I did, wasn't really paying a lot of atte for to it because I was playing on my phone, but evidently, I went into free spins and won 244$. My mom has a bad habit of doing this, which is why I've finally decided to ask what others think about it...

Was it wrong of me to only give her the 40$ back and keep the rest? She demanded the full amount, or at least half back, and threw a huge shit fit about it when I refused, but that's where I get confused at... I never *asked* her for anything, I hadn't wanted to gamble, that wasn't why I went with her. I did win the money on my own though, I feel kinda torn about whether it should matter or not. I mean she always does this to me, I rarely want to gamble, because it's a losing battle, but she'll give me money and then demand everything I won. Usually I wouldn't bother arguing back, but tonight hasn't been a good one and I didn't feel like being bullied or harassed out of it.

My friends would tell me that I wasn't in the wrong for it, but I want genuine outsiders opinions on this (no, not asking for drama like another subreddit dishes out, I just want to know what other people would think.)

I mean I don't know if this would be considered advice? It'd help when moving forward and how to react in the future, I don't know if this is normal or if I should fight it more often. I mean I feel torn because yeah, it was her money, but at the same time, she's one of those people that will mess up while ordering something and then turn around and rampage at the store and demand discounts or full refunds, or even the manager over stupid mistakes done on her part so... I don't know whether I should act differently in the future or if it was an alright decision.

My friends are prone to taking my side, which is why I wanted advice and outlooks from other people on the matter.",12Dec2020,1
275,Im going to college next year and have narrowed my choices down to Temple University and York College of PA.

276,"I’m angry, annoyed, frustrated, and confused. 

Here’s the story:

I dated a guy for a couple of weeks before breaking up with him. He was manipulative and controlling all throughout our relationship.

He wanted me to text him if I was going somewhere (out to the mall, work, etc) or even if I was going to sleep. He even wanted me to text him when I was going to be back home (or when I was able to text him) and if I was able to text while I was out. 

He sent me photos of his ex and screenshots of their messages (I believe without her consent).

When we broke up, he continued to ask me (more like demand) why we broke up. I told him it just wasn’t working out, and we would be better as friends. 

This is the situation that makes me want to block him:

Three days ago, I answered an anonymous (the anonymous part is important and will come into play later) question on my Tellonym. It said, “Is there any of your exes that you’d ever consider getting back with?”
I answered with a simple no. 

He messaged me yesterday, stating that he was sorry we weren’t chatting as much, and that he was going to bed. I said okay and told him to have a good night. 

Almost an hour later he messaged me with a screenshot of the question (and my answer) and basically said, “This is what prompted me to message you. I wish I hadn’t asked in the first place. I’m glad to know where I stand by you.”

I’m unbelievably angry and creeped out. 

Angry because he has the audacity to be angry at me for answering a simple question of his (I did not know it was him at the time) and that he just can’t seem to take no for an answer. 

I have told him I do not want to get back together with him, and I’m a lesbian. 

I’m creeped out because he went onto my Tellonym anonymously so I wouldn’t know it was him and lie to him to not make him upset (he knows I worry about his mental health, and I don’t want to make him upset). 

I considered blocking him a long time ago, but I was so worried about hurting him (I’m definitely not anymore) that I didn’t. 

Should I block him?",12Dec2020,1

I need help. I don't know what kind of help, I suppose I just need someone to listen. My life is hell right now. And I don't really have anyone to talk to. That's why I'm here. If this subreddit requires a question for a post to stay up, I suppose I could ask, ""how can I cope"". 

I'm a healthcare worker in a hospital. For obvious reasons, it's been whiplash and half trying to deal with everything, and it keeps getting worse day by day. We originally had 2 wards sectioned off for virus patients. We now have 8, after having to move patients around to open up new wards for new virus patients. And it keeps getting worse with no end in sight.

I'm supposed to be graduating this month, finally, with my associates. Everything has been winding up in preparation for finals and graduation amid the pandemic, and stress levels are at an all time high.

My parents, instead of being happy when I told them I was graduating this month, got angry that I wasn't getting the degree they thought I should get. Instead of being happy for my accomplishment, they went off about how I don't want the higher degree enough to get it, how I'm just lazy and will need to go back later to get the higher degree. They started comparing me with my aunt, who has no degree, is an addict, and lives by mooching off other people. I am no longer proud of my accomplishment. 

The worst thing, though, is that my boyfriend, the love of my life, decided to leave me. With everything going on, my stress levels got too high and I became more snappy and combative than normal, and he decided he didn't want to deal with that. And he left. He was my rock, my support, and voice of reason. And now he's gone. And it's my fault.

I have a grand total of 3 ""friends"", which includes my now-ex, and two people I know from college. Person 1 has grown more and more aggressive and insulting lately (lately as in yesterday and often), so I hardly talk to them anymore. And my ex has now decided that I am on the back burner to everything, and we rarely talk during the day now. That leaves one person, who has their own life. I often feel like I'm annoying them.

I'm having major issues right now. I have no support system, no one to talk to. I feel empty, alone, and depressed. I do have anxiety and depression, but I can't talk to anyone about those because no one, not even my parents, believe me.

I (27f) am seeking advice because I am incredibly torn up and can not figure out what to do about my relationship with my partner (27m)
Six years ago we met when I really needed someone. I had an unplanned pregnancy and because of a shitty relationship with my parents hid the pregnancy and went through the painful process of adoption. (No regrets, I love my daughter and I hope her life is better than I could have given her) 

My partner was sweet and understanding. He also had a child when he was 19 and the child lived with his ex about 6 hours away. 
We had a fun young life together, partying, smoking weed, traveling and riding motorcycles. 
About 4 years ago my partners son (4 years old at the time) came to visit us on spring break. While his son was visiting us he begged not to go home. He eventually revealed to me that he was being physically and sexually abused by his maternal grandfather. I felt so honored that he felt safe enough to show and tell me what was happening to him at home. 

Long story short my partner and I kept his son from that day on and my partner was awarded full custody. We became instant parents to a 4 year old boy with significant trauma, and therefore behavioral problems. Our life completely changed and we knew we were doing the “right” thing but it was really difficult for us to manage. A few months later my partner was in an ambulance accident(while working as an EMT) and was disabled for 2 years. Not working. All the financial responsibility was mine which was crushing for me. My partners ex went off the radar and couldn’t be tracked down for child support. 

Fast forward through the most difficult few years of my life. Now “our” son, I always call him MY son because I am his mother figure and I truly have grown to cherish and love this sweet boy. 
My partner has developed a nasty alcohol addiction. He also constantly smokes weed. Earns minimum wage and has little direction in life. He often spends large sums of money on random stuff, and was diagnosed with BP. He’s so sweet at times and the worst person I have ever know at other times. 

We are engaged but I doubt that I will ever marry him because of how horrible he can be to me.

282,"**Before you read,** let me just say that this is more of a self-indulged quarrel that feels like it could have serious impacts on my future. 

**Background:**

As a student, the Ipad pro has always had a big appeal to me. But recently the PS5 has had me focused on it and while I'm not a gamer by a long shot, I am seriously considering getting the PS5 over the Ipad pro. 

**The Quarrel (so to whoever reads the following mess of writing):**

As a student, the Ipad pro has always had a big appeal to me. But recently, the PS5 has had me focused on it, and while I'm not a gamer by a long shot, I am seriously considering getting the PS5 over the Ipad pro.  my academics by a couple of percentages. This makes me feel like I could be trading my promising future over to gaming if I get a PS5. But at the same time, I feel like I can handle it and that a lot of my social life could be easier if I could game every once and a while with my friends.  I mean, I've had the PS4 pro for the longest time, and the major gaming addictions I had have been on mobile apps. I can also afford the PS5 right now but will have to save up for around 1 more year to get the Ipad pro. BUT THEN AGAIN, the Ipad pro could increase my grades from 85-90 to 95-100, or I could be blaming my inability to be perfect on a lack of equipment.",12Dec2020,1
283,"So I’m married to the love of my life (M 21) and I have the best friend in the world (F 21). But my life with them both is really mentally draining. They both are unemployed and depressed, and have no other friends besides me. I think both resent the other for taking their wife/friend away at times. It feels like I’m constantly being pulled between the two. Of course my husband comes first, but I’ve known my best friend for years now. I just don’t know what to do or how to make time for both.

284,"Tonight when I went to go and pick up somethings from my exes home we got into a fight which resulted in him refusing to let me leave by blockading the door and physically restraining me. I began to scream at him and just for help in general. He told me to shut up and put a blanket over my face and covered my mouth and nose so that I couldn’t breathe. I thought I was going to die. 

He finally let me go and ended up throwing groceries I had bought (I had gone grocery shopping right before getting there and when he asked to talk for a little bit before I left I told him we could but I had to bring my perishables up) on the floor, including eggs and some sauce I had bought. I continued to scream and he finally let me go. After which I went straight to the police. 

I feel terrible that I did though as he is a black man in America and we had talked about what a terrible system we have. We spoke about police brutality and I just feel as though I led people that could really hurt him, right to him. I don’t want him to be hurt by the police or anything, I just didn’t want him anywhere near me and I was scared. Was this the right call though? Please let me know! 

(I also would like to add that the reason we got into a fight in the first place was because last night I told him to treat his current dog better as he maliciously had murdered his other dog and I was nervous that would happen to her too).",12Dec2020,1

But the part that has me messed up is the fact that she said that a portion of the sales would have to go in my name so not only is she proposing that I help her sell stolen goods, I would also have to say that I didn't know she was doing it because of the fact that I have Autism and severe ADHD, and that makes me think what else has she put in my name because of that.

First of all I'm sorry if it's not the right subreddit but I thought this subreddit might help and shed some light on what exactly is my teen cousin going through.
My cousin sister is 17 and a bit of a recluse and always have been as far as I know. But lately she has started talking about killing herself and dying. At first my family being one of those typical Asian families were straight to resolve the issue by shouting at her and talking her out of it rather than understanding what's the deeper reason to this kind of behaviour. And in turn received and sort of medical support quite later rather than sooner.
It's been almost a month she hasn't changed her thought process yet but rather her symptoms as I may say have worsened. She doesn't sleep at night, her parents can hear here walking around all night opening taps etc, instead of crying she just does this weird howl thing, says she wants to kill everyone, nobody can touch her as she just attacks people ( she tried to choke my mom as she tried to touch her also bit her when she tried to unclasp her hands from her neck).
Although she's going to psychiatrist you can't help but worry over her wellbeing, so my question would be do you know anyone who displayed such sort of symptoms?? People in my family are claiming all sorts of things from medical to supernatural.",12Dec2020,1

When this first started I would put my ear buds in, cough loudly, or play a video out loud hoping she'll hear it, realized I'm awake and keep it down. Though that hasn't stopped her. I went to our mom about it without actually saying what it was and she suggested my sister was just watching a movie. I really didn't want to make it awkward and say what it really was.

Anyway, I found nearly three places, however they all have their issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

Place 1 is the cheapest. However, I can't find any specific reviews on the apartment, yet the reviews for the apartment company in general is terrible. From what I found it's just a standard studio. I'll have to travel to do laundry for free, and pay heat with electric.

&amp;#x200B;

Place 2 is in the middle. 2 bedrooms, though. I am a 21 year old girl and the roommate a 40 year male. However, the guy I will be renting from is saying that the roommate is going to stay in his hometown in a different state until classes resume in person. Great reviews. No other bills but reduced rent with good amenities, however I am still leery about the roommate dropping in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Place 3 is slightly more expense than place 2. Reviews are average. However, some say that the electric ,heating bill is very high, like 200-300 high. Someone said it was around 50 for them. Average amenities.

I’m not just saying that either, I’m overweight, have acne, my hair is crazy, and my voice sounds like the babysitter from the incredibles. So overall, never really thought I’d be dealing with this. 

Today at work, there’s been this customer guy that’s taking up all my time even though I’m behind on work due to the holiday rush. I’ve tried to be nice in a customer service way but he’s been so creepy over the past two days (yes he came in twice). 

Today I was helping him after my store already closed just so he could get out and he started saying things like “if the pandemic wasn’t happening I’d hug you” and asking me if I was married, AND IF I COULD GIVE HIM MY NUMBER. This guy wasn’t special needs or anything he was just incredibly creepy and needy. I told him I was at work and I didn’t want to talk about that stuff but he kept bothering me like “can you stop what you’re doing and walk me to this aisle? Just for a moment?” While I’m trying to help my team close. 

I’ve literally never been bombarded like this before and I’ve heard stories growing up about this happening to young women but I never thought it would happen to me because I’m genuinely not attractive.

I joined a game while high and the first thing the guy did was start using random emoticons that made no sense and saying “well played” and “thanks” to himself before anything happened. The next thing that was really weird was his deck. He was only using skeletons and nothing else. I’ve never seen anything like it before in my life. And because I was so high I wasn’t sure if his deck was weird or if I just thought it was really weird. But he was playing it so masterfully. I’m pretty high rank so his deck really through me off there was no way to play against it. And he kept using taunts and laughs the whole time. I couldn’t believe how somehow the deck was actually beating me. After I lost I had an anxiety attack because I wasn’t sure what had happened. I thought maybe it was a perfectly normal game and I was just high. But after an hour or so when I calmed down I watched the replay and it was as weird as I thought. I never had an anxiety attack before. Should I get medication or was it no big deal?,12Dec2020,1

So my brother decides to go and shower and in that house we only had 1 bathroom so we would have to leave it unlocked just in case someone had to use the toilet. So my brother was showering and I had to go so I knocked on the door before going in just in case and I did my business and while I was sitting on the toilet I noticed in the corner of my eye that my brother was peeking out from the shower and looking at me and then after he was peeking he would jerk his dick , which I could see because there was a window so you can see his shadow threw the shower curtains, then he peeks his head out and tells me to come over to the shower, and me and my brother have always been real close and I’ve seen him naked a couple of times ( when we were a little bit older ) before this, so he tells me to come over to the shower and I walk over with my pants down because I was just on the toilet. So I walk over and he starts to stroke my dick and I obviously start to get hard, then I ask for him to show me his dick, and I start stroking it too because I didn’t want to be the only one getting jerked off, so we basically jerked each other off until we came. And after I kinda felt almost disgusted like I never wanted to do that again but did at the same time. Then a day or two pass and now I’m gonna go shower. So I’m showering like normal and then my brother knocks on the door then comes in. First he takes a while because he’s using the bathroom then he opens the shower curtain and tells me to go get closer so I walk over and we jerked each other off again, and then from then on we would jerk each other off every time one of us was in the shower. And I was just wondering if anyone thought that this was weird because I still felt that feeling like almost ashamed that we did that but at the same time I think who cares it’s my brother there’s no harm in doing that , and btw were both straight we’ve both had girlfriends after that, I just wanted to know other peoples opinions on the situation like would it be weird to do it again because we’re moving soon and we’ll be home alone at some points and the last time we jerked each other off was in some bathroom we were fishing with our family and me and my brother had to use the bathroom and we both walked to the bathroom and it’s only one toilet there, so we both went it and I had no intention of jerking each other off but then while I was peeing I started to get hard because I was remembering when we jerk off before in the shower and then after my brother went pee he turns around and says “ has yours gotten bigger?” And I said I don’t know and pulled down my pants so he could see for himself and then we ended up jerking each other off again, I just want some advice idk if this is weird or how to feel about it.",12Dec2020,1

I work with 8 people in a house and they will walk in with a mask on but then take it off and continue to walk around the house with no mask? 

My boss would like to have a Christmas staff party and has asked us to bring food? Meaning we will be eating around each other?

I am pregnant and every time I walk in there they want to come up and talk to me while they’re mask-less. I ask them to put on a mask before continuing which they will listen but then once I am out of that area. Their mask are off again. 

I am getting so sick and tired of being the only 1 wearing a mask and following protocol. 

Of course I emailed my boss explaining how high risk I am and if they need me in the office then everyone needs to wear a mask. But that following week, we had a in person staff meeting and I walk into 2 people eating and after they finished, one person did not put on their mask back on. They wore no mask throughout the meeting. I sat by the door away from the meeting table. My boss did not ask this person to put on their mask either. 

Our building should be completely closed as well. The whole administration has asked us to telework as much as possible but we can’t do that because most of them don’t know how to use zoom, FaceTime or any kind of video technology and refuse to learn.

314,"Both of my parents are only children. Not only this one of my parents was the sole heir of several aunts and uncles. All of my grandparents grew up in the depression and were very conservative with money, drove cars for a long time, lived within their means, saving money, etc. On the other hand, my parents made horrible financial decisions throughout their life, frequently guilting their parents into giving them money. The house I grew up in was given to my parents by my grandparents (who were not rich). My parents were very abusive to their parents about money. For example, during the last years of my grandmother's life, they refused to visit her because she was spending too much of the money they expected to inherit on a private nursing home room. Similarly, my dad guilted his aunt into buying him a $40k car under the pretext of taking her to the grocery store after she lost her license, only to renege after getting the car because he was too busy (being unemployed).

&amp;#x200B;

Now the older generation has all passed away, and my parents have inherited all of their assets. Neither of my parents ever made more than 50k a year. But as soon as they got the money (maybe $1m) they quit their jobs (pre-social security eligibility) and have gone on to buy 5 $35k-40k cars. They currently have 4 high-end cars for 2 people, and recently upgraded one that was about 2 years old. That's only the tip of the iceberg into their frivolous spendings. My dad has also started using Marijuana to pass the time. Not sure that's relevant to the financial discussion but certainly is not something I'm proud of.  I have tried to talk to them about this, and they just tell me it's none of my business and they earned it.

&amp;#x200B;

Legally the money is theirs. I haven't taken or asked for a dime from anyone during my adult life. I pay my bills, live within my means, and save. Just like my grandparents taught me. However, I would be lying if I didn't say part of me is unhappy that they are (in my view) blowing through money that they didn't earn and that I thought I'd have some benefit of someday. Indeed, I can't get over how entitled they were their entire life, only to not model the same thrift and generosity in their old age.

&amp;#x200B;

But in addition to that, it is also the values system that has me unhappy. Thrift and family was the mantra of all of my grandparents. They bought used cars and drove them for 20 years, and their only splurge in life was their kids. Now my parents seem to be hell spent to spending like drunken sailors (high-end purses, luxury cars, fancy computers, quitting their job, expensive and bad financial advice, etc). Maybe this is the wrong way to look at it but I feel like there was a family compact about living modestly and paying things forward, and my parents threw it out the window when it got to them.

&amp;#x200B;

My question isn't so much about finances but I'm trying to get honest and unbiased views about the situation and how I should feel. How would you feel? For me, the issue is both what I see to be irresponsible spending, but also how manipulative and badly behaved they were in getting money from their parents. Certainly, I don't want to replicate that. But that said, I mentally can't just brush it off. I understand that legally the money is theirs. My question is emotional. Do I have a right to be unhappy about this? Would you be? Should I communicate this to them? Should I change my behavior towards them (stop attending family events, letting them into my life)?

Around the incident with my mom, I was binge watching on videos about the work done by cops. I thought people could take matters and issues in their own hands. My mom at the time was not listening to me, so I thought I could use force against them at the time like the cops in the videos. I want to help keep order in society. People generally do take action when a crime is being committed. 

At the same time, what I did was abusive. I feel regret for what I did, and I wish the action I did never happened in the first place. I simply don't understand when people can use physical force to intervene. It is a moral and ethical matter that I simply can't understand, and I feel there a ton of contradictions. You see a ton of people on social media cheering when people who are being rude in public get punched or run over by a car, yet that behavior isn't okay at home.

317,"\*\*\*this is booked for much later in 2021, so please, for the moment, **pretend it WON'T be cancelled by COVID - though this very much could be the case**\*\*\*

I don't know what to do. My friend and I have been planning to go to Japan together since middle school and are BFFS - however, in the past 3 or so years she has really changed in personality, gotten very mean, very argumentative with me. I kept on thinking it would get better, she was just in a ""phase""... but it didn't. She constantly ""jokes"" about my looks, my personality, and compares me in negative ways, saying things she doesn't like about me; I try to laugh it off but it's getting so draining, especially since I'm always building her up, telling her how pretty she is, how smart, especially when she needs encouragement, etc. Sometimes at night, after hanging out with her, I am left in tears, she is so hurtful to me. I am realizing that this trip may be one of the biggest mistakes of my life; I will be stuck with her, for 3 weeks straight, in a foreign country. She is very controlling, and uses mind games to get me to do what she wants; even if I don't really want to do it. I'm worried the entire trip will become about her, her needs, and it will be a 3-week disaster. I was naive in thinking we would 'work it out' closer to the date; I am realizing she will never change. 

I have already bought my $1000 flight ticket, but we haven't booked any accommodation yet (thankfully). 

Here is my problem:

\- would you just suck it up and do the trip, for her sake? Even if I know it will be a disaster? Finances-wise, I've saved up for 3 years to afford this trip - and I'd be so sad to blow it on a terrible, horrible trip experience with her, but if that's the honorable thing to do, I will. 

\- if I don't decide to go (AND HERE'S WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH): how would you tell her? what would you say, exactly? I'm thinking of taking her out to coffee, and preparing some specific reasons why it's not working out between us - and ending the friendship, and trip - but in a very non-confrontational way. This sounds ""simple"" in context, but I feel like in person, it's going to be very difficult, she will likely get very angry and not let me explain myself. How would you approach this?

\- would you pay for her $1000 flight ticket as well (I've already paid for my own $1000 ticket), since it's ME who is backing out? What would you do? Or let her figure out what she wants to do with her flight? We didn't get the cancellation insurance.",12Dec2020,1

We’d send stuff that I guess could be considered flirting but just very lowkey, and he then informed me that he was still dating his girlfriend of a year.

326,"I went to a new dentist and had a root canal and a crown.  It was hitting a spot High and instead of trying to figure out where it was hitting she filed the entire top of it down to a tiny nub where I basically have a sliver of tooth left.  
I was in complete shock when I looked in the mirror afterwards.  To top it off the edges are rough and sharp.  The top is completely flat and I can't use it to chew and it's the back molar. I ate a small amount of food and after brushing my teeth I noticed something on the edge of the bottom of the sliver of tooth that I have left. 
I brushed it away but I felt a pressure I pushed on the tooth and bits of food or something came out underneath the edge of the crown.  As the day went on more bits of stuff came out of the bottom of this thing.  It's leaking something.  If I press hard on the top of what's left of the crown more gunk squeezes out of the edge. 

 I paid $500 out of pocket and my insurance paid several hundred.

At the end of the visit I wasn't satisfied I knew something was wrong but she told me to give it a few days and come back if I still had issues.  There was no mirror in the office so I didn't know until I got home that my tooth was basically gone.

I knew it felt strange to my tongue but she assured me it was just because I had something new in my mouth.  

I called and told them I would have to come back in to get this fixed and they actually asked me why.  I'm still in shock they let me leave in this sort of condition.  She said she can adjust it some more and I told her there's nothing left to adjust its too filed down already but she said we'll see when we see each other again if I can adjust it some more.

Frustrated with her insisting that she could still adjust it more  I called back and I made an appointment with the owner of the dental practice.  5 minutes later I received a frantic call from the receptionist asking me to reconsider and see the person who did the work instead. He told me to understand that crowns aren't an exact science and it's not going to be perfect but I told him I understand it can't be perfect but I don't have a tooth anymore it's a tiny little nub that is practically flush with my gums and it can't be used to chew.  

They seem to be trying to dismissive.  I'm certain I don't want the dentist who did this to do the work again.  I'm going in to speak with her but I'm not sure how to address explaining that I don't want her to work on fixing it since it was done so badly and it seems like she's a very new dentist.  Should I go directly to the owner? Try to reason again with the person who did the actual work? The Dental Board? I want to do this the right way but I also know that I definitely need to get this redone. I'm not out to ruin anybody's new career so I'm trying to take this delicately but I also don't want to be walked on 

The dental assistant that helped was so incredibly nice and I could tell she was concerned for me and the state of my tooth.

I went on a couple more trips that year and wouldn’t eat very much leading up to them.

Fast forward to covid and isolation/lockdown. I gained maybe 6-8 pounds and I’m generally a pretty thin person so it looked like a lot on me and I was unhappy. When we got out of isolation in the summer, I basically stopped eating as much.. I was so skinny that people were commenting on it. I also started vaping so that also suppressed my appetite. 

Now it’s December, I quit vaping and didn’t want to gain all my weight back after quitting smoking so I would binge eat one day then the next day I’d have maybe one small snack and drink maybe like, a couple coffees to suppress my appetite.

332,"How should my friend go at this issue? What should I do to support her? (TL;DR at end)

I don’t know what subreddit to post this on, I believe this will do. My friend, who I will name Sarah for the time being, has encountered some issues. She has always loved cosplaying and she has gained a major following of 10k people. She has always had trash being thrown at her but she easily ignored the internet trolls. At least, until recently. I was sent a ominous string of text by Sarah being spiteful of schoolmates and social media. Obviously I queried why she was so aggravated at such different topics, and she told me schoolmates got hand of her account and began throwing trash at her. Luckily Sarah is doing online learning, so she will not have to deal with any form of bullying in person, unluckily she is in middle school, so gossip can easily spread as most of us most likely know. The bully’s of sorts created Tik Toks (the social media platform Sarah uses for her cosplaying) ridiculing her hard work, along with a good friend just from association.

Obviously you would tell her to inform superiors of such shitty acts. But here’s the kicker, her parents don’t know about her social media, yes they know she cosplays, yes they know she is posting it on social media, but they do not know that she has 10k followers. So Sarah is afraid that her parents will just, according to her: “They’ll question everything on tiktok, take my phone away for a long time and just get upset with me.” I asked her if anything like this has happened before, seeing how she answered quickly. She denied anything like this happening beforehand, but she did tell me that her parents were very cautious of her using social media, by creeps, stalkers, terrible people in general.

Keep in mind, I know of situations such as this happening in the past in this middle school, and the superiors always dealt with it swiftly once reported. The only issue is Sarah’s reluctance, she is also afraid of getting her friend into the situation aswell. This portion of this small essay sized question will change overtime: One of Sarah’s friends decided to directly confront the attackers, and asked them to stop. They complied and said they would stop. Now this would seem fine, but liars exist and Sarah doesn’t have the social media they use to spread their shitposting, and so Sarah cannot confirm this response.

I just want to help my friend, and I know the exact timing of this message isn’t the greatest, but i don’t want anything to happen to my friend that could harm her mentally, emotionally, etc. The TL;DR will give a brief explanation and if you have a answer to the question implemented into the TL;DR, please answer.

TL;DR: Friend has social media with 10k followers, schoolmates got hold of this and threw shit at her. She doesn’t want to inform her school or parents of this because she feels like they will just take her electronics away, and when confronted they said they would stop, but there is no way of tracking this and no way of stopping them from lying. How should my friend go at this issue? What should I do to support her? Am I overreacting from asking the internet? Any other questions of the situation?

342,"I'm at uni in the UK. Last year I was on a placement year at a company in a small town about 60 miles away from my university, and I was incredibly isolated and alone for almost all of it. I went for weeks without having a real conversation with anyone that wasn't about work. I couldn't do anything with my evenings because I got home late at night, and I was many hours away from the friends I had made in the previous two years. At one point, I was mere seconds away from stepping in front of a train on my commute home. I still don't know why I didn't go through with it.

One of the things which got me through it was the hope that things would go back to normal this year. I would be able to step back into my old life with my old social circles, manage my workload effectively and finally have a relationship with the girl I'd been in love with since first year, who was also the only person from uni I still regularly spoke to. I started taking antidepressants and doing therapt weekly, and I worked my way through that miserable year knowing there was a light at the end of the tunnel.

Since September, I've been back at university and things have gotten much, much worse. Most of my friends have now graduated or simply moved on without me. My social circles have evaporated and because I've not been around other people for so long, I have forgotten how to socialise. Nothing to do with covid – that bit of my brain just no longer works. I can't hold a proper conversation with anyone or be in large groups of people outside without wanting to throw up. I haven't been able to manage my workload – I'm literally months behind and there's no chance I'll have caught up by the time my deadlines hit or exams start. The side effects of my antidepressents haven't gone away and I get about 2hrs sleep per night, and can't eat more than a few bites of my dinner. Worst of all, the girl I've been in love with for years, who kept me going when I was in the loneliest place I've ever been, has told me she's been in a long term relationship with a mutual friend from first year for over a year without telling me.

I'm sick and miserable and heartbroken and completely lost. I've had recurring issues with depression for about 10 years and nothing ever seems to set me free: not therapy, not medication, not daily exercise or even religion. I've tried all of it and I'm exactly where I started. I'm going to be living with this forever.

Next year I'll be in the exact same position I was in when I was suicidal before: working somewhere I hate, making myself sick with meds that don't even work, having drifted apart from everyone who's ever meant anything to me. I'm scared of being like that again, with even less to keep me going.

I'm doing everything right. Still taking the pills, still in therapy. I've spoken to the university to get extra help. I'm trying to get over the girl by distancing myself from her. I'm trying to reconnect with people I used to be close with. But nothing ever seems to get any better, and all these problems are continuing unabated.

345,"I have a friend who almost two years ago now, I had a bit of a crush on, it wasn't too deep or anything, and it passed quickly, I never made any mention of it to him back when because I wasn't looking for another relationship, he also caught feelings for me at some point around the same time but also didn't say anything. Well when he broke up with his ex a few months ago, he apparently got those feelings back (while I was tripping super hard over another friend) and I rejected him at that time. Even after choosing that it'd be for the best not to persue the friend that I was super crushing on, this guy, we'll call him Loo, was continuing to make advances, to which Loo got rehected three more times before slightly backing off.

He went from wanting to be together directly to offering to be a 'sexting friend', which I don't need nor want, given I'm not really into the whole ""partner"" scene on that, so he was rejected yet again, as well as a few times after that, followed by a thorough explanation as to why I don't want nor feel comfortable in wanting a relationship as of now (not good enough as of this point) as well as explaining that I don't find partnered sex, physical or over message interesting nor attractive, and... he kinda let up on it a little more.

Well being that I'm a really open person, we talk about all sorts of weird shit, sex is one of those things that comes up sometimes and he always ends or inserts somewhere that ""well if you ever want it I can provide!"" And just general things like that... he still says he finds me attractive and wouldn't mind a relationship often... I've told him so many times though, what more can I do? He's not a bad person by any means, I really enjoy being friends with him actually! He's just... well, a guy. He finds an interest in sex, he wants to have sex, and that's completely normal for the human species, or any species tbh... I just wish he'd stop making passive suggestions at this point. It's not like it makes me uncomfortable or anything, I just take it with a grain of salt these days, but I do kinda wish it'd stop...

Any advice on how to stop it? I mean I don't mind the conversations at all, its just him near constantly implying it and that that's what he's after or what he wants that bothers me.",12Dec2020,1
346,"Hello world

Long story short I’ve been dating my fiancé for 8 years now. His SIL wasn’t an issue until earlier this year when we won some money at an event she invited us to and pretty much demanded and justified that we owe her half the money. My fiancé gave her half just to shut her up as she complains she doesn’t have money this that and she has two step kids and a mortgage (we have a mortgage and bills too ?) 

Anyway fast forward to now (which is 9 months later) she and her husband just bought a $1M and are obviously over the moon. I am trying to be happy for her but I cannot get past the fact she is a selfish bitch who complained about having no money then she does that?? 

How would you feel? How do you react around family? I have not said congratulations to her yet (I’ll just do it in person..) but I’ll probably look like the “bad guy” which frustrates me???",12Dec2020,1

However, an obstacle that may or may not stand in my way is my last name. I don’t want to give too much personal information but for reference, I’ll use the word “harlot”.

It isn’t my last name but it represents the problem I’m in the most. My last name is laughable, and inappropriate, however it isn’t as commonly used anymore as “crooked” or “slutty”.

349,"There’s a lot of background to this. But basically, my (18F) best friend (19F) is hanging out and sleeping with my best friends (20F) ex boyfriend (20M). Back story: My friend, let’s call her Emma; dated this guy , we’ll call him Mason - for 3 years. He was a not a good boyfriend, they didn’t have a good relationship. He never did anything- no gifts, signs of appreciation, compliments, dates, nothing. It was basically a fuck-buddy with sleepovers and “I love yous” for 3 years. He was never there emotionally, was suicidal with addiction and drug problems. She was miserable, and didn’t see a future with him and broke up with him, around July 2019. 
  My other friend, we’ll call her Jenna. Jenna and her boyfriend , we’ll call him Blake(20M) got together April 2017. During this time, Emma and Mason were still dating. We were all friends and hung out together all the time. 
   In May 2020 this year, Mason and I slept together. I slept with Emma’s ex boyfriend, which is my best friend. It was just sex -  he’s a terrible person and I don’t know what I was thinking, but I kept it a secret for months. Jenna found out November this year, and so did everyone else. I just told Emma tonight. She forgave me, I was honest with her and we had a good long talk.
Recently, Jenna and Mason have been hanging out. Blake got super jealous (with reason) and everything piled up, and Jenna and Blake broke up 2 weeks ago after 3 1/2 years of being together. Two days later, she slept with Mason. 2 days after she broke up with Blake. She confessed to Blake, he forgives her and they got back together and she blocked Mason on everything. Yet then again, they broke up last week for real and unblocked Mason on everything. They started hanging out again. 
Again, Jenna is my absolute best friend. I’ve known her for 7 years. Recently , since she’s been around Mason so much she’s changed. She was gonna stay away from him after he’s held a knife too her, choked her, and forced her to drink his blood, (sexually?). But she hasn’t and she’s fucking him again. I just found out today and I don’t know what to feel. It doesn’t effect me, but I feel terrible for Emma and Blake because she’s hiding it from them and they’re fucking hurt. Blake was also BEST friends with Mason for years and now he’s ducking his ex girlfriend. 
Mason is not a good person to be around. He’s toxic, manipulative, and likes to play mind games. 
So basically Jenna is sleeping with her best friends ex, and ex boyfriends best friend. Everything is fucked right now. She doesn’t seem to care and everyone is hurt. Emma especially, I know Jenna is sleeping with Mason but Emma does not. It’s not my place to tell her but she deserves to know.
Jennas also been making Mason a priority over me. Which just hurts. We’re best friends and I always invite her over, she lies about where she is when she’s with Mason and doesn’t seem to care how I feel about it. We’ll make plans and she dips and goes to Masons and stays the night. 
Emma is really hurt because they seem to have more of an emotional connection then she ever did in her 3 year relationship with Mason. Mason tells Jenna she’s pretty, buys her stuff, opens up and actually talks to her and he never did that with Emma. I just don’t know what to do. None of us do",12Dec2020,1
350,"About 2 months ago I [M 20]  an altercation with my uncle /former roommate[M 34]  because of alcohol and other things. The fight broke out because I sent him a text to turn down his music because my other family members upstairs were trying to sleep after him and his friends have been causing nonstop noise coming in and out of the house. When I asked if he saw my text i was holding a water bottle tossing it from one hand to the other he says “If it was bothering you you could’ve turned it off yourself ” begins to start mocking me about the water bottle tossing I told him “it’s not my property to be tinkering with your things” he sees that as disrespectful and I asked if he had a problem this is where we then go to the living room and we both squared up and RIGHT THERE it didn’t feel right. As someone who trains boxing and kickboxing Instead of striking him I grappled with him instead because hitting him didn’t feel right. We begin to wrestle it and we bumped into his big tv that broke and he grabbed me by my throat and I grabbed him by his while having him to the wall. He threatened to kill me if I didn’t stop the entire time. Once he turned he tripped and fell on top of me where I tried to catch myself but with him being 100 pounds heavier than I, I dislocated my shoulder and he begins to scratch my face. He then asked why I was doing this? But all I said was “I just sent a sent a text to turn off your music” he then gets off me and my grandma tries to break up the fight. He starts threatening to hook me and missed 3 times so I kicked him in his chest and made him go flying and the fight ended there. We exchanged trash talking from different rooms until the cops came and saw that my face was scratched up and asked if I wanted to press charges to which I replied “no.” One of the things he said was that my car was small and I can’t even fit in it while he has no car. He said Everyone praises me because I work 6 hour shifts while he was unemployed. And that I wanted the whole first floor to myself but now I’m living with my mom and now he has the whole first floor to himself leeching off my grandma helping him pay off my part of the rent . 🤦🏻‍♂️ I just feel like a failure now because i feel as if People are doubting my abilities to fight because I didn’t hit him and that it was me that had to move out and not him.

353,"So I am absolutely being disrespected by the assistant manager at work who I work with just about every day, it has been this way since the day I started only it has gotten worse.

My assistant manager talks down to me as if I have no capability or brain what so ever. I work hard I do as much as I can while trying my hardest! And it is never ever enough, I try starting a conversation but it never works I basically get told off, unlike the other employees. I even brought in treats to try to win over some leniency, guess what? DIDN'T WORK. 

So I have noticed that the other employees as in my co-workers and managers are always ready to greet each other and give each other goodbyes while I, on the other hand, have to say hello and I'm usually either ignored or giving the driest half ass reply, so dry your ears would shrivel up and die. Actually, I will be trying to talk to another employee and they will look at me turn and start a conversation with another employee. It has been like this since day one so it was pretty obvious to me that my co-workers did not like me.

So after a hard day of me having to suck up and let my assistant manager degrade me and discredit the work I do for hours on end, I decided it was time to call the manager and let her know how the assistant manager was treating me. I specifically told the manager I did not want her to speak about this with the assistant manager which the manager told me she was still going to do aka denying my privacy by bringing up my concerns which will probably end up making my days even more frustrating than ever. But the worst part is after I told the manager my concerns she berated me with things I had done wrong and apparently negative things my co-workers said about me and things I had said. As she told me the things people had reported me of saying I realized almost all and I mean like 98% of the things said to her weren't true. And yes I owned up to my 2% even though it was almost all just taken out of context kind of almost twisted around I still apologized. But after we got off the phone I almost had tears in my eyes in anger sadness and stress knowing that all of the co-workers don't just like me but they legitimately hate me enough to lie to jeopardize my job, and having my manager defend the assistant manager by turning my concerns against me defending the assistant manager and attacking me I felt hopeless.

I was so frustrated and upset and now that I brought anything up to management my job is going to be far more difficult and frustrating not to mention how now I don't even want to show my face knowing everyone legitimately hates and I mean hates me.

357,"Does anyone have any advice? I'm 19, and I keep finding myself in situations that just absolutely make me feel rotten inside. 

I grew up very sheltered, and in a religious family somewhat. But they are conservative, so they believe and taught me growing up that ""theres a right way and a wrong way to do things"" and ""things are supposed to be this way in the world"" if that makes any sense. But that belief is unfortunately ingrained in my subconscious, and is something I am working to change. 

I met a guy earlier this year though. A lot of people tell me to stay away from him, or to be careful and maybe my decision to hang out with him makes me trashy. Idk. But his life has been on a constant downward spiral the last 3 years and I like to believe things happen for a reason, so the timing of when I met him makes me honestly believe we were supposed to cross paths. 

When I first met him, he was smoking meth a lot. I don't like that shit at all, because both my biological parents were meth users. But he was so honest I decided to give him a chance and im really glad I trusted my gut. Because since then, we've grown a lot closer and become really good friends. Hes a very level headed person, and unless he said something, you wouldn't even be able to tell he was smoking anything or using. 

But his use has calmed down a lot. He has cut almost everyone out of his life, and is trying to go back to living a boring, uneventful life. He's been talking about going back to school for welding and people don't understand how happy I am for him because he seems to be a lot happier in general now. He's slowly getting to a better point in life and its awesome to see, and to be able to support and help him through it is even better. He has told me I've taught him a lot and that im one of the only real friends he has too.

But I won't lie. It's kind of changed something inside of me. Seeing him struggle and go through all of that, it makes me want to be there for him even more. But he has opened up about a lot of things thatve happened in his life. He has had a very rough life and he has told me things that people don't talk about or want to think about. 

And honestly, I'm shook as fuck. I live in a boring town, and the people here are fucked up to an unbelievable extent at times. Like this friend i am talking about now, a few months ago he found out someone he had known for 3 years was busted by police for being involved in human trafficking. 

And its just like... it scares me the stuff people do in the dark. It has changed how I see the world quite a bit, and idk how to deal with it. I no longer really trust as much as I used too, but still can be very naive at times. That's what I've been told, anyway.

I try and apply to grocers and bakeries in the area but they either aren't hiring or end up telling me I'm over-qualified, or they just won't get back to me at all.

(Also this is my first post ever on Reddit, so sorry if I don’t format it right, also I’m on mobile)

Because of the whole pandemic and everything, the last part of my freshman year and so far of my sophomore year has been completely online. While it does suck, it helped me become closer with my friends, two friends in particular. One of them I’ll call W (for weeb lmao) and the other I’ll call A. I started talking with them a lot more over the summer, especially A. Once school began, the three of us would all go on vc together (discord) and we’d help each other out with homework and stuff, and pretty much just hang out. I didn’t notice that I started to like A until maybe last month, when I realized I was getting butterflies whenever I spoke with or heard his voice, or if we were just on vc together. Now I know for a fact that I don’t have a chance, because he knows TOO much messed up stuff about to ever have a crush on me (it’s just fun little tidbits of secrets and stuffs, nothing bad), he only considers me a friend, and if I ever confessed, it would make things awkward for me and him, plus, another girl in our friend group who were are both friends with, already told him that she liked him last year (she doesn’t anymore, but you get what I mean). Not only that, but I’ve asked for his advice on two of my other crushes in the past, one of whom we are both friends with, and the other I had a crush on at the beginning of this school year. I know I shouldn’t, but I keep wanting to tell him how I feel. But lately I haven’t been actually texting with him as much compared to over the summer, and usually when the three of us are on vc (me, W, and A) they’re just talking about gaming stuff and I usually don’t say much. I’ve being acting kinda weird lately (cause of a headache) and while A has been understanding (me and W have a friendly/mean friendship so we say mean jokes to each other occasionally, but they asked me if I was okay too) I get nervous that I’m making them annoyed. It could just be because of my trust issues from bad friends in the past, but I really don’t wanna lose these friends, because honestly they’re amazing and I feel so comfortable around them, and I know they won’t change their opinion of me so quickly after a few days, but I just get really worried.

TLDR; (I think that’s how it works?) I have a crush on my friend that I became close with over quarantine, but I’m scared of ever actually confessing because I don’t wanna ruin our friendship, but at the same time I wanna go for it?

I am feeling very sick as I write this. Last night I got (extremely) drunk for the first time in my life. I probably drank more than my body weight in alcohol.

371,"**I've been coming to terms with my codependency over the last few months and I have started to build a healthier and happier life**. I made a move to another country for work. I left behind a bad relationship. I am screening all of the new people I let into my life and setting boundaries. However, **I still have contact with two friends (a married couple) from my 'former life'.**

The problem is, I am starting to think that they are in an unhealthy dynamic and I am disliking our Zoom conversations. I am getting narcissist vibes from the wife and codependent vibes from her husband. **I am wondering if anyone has any experience navigating relationships in a healthier way and possibly recognizing that past relationships were unhealthy. And what do I do?**

Some examples:

She talks herself up, ""I am so accomplished"", ""I know this, that, blah blah blah"". It's all said very matter of fact, (someone talking about their accomplishments--with no BASIS IN REALITY).

She demeans her husband at times in front of me, sometimes they argue openly. I makes me feel a cringe. If the topic of conversation is something that isn't related to her (or not of her interest) she will openly tell him, ""No one wants to talk about that!"" or she will just get up and leave during the Zoom call.

She sort of wined and dined me as a goodbye before I moved. She has casually said, ""Oh, you'll be moving back here in a year or two after you save up some money"". It seems like a bit manipulative, and she keeps mentioning that I should help her husband with his business venture. It seems like she's trying to convince me that her city is so liveable and wonderful recently, even though there has been some political problems in her country.

There's plenty of other little stuff, too. But....

She has been very generous (opened her house and sofa-bed to me when I was in a transition after leaving my ex). She checks in periodically and asks how I am doing. At times she seems very interested in my life. Sometimes so much, that I feel like I am the one doing most of the talking. She will schedule calls if I forget. This has all happened recently, though. Before, I did most of the scheduling and traveling to meet them.

So, I am a bit confused. Should I just accept her as imperfect? The husband in the scenario is a great guy, but it seems like he just lets her treat him however she wants. I really like talking to him and have never had a bad conversation with him. The problem is, he will not talk to me alone on Zoom. It's always done with her. Not sure why that is, but he just doesn't seem like that kind of guy to talk on the phone or Zoom. We used to hang out in person separately from her (get some beers) before COVID and my move abroad.

Any thoughts on this are appreciated!",12Dec2020,1
372,"Hi, I think I must start by saying that by burning bridges I really just mean ruin a significant relationship, not that I am a pyromaniac or anything. That being said I just kinda need to vent and ask for advice while at it, you’ll see I’m 21 and I’ve been through enough rough patches to think I am cursed, but that’s not really that important to mention. I struggle and have been struggling with depression, anxiety and some neurological issues for years, I am being treated but I am currently in a low.
One of my only friends birthday is tomorrow and I am not planning on attending the very small and selected reunion planned for it, because I’m angry, at her and at the world really...i feel anger all the time recently and I can’t quite tell why. Partly, I am also a bit bitter towards her for a reason that might be dumb but anyways, she wasn’t there for me recently when I asked for help to shoot a thing for a class, and it wasn’t her obligation to do so, I know, but I don’t have many friends and therefore not many people I can ask to help me with stuff like that (it was like a short film) and she didn’t help me because she was busy but I just felt so left aside and irrelevant that I got a bit mad and it’s partly why I don’t wanna go.
Also, when I said today in the chat group with my other friends ( I guess) that I wasn’t going because I had a lot of work (excuse) they called me out and I just said it wasn’t my fault and that I already expected them to be mad at me for pretty much standing her up.
Anyways, I’ve been thinking, how most of my friendships end because of stupid fights (mostly product of an already toxic dynamic ) but this is not the case, only for the dumb fight...should I show up? Because I can already feel like I will regret it if this bridge burns because I am clearly not in a good state of mind. But also, I want to somehow validate my feelings, even if I can’t find a logic to them. 
I hope you guys read this far and maybe share what you think. I am trash and I already know it, so please don’t send hate, I am just really not ok and I think it’s showing on how it’s affecting my relationships. This just being an example

382,"Forgive me for any errors, English isn't my first language. We are in our early 30s, and after I noticed a cut, my spouse reached out and told me they sometimes cut themselves. We've been together for 5 years and I NEVER suspected such a thing as they do not have any scars. From what I understand, they aren't clinically depressed, but probably have a tremendous anxiety underneath it all. I know they have anxiety, as they don't fall asleep easily and they have expressed it's due to 'thinking too much'. I know it's internal and this is proof that they don't have healthy coping mechanisms...and I'm so unbelievably sad that they're dealing with that pain alone and I didn't really see it. I told them that I'm here, and I needed them to talk to me because self harm usually indicates a need to release some kind of underlying problem, a maladaptive way of coping, really. I said that I'm happy they confided in me, that it must've been difficult, but they need to talk to me about what's going on..that sometimes I know it's easy to feel a lot of shame around one's feelings or thoughts, but there's nothing so seemingly ""insignificant"" or ""burdansome"" that they can't come to me with. I held them for a while, and I also said that this shows me they must be really hurting, though they said it's more about a way to stay 'calm', and they don't do it often. I could tell it was difficult for them to admit, and I believe what they are telling me.   


I truly don't think it's often, but I'm worried that it's worse than I'm being lead to believe...either way ""big or small"", I don't think it makes a difference. There has been no pattern that I've noticed until they confided in me, I can't think of one instance and hindsight is 2020 and there are usually flags or trails you can see, but the only ones I can think of is that I know they have some underlying turmoil (as we all often do). Either they were very good at hiding it, or they are telling the truth and it is only a 'sometimes' thing. I didn't ask specifics, as I didn't want to focus on the when it started and why. But they did express it's not a regular thing...but I'm wondering if physical harm demonstrates something more sinister than I thought, that I should ask them to see a therapist. I know they won't go so easily, now I have a feeling there is no other option.   


**Extra info:** I don't know, I feel like I can't just let this go as a ""well it's only sometimes"". We have a very healthy relationship, we're very open and happy together, and I think they don't feel comfortable expressing their troubles, fears and sadness outwardly. They are quite forthcoming if I ask them to tell me the truth.

386,"Hi everyone, first post here.. or ever. I also have not actually met this “person”, if there is anyone to be met... but I’m terrified over this and don’t know where else to post. 

Below may not be in perfect order for reading, but explanation and reasonings are all there. Please consider them all.



We have been living in this unit since April of 2020. It is managed by the management company I work for, so once I saw the listing getting ready to be posted, I jumped on it and my partner and I moved in here. It’s a duplex technically, but is essentially like a house with a studio attached. 

It’s a weird set up. Like I said, we’re basically a single level house. We’re on a corner, so we face one way, and the studio faces the other. We share 2-3 of the studios walls with them. In our living areas, we also have a door that connects on each side locked by a deadbolt. If we wanted we could open it and share our spaces. We have a couch blocking our side.Their garage has been converted to another room, so legally it’s a studio but they use it as a bedroom. Odd right? Again, I work for the company so I’ve been in the unit myself multiple times. He’s a nice guy, nothing concerning really. We had a couple of noise complaints sent his way because he was loud after quiet hours, but has since stopped. I think he’s more of a night owl.

 Could the attics connect if our living rooms used to?

I hate the dark and I hate being home alone, I always have. But here, it sometimes feels like I have a reason to worry or that I am being watched. Our dog is very aware of every little noise and while it’s usually a dog or someone outside, I feel that her annoying woofs and barks that I once looked over might mean something more. 

My partner and I have heard several random noises that feel like someone is outside of our home and hitting the walls, usually one bang or spaced out ones. Like accidents. It’s not uncommon for homeless people to rummage in our garbages so that’s what we have been assuming.. sometimes though, they feel a little too close- like they’re up and over from us. In the attic. 

We’ve never been up there as we have a spare bedroom area and small loft in the garage for storage. To be honest, I’m not sure where the attic door is, although I think there is an opening in our master closet. At least one possible opening so far.. I haven’t looked. It’s not like a door but more like ceiling that is elevated, like a raised ceiling in a living room but very small. There is also a space that I think goes under the house as well.. haven’t been in there either. 

This closet has a motion light that turns off every 30 seconds or so, so if you’re in there you have to move again to get it on. It can’t be on continuously. My partner has gone to the garage through the night to smoke (marijuana, so it’s very quick,) several times to find me asleep with our dog and that light on. It’s not sensitive to bugs- we have a hard time getting it on sometimes. We have also woken up early and quietly laid in bed before to hear it switch on out of nowhere. (Obviously then it wasn’t something IN the closet, but what about above? Near the wires?)

Along with the noises, we’ve noticed things being misplaced or missing. Small things, nothing that we wouldn’t assume was the other person misplacing. Food included, but we don’t run out of it usually. More like it’s being picked off little by little. As an example,  say I have a pack of 10 tortillas, next week I might have 8, next I might have 7, and I likely haven’t ate any myself. It could be my partner but doubtful as we usually have our own snacks or make meals with/for each other. 

Our appliances, like a coffee pot, have  been left on several times.. we’re very particular about turning them off when we leave. Sometimes our washer is turned off mid cycle as well. Remember my sensitive, barky dog? We leave a radio on for her while she’s locked in her kennel during the day to help. It has been turned off several times, as in obviously switched from on to off, and she couldn’t do it herself. Sometimes alarms are set snd make it turn on but we don’t use it for that purpose. We are very routine and check on her 3x a day around the same times. 

She has always been SO happy to see us when we get home, and usually sounds like a little hyena for 20 minutes after we get there. But, it seems to be getting worse. She’s very sweet and can be timid, so if someone was mean to her when we weren’t around she wouldn’t defend herself. We have found piled up fur outside the front door of her kennel recently, like it was pulled out or brushed and pulled from the brush. 

Yesterday, my last straw was finding urine in our toilet in our master bedroom. Super dark, stinky, nasty urine. It definitely wasn’t me (I’m hydrated for one, and there was no toilet paper in the bowl,) and my partner only urinates in it at night and is also hydrated, and has 0 problems flushing. He also lifts the seat. He mostly uses the other bathroom. 

I asked him just to be safe- wasn’t him. Wasn’t me, so who? I was the last one here that morning and the only one to use it that day. 

Tonight, I slept on the couch for some time and woke up to several noises, and couldn’t distinguish if it was my neighbor or “the man in the attic.” My dog kept growling until we went to the bedroom. I am getting so paranoid that I brought my dog to work with me today so she wouldn’t be alone. 

My partner jokes often about the man in the attic, but what if it’s real? What if they’re getting more snd more ballsy? He says he’ll look this weekend, but I’m scared for him to. I ordered a camera and it should be here soon.

Dealership made a mistake

I took my car to a local Lincoln dealership on a Tuesday to get an oil change. I came home, parked the car and didn't drive it until the best day. That morning after I left my husband let me know there was a huge oil spot under where my car was parked. I also checked the parking space at work and there was oil there also. When I got home my husband checked my car and there was almost no oil. Since Thursday was thanksgiving I had to wait until Friday morning to call the dealership to let them know of my issue.
They said they could not take in my car until Saturday. On Saturday I was told the reason it was ""leaking"" was because it was excess leftover in the oil pan that was not cleaned &amp; I supposedly had the recommended amount of oil, no less. Which was bs. So I went home.
On Sunday night I noticed there was an oil spot under my car so I had my husband check it again &amp; he noticed it was very low. So we agreed to call the dealership Monday morning. On Monday morning on my way to work my car would not go over 35 mph &amp; the check engine light was on. 
I drove it all the way to the dealership.
They gave me a loaner &amp; said they would troubleshoot the issue. I was called on Thursday to say I had two cracked cylinders and they would have my car until the first week of January since they are waiting for parts.  I asked why this happened and he could only say it could happen for many reasons they aren't too sure. 
I have an Extended warranty so I will only have to pay $100 out of pocket. I don't feel like I should be responsible for this cost even though it's low. 

I will also have a loaner vehicle until mine is repaired. 

My question is, do I have any legal action for the damage that was caused to my car? Or are there additional questions I should ask the dealer to ensure my car is going to be properly repaired? I know they are repairing it but I feel like I will have to face the possibility that my car may have issues down the line because of their mistake or that the lifespan of the car may not be as long.

400,"Hi. I don’t know if I’m doing this correctly, since I typically just surf Reddit and have never posted before... so forgive me if this isn’t correct. 

So essentially, my husband (25) and I (24) are visiting my father’s house this weekend...whom I haven’t seen in almost twenty years. We came with my sibling. He gave my husband and I the basement apartment (the man has a ...very big house..) since we have our infant daughter with us. (We are all negative for Covid and he’s surprisingly a short distance from our address despite the lack of contact for so long. But not close enough that we can drive home and come back..)

I’ve been awake most of the night taking care of our daughter, since my husband has a heart condition that acted up a few hours previously. I decided to go to the bathroom...I walk in...and in the tub is a gigantic wolf spider. We recently encountered these in our last apartment (our apartment was infested with these and we didn’t know until after we signed the lease...and we had no where else to move away to). I ended up having a panic attack in the bathroom! Super awful. I keep running around looking at corners and crying and turning all the lights on (I haven’t slept in days okay). I’m typically not so irrational with spiders but these are REALLY big. Bigger than my entire thumb okay. Now my dilemma is...my daughter is finally asleep and now I can’t sleep in the bedroom out of fear of these spiders. I keep picturing them going into her crib and biting her since they are poisonous hunting spiders.... I obviously can’t turn the light on in the bedroom since then the baby won’t sleep. I left my suitcase on the floor open... and I can’t tell my husband because he will be out to the car in five seconds. 

What do I do! I don’t think they have anywhere else for us to stay in their house. Especially since we don’t want our daughter keeping everyone awake all night. But I also have to live with this new secret until we leave on Monday... and I don’t want to not tell my husband and then have him find one and flip out. And we can’t just leave since we brought my brother with us and he’s having a good time here... I’m losing my mind. Would it be rude to tell them we might go get a hotel room? But then we have to leave in the early evening every night because my daughter has a bed time 😩. Not to mention hotel rooms and COVID risks. 

I’m sad. And mainly typing this because I have no one to talk to. :( 
 Does anyone have advice?",12Dec2020,1
401,"Just going to vent about how shitty I have been feeling lately and maybe you guys can help me with some advice or just listening to me since I really have no one to talk to about how low I’ve been feeling. 

My sleep schedule is horrible sometimes I won’t go to sleep until 9:00am and will wake up at like 4:00pm. I feel as though I have to force myself to get out of bed everyday. I’ve lost my social life and have 0 friends currently. I do have a boyfriend which is the only thing keeping me a little bit happy. He actually makes me leave the house but I do turn him down a lot. I lost my job and no one is really hiring in my area. I really haven’t been motivated in school, but have somehow kept my grades up. I’ve put on a ton of weight. I finally just detangled my hair after almost a month of leaving it in a tangled, unwashed bun. It takes everything out of me to get up and take a shower. A lot of the time I just lay in bed all day long scrolling on my phone. My laundry is just piling and piling but it’s just so overwhelming for me to do it. I hate feeling like this. I’ve been this low before and that was when I lost my best friend 2 years ago. 
I’m really embarrassed typing this and on the edge of crying. I haven’t cried in a while. I’ve been pretty numb lately but I’ve been drinking tonight and my drunk mom decided to call me out on my life so I feel really sad and embarrassed. I don’t want to live like this. I just feel as though I’ve lost all my motivation and am really self conscious lately.

402,"Some background...I’m staying in a small run down motel, you know the kind, thin walls, due to separation from wife. Neighbor is non blood related cousin/friend. Staying at this place on his recommendation and didn’t have another place to go.

This guy seems normal enough when you talk to  him, but he goes back to his room, I can hear him laughing at whatever he’s doing, watching tv, chatting with his friends online. NBD right? especially during COVID. 
Here’s the problem: he’s not just laughing. This mf is giggling, cackling, and belly laughing to himself like 95 percent of the time during the day.. it’s this really obnoxious, sustained laughter that makes me want to put my fist through the wall and ask him “what in the goddamn fuck is so funny that has a grown ass man laughing like a deranged toddler for 8 hours a day”
So obviously I am afraid to confront him because even though he always seemed normal to me over the years, I don’t know that he isn’t mentally ill somehow.  I know he smokes so maybe he’s  just really baked but, even then this is unreasonable. How the hell do I bring it up:“hey you’re laughing like a lunatic and I can hear it so, please stop? 

He claims he doesn’t hear me or anything I do so I guess he thinks I can’t hear him? I think he’s deaf! My old neighbors at my apartment were loud but this is different. He’s ten feet away from me behind a thin wall. It feels like he’s sitting right next to me laughing in my ear.",12Dec2020,1

404,"TLDR: things get under my skin more easily than with other people.

Luckily, this applies to both ends of the spectrum: I can get super excited about positive things and be the first one to nose-dive into emerging opportunities, which has led me to beautiful places and situations in my life. Socially, once I think someone's cool and we get really nice and interesting conversations going, I am generally ready to become best friends with that person. Some people have found that annoying, but luckily I got an extremely fulfilling relationship and some strong friendships from this behaviour, which I generally consider a win eventhough I don't have an incredible amount of friends.

On the other hand, I also experience the entirety of the other end of the spectrum: I am very sensitive to negative situations and consider stuff personal rather quickly. I don't necessarily want to dive too deep into the negatives of this personality trait, but I have finally reached a point where I am considering working on my behaviour.

Yesterday, I had a particular situation that I don't want to let under my skin. For context, I moved to another country 2 years ago and I am finally starting to reach about 99% fluency in the new language including cultural references, slang and all that. We had a Christmas dinner at my new company that i started to work with 2 months ago (it didn't happen in person of course, but online). It turns out that there is a certain culture regarding these sort of things here, that I was not prepared for. This stems from the general societal culture of this country, mixed together with some youth culture as the company consists of mostly young, 'hip' and cool people. Essentially, what people do here is prepare Christmas speeches for each other and essentially dump all the shit they got on you. Yesterday, I have heard some really embarrassing personal things said to other people and when it was my turn, literally the boss of the company read a letter to me in which he dragged my online presence through the mud. Obviousl, he didn't have much on me on a personal level, as I am the new guy, but he said enough shit to feel really sad and insecure now. Like as in: how did that person agree to sign me up, if he thinks that way about me?

As I said, a lot of people had their pants pulled down, so I know to not consider this as an attack on myself. I think what's going on here is that people here generally think it's very funny and it brings people together being able to laugh about themselves.

Nevertheless, I got trouble shaking this off. Does anybody have some advice?

410,"I'm (22F) have never really been close with my family. I moved to a different country when I was 17 and that was the best decision I've ever made. I do love my family, they are good people and I've never doubted their love for me but I still don't like them. We are just too different and incompatible. When I was living with my family, it used to feel like I was trapped. They would constantly judge me or tell me what to do and what to feel. They would also make fun of me too. I'm a quiet person and so they would always make fun of me being quiet, in front of their friends (You know saying things like 'cat got her tongue' or simply make fun of the way I speak which is usually in short sentences). So, it was just torture.

I've never been close with my sister, she was mostly away when I was growing up because she is a lot older than me. So, never had that sisterly bond with her. I used to be close with my brother, I enjoyed spending time with him but overtime we just grew apart. I used to trust him but he has become close minded over time and speaks like he is an expert in everything. So I've been slowly cutting contact with him too.

I don't know what to do with all this. Every time I see friends or dates talk about how they are so close with their family, I get jealous. How nice it must be to have your mom as friends whom you can talk to about anything. Or having a sister that's also your best friend. I also feel a bit nervous because I'm afraid people will assume things about me because I don't have a connection with my family. Isn't that a red flag people talk about?

Again, I love my family. They've been good about so many things. I mean, they've supported me, their 17 old, to move abroad by herself. There aren't that many families who would so something like this, have this much of trust. Growing up, they were never strict with me either. But still, I just don't have any connection with them, they were emotionally absent. Had they not been my family, I'd never befriend them. So, I kind of crave for a family that I could have. Parents and sibling that could also have been my friends, my safe heaven, people I could always rely on for emotional support.

I can choose two university, not every people can get it, i knew. But this is quite dilemma for me. If you asking did i wanted to go to uni ? Yes, i really wanted to.

Let me talk about my family financial situation first. So because this pandemic, my family is greatly affected. From the start of pandemic (roughly February), my mother is sent home by the company. But it doesn't mean she's working from home, she didn't get enough payment, it's barely 10% from regular salary, so my mother is technically not working. Other than my mother's income, there's no any income for my family. I've never allowed to work, my father is old, he can't do anything more. I have brother and sister, my brother is still on school not really a problem. But my sister is on boarding school. My family largest expenses her. In fact even before my family income getting cut, roughly 80% of that is to keeping my sister's boarding school. From her study and her living.

Now let's talk about my problem
My first Uni is a good one, top 50 in my country (developing, asia). The tuition fee is below average standard. It's quite far from my home. That's because it's quite far from home, there's going to be very expensive expenses. Especially rent which is very huge, according to my parents estimate (i accidentally overheard them). I applied students loan, but i failed.

My second Uni is not a very good one. I applied because i really don't want to add more expenses for family. It's close to home, i no need rent or something. I even can walk to there.

I really wanted the second Uni. The reason is, first, of course expenses. Second, it's computer science degree, while the first is psychology. I don't mind studying psychology. I really passionate for computer for quite a long time.

How can i say to my parents ? Obviously the first Uni having prestiges, that's why my parents wanted it. There's concerned about hard to do anything in the future if i choose the second Uni, because it's not really renown. And there's big stigma about it, because it's private university and my first Uni is National university.

I really don't care about it, as long i enjoyed and not carrying burden. I don't want my parents choice.",12Dec2020,1
413,"Tomorrow I will be meeting my sisters new (as of around 4 months) boyfriend who is visiting from the other side of the country.
My sister has a long history of extreme manipulation and extreme sociopathic behaviour. She is very good at presenting an endearing front for extended periods of time. However at some point the reason for the setup always shows up. In the past it has come in the form of her using people (both friends and family) as emotional dolls to play with and hurt once she has sunk her teeth in. Other times she simply leeches and takes as much money and attention as possible until the person is forced to rip her off.

My question is, should I warn him so that he can at least have the option to escape before he’s in too deep? Or should I pretend it’s all good and leave him to figure it out?

If I was to warn him I was thinking of typing a simple “she isn’t what she seems, leave while you can” note and showing him. I know it sounds extreme but I really would like to get the point across. I used to sleep with a weapon out of fear for my life when we lived in the same house.

415,"When I was in 5th grade, I met this kid and we quickly became best friends. We shared a love of videogames, and pretty much played Xbox together everyday. He was a little bit strange, but I didn’t really care, and we both got bullied a little bit but it was alright, we were cool together. But, once we entered 7th grade, he started to become really annoying. Once he stabbed me with a pencil as a joke, and didn’t seem to understand why I was not happy about it. He also threw stuff at me, like food and rocks, and I know this sounds pretty bad on his part, but he was actually a really good kid, he just didn’t know when he crossed the line. Well eventually I kept on getting more and more angry with him, and I stopped being friends with him. I had every right to do this, but what I did that was inexcusably wrong is that I started being mean to him too. We did get bullied, and now that I wasn’t part of his group anymore he basically took all of it on himself. I definitely didn’t do the worst of it, but I can recall a few instances where I was pretty mean to him and now that I’m a senior in highschool it haunts me now. He eventually went to a different school because of the bullying, and all the main bullies that were focused on him switched to me. I’m not really mad or upset about it, I feel like it’s deserved cause I abandoned my friend, so I forgave my bullies but i still carry the guilt of my actions. I know it is just that I feel some guilt, because it means that maybe I’m redeemable, but It’s getting to the point where it keeps me up at night, I spend hours thinking and regretting what I did, feeling horrible about the pain I caused. I’m looking for his phone number so I can call him and apologize, but I read some comments on the bullying subreddit that say that it would open old wounds, and it’s best just to not contact that person ever again.

417,"I am by no means a vegetarian or vegan and I love to eat meat, but I am in a peculiar situation that is giving me a mental block when I try to eat the pork I have in my freezer.

A few months ago, my family won a raffle for a pig from a 4H family. By all means, we're extremely lucky: we got the entire pig in various cuts.

I want to eat the pork, but there's a problem. When the family came to deliver the cuts to us, they told us a story about how the pig (including the nickname they gave it while they raised it) was scared to death to enter the truck to go to the slaughterhouse. How, when it realized where it was going, it squealed bloody-murder and tried to run away. How it thought it was simply going on a walk and getting a treat after.

I was mortified, and I haven't been able to eat the meat. The rest of my family have not suffered any of these issues.

But it's good meat. It's expensive meat that I don't want to waste.

How do I get over this? Every time I see it, I just think that this pig had a name, it was treated like a pet, and it was scared to die.

422,"I don’t mind buying presents my family is just toxic as hell and I’m so confused about how to act.

Small family but most of don’t have a whole lot of money to be honest. We get by month to month. My aunt sacrificed love for money, let me just be frank. Her husband is horrible and manipulative, probably a narcissist but I haven’t looked into it, it’s not really my business. He just makes all of us uncomfortable.

Anyway, in my family the adults don’t really buy each other presents. I honestly hope that changes when I get older because I would love to just buy my dad a red wine, my mom a good foundation and receive a face mask or a bath bombs myself or something. A small thing that still shows you but thought into it. I think my aunt ruined the whole thing to be honest? 

They tend to just stock up on creams, perfumes etc and whenever Christmas comes around they’ll hand those out as gifts and buy their OWN gifts and just tell people to pay for them. It’s very weird actually. My parents are divorced so my dad said a long time ago he only buys presents for the kids. My mom this year finally joined because she’s sick of my aunt, but I know my grandma got annoyed by it’s as well. My mom’s broke, she can’t afford those expensive gifts, but my aunt would never understand that. 

I usually hopped on my mom’s gift for older people. I will say I’ve managed to buy something for my cousin, mom, brother and grandma myself and I’m just missing out on aunt and uncle. I just can’t afford to spent 100$ on something they already bought? I like buying gifts but not on those terms. It’s like they stripped away everything nice about gifts and just made it very selfish. My aunt will throw a fuss, she gets worse and worse every year just in general.

Do I buy them something? If yes, then what? They have everything, I can’t think of a single thing they’d like that’s not like expensive as hell. 

For reference, I did spent around 100$ on clothes for my mom because she spend that kind of money on herself. Got a perfume that she’s been looking for for years and an angel for my grandma (she’s obsessed with angels). My cousin wanted money for a new phone and my brother is just getting some grooming supplies cuz we are on a very low budget for each other and that’s ok.

425,"Short rundown of my life thus far. I graduated high school many years ago confident in my career choice as a teacher, so I never really explored other career ideas at the time. 4 years into college and teaching, I realize not only am I bad at it, I'm miserable doing it too. It wasn't what I thought it was gonna be, it made me even more nihilistic and depressed. I was low on money after 4 years of college, and was not about to waste the thousands of dollars in certification testings for a job I no longer wanted (and didn't pay well to begin with), so I jumped ship into whatever would take my credits and wound up with a BA in Social Science.

Cue to me now, more than 3 years out of college with no job prospects outside of minimum wage retail, and I want out. Only good thing is my parents forked out most of my costs the first time around so I'm not currently in any debt. They won't do it again though and I wouldn't dream of asking. I already fucked up their gift to me once lol.

So here's the new plan, I'm not aiming for a job I think I'll like anymore. I already tried that and it left me flat on my ass. I don't really care if I hate it, I just want money. I'll do whatever I gotta to ensure I'm not living another 60-70 years in poverty wondering where my next meal is coming from without healthcare. If I'm gonna hate it though, it better pay well. At the same time, I can't help what I'm just not good at either. Idk how to know what I am good at though, I in all honesty don't have any remarkable talents. I'm painfully ordinary.

I need something that is not labor intensive. I have a plethora of medical issues, none of which qualify me for disability and protections under ADA unfortunately, but are debilitating enough to make me unhireable for a lot of jobs. I can't stand long periods, lift heavy weights, or be in non climate controlled environments. I'm also on the spectrum, so customer service type jobs or sales type jobs where charisma is important are things I struggle with. 

I was thinking about something to do with computers, since they seem to pay well and will likely be desk jobs. Cyber Security was on my radar, but if a general computer science degree will help more than hinder I'll take it. (My fear stems from already having an ""umbrella"" degree. Most places don't seem to want someone who is a jack of all trades, they want someone specialized.) 

I hesitate a little though because idk how I am with math anymore. In high school I was terrible which turned me off the idea of any career paths utilizing math, but I also had undiagnosed AD/HD so god knows how much of it was just that. The few math courses I took in college the first time around were rather good, granted it's not like I was taking very challenging courses, just the gen eds. I found them to be kinda refreshing once I got older, given I didn't have to try and guess what answer my professor was looking for like in other subjects. There's only one right answer you know?

I just don't want to repeat getting 3-4 years into a degree before realizing I'm terrible at it again. I considered going to a community college and getting a ""certificate"" first to see if I'm any good at it, and if I am using that as more transfer fodder to a university. Idk if that's just a waste of money though.

&amp;#x200B;

Idk where to really start with this tbh. Sorry if this is just kind of a mess of a post. I guess some key questions:

* What kind of careers would you suggest that are high paying (roughly 50k minimum) with little physical labor/customer service, preferably ones I can get done with school on quickly
* How can I ""test drive"" a career without wasting too much money on it? I don't want to be 4 years into a degree before I realize I suck at it again. Would getting a ""certificate"" in the subject at a com college first be useful to try it out, and just transfer the credits if I am good at it to get a real degree? 

Also if anyone has any general advice on going back to school despite already having a bachelors I'd appreciate it. I don't even know if there are financial aid type things I could apply for since I already have a degree, though I planned on discussing that with an academic advisor once I figured out what I'm going for and where I'm going to get it.",12Dec2020,1

Being home all the time, I began to think a lot more than I usually do. The people I knew from highschool are either married or started a family already. Always being compared to my relatives who are successful in their current occupations. 

Through life, I've never felt like I was ever good enough, it's hard to care when no matter how far you go you still get put down. I still care, I'm still trying but it's getting harder especially with my depression and anxiety getting worse these days. I've been having a hard time even breathing most of today. I think one of the reasons for my anxiety is because I'm into this one girl. We got close and used to hang out a lot until I introduced her to a friend group of mine. She 20f started talking a lot more and gaming with a friend of mine who is 32m. She is usually fawning over him because he is pretty much in the game, but her over behavior is different with her than around me. I honestly don't feel like I could measure up compared to him, my confidence these days are pretty low.

Don't get me wrong though, it's not that I haven't dated before, but I always struggle when it comes to feeling for someone one sidedly. I care about them both so I don't plan to cause any drama. In the end I don't think it's worth it, I just want to get over this feeling. It's just that when I see the two get along so well, I get really anxious. I've been hanging with other friends these days to try getting my mind off things and move forward, but I don't know what to do? I also don't plan to say anything to them. It's not my right to say anything. I'm just struggling a lot right now, please help.",12Dec2020,1
428,"Hi everyone, first time post to reddit! I (22F) recently moved to a new city and new apartment. The major downside is the floors are SUPER creaky, so I hear my upstairs neighbours walking around. I’m particularly bothered by this at 5AM, where I get woken up when they get out of bed and I can’t fall back asleep. This happens multiple times per week. I’ve tried earplugs but I’m paranoid I won’t hear my own alarm if I fall asleep with the earplugs in. I’m not sure if they have carpet or not (my apartment has carpet and my floors are quite noisy as well). Is there any tactful way I could ask them to keep it down? I feel weird because all they’re really doing is walking around.

Thanks in advance!",12Dec2020,1
430,"Hi, 

I'd really love some advice on how to go through diplomacy with my landlord. Nothing that pertains to legal advice, but just... if I can maybe change her mind?

So I recently rented a nice apartment (I live in Estonia if that is significant) that had ""pets allowed"" in its ad. We also have a clause in the contract that says pets are allowed with the written permission of the landlord, as well as the fact that I asked if I could bring in pets when I came looking at the apartment in person and they said yes, given all the usual conditions - that it won't annoy neighbours with barking, won't eat the furniture, etc. 

So a few months pass and I arrive at the decision that I should finally adopt a cat. I start making the preparations as well as e-mail the landlord for the previously stated permission to bring the cat in, and suddenly, she says no. She says cats and dogs are not allowed because then she can't rent the apartment to people with allergies afterwards. (bit of a weird heel-turn imo considering ""pets allowed"" but I suppose I never asked for \*specifics\*) ... So I make an offer that she can order the apartment to be cleaned with my deposit money whenever I move out, and she still says no. I really like this apartment so I am considering asking the third time and making some specific offer or trying to convince her in some way, but I am not sure how to go about it. If she says no again, I'm definitely going to move out, but I have to give a 3-month notice, which is not ideal. I even went to visit the local shelter and picked a lovely black cat just before I received the unexpected 'no' - what to do?",12Dec2020,1

432,"I try to be logical and emotionless about all my decisionmaking, although I sometimes weigh emotional factors like stress into value estimates. I'm entirely selfish. My goals in life do not involve enjoyment, they're quests where I have to get specific things done and after that can move along gracefully.

For many years I've gone back and forth between being good and evil, and I have very personal feelings for longing for either. I'm not expecting Redditors to advocate for evil, but I hope someone in the comments of this post can convince me to be good, despite being who I am.

I know morality not only as restricting oneself from intending to do unjust violence but also being cautious to uphold some respects for others. Respects like agreeing with their ownership of property, not invading their privacy, paying them back if you accidentally break their property, and having manners. With morality, you wouldn't just do these things to not get in legal trouble or have a good reputation. In summary, I believe morality is a curtosy and all people who are moral are nessesarily altruistic.",12Dec2020,1
433,"I’ve tried to convince him to get therapy. We were friends for 3 years. Then we dated and broke up. I was the only person he’s ever “cared” about. He is diagnosed with sociopathy and alexithymia. He seemed perfect and was funny and we got along fine, but I got disturbed by a lot of things, mainly his hobby of looking at gore. He’s told me it’s the only thing that made him happy, and it was the only time I ever saw happiness on his face. He found videos of a man crying in front of his hanged kids, women in freezers, people getting their heads chopped off with axes, babies being run over by trucks. Horrible things like that. He tried to get me to enjoy it too, but I’m traumatized by it. His eyes would light up when he saw it, and he would laugh like a kid getting candy. He was really truly enjoying it. The more horrific the video was, the more he enjoyed it he told me, and he explained his favorite was a video of a man’s son being skinned and dismembered in front of his crying, screaming father who then had to face the same thing. I don’t even like typing that. 

I noticed him become more aggressive with this halfway through our relationship. I’d never once seen him happy except for with things like that, and when I asked him once how he knew how to tie hands up so well, he said he was practicing because it’ll make him happy later. This man doesn’t care about sex. Alexithymia is a condition that renders him void of emotion whatsoever, that he pretended he didn’t have. He told me my favorite quality about me is that I’m trusting. When we slept in bed together once, I was pretending to be asleep because I didn’t have the energy for a conversation and I wanted to relax and fall asleep, and he ran his fingers over my neck. We got in a fight because I slapped him because he dug nails in. 

His gore obsession (now 3 months after we’ve broken up, we barely talk) has gotten much worse and what I mentioned earlier is somehow less disturbing than what he’s told me he watches now. (I’ve asked him.) He just turned 19. His behavior just disturbs me. The more comfortable he became around me, not from an emotional connection, the more.. creepy everything got. In our fight when we broke up, which was one sided because I was mad he faked everything, he was calm and told me every single person is just useless or useful to him, and I was the only useful one he had ever met. He has never had a single friend other than me - he has avoided public school since kindergarten. He would never admit to me that he hurt animals for fun when he was younger, but his mom told me he did when I had asked.

His views towards animals concern me. I loved his cat. He got angry every time she walked in the room and looked like he wanted to hurt her. He said that she was a useless animal and waste of oxygen because she serves no purpose. This isn’t at all out of character. At 1 month in, I didn’t really have friends, and I was just distancing myself from him to be alone. 
Whenever he sees babies, he grabs his arms so hard they bleed. He tears them open with his nails because they frustrate him. He left the room when we were around my then 2 year old niece because he said he wanted to kill her. 

I don’t know what to do because I truly believe he is going to hurt someone.",12Dec2020,1

I recognized that she also used his car to get to work and once she got her own (brand new) car under her dads insurance she left him. He wants to be nice and stay friend with her but she is constantly dragging the fact that she has to pay rent (with her aunt+she can live with her parents if she wanted to but she just simply doesn’t want to) and she has to pay for school (she decided to go) and works (where she receives a pretty good pay), yet she texts my brother “ugh I’m stressed” and sends him the bill and because he’s still in love with her he pays it for her.

Lost contracted work in March (company I was consistently growing sales of) 

Was told it would come back nothing personal etc 

Had no contact for 2 months and follow up email ignored at 1 month 

Started arguing due to the stress of having no money to live on and lack of communication Realised I messed up with some work I did previously. 

Offered to fix my mistake for free &amp; start over. Finally response after a month asking me to fix it and they  pay to fix it so we can ""draw a line under it""

I asked If this meant I would get more work and they told me they can't answer at this point. I've responded again &amp; had no answer for 8 days now I apologised again and offered to fix it all for free if we can start again fresh. Explained how I can't justify 1 time pieces of work as I need a job.

Should I follow up again at some point if I get no response? Or should i just let it go? I don't want to be used for some specific work and then discarded.

They are very busy over christmas due to the type of business. Potentially follow up in the new year? Feels like I'm hanging onto a lost cause at this point and any help is appreciated

441,"I'll try to give as many details as possible, without being redundant or annoying.

So in my country, government voted in favor of allowing pension administration institutions to release 20% of people's pension savings, due to the pandemic destroying several small businesses and hurting economy in general. The payment was released in two parts of 10% of total savings amount.

Me and my family went through 5 years of absolute financial horror due to the house owner of the house where we have lived since 2001 deciding to kicks us without warning in 2015. We unlawfully used the house during this time due to the illegality of kicking people out of houses without a proper eviction order. Happily, after the release of the first 10% of retirement savings, and the delicate situation of credit/consumption in the country, the banks reformulated the requirements for getting a mortgage and we were able to finally buy our house, although,the purchase is still in progress. 

During this time the mental health of me, my mom and my brother severely deteriorated, just recently things are starting to look better. My brother had work leave for psychiatric reasons during 6 months, and my mom too due to torn rotator syndrome. My dad had a very well paid job, and I worked 2 and even 3 jobs at the same time to pay the bills (1 full time job and other teaching and art related jobs). Thanks to government financial aid in countries like Australia, I got a lot of art commissions during the quarantine period and I manage to save 2.1k USD (this has added the second 10% of retirement savings).

So, now that things are starting to look better moneywise, I'm considering buying an anime figure. The thing is, this figure has an erotic connotation, it represents a naked young woman in a not particularly erotic posture (if that makes sense). It will help me as a anatomy model, and kind of cut some corners in the stylization aspect of my drawings that oftentimes are a bit too realistic and uninteresting stylewise.

My concern is the opinion of my family, and the price of the figure. Its worth 270 USD. So, I already have have a anatomical model, but has proven to be difficult to read due to its texture being too shiny. I also own a book by the japanese artist Houtengeki, that teaches how to draw attractive women. My mom and brother seemed to like the book, and my dad only notorious reaction towards it was ""wow those breasts are huge"". 

Both my mom and dad have a pretty relaxed attitude towards sexuality in general. And that is one of my concerns, because the figure could be interpreted as masturbatory aid instead of art (and it's a reasonable interpretation, people have reservations towards life drawing and it's understandable). Also, both my mom and dad have manifested to me their interest in me getting a partner and having kids , which I have responded with hostility (maybe more than necessary to get my point across. I'm 28 right now, and I have never had a partner because I'm a dwarf). My mom insists that having a child will help with my mental health and will give me a reason to live, after my struggles with suicide, but after my life experience,  I've become a antinatalist. My dad has mentioned to me before that he thinks my depression has to do with my singleness (which is partially true, but with time has lost relevance as a mental health issue). My brother seems to be completely sure that I eventually will have kids of my own, and doesn't engage very much in that discussion with me.

With all this information in mind, what do you guys think about buying the figure? Should I buy it?

443,"I guess the title sums it up. I first got interested in this group about a year ago, and I really enjoy their content. I feel really bad about just making this post.

I’ve managed to transition from a heavy crush on my favourite out of the group to practically wanting to be him. All my spare time is spent thinking about these people to the point i regularly check their liked tweets on Twitter and similar for any other platform they’re on. It’s made worse by the fact they make content every day, and the fact it seems to be the only thing making me happy at the moment after losing all motivation for hobbies and academia. 

Even if I’m not obsessing over them as people, I’m thinking about how much happier I would be if I had a group of friends like theirs or a life like theirs. Half my time is spent thinking about them and the other half is spent trying to be them. It’s starting to make me depressed that I’m not one of these content creators. 

The worst part is I don’t take part in the ‘stan culture’ - I don’t have any social media dedicated to them. I don’t understand why I care about them so much, but I do know if I let this go on I could legitimately impact my own life. I really want to continue enjoying the content, but I don’t want to be this obsessive fan anymore. I just want to stop.

444,"A bit of backstory. Apologies, but I don't really know how to summarize this with a TLDR.  


At the age of 21, I was diagnosed with a fairly common congenital heart defect known as bicuspid aortic valve, with dilation of the ascending aorta. The rapid deterioration of my health forced me to drop out of school and put my life indefinitely on hold. At the same age, I underwent an aortic repair surgery by an expert surgeon who told me he was confident that my valve would hold for most of my life following the procedure. Despite his reassurances, the recovery process from the surgery was a living hell. Not only was the minimally invasive route not possible due to the swelling of my heart, but I would later go on to develop both pericarditis and a staph infection in the incision site. The six months of blood thinners was an added layer of hell, as I suffered every possible side effect imaginable from them.  


Despite the utter hell I've endured up until this point, I maintained that it was all worth it, until not too long ago. After a routine checkup with my cardiologist, who assured me everything was fine, I received a phone call later on; My valve showed signs of deterioration already. The degree of said deterioration is not yet clear, and it must not be so pressing since my cardiologist wants to hold off on doing a more intensive examination for a few months, but I already know what this means. Stenosis of the valve can only lead to one real possibility, another surgery.  


Between getting a mechanical valve which will require blood thinners that caused me additional misery, or getting a biological one that will require replacement every 10-15 years(if I'm lucky), thus putting me through the hell of recovery on a decadal basis, I've already determined the third route, and I'm sad to say that I find it most appealing.  


I have every right to refuse any more surgery, and I'm fully aware doing so will cause my death. I'm also aware that I'm not guaranteed a quick passing in my sleep, and that a fatal aortic aneurysm could most definitely occur while I'm wide awake. But I'm just so fucking tired. I'm more tired than anyone my age deserves to be. I dream of simply finishing my degree, only to have it put off because of my heart health, every time. My youth has faded so quickly, I've aged so considerably from the physical and mental stress of this. I don't wake up with an excitement for life anymore. Honestly, the prospect of death has become so disturbingly attractive that I don't talk about it with other people out of fear of being committed. My early 20s have been nothing but suffering, and I see no reason to suspect that it'll get any better. If this is the prime of my life, then I KNOW that the road to come will be even worse.  


I don't want to die, I'd much rather live. I'd love to finish my degree, have a career, a family even. But I also don't want to play this game of surgery every so many years or blood thinners that I react to horribly for LIFE. I'd much rather die young, on my own terms. I've said as much to my mother, who's still in denial and thinks I'm just being difficult. But I'm not, and I'm planning on drawing up a will as soon as possible. I've not told my friends my decision, and the reality of it won't be really apparent to them for some time.   


I know there will be pushback against my choice, and I'm prepared for that. But how do I get them to accept my decision so that I can enjoy whatever time I have left peacefully? I don't want to spend however many years I have left with them begging me to do so something that ultimately kills me, even though it sustains my failing body. I want to go on my own terms, and I want them to accept that and be there for me until the end.

447,"I had a friendship with a girl (both 15F at the time, now 16F, 5 months older than her) at first it was really good. We FaceTimed every day, texted every day / even in class, and later even ended up telling each other traumatic experiences that happened to us that we didn't even tell some people in our real life. We stop being friends due to fading away, I kind of distanced myself from social media, and strangely iMessage, and later we started to be friends again. 

I know there is some abusive relationships that other people look at and it's like ""obviously this is an abusive relationship"" but sometimes when people are going through it, they don't realize that it's abuse, and if I were to tell you the whole history of our friendship, you'd probably be thinking, ""yeah this was a toxic ass friendship""

But, when you look back at it, we were both very mentally abusive to each other. And without trying to explain it all, we were friends for a year, and it started to become toxic about a year and a half in, we fell out and we were on extremely bad terms, she told our mutual friends online what I did publicly, and I guess you can say I got canceled. I was called sick, disgusting, psycho, everything. I didn't tell what she did because one, honestly I know there are people who have the mindset of ""if I go down you go w/ me"" but I didn't want to see her lose support, like at that time I just thought it would be really cringe for me to say ""hey well did she tell you she did this"" and then for them to turn on her, I guess I just think it would've seemed not satisfying, and two, I honestly didn't wanna deflect. I knew at that time it was my time to face the music.  After I deleted my social media's, a while after that we had a conversation and she apologized. But ever since I can honestly say I've been in the worst mental state of my life. I struggle from substance abuse, developed an eating disorder, have multiple mental breakdowns a day, intrusive thoughts, bipolar disorder, and don't keep up with hygiene. And, basically, the reason why we were friends, is because honestly, when we were on good terms, we were so compatible for each other, we could talk to each other about anything and everything, we both bonded on a specific interest, we were just one of those people who could have nothing but each other in a room and enjoy each other. 

But it's been a few months, and she reached out to me and wanted to try being friends again, I still carry the guilt, for what I did. Even when we were friends and on good terms, sometimes I'd tell myself I don't deserve to have her as a friend, because she was so amazing. On the other hand, I feel like I would be such an ass kisser. Like, ""she embarrassed you online, publicly humiliated you, and although what you did was disgusting, she was just as guilty. If you become friends w/ her, that'll be the biggest ass kissing move of a lifetime"", but I also feel like with me now being in therapy, I would be a better version of myself, so, should I be friends with her again, while I work on myself, even if it takes time and then try once more, or should I let it go?",12Dec2020,1

She even told me that if people do believe me that they’ll just tell me that I’m lucky to be having sex with her and that she won’t get in trouble because it’s not rape because girls can’t rape boys. I know she’s wrong about the last part but I think she’s right about people just telling me that I’m lucky because I’m a boy if they do believe me. I remember my dad and uncle saying that when there was a thing on the news about a boy who had sex with his teacher so I’m pretty sure she’s right and that’s partly why I haven’t told my parents about it. I really want to tell someone about it because I can’t stand the thought of her touching me and making me do things with her but I know that she’s right about what will happen if I tell on her and I think it that everything will just get worse if I do tell.,12Dec2020,1

Some days I feel totally unfaced, convinced and confident but other days at the slightest notion of a problem I'll feel like giving up, like there's no point to life, that I'm not strong enough to face all these trials, that there are no rewards.

Also, will black race be the next white race, and the dogs or cats be the next black people? And there will be interspecial marriages or relationships which will be looked down, and there will be groups like DogLivesMatter, or Male Dogs fucking the future black female or mixed race female population commenting Dog Power and then those dogs will write articles on how their ancestors were treated as pets and seens as inferior? And then black females or mixed female population join a liberal team to support DogLivesMatter and have sex with Male Dogs as a homage to what the humans did to their species? And then Dogs just take over all the world regardless whether they just bark, 
the scientists will conduct research on how the dog brain is small and how dogs never had any stable society, and then the DogLivesMatter activists would just say that they didn't have freedom to think on their own and that's why never had a stable society?

I'm having a really hard time catching the Z's and I seem to have these periods of happiness and extreme sadness.

My parents fight a lot and my dad has become very easily irritable and has become very delusional/abusive over the last 2 years, since he lost his job in a big oil company. He's become one of those Facebook dad's who are hateful and toxic. He has also become very selfish and is acting without any concern for anyone. Sometimes he's caring, and other times he's an absolute monster to my family. He also lies to me, telling me my mother is crying and is sad that I have ended up how I am right now.

459," posting on my alt account since I find it embarrassing

tl;dr was sexually harassed at work 4 years ago, quit, now have had bad anxiety since looking for other jobs

So I was working for a common retail computer store in the UK for the Christmas holidays but got brought on full time after, everything was going fine until a manager switch happened.

Shortly after he would tell me inappropriate jokes and talk about how it was last night with his fiancé and so on which I would laugh about since its 'lad talk' but this eventually turned into light petting which started making me feel awkward, it started taking a darker turn shortly after with him on one occasion forcing me to kiss him and him groping me more than one occasion.

I started feeling trapped and started feeling like it was a normal thing until a few moments after it had happened then I would think about it and know it was wrong and made me feel awkward, I used to think I would react if someone would try something like this before it happened but when at the moment I felt like he had authority over me and I didn't want to lose my job because I was overreacting.

It wasn't until around 8 months of this had passed that he started calling me into the manager's office telling me he will put me on warnings and he could fire me that I started feeling that it had gotten too far and decided to make a complaint to the store manager who called HR and the district manager over the issue to come to talk to me,

When talking to the HR person I was getting a kind of weird vibe from the district manager who was giving me a kind of angry dirty look as I was talking about what was happening,

I was given a booklet which had to be kept in the backroom to write down any issues I have which were awkward in itself cause I couldn't stop thinking whenever I go into the back room because that's where the toilets and break room was people would assume I was going to write them up in my most likely useless booklet,

I left shortly after because it no longer felt like a safe and friendly environment I just kept feeling awkward around everyone as they had fired the manager who was harassing me.

I assumed people might have thought I snaked him without knowing the full story.

I was told shortly after by one of my friends who still worked there that he was rehired at another location pretty much just down the road.

This whole situation forced me to come out as homosexual to my parents because I felt like I had no one else to talk to since trying to talk to my friends they just said it was normal and 'lad stuff' but it felt more than that since he was forcing me to do things that I didn't want to do and made me feel like I couldn't do anything because he had the managerial power.

I've since been on SSRI for depression and anxiety since I fell into a deep depression for 2 years literally not washing or leaving my bed but even after so long (literally 4 years) I still find it incredibly hard to even look for work because I can't stop thinking about everything that had happened and how trapped I felt.

my main question is how do I get over this and find work? I have a drive and want to work but it's like something takes over me when I actually get to the point of applying and looking for work and shrouds me in anxiety because of what happened.",12Dec2020,1

I was 13 when I got pretty badly bullied and had alot of shit going on at home like I was having issues with parental abuse and sexual assault all the while this girl and her friends (who I used to be pretty close with) were ignoring and tormenting me. I was already pretty anxious and now I feel like everyone hates me. She came over and started ranting at me saying she never bullied me and if I was having such a hard time I should've come and talked to her about it. She justified the bullying when it was at its worst point. I was stood outside school waiting for my friends who had abandoned me (but I didn't realise this until after) and she came up with a big group of people (maybe 20-30 people) and surrounded me and yelled at me for 5-10 minutes. I got all of this on camera and she said this was because I ""lied"" about her bullying me. I admitted that maybe I had exaggerated things as my anxiety made things feel much worse than then were realistically but I still felt upset and aggrieved. I just want to put it all behind me - I happened almost 4 years ago now and I got new friends, new school and moved on but after she said I should apologise and feel bad I just feel really shitty.

We went out to dinner twice and she came over my house to watch a movie. She just got broken up with 2 months ago so I didn't say anything at first but I've always kind of liked her and so 4 days ago I decided to tell her directly how I feel. When I did this, she basically said she doesn't feel the same way. She also said she's thought about it but didn't really clarify what that meant, then went onto say she kindve sees me as family,  but yet juggled the idea of FWB. I told her I don't really do that. She continued to say she really wants to stay friends and I told her it's not that good of an idea for me. It sucked but it was handled maturely and I left feeling like I left no stone unturned. The next day I talked to my best friend about it and he told me she showed up to their house right after we had that talk and she was crying about how she felt like she had lost a friend. I know to just keep moving forward but the situation is unique to me and I don't really understand why she is more upset than me, the person who got rejected, as we didn't spend a whole lot of time together although conversations did get a little personal at times.

466,"I've got myself in a situation here, where a friend of mine has been seeing this girl who is one of the worst people I have ever seen but likes to play moral superior all the time. Both have spread rumours about other people in our friend group in the past, some of which have been severe enough to almost warrant police attention. my friend has since grown out of it but she hasn't.

I was recently targeted by this girl after having my dog pass away last month, he died of old age at 16. One of the guys in our group informed me that she had been saying my family were dog abusers after we left him with my aunty for 6 months due to my parents divorce, she liked to spoil him and over fed him to a point where he was almost obese. We managed to correct this though which was difficult since at that time he was a senior dog.

Anyway I confided in a mutual friend of the group who was outside the situation hoping to know what to do and clear my head, I told him about the stuff that had been done in the past which involved the guy who told me about all this in the first place, who was falsely accused of sexual assault, which years later this girl tried to start up again to spread gossip. I tried to show how this was done in the past and is being done to me currently. 

Anyway the guy went and told my friend who was the victim of all this and has gotten angry at me, I didn't expect him to be angry as I was heavily involved in the situation back then too. I don't really know what to say or do as I'm angry myself with how these dog abuse accusations have been kept from me and my friends enabled that and never once stuck up for me in front of her, I've been in tears about it several times. I can't talk about it with the friend who is seeing this girl as he will fight her corner no matter what and I'm not even sure he knows about it and even if he does the two of them will escalate it further and further and with my familys situation right now I can't deal with that.

I've tried to do my best by this friend group although I've made many mistakes myself. I am disgusted this has been kept from me for years and I'm upset I've managed to anger one of my friends trying to get my feelings out of my system. I just don't know how to convey my anger to the few that will understand and have them take it seriously. I've tried to get people to stand up to her before but no one will bother because of how unstable they can be.

467,"I have the constant urge to hurt people. Constantly. I have suffered no traumas before( guess this is important to say). I am not saying that my life has been perfect, I have had depression and my parents can me strict sometimes, but overall I am okay I guess. I want to hurt people that hurt me, not innocent people. Seems “normal” until now but is not that simple. I want to torture them. I have really sick fantasies( if that is what we can call it) about doing it. I used to be a really exploding child, my temper has always been really short but I managed to control it. I still have short temper but I hide it well, at least I try. Most torture if not all are with men( guess this is important to say). I don’t know if I developed some hatred for them.
it has been a year or so since this started emerging in my head and it’s getting harder to control it. That is why I am posting this here. 
I don’t only want to hurt people physically but mentally. Humiliate them. For some reason. It feels like there are two people living inside me and idk what to do. There is the me around other people and the me alone. When all those thoughts start to emerge. I am afraid of what I might do if I have the chance. If I go out of control. I live in constant fear of that.
my sexual fantasies are also not great. I have weird masochistic thoughts. I think to say things in sex that are just disturbing. I am even ashamed to write what I think of. Is just sick and I hate it. The things I think make me feel really guilty. I was sexually assaulted once before and it is weird how much i hate the guy but still talk to him
I can’t get attached for too long because for me people are entirely disposal. I can love someone but I have never been faithful. But I loved them, ik i did. I loved my past boyfriends a lot, i just didn’t want sex only with them. I always want something new, get bored pretty easily with people. But i want to hurt men, but i love sex. I don’t get this. I want to hurt people so badly sometimes.
i like self harming too, I do it a lot. For some reason it makes me feel good. Sometimes i hurt myself mentally, sometimes physically
I don’t know how to talk to people about this, how to ask for help. People won’t get it. I just need help please, I don’t want to hurt anyone. I know what is right or wrong, but what if this “other me” just overshadows the normal me one day. I am empathetic I feel love. I think that is the only thing that have kept me from doing anything. I feel regret and remorse

469,So I’ve always had problems with my family my whole life. I’ve always been treated differently then my siblings. For example I can’t defend myself from physical or emotional abuse without being called names or everyone teaming up against me. So I was asking around for advice here asking how would I deal with my situation. Where I heard my parents might kick me out when I turn 18. I’m in a small town and can’t drive due to them not wanting to teach me. After hours going by of solutions being suggested someone suggested the military. I felt like it would work.  But I thought about it more. I wouldn’t survive I can barely stand when my family yells at me what makes me think that I can stand some stranger yelling at me for being a dumbass and screwing something up? So I posted in a different subreddit and someone suggested a GoFundMe me.  Would are ur guy’s opinion on me doing this?

470,"I'm almost 21. ever since i was 16 i have been depressed because of severe bullying, this has caused me anxiety in social situations and to not leave the house much. early on i resorted to using drugs. i progressed from weed into anti depressants (not prescribed just to get to the point where i was a walking zombie fighting the drug) then  into mdma and lots of psychedelics. im passed most of my drug days in my 20s, i have quit my last drug couple months ago. during this period i let myself go, i got fat and avoided most social situations that i didn't use drugs to build the courage to do it.

Now that im off drugs i find it very hard to restart my life. I have lost most of my friends during this process except one who did lots of drugs with me. I now sit at home wondering where i went wrong while everyone i know is out having fun and partying their youth away when i cant even build the courage to get out of the house and meet some new people.

474,"Sorry this ended up being way longer than I expected. I don't even know if Im posting this to the right subreddit Im just tired and in need of someone to talk to about this.

A couple months ago I broke my arm (the lower part of my humerus bone, right above the elbow) and have had to have a few x rays since then to make sure everything is healing. The first x ray a few months ago was completely fine, a nice old lady did took the photos and it was over within 5 minutes. I had another x ray a few days ago and the experience was really different and has left me feeling uncomfortable.

A lady came out to get me from the waiting room and took me to a change room area. I was really confused by this. She told me to take off my shirt and bra and put on a covering that they supplied. I was a bit shocked as last time I did not have to do anything like this and I was wearing a short sleeve cotton t-shirt both times.

After I got changed, she took me to the x ray room and there was a man waiting for me. He introduced himself and he made a bit of smalltalk until she left. He then started positioning me up against the board to take the photos and was just really touchy about it. I don't know if this is just me overreacting or if it was him behaving inappropriately. The covering I had on didn't have a proper back so when positioning me he would sort of stroke up and down my exposed spine. I was embarrassed by this and I just tried to pretend that I thought he was behaving normally. He kept having to 'retake' the X-rays because of something being wrong so he would have to reposition me over and over again while stroking my back, arms and sometimes my waist.

For the third angle of my arm that he needed to get an X-ray of, he said he had never taken a photo like that before. It was a photo where I faced the board (my back was facing the x ray machine) and had my arm tucked up as if it was in a sling (my hand was on my collar bone and my elbow towards the start of my ribcage). He seemed really confused by this photo and spent maybe 10 minutes arranging me to get the right angle. During this time he asked if I would take of the covering I had on as it would be easier for hime to see how to line me up (which doesn't even make sense as the covering was already pretty much exposed at the back).

This is where I was an idiot. To be honest I was really scared of what would happen if I said no. He was significantly taller and larger than me, I'm a 17 year old girl and he was at least 35 if not 40 and while I can hold my own, my dominant arm is really weak due to the break and I didn't see myself being able to fight him off or defend myself. The entire time I was terrified of his touches and the way he was behaving towards me and I just figured it would be easier if I agreed to what he said.

I stupidly took the covering off and he rearranged me while I faced away from him. He was breathing on my neck and at the point I was preparing myself for the worst. He took the x ray then asked me to turn around and face him 'for the next xray'. I knew he didn't need to take one of me in that position however I didn't know how to tell this man no. I turned around, I was able to semi cover some of my chest with the arm I had up hanging up from the previous xray but I was pretty much completely exposed to him. I have quite a large chest for my frame and I couldn't cover myself without using my other arm/hand however there was no use as I wasn't able to move as it would 'ruin the shot'.

Eventually he finished, I think about 20 minutes had passed when my first appointment took about 5. He told me to put the covering back on then walked me through the hallways back to the change room. I got changed, the receptionist gave me the photos and then I left. The fourth xray of me facing him wasn't included with the other prints, I don't even know if he ended up taking it as the Dr had not asked for it.

Now I just feel empty and violated. This happened a couple days ago and I still haven't really recovered I guess. I just feel angry and sad that I allowed myself to get in that position. I really don't feel comfortable telling parents about this as I am worried they will overreact. I really don't want anyone to know this has happened to me. I guess Im asking for advice on how do I move on with my life? I don't want to feel so gross anymore, I really want to let myself move on but I can't stop obsessing over everything that happened. I'm really overwhelmed with anger towards myself for taking off the covering and allowing him to touch me the way he did. Any advice on getting over this would be really appreciated, even just writing out this post which has turned more into a rant has made me feel a little bit better.

476,"**LONG POST - Sorry.** 

I need help on how to deal with my current situation. I can't go in to a lot of detail, because I'll just start crying over it all, and I'm trying hard to move forward. I got with my current partner that I met through work. We started recieving emails/snapchats/facebook messages from an anonymous person. We found out quickly it was someone we worked with (certain information only available through work e.g). 

At first, they made out that I wasn't good enough for him, that I was fat and ugly and all the usual bully tactics and that he deserved better. Then we found out it was actually a man who was 'in love' with me and said that my partner was messaging loads of girls and meeting other women etc.   
My partner immediately sent me a screenshot of everything to prove that he wasn't. Due to all of this, I deleted my social media accounts (except Reddit obviously)  


Some time later, he asked me to move in. Now I have 2 children and this was a big step. He got overwhelmed (not realising what 2 kids can bring to a normally empty home), and I found out he was messaging a woman. From the messages I saw, it wasn't regarding sex - he apparently wanted to meet for a coffee, but the type of girl this is makes me very sure that she would have tried it on with him. They've slept together in the past, and it broke my heart - I am 100% in love with this man, but I'm not a fool and I won't tolerate cheating. We talked about everything and I made the decision to stay with him, but if I couldn't get over it then I couldn't get over it.   
(There's clearly more to this but I don't have the mental capacity to go through it all again.)

I recieved an email from an anonymous email - Guerilla Mail? - that apparently deletes itself after an hour. It's untraceable according to the information I can find. It said something along the lines of: ""You have a surprise waiting for you at home, just to show I'll be there when he hurts you.""  
I was worried - obviously, but it was all for nothing. Nothing turned up at the house - no presents or gifts or anything creepy. 

I've just recieved an email today which says:

**""Isn't it funny how you deletd fb to get away from me and my messages (which i agree was probably the right thing to do), and** ***my partner*** **said he was going to delete everything but he still has fb - which by the way he's showing as single on it. who knows who hes messaging on there?? it wouldnt surprise me if he was on snapchat too - can u really trust him?**

Just to add to this: my partner did delete snapchat and instagram but he kept Facebook mainly due to messenger and old work friends. He doesn't use it often - not like 'normal' people do. And it wouldn't surprise me if he hasn't updated anything because he's just not that way inclined regarding facebook.   
But as you can imagine, this all has been taking it's toll on me and I'm not sure what to do. I really don't want to get the police involved and I don't believe there's much they can do anyway as it's untraceable. I haven't even told my partner about this current email because I don't want to bring the past up again and get emotional over things I'm trying to move forward from in my life. Obviously, I can't go in to details about the ins and outs of my relationship - but things have felt good lately. I've told him that I'm absolutely terrified of him hurting me again the way he did and I know that if he has been messaging anybody or snapchatting anyone, then I would have to leave. I'm not going to give4 my kids that sort of role model. And I keep flicking between believing him entirely and then having doubts creep into my head and start questioning things...then I think, this is what my stalker wants. He wants me to have these doubts. And I go around and around in circles. I've considered having Facebook again, and hopefully be able to weedle out who it is, but then I'm opening myself up to new messages etc. 

I've been trying to journal and get my negative thoughts out on paper so I don't have to think about them again, and to be fair, it has been working. But I just feel like I'm going to end up spiralling. It's almost like not knowing who or what to believe.

479,"‪I would like a stranger’s perspective for this 

a friend of mine who I am quite close to and have been able to open up abt bad experiences of my life after not being able to do so for years, recently sent me a very triggering tiktok that just talks abt my trauma and not even as form of advice for how to deal with it, I don’t know how to explain the tiktok in detail but basically it was someone sharing their traumatic event of the same nature of mine I guess in form of humor for themselves, joking about it, which is ok for themselves, but what bothered me is why on earth she thought it would be ok to send that to me ? knowing fully it’s hard for me to talk or see relating stuff to my own traumatic event which as stated before I was able to open up to her because she offered me help and support which she did at the moment. 

After she sent that tiktok I asked why she did it and she just told me she was sorry and she doesn’t know why she sent it, so I proceeded to explain to her that I don’t like seeing things related to it and it makes me uncomfortable but she didn’t reply afterwards and has been ghosting me ever since it happened which it’s what makes me mad, why she is doing that instead of trying to discuss this because I would like to make things clear about what bothered me and why

and the ghosting just really hurts me because it is a serious matter to me, I am doubtful if I am making this a bigger deal than what it is and if I am allowed to still be mad even though she said she was sorry, maybe I am just seeking validation for what I am feeling 

I would like to ask what would you do in this case? should I just reach her myself? am I being prideful for not wanting to do so ?

488,"Hi reddit,

Firstly I just want to say that I am totally aware of how awful I am going to look with this post (hence the anonymous account).  And while I am fully prepared for, and deserve, any shame that may be coming my way, I would also be very grateful for any advice that any of you may be able to offer to me.

Around a decade ago, when I was 18 years old, I began having some unusual sexual fantasies (specifically revolving around me getting hurt, and sometimes quite badly) and ended up joining a kinky website, in an attempt to meet someone in which I could live some of these fantasies out with.  I was interested in some pretty dark stuff at the time.

I got speaking with, and eventually ended up meeting, a guy from one of these websites, a ""dominant"".  He was around about 50 years old, and I was aged 18.  At some point, I'm not sure exactly when, I found out that he had a wife, and children actually older than me - he also shared with me some major health battles his wife had gone through in the past.  I am absolutely disgusted with myself that I continued to meet with him, but I did.  We met around once a week, including for a ton of overnight visits, at his second home - we had a relationship that revolved very much around him being a ""dominant"" and me being a ""submissive"".  There was a lot of sadism, and masochism involved, as well as sex, and we roleplayed some darker shit like kidnapping, rape play, etc too.

Looking back at this, I am amazed that I ever did this, and I hate myself for it.  Also, while I am making no comment whatsoever on anyone else and an age gap of any size in their own relationship, an age gap of 32 years seems absolutely crazy to me (for myself), and I am horrified this is something I took part in.  Our dynamic (we never referred to it as a relationship) lasted for around a year.  He told me that it was okay, and that he did not feel like it was cheating on his wife, as the dynamic he and I had was one of a dominant/submissive nature, and completely different to that of a relationship.  For my own part, my head was a total and complete mess and I was in a pretty dark place myself which I think had some impact on the decisions that I made - I had gone through years of sexual abuse as a child and believe I was looking for a nurturing male figure in my life (I am aware now how fucked up it was that I found that in this way).  I had also had (as a result of the abuse) a really awful time with my own mental health; I suffered from depression and in previous years had made numerous suicide attempts, self harmed, had an eating disorder, and suffered from PTSD.  He knew all of this in a lot of detail as at one point I had an occupational health meeting coming up where I was anxious about needing to discuss some of this, and had spoken with him in detail about the best ways to try to answer their questions.  Regardless, at 18 I was an adult, and absolutely responsible for my own decisions; and carry (along with him) a massive part of the blame, and therefore a massive part of the guilt, for what we did.

He and I have not spoken in years.  I have never, ever, told a single person about this, not even my very best friends.  But, over the last few years, reflecting on what we did has caused me massive massive amounts of shame, guilt, self-loathing etc.  I understand that this is something I will, quite rightly, likely carry around with me forever.  I have also been thinking more and more about his wife, and about how awfully she was treated, and that this is now a decade down the line and they are quite possibly still together and she has absolutely no idea.  My question is, does she deserve to know?  Should I somehow get in contact and tell her?  Or is it better for her to never know; hopefully he isn't repeating the same actions, and hopefully let them continue on what is a happy marriage?

My main fear about contacting her would be that I vaguely remember a conversation, once, when I was asking him about her, and he was justifying why it was ""okay"" for us to have this dynamic.  I asked him what would happen if I was to ever tell her (kind of meaning, how did he think she would be about it).  And he told me that if I ever did that, he would tell my parents about my part (looking back of course, I very much doubt that a 50 year old man would ever tell the parents of an 18 year old girl that he was fucking her, but I believed him).  What if he did something similar to his threat, and contacted my work, or my friends?  But also, if telling her would be the right thing to do, then maybe I just need to suck it up and accept any backlash from that?  

I would be so grateful for any advice.  Please don't be too hard on me; you couldn't be any harsher than I am to myself anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR A decade ago I met a married man on a BDSM website, where we had a ""dominant/submissive"" dynamic which involved a lot of pain and sex.  I regret this massively.  Is there any benefit to me reaching out to his wife and telling her?",12Dec2020,1

She’s gorgeous, sweet, goes out of her way for me, we have sex etc. however, she has told me she likes me and I have said the same, but I wanted to wait to ask her to be my girlfriend. So she came over last night, and I have two phones (one is old but still synced up to my iCloud, so they both get the same notifications.) she saw a notification that “Xyz matched with you!” And looked at me very confused. I lied and told her that my old phone sometimes updates with old notifications. She didn’t believe that and asked me to show her the proof of when I matched with that person. My hands started shaking and I knew I was caught in a lie so I just told her I still use the apps.

492,"This person is a personal acquaintance who’s known me for a long time, but I haven’t seen in years as I’m kind of scared of them.  They’re an animal hoarder, they have between 50-100 cats at a time. I can see in the photos they post that there’s animal waste all over their house, on all the walls, and covering the furniture. The cats look sick, injured, and mangey. I know this person loves his cats, but not a healthy love.  He’s obsessed with them, but doesn’t have the money (he doesnt have a job) to take care of them. 

He claims to be a rescue to get more cats, but isn’t licensed. I’m very afraid of him because he was reported before and had all the cats picked up and taken somewhere else as well as his house painted when authorities came to check. Then he had them brought back to the house after and bragged about beating the “crooked cops”. A veterinarian also reported him once and he bragged about threatening her and making her take back the report. 

This person loves guns and is also suicidal and I’m afraid they might hurt somebody or themselves or if they are reported again, but it needs to stop.

493,"Hi all, been agonising over this one for the last day or so. 

So I'm friends on Facebook with a work colleague. I wouldn't say we're 'friends' per se but she's more than an acquaintance and she's a good laugh at the pub. 

In any event I saw that she had posted an update on Facebook but accidentally wiped the notification from my phone so while having a braindead session on Facebook earlier I realise I didn't see her update so I go to her profile and I clock that her photo looks a bit odd.

So I click on her profile picture and I realise that her blouse is open too low down and she has one of her breasts on show. She's said before at the pub after a few drinks that she never wears a bra because she has small breasts. But this isn't a slight malfunction, she has her left breast on full show, nipple and all.

I'd not clocked it before because when you click a notification it shows the update on Facebook with a small profile picture. It's only when I went to her profile that I noticed.

So how do I tell her? I want to tell her that she's exposed but it would mortify her and she's had that photo up for a while now. Do I even tell her? The way her photo is she might have actually done it that way (she's very flirtatious) but she's also a massive klutz so I could easily see that as a mistake.

494,"Hi guys, just looking for some insight here. My work did secret santa this year, which I usually would never participate in because I've only ever drawn the short straw and had people forget etc, but I was assured that because we're such a small close knit team it would go off without a hitch.

Basically how it workd is everyone puts 5 items on their wishlist, 25$ max, and santa picks from the list. Anywho, after searching for the perfect gift for mine and bargain hunting so I could get her two items off her wishlist, I was stoked, and my person loved their gift! But then my turn rolled around and I opened up half a packet of paper from the store room, a $2 set of crayola pencils with 2 colours missing, and some chocolate that I'm very allergic to (yay gluten, yay nuts!). I almost burst into tears on the spot. Everyone knows about my allergies, and my Santa turned to his friend and laughed about how I can't eat them so I'd better hand them over.

I'm so upset.

My question is, do I talk to the organiser about it? Considering he didn't follow the rules we set about items, price, no troll gifts? I'm not sure she could do anything now, but I feel like I'd benefit from getting it off my chest. 

I know not everyone is of the perspective that for games like that, you should always put in what you expect to get out, and that it's likely this guy just wanted something for nothing and couldn't actually care less, but it was humiliating and pretty awful that  the only part of the gift he actually bought could literally kill me.

Also, does it make me an asshole if I tell the manager he's been taking supplies from the storeroom without permission? 😋

I dunno guys. First world problems, and theres definitely stuff happening in my own life that make this feel even worse, but any advice/similar experiences etc wpuld be really appreciated x",12Dec2020,1

496,"Hey,  
this is kinda long so please read (need advice).

I guess, I'll start with an introduction: I'm 20, ethnically Pakistani (born in UK), live in London (kinda posh accent) and bisexual and also have social anxiety and bipolar disorder. 

My looks (if useful):  
Naturally curly hair (long-ish - to my ears).  
Average nose (not very pakistani).  
Medium brown skin, obvs (between Riz Ahmed and Dev Patel).  
Big Lips. 📷  
5'9 - 5'10  
Average weight (not toned).

I'm constantly feeling unattractive and I think its because of my ethnicity, ethnic facial features and skin tone. 

I generally don't struggle with dating:  
I've been asked out by multiple different guys and girls during different points in my relatively short life. I've said yes to some and no to others and they've all been relatively decent looking (not models but 6-8/10s).

Although girls tend to ask me out less but I think this is because of my anxious (not confident) behaviour most of the time (and I'm not super masculine). but no girl has ever said no to me or called me ugly or unattractive (that I've heard).

Same thing on Grindr, I get almost instant messages from guys on there. And when I meet them, they all seem fairly attracted to me and none have ever seen me and just left. (but admittedly some had fetishes for my ethnicity).

  
So with dating I generally don't feel unattractive but when I'm online (mostly TikTok and Instagram) I feel Very Unattractive!!

for example, if I'm scrolling through tiktok and see an interracial couple (usually brown/black girls with white guys), my first instinct is to be happy for them, obvs. But I often can't help but look at the comments from other brown/black girls that say stuff like:

'no more bajeets only white/black guys now.'

'How do I get a white guy like this, you're living my dream.'

'Down with brown guys, white guys only from now on.'

It makes me feel super down and unattractive. I don't know if its because my preference is brown/black girls and guys? and I hate that they see me like that. and I've also never really seen a white girl post something like that and they've mostly been the ones to ask me out?...

Do brown/black girls just find brown men super unattractive? cause that would fr make me sad. I know there is a culture of ignorance and bigotry that brown men have and that's a turn off for women, but that's not me I'm super super progressive and leftist and obvs pro lgbtq+ and women/minority rights. 

I feel like I also compare myself to white (mainly) and black guys a lot . Like my tiktok fyp is full of them even though my personal preference is brown men. I guess I also have this weird feeling that its wrong to find brown men as attractive as I do (like I'm the only person who thinks that).

So why do I find other brown guys (mainly Pakistani) attractive but not myself (as a Pakistani boy)?

I get so much of my self worth from brown and black women and their comments are the ones making me feel unattractive, should I force change my preference? is that possible? how do I make myself attracted to people who are actually attracted to me?

I'll try and keep a very long story short here and cover the main points:

Lost contracted work in March (company I was consistently growing sales of)

Was told it would come back nothing personal etc

Had no contact for 2 months and follow up email ignored at 1 month

Started  arguing due to the stress of having no money to live on and lack of  communication Realised I messed up with some work I did previously.

I believe this was just a simple unfortunate disagreement that went way out of control (They thought I was furloughed, but I wasn't eligible for any government help).

Offered  to fix my mistake for free &amp; start over. Finally response after a  month asking me to fix it and they  want to pay to fix it so we can ""draw a line  under it""

I asked If this meant I  would get more work and they told me they can't answer at this point.  I've responded again &amp; had no answer for 8 days now I apologised  again and offered to fix it all for free if we can start again fresh. 

Explained how I can't justify 1 time pieces of work as I need a job.

Should  I follow up again at some point if I get no response? Or should i just  let it go? I don't want to be used for some specific work and then  discarded.

They are very busy over  christmas due to the type of business. Potentially follow up in the new  year? Feels like I'm hanging onto a lost cause at this point and any  help is appreciated

My parents are sad about this because they like hugs and don't understand why it makes me uncomfortable, they seem to think maybe I will grow out of it or something as I grow older. I am okay with hugging some people like really close friends or my gf ( I have not seen her irl in a long time because we are long distance). I don't really know why I dislike hugs this way,  I just need my personal space and hugs feel somewhat invasive, and I also don't know why this was not the case before and somehow changed when I was about 13-14 or something?

507,"A little context, I am a Malaysian Chinese M19 (With Autism) who has been living in Australia since 15.

To keep it short, it was a living hell in Malaysia being undiagnosed with Autism. I had very few friends and I was not only constantly bullied, but never had my concerns taken seriously by any of my teachers. This caused me to harden mentally as I lost my faith in my teachers and in turn, any authority figure. I slowly I started to turn to ideology and violence as a solution to my problems (I had a strong belief that I could make myself stronger by dedicating my life to an ideology and living to it as closely as possible which in this case was Communism).

Fast forward to when I was 15, I moved to Australia. I was diagnosed with Autism when I was 17. At this point in my life, I had much more friends though I still retained my ideological beliefs as I did not feel completely safe. It was at this point where I started to notice a growth in far-right movements worldwide and to a certain extent in Australia. At this point, I began to research these far-right movements such as a historical example being Nazi Germany (Now I understand it is more of a far-right government though it was originally a far-right movement and party that led to its establishment). As soon as saw what Aktion T4 was (the program to kill off the disabled and so-called sub-humans), I began to heavily resent such far-right ideologies and in turn far-right movements. At this stage, I began to commit myself more to my ideology and in turn, becoming far more comfortable expressing my hate for such movements and related people (I have been very open about my violent resolutions which scare a lot of people though I think they are simply over-reacting). I had even considered acquiring a gun in the case I should have to die fighting (though I had second thoughts due to the costs of gun ownership).

It is at this point where I am confronted by my mother, She expressed that she was worried about my ""so-called fanatical beliefs"". I immediately dismissed her, telling her that she has no right to interfere or be remotely worried about my beliefs as she doesn't know the pain I had to go through being undiagnosed with Autism and how her raising me didn't help (even though she has apologized for doing so, I refuse to accept her apology as I thin crying when apologizing automatically makes it a sham). She still has the nerve to tell me I have a lot of hate in my heart which has pushed away many people and alienated me (though I disagree as this simply means I have avoided potential saboteurs in my life).

Should I continue on? I don't think my mother understands how hard an Autistic person has to fight to simply live a normal life, let alone to simply exist.",12Dec2020,1
508,"So the semester is ending and my best friend is moving back across the country until the spring semester starts. He's been asking me to hang out a lot lately but I've been stressed with two jobs and finals and trying to also make time for my boyfriend, and we haven't been able to hang out much at all.

We did hang out earlier in the semester, but it's hard because I don't live on campus anymore, and due to the covid restrictions I can't visit his dorm or anyone else's. He doesn't drive so usually when we spend time together it means I go pick him up and drive him around. He and I really only have each other; our other friends have grown apart from us.

I feel really guilty that I'm probably not going to see him in person before he leaves, and I know he'll be back but he's struggling and lonely and I don't want him to suffer.

The main reason is is that i met him on tinder, and our very first conversations are there.

Whenever i use the app, i literally just go straight to the messages (i don’t swipe anybody, i haven’t messaged/engaged with anyone since before me and my boyfriend started talking), and i haven’t updated anything in my bio since before i met him.


Obviously if it shows me being active i’ll stop immediately- because ultimately i can just screenshot the conversations to go back through them like that. But for the time being, would it show me as active?

513,"[The post in question.](https://offerup.co/F0BirmbU9bb)

Back in June I had my truck stolen, and I had these expensive wheels on them. The day before, I spent $800 on a brand new set of Venom Power tires. I found this post on OfferUp just now, and I highly believe that these are my wheels, but I don’t know how I can prove it.
 
These are the reasons why I suspect these are mine.

- The wheels are wrapped in Venom Power tires. I bought mine all 4 brand new. This guy only has three, and a Goodyear tire on them, and they all look worn out. So I’m not sure. I don’t think a span of 5 months can wear a tire out that fast.
 
- All 4 wheels have curb rash. I admit that I didn’t take care of my baby’s shoes that well (it was mostly due to the stupid ATMs at Chase) so I had nasty curb rash on all 4 of my rims. 
 
- One of the wheels has very nasty brake dust, again, also my fault. I had that wheel on my driver side rear, and even when I changed my brake discs and my pads, it still had so much brake dust. 

Idk what to do. I messaged the guy and offered him $800, and he accepted. I find it weird that he’s selling for $1k and easily took -$200. I’m picking them up on Tuesday. He lives about an hour away from where my truck was stolen. Any advice?",12Dec2020,1

516,"Been dating this girl for about 5 months now and when we first met we didn’t plan on dating. We were both fresh out of a relationship so we tried to keep it casual but you know how that goes. Either way, she dated her ex for 4 years and cheated on him over 5 times. Also, all of her friends are guys and most of her “friends” she’s hooked up with before, some of them more then once. Our group of friends now is pretty much just my group of friends and we all hangout together almost every weekend. We never hangout with her “friends”. She works Friday till 9:30pm then has work early in the am on Saturday so she doesn’t like going out on fridays, sometimes I do. We almost never go out alone so when I said I was gonna go out with my friends she said “well then I’m allowed to go out with my friends when you can’t” meanwhile the people she is calling her friends are all people she’s slept with before. Am I wrong for saying she can’t do that and it’s not the same thing? Also, do you agree that someone you used to casually sleep with in the recent past can’t be your friend?",12Dec2020,1
517,"I'm just going to start with it, my boyfriend (M27) has Stage 3 Colon cancer. It's so hard to type that out. He just got done with a surgery where they removed part of his colon that had a tumor, had run a biopsy on it, and the results came back that it was at stage 3 cancer, which the surgeon let us know is still curable. They want to do a bit of chemo and keep it from spreading through his lymph nodes to other parts of his body. 

Now, my boyfriend has had issues with his Liver and Colon his whole life. He had been in and out of the hospital when he was younger very often, when he was an infant he had an enlarged Liver, was getting ulcers in his colon even before 18 years old, and he currently has a Liver disease as well as Ulcerative Colitis, the doctors have diagnosed. He had a liver biopsy done about a year or two ago now, and has had colonoscopies as well to check on things. Time has gone on and he has always done a lot of research on these kind of things, because he has such a very specific bunch of issues and wants to know what's going on. I don't doubt the doctors because there is proof of what's going on, but my boyfriend is hell bent on fixing his liver issues instead of focusing on the cancer in his colon right now. He feels that the cancer is caused by his liver disease, which has been leaking liver bile into his colon. This is what my bf has hypothesized is going on, and from the liver biopsy, the liver doctor has also confirmed this as far as I know.

I'm not saying he is incorrect, I *do* think that has something to do with it, but I feel that his colon is effecting his liver as well, in such a way that it's a double edged sword. If he has colon cancer, it's effecting his liver, but the liver bile is effecting his colon and vice versa.

He is obviously upset and feels that the doctor isn't trying to fix the main problem, but I had told him earlier today that we have to focus on the cancer because it's still much more likely to be cured than if we waited. His family is also saying he should do the treatment, NEEDS to do the treatment, and I also don't think this is up for discussion. I've been told I have to be strong and push him to do this so he can take care of himself and I've been tending to him since he got home yesterday.

My main question is...what do I do? How do I support him? Other than helping him around the house and making him food, I just don't know what to say to him to make him feel better, and I know I can't fix it but if I could I would give him part of my liver if we were a match. I'm really struggling to find the words and the right decision, I would never want him to go through something and be worse off, BUT I do feel that the doctors have his best interests at heart and if we waited, what then? I don't think I could deal with watching him fade away like that. 

I just want him to be okay and I'm scared for him. I know this might be above Reddit's pay grade, but if anyone else has dealt with something similar, I would really appreciate anyone else's experience and input.",12Dec2020,1

531,"So, I've had a problem over the past many many years with keeping a consistent job for more than 5 months. There is one job I had during college that I had for almost two years which I loved because it was super easy and in the department of my studies (film).

Due to some really traumatic events I stopped going to school and still haven't finished my degree. I've just been out in the world working, which has been difficult to say the least. I've had nannying jobs, jobs with amazon in their facilities and also driving, I've had a real video production house job, I had a job at an escape room where I was promoted to AGM within two months.

The thing is, I often perform exceedingly well at all of the jobs in the beginning. I go above and beyond &amp; I never miss work. Then suddenly, it's like all my stamina for work dissipates. It's harder to wake up in the mornings, to dress myself for work, to feel happy about going. That's when the bullshit and sabotaging starts to happen.

I'm so afraid of admitting to my bosses about this sudden shift that I start lying about my life or situations. ""Oh my car battery died."" ""My mom is in the hospital"" (which this does happen often, but I could still go to work). ""My dogs got sick."" etc.

I feel like trash saying it too. I know I'm just a shitty worker who apparently can't handle work life. But the thing is, I know I can! I had that one job for almost two years and I only ever missed ONE day of work, and often times I picked up extra shifts. 

So I'm at this crossroads again. Where I'm feeling burnt out at my job (amazon delivery driver). I've been scheduled 5/6 days a week because of the holidays and I just do not want to go in. I'm literally writing this post as I'm dressed for work, but just not going in. 

I don't want to lose this job. Honestly most days I do actually enjoy it. But obviously I know if I start this trend again, I'm going to lose my job. Has anyone else ever had this issue? How do I combat this? 

TLDR; Whenever I start a new job it's fantastic and I become a top performer. However, it always happens that I suddenly lose all gusto and start lying to miss work / just miss work altogether. I don't know how to stop this cycle &amp; it's starting anew with my latest job (amazon delivery driver).",12Dec2020,1

The three of us have been very close friends for many years, and we now live in different cities so we keep in touch very often (think checking in multiple times a day) via a group chat. Recently I've decided I need to cut Jill out of my life, because she's become so toxic and damaging to me and I'm constantly stressed and upset when I talk to her. My plan is to just kinda phase out of the group chat, very slowly maybe over a couple of weeks (holidays coming up is the perfect time for it honestly) and make excuses about life/work/family/etc keeping me busy if I'm ever asked. I know some people might think confronting her is kinder than ghosting, but I really think this confrontation would go badly based on her personality and history. My problem is that I really want to keep my friendship with Jack and continue to keep in touch with him one-on-one, but I'm worried about putting him in an awkward position. Obviously if Jill never realizes that I've ditched the group purely because of her, then he might never get stuck in the middle. But if it gets back to her that he and I still talk privately.. I don't know. He's a really great guy and I don't want to make things hard for him. One solution I came up with was to explain to Jack how I'm feeling/what I'm doing and be like ""don't tell her that we're keeping in touch"" but that seems a bit malicious and I don't think he'd want to lie, so it's not a great idea. any advice? thanks!!",12Dec2020,1

The real kicker, is that at the time he tried to control my hobbies, which at the time featured language learning, saying it was pointless and that I'd never become fluent or get a job with languages. It got as bad as him burning my books, shouting at me, and basically being controlling of any interests I had outside of him.

537,"I know this is just a simple problem for most of the people but I’m really having anxiety because the HR didn’t update me when she said she would.

So to make the long story short, just this 27th on November I got hired by the company. The hiring manager called me and congratulated me that I got hired for the position. She discussed everything to me, everything about the company background, what I should expect when I join the company etc. and she even told me that I’ll be able to join them by December 8 and I agreed right away because it’s been like months, it took me months applying for jobs sending resumes online and it was really hard finding one because of the pandemic happening the past few months. I was just really happy that I got the job. So she gave me the application form and the medical slip for my medical examination. She also said that she’ll be giving the job order by next week. 

First day of December, I went to the clinic and had my medical examination and everything. I even paid for it. After my med exam I checked messenger and the hiring manager messaged me that I should not yet take med exam because the higher management told her to postpone my onboard appointment and she doesn’t know when. 

After a few days I contacted her through email and asked about it and she said she’ll get back to me next week (which is this week) by Thursday because they’re busy with the organization and it’s year end but it’s already Saturday and I still didn’t get any update about my job order and when will I be joining them. I called her number yesterday (Friday) and didn’t get any answer. I can wait and I know I’m being impatient about this but i just don’t like it when people give specific dates and they don’t update you when they said they would. And also one of the reason why I’m really anxious is that my family is pressuring me in finding a job and they always ask me everyday about it. 

Please I really need some good advice regarding this. Should I be worried about it? Should I just find another job? Should I try and keep calling until she answers? Or should I just wait patiently and just be quiet. I really don’t know what to do I really try to distract myself but whenever I’m not occupied I still get bothered by it. 

Thank you in advance to whoever reads and gives advice regarding this situation . I really appreciate it!",12Dec2020,1
538,"I’m (20F) looking to move out soon, but it’s incredibly hard to find a job and an apartment in my country, especially at the moment. I have a job now with low pay and horrible working conditions but I found a new job that I just applied to. If I get it, I should be able to move out around spring time the latest.

I’m super excited, and it’s way overdue, but I’m also a little scared. Actually, I’m terrified. I’ll be on my own, paying my own bills, cooking my own food and be in charge of my own laundry. I’m good with money, I can do my laundry and I assume cooking skills will come along the way. But what about when you go to sleep at night? It’s just you. What if your landlord tries to screw you over? What if I lose my job for whatever reason? What if I get incredibly lonely during this whole worldwide thing (not sure if I can include the word)? Do you just get random water bills that’ll do I can’t pay for my medication? 

I can’t wait to have my own space, to have privacy and control over my own things. Now that it’s getting closer, it becomes less of an exciting thing and more of a scary thing. All my friends are moving out (and in) with their partners, but I love my single life. They have each other. I’m afraid I’ll be all alone and everything will crash around me.

Is it really that scary?",12Dec2020,1
539,"So my girlfriend went to a work christmas party with her friend. She recently has been close to this coworker girl for like a month. Her previous drug addict boss was there and giving free tattoos without a liscense and her friend and her decided to get matching white ink tattoos on their fingers as a tribute to their new friendship. We have discussed tattoos for a long time and agreed to never do it. She called me a minute before she did it (she already did it unbeknowsmt to me) and said she was getting one. I said where is this coming from? And saying no we didn’t agree on it, come home and we will talk about it and if you truly want one we will get one later in a week or so, as they are truly permanent. She said she’s gonna do whatever she wants it’s her body why can’t she do what she wants when she wants. I said sarcastically do whatever the hell you want if it makes you happy and that was the end of the phone call. I was extremely let down and cried for hours and she just went to her friends house instead of coming to see me. When she came back she acted all mushy gushy and like nothing was wrong and I told her is her new found friendship worth our 2+ year relationship.

540,"I’m not totally sure if this is the right subreddit to post this on but hopefully it is, if not please let me know :)

Today I(18f) came to a realization. The realization that we go through life just for the sole purpose of feeling emotions. You go to college to feel content, you get a partner to feel love, you have kids to feel proud. But what would life be without emotions? You go to college for what? To survive?You wouldn’t even try to survive if you don’t have emotions driving you to do so. You can’t feel love, you can’t feel happiness, you can’t even feel sadness. So what do you have now? What is there to live for? You have nothing but meaningless actions that ultimately serve no purpose. It’s like we put this idea in our heads that we have a purpose, that we’re so important. We do things to make us FEEL like our life is meaningful. But the truth is that there’s no meaning. Without emotions we are nothing but a limp body of flesh and bones. Like a monitor without a computer system. And that is hard for me to cope with. The only reason for living, is to experience emotions. And with that being said, life just seems so boring now. I would’ve hoped there would be a deeper meaning to billions of peoples’ existence, but alas, we are just so simple. 

But I digress, I am just depressed right now so maybe I’m just saying all this due to my depressed mood. Although, I’m posting this because it’s making me feel quite shitty and unmotivated having come to this realization. So now I’m looking for help, I just need some reassurance right now that maybe that’s not all there is to life. Or even just some advice to help me feel motivated to continue through life again. Thanks :)",12Dec2020,1

Mentioned sex stuff they used to do
Places they used to fuck back in the day 
He said he remembers the first time he met her so vividly it was crazy. 
He kept some of her sex toys they had in their relationship together. I found them in his closet. They e been broken up for four years 

Talked about their old vacations together. Swapped pics of their trip from years ago. Talked about all the places they used to fuck there. Mentioned how it’s nice to have someone who enjoys the same thing they do while saying he and I don’t share those interests. Talked about fun sex things they wanted to do to whoever their spouse would be one day. 

She said her boyfriend didn’t want her to sleep naked in his bed and he texted her “what? I would def want you sleeping naked in bed”

I wanted to nag at him all day and tell him how important he is to me and i didn't want our friendship to end. But, i didn't.

I had sang him happy birthday! And was planning to send it to him. It was the first time i recorded my voice for him. I recorded my voice soo many times to make sure it's perfect. But in the end i didn't send it cuz his reply was too short i thought he was not interested in talking to me anymore. I even wanted to make a short video of me talking to him because i wanted to make him happy so badly. I'm a fool right??

I'm so sad i don't know what to do :(((( I replied to him but he hasn't read my texts yet. I guess he's started to ignore me again..

544,"It's too long of a story but basically:

My mom is weird and has the mentality of a 11 year old, my dad is just there physically i guess, they raised me to not know how to interact with a human being decently, for that i couldn't make any connections with anyone but i never realized that and just blamed myself and they did too, and since i had nowhere to vent i just ranted about everything on a secret facebook account, my family found out and talked about it with literally everyone but me, that caused me to be paranoid and my mental health to get worse, years later nothing gets betters but i convince myself it actually is! There were a lot of times this year i realized that and tried to change my situation but nothing really changes, i go back to trying to convice myself that it actually is. Then yesterday i just gave the fucking up, basically my mom did bad stuff, i tell my aunt and she says ""Hey it's you that should look out for her not the other way around"", and says that i'm 'like that' because i don't make friends, and tells me to go to my cousin's house and talk to him. There's also things involving him but basically (i'll continue saying that word), my mom keeps/kept comparing me with him, and my aunt knows that since she's one of the people who found out about the facebook page, and idk how to explain it but the fact she said that 'im like this' because i don't talk to him just didn't make me feel better at all? Then i went home having a panic attack and sometimes stopping to cry (i was riding a bike), and my mom did nothing except ride her bike 10m away from me and also stop when i stopped, there was one time when she actually acknowledged my existance but when i spoke she backed again, now she's watching tv and still hasn't talked to me, my dad actually asked if i was ok but that was it. And hey, talking about him, my mom does this thing that whenever she's in the wrong and she knows she's in the wrong and people hold her accountable she gets mad at them and try to avoid them until they stop talking about what she did, she does that all the time to my dad and me, and as mentioned when i try to talk to other family members about it they say ""Ohh but whatever!"". Also i had a half-sister born before me who was allergic to a bunch of stuff who died because my mom kept feeding her with said stuff. Also, my mom is half-deaf, and my family blames my mom acting bad on that, also this isn't a fact more of a theory but my grandma (my mom's mother) possibly guilt-tripped my mom into staying with her, and was possibly abusive to her too (i remember asking my mom if my grandma 'was bad' when i was a kid, and she got visibly uncomfotable but still said no, and i don't know a lot about it but there was a lot of drama when my mom got with my half-sister's dad, who was married.)

There's also other things like, the fact i'm getting nowhere with my life, the fact my mom tries and is succesful with ruining everything i do or plan...

I don't really know if it all explain it either but, the only way for there to be a possibility of a change is for me to make it seem like i killed myself, i don't mean like faking my death (i mean that would be great too) but like consuming a certain amount of whatever pills and passing out but not getting any serious damage or dying?

As the title says, I want to leave my rural area on the east coast of Canada - where I have spent the majority of my life. I was born in the USA and moved here as a young kid, went through the public school system and now I go to university about 100 km (60 miles) from my childhood home. I have a few acquaintances, but no real friends or relationships. Pretty much, they only reason I have stayed is to be near my mom and younger siblings. 

As for so many, 2020 has been a year of reflection and self-discovery and at the end of it I am feeling like I just go through the motions. I chose this school almost out of comfort, the majority of my high school class goes here and my childhood neighbour lives just down the street. I struggle with anxiety and I feel that due to this, I'm allowing myself to just stay in this little comfort box.

He had my full trust, I knew he was struggling with mental issues and problems with emotion regulation/impulse control but I was understanding and supportive. Like I said, he had my full trust that he wouldn’t do anything wrong. 

Last night we had a long conversation about it that was going well until the end where he started talking about a girl he used to talk to and how he never got the chance to have sex with her or date her because of me. He told me he was still talking to her and that he wanted to and was most likely going to sext her or have phone sex with her. I’m crying and I feel sick just typing this. I told him if he wanted to do that we needed to break up and he basically banned me from breaking up with him. He refused to hear it and basically said “no fuck you you’re not breaking up with me and I’m going to sext her if she wants me to” then he spent all night watching pornography in bed while I cried. 

He hasn’t cheated on me yet, and he might not do it at all since he is so flip floppy about everything. But it doesn’t even matter. I’ve lost all my trust in him completely. I’m embarrassed, lost, hopeless, suicidal, angry and just completely broken. 

Even if he takes everything he said yesterday back and says he didn’t mean it and that he’s sorry and he’s never do it and he threw his phone off a bridge my life would still be ruined.

553,"So I recently moved across the country (UK) for a new job. 

I went to buy a house at auction but ended up buying 2 cheaper houses and a small flat on the same street.

1 house that I moved in to was a bit dated and needed a bit of TLC but was perfectly fine to move into. The second house had sitting tenants who I offered to extend their lease with an intial 6 month offer. The couple living there are slightly older with no kids, so seemed like decent tenants. 

Anyway, I've been working from home due to Covid19 restrictions etc. During my working from home period they had some minor issues with the house, which I would pop over to fix during my lunch breaks etc. It's my property so my responsibility to fix

However, the man has now gone back to work as a van driver but the woman hasn't. She called me over a few a few weeks ago to look at something, when I got over there she was a little tipsy and came into me. I initially refused her advances but after 2 more ""call-outs"" I ended up sleeping with her. The sex was amazing, real heat and passion!

It got to the point where I was giving her partner long distance jobs to drive hours away to pick up random objects for me just to give us time to fuck. So much so, I've seen her every weekday for the past 5 weeks.

I love the situation we are in, her being my booty and the illicit nature of it all. 

However, one tenant of the flat has blabbed to the male that I've being going over a lot and that she's been coming to me. To which we just laughed it off saying we've been discussing rent reduction and getting all the little bits and bats fixed

The trouble I'm having is, the flat tenant doesn't know I'm the landlord, and I'm really fucked off with them for being a nosy neighbour. Legally I have no grounds to evict them, unless I wish to sell the flat - but I don't want to. I don't want to reveal I'm the landlord to cover my own arse in case anything happens.",12Dec2020,1

I just don’t see any point in traveling anywhere during the pandemic, especially to a place where there are so many restrictions in place already. I also particularly drag my feet whenever we go to San Francisco, which is about once a year, so that might have something to do with it too. With my first semester of college about to be under my belt, all I want to do is just relax and stay at home when the winter break hits. 

I’m willing to convince them that they should go without me while I stay home alone (and not have anyone over to prove to them that I’m serious about being safe from Covid). The thing is though, our hotels are already booked from using our miles so I don’t think that they are even open to compromising, like going to San Francisco for just a day. My family looks at me as the guy who always needs to follow the rules, which is true to an extent, but I do think that following suggestions from the CDC and literally every healthcare worker isn’t crazy. All of my family members have done a pretty good job of keeping themselves safe, so their argument is to be a little selfish to be honest and do their best to stay safe while enjoying San Francisco. 

We live in the Bay Area for some context. How do you suggest I go about having a conversation with my family, that they should go without me or reconsider going on the trip altogether? Thank you!",12Dec2020,1

Anyways in junior year of high school i was dating a girl she was nice, i liked her very much. Since im so close to my dad i thought maybe i could tell him im bisexual and so i did ... but he didnt take it well. He was disappointed ... he didnt say it but i could see it on his face.

576,"I (M20) messaged her (F21) over Instagram a few months ago. I took the opportunity to get her number and ask her out last weekend. She agreed and we met up with some friends. Soon after, I asked her out for a one on one, she was accepted and we met up yesterday.

I had arranged to meet her at an art museum seeing that she loved art and immediately sparks were flying. She seemed generally interested, laughed, asked deep questions, held hands for a ballet impromptu in the rain (she does ballet), and drew me in the museum's artbook as a memory piece. Furthermore, throughout the day, she arranged future outings with me and said that we should go out this week coming.

There was a moment where time just froze, I was going to go in for a kiss, but decided to leave it until the end of the day (in retrospect, that was probably a good idea).

Towards the end, she then told me that her parents are strict and further asked if my parents knew we were out together. I was surprised by this and told her that they did know. She then asked about relationships and said that she is unsure about how her family would take to her having one as her father does not know about me yet.

The conversation then went radio silent as we sat in each other's company. She turned to me and asked why I messaged her specifically on Instagram? I answered by telling her that she should know that answer by now.

Right when I was about to ask her out on a date for next week, she told me that she had a boyfriend before and that she had just come out of a relationship with him so she does not know if she wants one now. I felt a huge lump in my chest because I have been through this past and thought that she felt different towards me.

I cannot help but think I did something wrong, everything was going great and I was not expecting this at all. I really do like her and admire her maturity for telling me this though. Was this just her testing the waters seeing if I would make a move or what? I am willing to take things slowly if it must be. We agreed to see each other again next weekend, so I'm unsure on what I should do",12Dec2020,1
577,"Over 10 Years ago I was at a family reunion or so and I was left alone with this girl I didn't know. Until then my contact with other children was very limited and with girls almost nothing. I got weird and touched her breast, almost immediately after that my parents went for me and we left. I feel SO MUCH regret over this, I'm so embarrassed I haven't talk about it with anyone. I don't have a way to contact her nor like saying sorry would change anything. I really dont know what do or how to deal with it, also, as the abuser I feel wrong asking for help, I made her enter the list of sexually abused women and I can't forgive myself for that. I'm also part of a minority so I  made my part to keep the idea that my people are predatory. I know I deserve to feel bad but I'd really appreciate any advice.",12Dec2020,1

579,"It's very hard and lonely being unattractive, I've had a tumor in my face since I was a kid (non cancerous but could turn in to cancer one day) and the side of my face with it is very noticeably bigger and obviously no one would find me attractive with it. Due to this I've always lacked confidence and have only been able to ask 2 girls out but got rejected and made fun of so don't think I'll ever try again. I've tried the online dating apps but it's just impossible to get any matches since you are just judged by your looks online. 

It just sucks seeing everyone I know getting married and having kids and I've never even been on a date or hugged or kissed anyone before and one of my main hobbies is watching movies and TV but literally almost all have some sort of love scene/story which just make me feel even worse. I've started drinking more to try and cope but doesn't really do much, thought of trying some of the more hard core drugs to take my mind of loneliness as I have nothing to lose but not sure if I want to go down that path yet.

581,"Throwaway because my family knows my reddit. I don't know what to do, I just need an unbiased opinion, or maybe just to vent since I'm not allowed to go into detail with anyone I know, and I absolutely can't just keep it bottled up, for my own mental health. Obligatory on mobile, and sleep deprived and in mild distress, so sorry for mistakes/formatting.

My (16F) cousin (19F) is in an extremely bad situation, and my family wants to take her in. She's been homeless and on drugs, specifically meth, for several years (she claims to have clean for a week, but we have no way to know) and is currently living with her bio father and his girlfriend, both of whom are drug users/dealer, and who have brought her on a drug buy, most likely to use as ""currency,"" and abandoned her with no way to get back at least once before.

There's a whole mess of information I don't think I even fully understand, but she doesn't really have anywhere else to go. Her mother died when she was five or six, her siblings are all struggling with several things, and the other aunts/uncles have bowed out of helping for various reasons, mostly relating to her behaviour. She was adopted by some extended family as a child, but they abandoned her when she was twelve, so they're not an option. She seems to really want to get back on her feet, she says she wants to get a job and have a family and live a ""normal life,"" but that's obviously easier to say than it is to do.

My issue is this: I don't know this girl. I have had absolutely no contact with her since I was four, and I barely remember her. ""Oh but she's family"" aside, she's a complete stranger to me, and I don't see being biologically related to someone as a reason to help them, especially in a situation that she, at the end of the day, got herself into. Yeah, she was dealt a shitty hand to begin with and a hell of a lot of people failed her, but there have been multiple times she's had the opportunity to get help and didn't take it. I have no relationship with her, I have no responsibility to her. She's a drug addict, and she's mentally ill. She's going to be going through withdrawal, she needs serious psychiatric help. Bringing her in is a life altering decision, and I don't know if I'm willing to make it for someone I don't even know.

I'm going to be graduating soon, and going to college here until I'm 18 and can move for uni. I want a stable environment to focus on school. We have no way of absolutely keeping her clean. I don't want to be around drugs under any circumstances. I know through family history on both sides I'm susceptible to addiction, and I'm not going to even consider being around something that could jeopardise my adult life and future right as it's starting. But if she does bring drugs in, then what? I'm not confident my parents will be willing or able to do anything that'll work. We have four cats and a dog, two of which are elderly and one of which is special needs. I don't know if they're going to be able to handle a new person, and a new person who has (for lack of a better term) serious issues coming into our house. My family isn't exactly well off. We're not living paycheck to paycheck, but we don't always have the money to be able to comfortably support an entire other person. We can't afford rehab, or good psych care, even if our town had either to begin with. My parents work all day, so keeping an eye on her during the day falls on me and (mainly one of, the other also works part time) brothers. Both my brother and I plan on getting/resuming jobs once the pandemic is over, and I plan on going to college. I'm a very private and reserved (read: antisocial and extremely socially anxious) person, I'm out of my room for maybe three hours on a good day, bar night when everyone else is asleep. There is absolutely no way my mental health could handle being around someone literally all day, especially a stranger. There's also the fact that we're still in a pandemic, and my brothers, my stepfather, and myself are immunocompromised. I don't see her coming here as a good option, but the other option is her staying with her deadbeat junkie father and being around drugs 24/7, and always being at risk of overdosing.

I guess I'm looking for someone to tell me I'm being selfish and to just agree, but I can't help but just see the cons outweighing the pros and imagining the worst, and again, nobody in my family has had any contact with her in twelve years until this week. We have no idea who she actually is, our last interaction with her was when she was six years old. My stepfather and at least one of my brothers are completely sold on it, and my mother definitely seems willing. If even one of us says no, then we won't do it. I just don't know if I'm willing to negatively change my life in a major way for a complete stranger, and I don't exactly have time to decide.

Tl,dr: my family wants to take in my drug addict cousin to help her, but I don't know her at all and don't know if I want to agree because if the major impact it would have on our/my life.",12Dec2020,1
582,"My girlfriend and I are 9 months into a relationship and I can say I love her to this day. I met her through my bestfriend, who I've known for 4 years and has been there with me for my ups and downs ever since I was 13. We played loads of video games together, slept in calls, did dumb friends stuff but I wouldn't say we were ever in love. In fact, I once asked her if she wanted to try and get in a relationship but she rejected me straight up cuz she likes the friendship we have and I was completely fine with that. Better keep things the same than going worse. Now, since I'm in a relationship the only thing I do with her is study, take relationship advices since she knows my girlfriend longer than I have as well as playing video games.

 However, months have passed in the relationship between me and my girlfriend and we keep having arguements about my relationship with my bestfriend and my girlfriend questioned me if I would choose my bestfriend over her. I told her no, of course but after I comforted her and reassured her, I'm questioning myself whether would I really do that. I'm paranoid.

587,"There've been a couple times that this has happened. I bought this truck over the summer, and it had a couple issues. It's check engine light has been on forever, and it is still on, even after the dealership said it shouldn't come back, it came back an hour after they returned it. The back seat lights would flicker quite often in the beginning, always when I stepped on the brakes. While that issue was fixed by replacing the lights, I'm not sure if it's related or relevant to this new issue, so I figured I'd just share it.

There are two main problems we're now having with the truck, along with the check engine light still on, despite the dealership fixing it and saying it shouldn't come back on:

1. On the little screen above the steering wheel (not sure what it is actually called), the words ""service stabilitrak"" often appear for a second or two, very quickly go away. However, right before this happens, all the dash lights and the radio, as well as the lights on the speedometer and other dials, turn off for a couple seconds. I haven't ever noticed, since it's so quick, whether or not the power steering turns off, but I don't believe that it does. This wouldn't be nearly as troublesome as it is, if it hadn't been for the second problem, which I believe could be related. My father believes it could have something to do with turning the high beams on, but I don't believe that is the case, since it happens even when I don't turn the high beams on. I told him that it also has happened when signalling, and he says that I could've turned the high beams on for a second without noticing. I'm not sure why he thinks it is the high beams, but I think we're onto something, although again I'm not too sure. I believe that there could be a chance that it has something to do with the wiring of the lever that controls the high beam as well as the signals, since it's the same lever. I really don't know, though.
2. Oftentimes, when I'm driving in a parking lot, usually pulling in or backing in to a spot, the truck all of a sudden stalls. While it hasn't yet happened when I'm on the road, I'm a bit worried that it could get worse, and eventually happen when I'm at a stop light, and may not turn back on, although so far it hasn't had any problem whatsoever with turning back on.

While I'm not sure if these two are related, and if either or both are also related to the problem with the backseat light flashing when touching the break, although that problem has since been fixed. I really don't know what to try. I know that this is a rather common problem with GM, and I've heard that it could be the throttle body and the sensor or it could also be a problem with a ground wire, I believe. I'm not exactly sure, and I'd rather be able to figure it first without wasting money with the dealership, like I have in the past. Any ideas or advice? Thanks.",12Dec2020,1
588,"(Please let me know if there's a more appropriate sub to ask this question in.)

I have a very strong feeling that due to my personal background and life experiences, my purpose in life is to help and support those suffering from mental health issues. Problem is, I'm poor as hell so I can't make any donations to some kind of charity, I'm already in debt from a bachelor's degree (computer science), and I have really bad social anxiety. Also, I have no work experience other than being a lunch monitor and a special education aide three going on four years ago, and I had to quit my most ""recent"" position as an aide due to serious mental health issues that occurred at the time (I'm better now though, other than my anxiety).

I am currently a volunteer peer supporter for a nonprofit mental health organization, where people, using Discord, can request for someone like me to discuss whatever might be stressing them. However I barely ever take on requests because I'm deathly afraid of saying the wrong thing to somebody who's already deeply struggling for fear of making their pain worse (and if you wonder why I became a volunteer, it's because I genuinely thought I could do it... that, and even though it's not officially a crisis line, people still make requests while they're in crisis). 

I am also in the middle of studying for an IT cert, and I already paid for the test vouchers (CompTIA A+). I planned to eventually try for an entry level help desk position, in hopes that my social anxiety would dissipate as a byproduct of working in the position.

I have already thought of using my CS background to make a mental health-related app, but honestly I have really poor coding skills (I graduated with only a 3.1 GPA in college). I can't even solve problems in Python which is apparently the easiest language to learn. It's honestly probably because I have a fair number of head injuries, the effects of which I'm doing my best to mitigate (meditating for an hour every day, ingesting omega 3s, etc). I'm very slow when it comes to logical operations, even my overall creativity completely went away after two of these injuries (used to draw and songwrite well, now I'm absolutely horrible at both), among experiencing other symptoms that impede my quality of life. 

At this point you're probably wondering why I pursued a degree in CS, and it's because I was encouraged to rush into college out of high school, that and all I knew was ""pick something that interests you that also makes money"".

The only things really going for me - about feasible avenues relating to my identified purpose - are that I have a good deal of knowledge in mental health, psychology, and therapeutic techniques, and I can write well academically, which I could probably somehow translate into article writing. I've often thought about becoming a writer on the side. But even then, it seems like there isn't anything necessarily ""new"" to write about in terms of psychology or mental health unless you're a researcher (and man, I would love to be an actual researcher, but like I said I can't afford another degree). Or maybe there is something that can be written, and I just lack the creativity to know what exactly that is. Who knows. :(

So... **all things considered, what would be an attainable path for me?** 

The kinds of suggestions or ideas I'm looking for don't necessarily have to involve my main career path - I don't mind just living out my values on the side while doing IT work - although if there were actually some way for me to attain a career pertaining to psychology or mental health that would be cool. I highly doubt there is a way, though, not just due to financial reasons but because my social anxiety is so deeply ingrained (I've been going to therapy for years and it has barely went away).

**TL;DR I feel that my life's purpose is to support those afflicted by mental illness, but I don't know how to fulfill this because I am poor, I am already in debt from a degree that has nothing to do with mental health or psychology, and I have extreme social anxiety. Do you have any suggestions for someone like me?**",12Dec2020,1

I am 26 years old, 25 weeks pregnant, and in a bad relationship with someone who is very manipulative and cruel to me. I want to leave, but need help with the “how”. I could really use some advice with what I should do next. 

We were in love and are currently engaged, but everything changed after I became pregnant. We had planned this pregnancy and it is still very much wanted, but his personality changed like a switch. He does things that upset me, and when I ask him to stop, he mocks me and imitates my crying while calling me a baby. He twists everything around on me so that I am the one at fault and tells me that I always try to make him look like the bad guy. He’s manipulative and has been physically abusive twice in the past. I’m exhausted and stressed out of my mind. I can’t sleep at night and its affecting my work.

I forgave him every other time things would get tense between us, but I think I am finally done. I know that I deserve better and I want to leave.

The problem is, I don’t know where to start exactly. I have a good apartment close to my job and all of the utilities are also in my name. I usually work 40 hours a week and can afford everything for myself easily. Lately, I’ve only been averaging 24 hours a week and my bank account is always low. I also pay for all of the groceries which he mainly eats all of (yes he eats more than twice what a pregnant woman can.) We don’t share bank accounts, though, he does usually help make up whatever rent I am short on. We actually work together, but he is upper management and makes a lot more than I do. We are currently trying to save up so that we could move into a bigger apartment together, which is why he doesn’t contribute to the other bills I guess.

I have no reliable family to help me. They were abusive to me as a kid and I no longer am in contact with them.

If I leave him, there’s no way that I could afford to live by myself with a baby. I do get some maternity leave paid, but not much. Then who will watch my child when I’m at work? How will I afford child care? I feel so lost. I’m afraid that I will just stay in this relationship, because its easier than worrying about what I will do alone.

I feel like I have failed my baby already, because he either grows up with two parents that are no good for each other or lives half of his life in child care like I did. I have thought about adoption, but I hate to think about just giving him away to someone else. I was/am still so excited to meet him and raise him.

599,"I'm sorry if this is not the right sub for this, but I really would like to get advice from people who had experience. I am 25 and around 2 years ago I came out as a gay, first for myself, and after that every new friend I met I would tell him about it when the question about if i'm having a girlfriend arrived. It's important because this is when I started university, so I have a new set of friends from university who already knows it about me. overall I am pretty confident with my current friends.

My hardest time comes with people from my past who knew me as ""hetrosexual"" (tbh I wouldn't even admit it for myself at the time that I was gay). 

now, a group of friends that I knew arond 4 years ago is making a meeting, and I havnt seen them since I came out as a gay. I know it should be simple, but I get anxiety from the thought of meting a bunch of people from my past, and than making a dramatic pause when they will ask me if I have a girlfriend and I will tell them the truth instead. I know it's stupid, since all friends I know from university for example knows im gay if they asked me because its much easier for me with people I havn't met prior. but when it comes to people from the past, it's really hard for me and making me feel anxious. one possibility is to just fastly say ""no I dont have a girlfriend at the moment"" and move on, but if I do it also it will makes me feel bad since im backtracking all the progress i've done in the last 2 years. maybe I should just not arrive and that's it? that would make things easier, though I will admit I would like to meet those folks, and I can see why this can't be the solution for every meeting from the past.

We have gym class together, so we usually hang out during gym. We are always partners, and on the same team. Anyways I have a huge crush on him. He doesn’t really have a lot of close friends, and he’s kinda a misfit. Last week, he started talking to me less in gym. we had this friend group that basically disowned him for no reason. And one of the girls in that friend group is in our gym class. She literally hates him and he hates her. And what’s surprising me is he is talking to her more then me. It’s not like she doesn’t hate him anymore because she told me that she still hates him. And he still hates her because he’s told me many times. Anyway, he is showing me many signs that he likes me, but this is giving me mixed feelings. For example, I told him that I hated myself and he listed all the things that are good about me, and basically called me pretty. I also asked him if he was mad at me (because he wasn’t talking to me) and he said no why, and when I said because you don’t talk to me as much he said “oh yeah I’ve been thinking about that” implying that he’s been thinking about talking to me. He also defends me all the time. He’s showing way more signs he likes me but I can’t list them all. You know how when you like someone you try to look cool around them, like making it look like you have friends by talking to your friends around them? I think that’s what he’s doing to me but I’m not sure. So does he like me or no?",12Dec2020,1

606,"I met this dude 2 years ago on a fandom community in amino. He was such a nice guy, literally one of the nicest people you could met. We were friends up until recently. There was another girl (who was 13 when I first joined the amino) who was an artist. He got banned off of every single amino community we were both a part of because he had major anger issues and would lash out at anyone who gave him critique.... Which has made me realize he wasn't as ""nice"" of a guy as he made himself out to be.

Well, for a while this guy was like a brother to me. Not just to me, but also the girl who'd now be 15. They used to call each other ""brother/sister"" all the time and they had a, what it seemed to be, a loving relationship. Well, as I found out recently, their relationship was *TOO* ""loving"" and it's absolutely disturbing. Just last night, I found out from several of my online friends that he was grooming her. And they're now in a relationship and he's publicly stated on Instagram that he was gonna marry this girl when she was of age. I also found out some hours ago that she wasn't the first minor he tried to groom. This man is 25 and this girl is 15. This isn't just word of mouth, I've seen the evidence. She's not even of legal age to consent yet. However, somehow, her parents are totally fine with it. Our friends have tried to talk to her about it, however she's blocked all of them. She's not willing to listen. I'm scared and worried for this girl, however Idk her real name or where she lives. Is there anyway I can find out and tip the police or CPS?

But honestly i feel like I've made little to no progress in recovery. I've gotten 2 MRI's, one for the knee and one for elbow/hand (elbow is where the impact of the accident mostly was) and a nerve test. i haven't gotten the full results back(specialist is looking over it) for the nerve test but the doctor who was doing the test showed me that all signals from the nerves that go pastmy elbow slow down significantly.

I’m experiencing insomnia and I don’t know why...

This started Tuesday. I was sleeping great every single day. 8-10 hours like a baby. Almost a year. Then since Tuesday, I haven’t been able to sleep. It takes me until 6-8 AM to finally fall asleep. 

I just started my period and my period does seem to be irregular and that it’s so light it’s spotting. Not sure if it’s related.


I would like to point out that I’ve had insomnia once before in my life. It was when I was under extreme and crippling anxiety from exams back in college. However, I’m not subjected to that form of stress anymore.

I also wear blue light blockers.

My sister‘s husband was belligerently drunk on thanksgiving and beat my sister up one night. She told me that they were going through a rough patch, but this was the first time he assaulted her.  


She kicked him out of the house,  so he was staying with his parents for a few days. 

He and my sister had a discussion where he said he was black out drunk and didn’t remember a thing. He deleted all his social media and was profusely apologetic. He since has joined Alcoholics Anonymous, and is seeking counseling. Because of this, she has allowed him back in the house , but he is sleeping on the couch and they are not speaking . 

Before you judge, my sister doesn’t have the means to get her own place and she was worried about this affecting the kids too much around the holidays. 

Anyway, I am still very mad about the situation. I haven’t really said my piece to him because he can’t even look at me and hides like a coward when I am around.

621,"Hey guys I really need your opinion on something. Do you think that being a free use slut could be someone's passion in life? That it could be what makes them truly happy/gives their life 'purpose'?

I'm asking because I consider myself a free use slut. I'm still relatively new at this kind of stuff, but that's not the point.

But like other than this and maybe singing, I don't really have any passion for anything. I don't have any in-person friends (and I can't make any because I can't drive). My 'hobbies' bore me and are just used as distractions to pass time. 

My psychiatrist says I've been more depressed and suicidal lately because my life is stagnant and that I have no passion/nothing to look forward to. I'm disabled and unable to work/at least have a career due to physical impairments and the pain they cause.

Thinking about being a free use slut again when COVID slows down is like one thing I am looking forward to. I'm very much looking forward to sucking as much cock as I can, swallowing thick tasty loads, getting my ass used and maybe even bred.

They shot me a dirty look and said something nasty (and of cos they did, I understand why) but I felt so affected because I couldnt explain to them that I didnt do it on purpose/it was an accident/I am a beginner at this sport. I also apologised. So for the entire fucking day, I was thinking about how they are judging me/probably cursing me, etc. It also gives me anxiety and makes me wanna cry.

I live with my mother, and she assured me she hadn’t touched it (which checks out since I’m the only one who cooks and cleans the kitchen and takes out the trash). I’d used it on Tuesday evening, took out the trash on Tuesday night and couldn’t find it the following Wednesday evening. 

I assumed that I must have thrown it into the trash by mistake. Very unlike me but I do just keep it on the counter (not near the trash, but perhaps when throwing away vegetable peel, I swiped it into the bin and didn’t notice. Weird as it was a heavy stainless steel) 

Life moved on. I used the spare peeler. Forgot about it. 

Then today happened. 

I used the spare peeler last night to make dinner. I left it on the counter.

644,"I (14F), have a problem. I have a really hard time understanding my emotions. 



You see, I am often confused about what I am feeling. I’m constantly asking myself, “what is this? Is this happiness, anger, sickness, hope?”


Other people find it so easy to tell happiness from anger, but for me, when I do feel these things and then say, “is this joy?” the feeling goes away, and I’m not the emotion anymore.


Example: Let’s say I’m in class, and I remember a funny joke. That’s happiness, but as soon as I ask if I’m happy, I’m not anymore.



Often times I’m left feeling empty. I don’t know why I can’t feel! It’s a constant struggle that I haven’t told anyone about yet.



TLDR: I can’t tell what I’m feeling.

I figured everything out except the logistics of actually funding the event. I want to give away the trees (eastern redbuds) for free. Each tree right now costs $5. Thats $500 that I need to raise.

646,"So everyone who knows me, knows that I like to clean and don’t like mess. So my best friend moved in and we both are studying on the same course. When she moved in we made rules and I told her that we’ll just clean after ourselves and she kept saying yeah I’m super clean. So I was happy that it’ll be easy this year. 

But after she eats she leaves her dishes for days, she leaves her food out, leave food in the fridge to rotten and the place a mess. Like when she enters she throws her jacket off and bag. This stuff really triggers me and is really bad for my anxiety. So I will just end up cleaning it all and especially in front of her so maybe she’ll get the idea that this annoys me. So yesterday after our lecture I deep cleaned the flat. And as soon as she comes I was just wrapping the vacuum she saw it. And she didn’t say anything and just throw her bag and jacket on the sofa. Didn’t put her shoes in a corner. And it really broke my heart. Like when I bring it up she’s like yeah I’ve got exams to study for but so do I😩but I’m always the one whose cooking and cleaning for you like it’ll be nice to get appreciated for once.

647,"I used to call and talk with one of my friends all the time, practically every day. I would always call if I wanted to show her something, mention something etc. It was never without reason, because I wanted to have an actual conversation instead of just an awkward environment. One day I called and she didn’t pick up, so I thought she’s busy. I sent her a snap, and she left me in opened. A day later she still hasn’t responded, so I sent her another one asking if she wants to call, and that I drew something I really wanted to show her. She just left me on opened and sent a streak a few hours later.

So I ended up sending about 7 snaps regarding why she’s leaving me on opened, and she didn’t open them. Our streak was about to expire so I asked her through iMessage if she could send one, hoping it would start a conversation. She said “Don’t rlly wanna talk, and I sent the streak, cya”. And that made pretty disappointed. So I told her we haven’t called in practically a month, and she told me that we texted instead. I wanted to ask why she never called back, but I remember one time she told me she had phone anxiety.... even though she also called other people and told me she couldn’t call because she was calling so-and-so. 

Sad thing is, I take online school while she takes traditional school. She gets to see her friends all day and then calls then after school, while I haven’t seen her in a whole year. I asked if she could call tomorrow, she said she has homework. I asked if she can call in 2  days, she said she’s cleaning the house then. All other days are school days.

My mom yells at me about it sometimes, I know she’s right and I deserve it, but I just feel like an absolute failure.

652,"Well basically I need some advice on some things, I’ll give you some background on what went down. Sorry it’s gonna be long.
I’m an exotic dancer, and it has always been a point of contention between us. I only go to work when I get a text from someone telling me to come out because that’s when I make real money, and that happens roughly every 2-3 days. Every time I have to go to work the energy in the house is weird, and he has consistently gotten upset that I drink at work. Only problem is that I can’t stop doing that. The client who really makes me the big bucks gets upset when we don’t have fun and drink with him. Yes I know it’s unhealthy, but it’s the life I live because it affords me the comfort I want. Anyways, I almost never come home sloppy drunk, just regular drunk. As if you went out and had 3-5 drinks with your buddies, and I drink this usually over the course of 4-5 hours. Another think he gets upset about it that I have a client who I actually consider a good friend. I’ve known him longer than my (ex) boyfriend and he’s always been a cool guy. Me and the other girls go to his pool parties or out to eat with him as a group and it’s nothing weird. Well my (ex) boyfriend always asks me uncomfortable questions when I go out with my girlfriends (which is actually rare) like if that friend met with us and if he touches us/kisses us. I hate this because I told him I don’t allow this behavior but he just doesn’t seem to believe me.
Lastly the breakup happened after a girls night. We drank wine and my (and his) place and then went to the strip club for the last 45 minutes it was open to eat and have some drinks. I passed out on the couch when I got home. Next morning I wake up and he’s angry, telling me I wouldn’t wake up and asking me who went to the club with us and if that guy was there and if he was kissing us. I told him no it was just the girls and I have pictures to prove it, but he told me he was tired of it and couldn’t  do it anymore.
Well sure enough after I get home from work last night he tells me he made a mistake and wants to get back together. My thing is- isn’t this same problem just going to keep happening? I told him I already cook and clean, take us out, make sure we have everything we need and pay the most when things are divided up bc I make the most between him and our other roommate, so I won’t compromise on this and will continue to live my life. He says he can change but do you think he can manage changing an insecurity that?",12Dec2020,1

656,"TLDR: my dog bit my friends dad, although a minor bite, there were legal issues and my family had to give compensation to him, and I blocked the father and the old friend because I thought it was the best decision. 


To preface, my family has been taking care of a stray we found 5 years ago, and he became the family dog. However, he started being very territorial and biting people he didn’t know. (I wasn’t aware at the time) After several lawsuits, my father decided to built a fence on our property to solve the problem, while our more passive dog roams free. Now, to the actual story. 
A friend was spending the day with me at the house. Everything was fine until night came it her father came to pick her up. When he dad came out of the car, the dog ran and bit him and was kicked by the father. I had no idea the dog had gotten out. Luckily it was a small bite, but my family and I were mortified. We helped him take care of it and brought him $100 to compensate for the emergency visit. 3 months later, I get a text from the father saying he contacted our insurance company about more financial compensation. Not sure why he would message me, (16f at the time) the minor in the situation.  After this I was instructed by my mom to block the father and the friend. I also wanted to block the friend because I didn’t know how to go about the situation anymore. Anyway, fast forward another 3 months and I saw the friend at school for the designated SAT day, reminding me of the events. I know it makes me sound like a wimp, but i was worried that she’d spread rumors about me, considering what happened what embarrassing and she knows a few other embarrassing things about me.

I’m not blaming anyone for my problems, I know it’s mostly my fault for not doing better.

I am about to be 23. Was a good student in school so I always believed that I will do decent and figure out life. But at 23, I feel completely lost. I have a job in digital marketing, it is fine but I don't work dedicatedly.

Whenever I try to do something I get distracted and fall in trap. I feel like I am not able to give my time to things I want to pursue and these habits are becoming my way to escape the reality.

I don’t really like how a person could go through life and be a great person, but just because they didn’t believe, they won’t go to heaven. Vice versa, a incredibly sinful person could go to heaven if they accepted Jesus in their life on their deathbed.

Tbh religion is kinda dumb because all the types of religions   think that they are the real one. So, the last time I tried to tell my parents that I don’t really believe, they said I wouldn’t go to heaven and be with them. But so does every other religion right? So someone from say Buddhism wouldn’t go to heaven according to them and vice versa. 

I don’t like the idea that my life is controlled by an all knowing being, I would like to do with my life as I want. And, if he really is real why are some people not believing? If he created us, then we should believe in him. 

I still want to be a good person, but am kinda worried my parents would basically disown me if I can out as not a believer. Last time I did say something, they lost it and got super mad and made me read a bunch of books to “prove” that god is real and miracles happen because of him. What’s to say it’s not some other god doing miracles? Wouldn’t every religious person say that their god made those miracles happen?

663,"I posted this body of text on the study advice thread in the linguistics subreddit, but I don’t think it is very active and I think it merits a broader scope.


I’m in a weird place in life. I have been struggling with some mental/emotional dysfunction that peaked in college and led me to pretty quickly flunk out after a record of excellent performance. It’s been 8-10 years since then and I’m finally starting to get it together with medications and counseling. I have set my sights on going back to school (currently in pre-req classes) for medical ultrasonography because I have a lot of non-degree experience in veterinary medicine and I’ve always found medicine a good balance of challenging and practical. Which I feel sonography would be.

However, something popped up in one of my statistics assignments about a face-to-name matching survey and I literary went tf OFF about sound symbolism and why I strongly suspect that the man with a more youthful appearance-closer-set features and narrower face was 75% of the time chosen as “Tim” and the balding, older man with a more heavy set, a wider face, and more rounded features was assigned as “Bob.” Of course there were things to consider from an introductory statistics standpoint, like the sample size and the survey reliability, but I’m genuinely surprised by how EXCITED I got to talk about linguistics. Language excites me so much, I am such a nerd!!! I’m surprised I still have this passion.

Part of me thinks maybe I should scrap my allied heath plan and just go back for what I originally wanted to do? When I flunked out of school I was almost done with a double-major in English and Spanish—the second-best and closest approximation I could get at a university that didn’t offer a linguistics program.

Is this legitimately worth considering? Am I too old? (28/29.) I am still very interested and quick but my mind isn’t what it once was. How long would school take? And are there more practical jobs rather than just writing academic papers? Sometimes I’m Glad I didn’t finish my English course, because while I thought I was headed for academia it would have been torture; in the same vein that I find entry-level clerical work and manual-only labor to be extremely tedious after a while.

* Most indoor activities are closed (rock-climbing gym, go-karting, heck even sky zone)
* Don't want to stay at home watching tv/pc/reading
* I work-out/run/bike at home during the week so I'd like to do something different if I'm gonna exercise

671,"I want to keep the story to the point otherwise it would get too lenthy. (I am gay and nobody knows it.)
 
Backstory:

I met him in highschool. We live in a same street
We became bestfriends instantly and used to hangout almost daily. After being his friends for like 2 3 month i realised i was attracted to him. I knew he was straight but i couldn't help myself falling in love with him because we were always together.

Me being in love with him affected our friendship in both good and bad way. Because at one side i did everything to keep him happy. I would go beyond to help him when ho got in trouble and everything and it made our friendship stronger.

On the other as i was completely obsessed with him so i only wanted him to hangout with me all time. I would get upset when he would go out with other friends and not invite me (i knew it is wrong to get upset with him on this thing but i felt so bad when he was with other friends). Me being so clingy did affect our friendship and we arrgued several times and one time he and i did not talk to eachother for 7 8 months. (I was both happy and sad due to this because i wanted to fall out of love with him so i thought this completely not talking to him would help me forget him completely) but after 7 months he came to me and apologised to me(bec he ended the friendship) After being away with him for so long i thought my feelings for him would be gone but when that was not the case. Wd became bestfriends again.

Current:

Its been four years.We are still bestfriends now and meet everyday. I am still in love with him.

I will tell u how deeply i am in love with. I know it would sound so creepy and wrong on my side but i cant help it. I think about him daily like literally. Whenever i see him my heartbeat become so fast. I become instantly happy whenever he messages me and even when he tags me on facebook. Whenever we are together i 'accidentally' try to touch him and put my arm around him but i dont make it obvious. I have made scenerios in my head both sexual and non-sexual (i know so creepy) and when i am not doing anything i play these scenarios in my head.
It's been like that for four years. 

Now he is getting engaged to a girl. Seeing him with his gf breaks my heart. I am so in love with him i don't think i can ever fall out of love. I know it is making me mentally and emotionally weak everyday and i want this constant suffering to stop. I've tried everything to fall out of love. As I'm in a third world country where being gay is considered as wrong so i can't have any boyfriend so that i can move on.

I want to not think about him all the time and fall out of love. Because my happiness depends on him. I feel unhappy even if he posts a photo of him with another oh his friend on social media. I know this is wrong and unfair to him but i dont know what else to do. I what should i do. I know breaking the friendship would not help me because as i mentioned earlier we once didn't talk to eachother for like 6 7 months but in these month i couldn't stop thinking about him( i even saw so many podcasts on Internet to help myself at that time and tried so hard to not think about by keeping myself busy in different activities)

What should i do?

673,"My friend (16, I'm 16 too) is depressed and suicidal. She self harms, I don't know how usually but these days it seems like she cuts herself every day. She has a lot of issues with her body (in general but also because she's trans and in the closet, she's very dysphoric constantly) and a lot of issues in general in her life as well. But no matter what I offer, she won't accept any help and won't talk to anyone. A part of that is also her anxiety, she suffers from panic attacks too. I sent her numbers of social workers, a trans woman I know that's willing to talk and try to understand her, and programs for LGBTQ teens who don't feel safe in their homes and school. I also suggested helping her find a psychologist because I know a good one that also deals specifically with this subject. She won't talk to her teachers (she told one teacher but only half-truths, I don't know what is going on with that and anyway he's not a therapist) nor her parents. Her parents are also not very supportive, her mother specifically and she's the dominant one in the house. 

And I don't know where to go from here. I can't just force her to talk to a therapist, because if she doesn't do it on her own accord she just won't say anything and I can't talk for her. I can't invite a social worker to talk to her parents because she won't cooperate. I can't inform the police that she's suicidal because it will make things worse, and she still won't talk.

677,"Tomorrow I’ve got online lectures from 12-2am and the license test on 2am. I’ll be taking the test immediately after the classes. During the test, I can rent a car for $30 to take the practical driving test. 

My driving instructor told me I’m perfectly ready for the test but shouldn’t beat myself up if I don’t make it on the first try since it’s common. I’m also pretty confident. He called today asking if tomorrow I’d like to warm up for 2 hours before my lectures just to get me all readied-up for the test. I panicked and agreed since the conversation was so unexpected and awkward.

We agreed at 9am since its the only time that allows me to be back home in time for my online lectures. Looking back, I don’t think spending money on both a final lecture and renting a car is wise. 9am is also too early. But I’d also hate canceling on his plans and potentially missing out on his clients for me. Maybe it’s not the ideal happy ending for my driving school era but should I cancel the final course?",12Dec2020,1

Chapter 2

She arrived at the inn at six-thirty, nervous and hungry. The building was an old pump house situated on the opposite side of the river to the town, filtering what came through the door and pumping it out of its dusty old chimney. It clung to the riverbank like a fungus, with red brick walls festooned with small ferns and lichen. Tall reeds and bulrushes cushioned the waterside wall, and mayflies danced in the evening sun to the gentle rhythms of the flowing canal and pub chatter. Bea entered and found a seat at the corner of the room. Looking around she recognised many of the town's people. There were the two farmers, Mr. Creamsworth, and Mrs. Birch. Mr. Jones and Ms. Bennet from the primary school, on separate tables. Ms. Stevens in the corner talking to her cat. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary; certainly no sign of any talking mice. In the midst of Bea’s observations, a man laughed heartily and banged on the table, startling her.

‘I should go to the bar and see if I find out anything’ she said to herself.

‘Hi, what can I get you?’ the bartender asked.

‘Hi, yes, I’ll have a-’ the bartender had large front teeth and a pointy nose, which Bea eyed suspiciously ‘Actually, I’m here for a meeting’

‘Which one? The board game club is just over there.’ she pointed with her eyes.

‘No, the one being held upstairs’.

‘We don’t have an upstairs? Unless you mean the attic.’

Bea realised that the lady must not know anything, and reassessed herself for assuming from her mouse-like complexion. She walked back to her seat. The clock was ticking, and she had a feeling - quite a strong one - that the mice wouldn’t take it lightly if she was late. There was an entrance behind the bar she could see, but other than the front door and bathroom doors, Bea couldn’t see anything that might lead to the attic. The idea to walk around and look was too risky; she didn’t want to bump into anyone and start a conversation.

She made her way outside to see if there was any way of getting to the attic, managing to find a small window high up on the wall facing the river. She searched around for a means to get there, and found an extendable ladder lying alongside the building.

‘Of course’ she sighed.

She wasn’t the most active of humans, and if Bea was being honest, avoided sports at all cost. She wasn’t a runner, or a climber, or a rower, or a swimmer, cycler, javelin thrower, weight lifter, kite flyer, surfboarder, lion tamer, snake charmer, race car driver, or any other type of sportsperson - and that went for double when it came to heights. The only thing that Bea liked that was active, was walking. Her eyes ran the length of the ladder. *And what's climbing a ladder but walking… upwards?*

‘O.K. It’s just a ladder. One step at a time and don’t look down; that’s what they say on TV, isn’t it?’

She placed her left hand tentatively on the wet metal of the ladder and took a deep breath.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After a harrowing ten minutes, she made it to the window. She took a peek before deciding to climb in. The room was *full* of mice - all of them white. Hundreds of them. Sitting on top of  dining tables. Looking a bit closer she noticed that a lot of them were wearing handkerchiefs as clothing, and the fur of some of them had been styled; braided and beaded like druids of old, or combed wavy and long that Bea herself was a little jealous of. The fur on some of their heads was spiked up high or slicked back, and some simply wore a hat. The whole congregation was chatting away and enjoying the mouse equivalent of hors d'oeuvre. The chatter gradually quietened, however, and the clinking of metal and glass was heard for a brief moment and then stopped. The news of her appearance spread and the entire party turned to face her. She stood in the still air, trapped. She thought about pushing herself into the river but knew she wouldn’t. A guard walked up to a mouse wearing a crown and whispered in his ear.

‘Bah ha ha ha!’ the king burst out, and the room followed. One of the guards pounded the table, sending nuts and cheese and small tankards shooting into the air. Bea's nerves were stretched thin.

‘My fellow mice, look upon our guest with praise! She has attempted to flatter us by entering in the way customary to our kind. Worry not again, Ms. Willis, for one day we wish to use the front door like yourself’ the king had an unusually deep, hearty voice for such a small animal.

‘Quickly, help her inside. We may not be so fragile falling off of great heights, but our guest here will surely make a great mess if left unaided.’

A group of alarmingly strong mice came to the window and helped her inside.

‘Take a seat and relax, you are in good company I can assure you’ he said, waving his hand in the direction of her chair.

She was led to the only seat at the table. She sat near the king, who stood beside a tiny throne with golden acorns embedded in its armrests. On the table, she could see all manner of nuts, and of course, plenty of cheese. A feast in the eyes of a mouse, but what Bea would later recall a stone in her stomach.

‘Welcome, Ms. Willis. I am sure you have already guessed why you are here.’

Bea hadn’t guessed, she hadn’t guessed at all. Unless the guess was that she would be eaten. Without knowing how to proceed she stood up but remained hunched under the low roof.

‘Hello, everyone’ she said meekly. ‘I am not sure why I am here, but I’m happy to help in any way I can.’

*What was that!? I’m happy to help in any way I can?*

‘What?’ the king deliberately blurted ‘My dear, there are many reasons! But it is not up to me to tell you. There are many a mouse here who are more than happy to show you their gratitude!’

Bea turned while looking down to see a mouse ambling over. It was injured and walked with a forked twig under its arm.

‘I nearly met my death at the ‘ands of that cretin, Marmite’ the young mouse said. ‘Trapped in a bush I was, until you came running along and scar’d him.’

Another mouse - a particularly large mouse - terrifyingly large actually, nearly 6 inches tall on its hind legs - expressed great thanks to the bird feeder full of nuts in her garden. Bea intended that to be for the birds, but she thought not to mention it now.

‘As you can see Ms Willis, our kind are indebted to you in life and in love. This is why we hold this great feast for you.’ said the king. ‘But that is not all, for we must ask for your help once more. You see, Ms Willis, there was a time when the ecosystem was one, and all animal kind lived in synchronous harmony. There was no need for fighting amongst each other for nature was bountiful, and the land was not bordered. Now, we are plagued with war and famine. The tales of our families are no longer intertwined, and what used to be a paw on each other's shoulders, is now a claw to each of our throats.’ 

The entire room was silent, and for a moment Bea felt like she was in a dream.

‘Ms Willis, it is clear who I speak of’

This caused a stir amongst the mice.

‘It is the *cats!*’ 

The room burst with expressions of fierce anger and fearful dread.

‘Filthy felines!’ a mouse spat out.

‘Greedy grimalkin!’

‘Good for nothing body snatchers took my young’ another shouted.

‘I heard that Oscar cat is nothing but a sunbathing belly scratcher!’ one of them laughed.

*Oscar!? Surely they don’t mean…*

‘Settle down, settle down. Let us get back to the question at hand.’ the king commanded.

‘Ms. Willis, as you can see these furry friends of yours are nothing but a menace to our peaceful population. This is why we must ask you to help us.’",12Dec2020,1

689,"I'm on the autistic spectrum and I'm 22, in college, trying to be an adult.

Things have been hard. I don't know how to manage my emotions so I've been crying a lot in my dorm, which scared my roommate into leaving. I've been living alone in my dorm for months now

I just missed my final exam in one of my classes because I got the date wrong. The professor sent me several emails saying when it was due but I only saw one of them because I don't check my email. And the one I did see, I misread as being just a practice exam. Now I have an F in the class, the first one I've ever gotten. And I really broke down about it instead of studying

I used to think that I wanted a friend group, a social life and even a girlfriend, something I felt like I never had before. But it's been taking up so much of my energy to just try to get closer to one goddamn person. I don't think I even know how to get closer to them

Every skill I learned through my life to manage my academics and myself, from showering and brushing my teeth regularly to just saying thank you to people, I used to do effortlessly. It was second nature. Now I struggle to even remember to do those things

Now I'm trying to study for the rest of my exams but I'm so down in the dumps I can barely do anything. And I don't know how to pick myself up

I don't know what's wrong with me. Is this really my fate? Is this what I want? To be alone and incapable of fitting in to society and fending for myself? Is it because it's all I've ever known and I take comfort in it? I don't fucking know anymore. I'm not sure if I even care anymore. It seems like every time I put in any effort, I get nothing back.

So since my first post I have signed my son up for the local football team and the big brother program which he starts both next week so he can finally get some male role models

Me and my wife sat our daughters down and had a serious talk about why they have been so distant and abusive towards there brother and also if my mother has said anything to them

I have also told all of my children that they are allowed to speak to there grandmother on the phone (as long as I am near) however they are no longer allowed to see her in person

I haven’t had the chance to talk to my mother personally as the day I was meant to my wife broke her thumb at work so I was at the hospital all day (she okay btw).

I have also made it mandatory that all of the family spend at least one evening a week playing some game (hopefully this will improve there relationship)

I haven’t been able to sign us up for family therapy because our local one is all booked up till late January so I signed us up to that as well

699,"""Open up the drapes so that I'm not blamed for your mother's emotional state."" 

This is what my boyfriend just told my son because I'm not very okay this morning. I'm not crying or screaming, I'm just being quiet. I need to know that I'm not nuts. This is a typical day for me but I'm going to present you with this morning's scenario. I don't know if it's me and my ADHD or if it's him.

I woke up at 8:50 AM, which I suppose is probably late, but I was laying in bed with a cup of tea and just trying to wake up. My boyfriend started getting on me about things not being done. I hadn't made the kids breakfast yet, and I hadn't cleaned the litter box, and I hadn't done anything because I slept in and I wasn't ready.

But his attitude wasn't helping, so I went into the bathroom to just sit and try to gather my thoughts so that I could get some clarity of mind, because I can't DO ANYTHING until I feel less overwhelmed. 

Which he immediately came in to get on me about ""hiding in the bathroom all day"" and knowing that I hadn't yet asked me questions that he already knew in a passive-aggressive mode saying things like ""What did the kids eat? Have the kids eaten?"" basically calling me lazy, and I said I wasn't ready and I needed to clear my head, so he then told my son to come in and sweep up the bathroom BECAUSE I was in there. 

Then when I didn't respond because I DO NOT react emotionally to things he said ""Why are you ignoring me? B\*\*\*."" And then I said, 'Did you just call me a \*\*\*\*\*?"""" He said, ""NO. I just said it."" 

I am so freaking confused and I feel like either I am an idiot or he's wrong. Every time I try to pick myself up, or quit smoking, or try to start working out, I'm either called selfish or self-absorbed for working on myself because I should only be focusing on the family or I feel so down emotionally that I can't bring myself to quit smoking because of the fear of the emotions that I am going to have to go through if I can't suppress them.",12Dec2020,1

Basically, I've been feeling this way for about 3 years now and for the first year or so, I thought I was some joke. That I was making this whole thing up in my head for attention. But this past year, I've actually been trying to do something, anything, to distract from this hole I've dug myself in.
And, is it bad I kinda don't want to get out? I mean, it sucks. I constantly cry myself to sleep, feel guilty everyday, can't do anything, etc... But it somehow, feels comforting.
It makes sense in a way, this is honestly been my main experience for the past year. Doing things wrong, feeling wrong. Now, I can't imagine a life where this doesn't happen. It seems like a pipe dream. A somehow scary one.

And this confuses me a lot, these few months. I've been getting worse, I can tell and people around me can tell that I'm.. Off. Even my brain is going off. It tells me that I went through what I called the 'worst week of my life' but I can't remember exactly why it was the worst week of my life, it's all just fog. Even if I try to recall anything at all, I can only guess what happened and what I felt based off the entries I kept.

706,"So, last night is something I’m only beginning to process as I spent most of it anxious. My partner and I were drinking, they had a shitty day, dealt with the dmv like four times for nothing. That kind of shitty day. On top of that, it’s been about two months since our collective last drink, for reasons I don’t feel the need to specify here apart from drinking being medically unsound and reacting badly with meds. Like, coma bad. 

Anyway, I think the first mistake was us both misunderstanding the sheer amount of time that two months is between semi-regular drinking. 

So, they get sick, I don’t — I had stopped about 30 minutes before or so, when I felt as if I MIGHT get sick. Get themselves down the stairs to the bathroom after falling on our floor and my helping them up the best I can with partial weight bearing. 

At this point, I’m really fucking worried, and they aren’t even answering my texts checking in on them so I go down myself. Bear in mind, this is thirty minutes into about a two hour process. I being the responsible (at least imo) far-less-drunk take a seat on the bathroom floor, and I wait. I wake them up from passing out several times and eventually I get snapped at. 

Full lucidity “GO UPSTAIRS. You’re annoying.”

So I go, not wanting to wake our other roommates and hurt, but still worried. Wait another 40 minutes, still no answers to my checking in, and I go down again, find them passed out on the toilet. But this time they can at least get up and get into bed. 

Get up the next day, he’s still asleep, so I unclog the toilet and spray the tub with something that might clean it out, and... I brought it up with them. Because, you know. Communication. They told me that they hope I don’t spend the whole day moping (after admitting fault) and that everyone says stuff they don’t mean while drinking like that excuses it.

I just don’t know what to do or how to articulate that it still hurt, and open it up to discussion without being accused of fixating.",12Dec2020,1
707,"Hello

Sorry if I have mistakes in my writing I'm not perfect in English, it isn't my first language 

Please help me out, I need an advice 

So me and my husband come from completely different backgrounds, I lived very comfortably my whole life money wise, my husband needed to work and sacrifice a lot in his life to earn money, sometimes he sees things differently than me, but that's ok, except when it comes to animals, I couldn't be ok.

Him and his father both work breeding some animals as a side work, to earn extra money. 
When I first knew about this I was a little excited , I imagined happy cats and happy animals with their babies surrounding us, but that was not the case.
 
He got a room with about 10 cages full with cats, they were angry and dirty and sad and crying all the time, I was shocked.

Over the years, I tried talking to him about how this is not ok, it is not ok to keep animals like that, they are suffering, no creature wants to be locked in a cage 24 hours all the time just to breed, you can't make their life a living hell just to earn some extra cash, but he couldn't understand, he kept telling me how this is how people do it, and that I don't know anything about animals so I shouldn't talk about them and what's right for them.

We always fight about this subject, as soon as I talk about them he gets irritated and angry and shuts me off, and I don't wantbus to loose each other because of this.

I kept nagging and complaining about the smell they bring and he got rid of all of them but 3 cats, one male and two females.

While I felt very happy he got rid of most of them and sold them, I feel I'm going crazy over the last cats  especially the male one, he cries all the time, with the saddest voice ever, he wants to get out, he cries and diggs the floor and he just wants to get out, he tries to get out all the time and I feel useless , I'm an adult and this cat is right in front of me asking for help and I can't save him or do anything, one time I got him out to walk in the room for a little bit, and he peed on the flood because he is not neutered, my husband got angry and asked me to never let them out again, I felt hopeless. 

I don't know what to do, it is not illegal to breed like that in my country, and even if it was I don't want to tell on him, I'm just very sad and I don't know what's the right thing to do. 

Please help me out, what is the right thing to do? What would you do?

710,"Context: I live in NYC, and I usually take an Uber to my parents’ house on Christmas. We do gifts there in the morning and then visit my grandma.

Given the rising COVID cases I don’t feel safe taking an Uber to my parents. I know that Uber is taking precautions, but I am still nervous. I also don’t feel comfortable seeing my grandma because she is 94 years old and immunocompromised, so I plan to call her instead of visiting.

My parents have a car of their own so I proposed that they come to me (in their stranger-free car) and I will host Christmas morning - I will cook brunch for them and we can do gifts at my apartment. They can then go see my grandma while I call her. 

My parents are angry at me and are accusing me of being irrational. They say that I am safe in an Uber as long as I wear my mask, and that the rising cases are just people who aren’t wearing masks. My dad also says that seeing my grandma is fine as long as I wear a mask.

Sometimes this has extended to a feeling like she is planning something. I come from a religious family, and I myself too is a Christian. However, shes been acting VERY strange. In Order to lose some weight for powerlifting I have been drinking protein drinks instead of breakfast in the morning. She was trying to tell me I shouldn't and said ""God said those protein drinks are bad for you"". Then denied saying it once I asked ""what did you say"". Another time I was heading to bed and she told me that ""There is a guardian angel watching you and if you do anything that I wouldn't want you to do hes gonna tell me"". Again she back pedalled on this when I asked her ""what did you say?"". What I do know is that shes joined some religious groups on Facebook. She locks herself in her room on Saturdays to pray all day. She also hasn't said anything about the upcoming Christmas even though she typically urges us to put up the tree the weekend after thanksgiving....

The Account is also linked to my personal email. This account was set up on October 8th, that day I was physically at school until 6 o'clock due to powerlifting practice. Is it possible that she got onto my computer, logged in, and then made a reddit account with my email? Why would someone feel a need to do this?

718,"**\*\*TW for mentions of suicide and murder\*\***

Okay so this is a long story, so I\*\*(F20)\*\* want to send an email filled with basically everything my ex-friend\*\*(F19)\*\* ever did to me and really give her hell but I don't know if its a good idea.

So basically, in high school and sixth form, I had this best friend who was incredibly toxic, we were friends for about 8 years, and it was kind of a nightmare and she was very emotionally abusive. Highlights of things she would do:

* Be incredibly condescending on things that I liked,
* Gaslight the hell out of me anytime I called her on anything,
* Isolated me from my old friends and any other friends I would make over the 8 years so she was my only friend,
* Make me text her every single day or she would make me apologise profusely to her ( which happened often because my home life was a mess as I looked after my little brother and sick mother ),
* Lie about a lot of messed up stuff that had happened to her for sympathy whenever I wanted to talk about anything wrong with me and my favourite make my break up with my girlfriend because she was 'toxic'.
* Oh and made me believe that I was the only person keeping her together which was not true as she was doing the same thing to 3 other people.

I had a mental breakdown at 16 and had to go to therapy for a bit from the sheer amount of stress I was under, and just from how she treated me. But again I couldn't leave because she also **((TW skip to the next bold point))** would tell us that she would commit suicide if we were not her friends, send photos of her cut arms and told us she would slit her wrists open when we had a big argument to make us stay. **((TW ENDED))**

Now 2 years ago I called her out on this one lie she had been telling me, where she was apparently dating the ground worker at our school, but I found out that he was friends with my older sister, and had never even met her. I compiled evidence and proof, which I never had for any of her other lies, and I was just done I didn't want to deal with her anymore. So I confronted her and we had a big blow out, and incredibly big argument full of manipulation and she threw a time where I had a mental breakdown (because of her) and how she had forgiven me for that so I had to forgive her for this. Anything she could think of she threw at me, but thankfully my mum and this common friend who she was doing the same thing too, helped me stay strong and I broke off from her, no contact, which was even more effective because we finished school a week later and she lives quite away from me.

So now I have not had any contact with her for 2 years, I blocked her on everything and whatever I missed she blocked me on. However, the more time I have had away the more information I have been given, basically she talked about me a lot to other people, saying incredibly horrific things. Another selection of highlights:

* Said and make incredibly homophobic and transphobic things/jokes (I'm a lesbian and genderfluid)
* Almost got one of her friends to call social services on my family which do I even have to say why that is messed up?
* Now my favourite, when one of my family friends was murdered and I was rightfully distraught she told everyone that I was doing it for attention and that I should 'just get over it'.

I can't stop thinking about it and I just want to know what she was thinking during this time.

Now I want to just reach out this one time, send this essay that I wrote basically saying I know what you did and that I'm doing better now, I want closure and I feel like this is the only way but I don't want to be a bad person, and I feel like I would be a bad person if I sent this. Also, I don't want her to contact me which I think is counter-intuitive but I don't know how else I can get the closure I need.

I've never been particularly happy and haven't had a very good time ever really. I've always felt and been rather alone. Relationships haven't had a good history and family support is none existant.

I'm stuck in a very unhealthy home environment and am more alone than ever. With my education suffering more than it ever has. Things have gone wrong from all angles and I've started considering professional help. I was signed up for a free local therapy organisation a few years ago but after one session I just couldn't do it so I never went back.

727,"***Hello.***

Thank you for stopping by, it means a lot to me. Lately, I've been struggling to understand this one guy I've talked to in social media. I've been talking to him for a couple of weeks now (or a month, I guess). He is 1 of the 3 guys I talked to, it's a small steps for me to try to talk to guys as I struggle a lot with social anxiety when it comes to interacting with people, especially men. Btw you can call me Li, I'm 19 and I'm a girl (female? woman? I don't know). 

You can skip this part because I would like to talk about him a little bit. He seems very welcoming, nice and funny sometimes. We do struggle with time zones as we live in a different part of the world but I don't mind, neither do he I think. I'm not a native English speaker so I sometimes misunderstood things he said but he seemed to be cool about. He sometimes gave an amazing advice about things I struggled with, etc. He made me comfortable. Honestly, he seems like a genuinely good person and I can't be more grateful and happy when talking to him.

But yes I messed up the whole thing. Well, I found out he do music. He seems happy when I said that I will check his music out later. Things going pretty good until I said this, ""once I found my courage maybe I'll try to check your music and even support you"" ""but for now, let's say I'm a little shy"". He seemed curious about it and asked me if I can explain why but I insisted badly and ended up annoyed him. He later on said ""whatever"" and we stop talking.  I didn't explain it because I'm afraid he would be weird out by it.  

I know I'm a bad person. I truly messed up there. But I'm just sharing my true feeling at that time. I wish I didn't said any of that. I'm sure I was shy to hear his voice. Not that I've never hear his voice, he did sent me voice messages. It's just I'm not ready. This voice messages he sent got me shaking(mostly my fingers), chills all over me and a little stress (at the back of my head, I don't know why). I'm insecure with how my voice sounds so I never really send him any voice messages back. It's just me getting shy with guys voice for some reason. I wish I can be cool about it but it's just too much :( But I found my courage later on and surprisingly, I love his music! Every single one of them. His music is really good, it had me feeling guilty for not hyping him up before. I know he is passionate about his work and I respect and adore that. 

After a few days, I messaged him back but his reply is dry, not like usual so I assumed he is mad and apologized to him. I didn't explain why I was shy or said those things because I don't know how to. He said I didn't need to apologize, that I can't control the way people think. After I replied, he left me on seen. I was sad but I gave him the space he need for a week I guess, It was rough. I was crying because I feel guilty and almost had zero idea what to do. This thought of him not wanting to be friends with me kept on haunting me. I can't wait anymore so I messaged him back by saying how long it has been since we talked and wishing his wellness. He replied back with this huge sleepy emoji that can spin around ಥ\_ಥ  I know it's afternoon there so I quickly assumed that he is still mad. I wish I didn't. 

So what my small brain did is encouraging me to apologize again so I did. I sent a few messages saying I don't know if he pissed off still, etc. He left me on seen this time (╥\_╥) and I cried again because I messed up. I wanted to talk to him so badly. 

I honestly don't know what to do. He left me no choice other than to assume things (I know this is wrong but it's the only thing I can do). I don't understand the situation here. He didn't say anything. Did he lost interest in talking to me anymore? or is he just mad? Do i need to spam him with my explanation? or should I wait for him to say anything? Am I wrong in any way? How can I seek for his forgiveness? What should I do really? I overthink and I can't make the right call or decision. I seemed to be desperate now. I wish I can talk to someone about this but I'm afraid if I'm not supposed to do it.  

I'm sorry for the long essay, I wish I could construct the explanation nicer or shorter for your convenience. Also, I know a lot of people here have a much more important question but I would be very grateful and thankful if anybody can help me. 

I hope I don't appear as too much or annoying to you. I'm sorry if I did. And I hope my grammar and spelling mistakes or the lack of vocabulary doesn't bother you so much. Anyways, I hope you're having a good day or night! 

Thank you for your time.",12Dec2020,1

I (17M) want to move out of my dads house to live with my mom full time. As of right now, I live 50/50 with my dads family and my moms family. Week on week off. Anyways, my stepmother is toxic and I can't stand being around her, and her son (14) is even worse. To her, he's an angel child who can't do wrong. The worst punishment he gets is maybe getting yelled at, and he's just a POS in general. Recently my dad found out that $1400 CAD was spent on Microsoft purchases. He originally thought it was a hacker and told my stepmother. My step brother uses my old Xbox account ( I use PC now) and I get all the emails for his purchases. Looked over transaction history for the account and cross referenced it with the banking statements. Everything matched. OK. Look on his Xbox, all the games that were bought were there and installed. Fortnite was the main culprit though, over $1000 dollars spent on V-bucks. So here i am, with my dad, prepared to tell my stepmother and confront my step brother about this.

Confrontation: immediately after asking my stepmother about what had happened, she yells at me saying that me and my dad were ganging up on her son. BS. We go downstairs to confront him, obviously he denies it all. We look at his games which are all still there EXCEPT fortnite which he had literally just deleted. And after all that my stepmother STILL THINKS its a hacker because her son would never do that. 

I just don't think I can handle living at that house anymore because I'm not trusted and things are very unfair. Everything I'm at that house I feel like I can't leave my room or else ill have to talk to my stepmother or ill get yelled at and I just can't anymore. 

I don't want to leave that house because it would absolutely devastate my dad and I don't want to pit him through that, but I think for my own mental health I should be living with my mom. 

At my moms house I talk with my mom and stepdad all the time, every night. It feels like a HOME and not just a house. I really enjoy living at my moms but don't want to break my dad.

Okay - not quite 'sane' but how do you stick to a good routine, sleep well, eat well etc when your roomate/partner is away?

I find that when I'm alone in my flat for 24h+ I completely lose all structure to my days and don't hold myself accountable to any sort of 'normal' habits. For instance, when my partner is here I'm a pretty conscientious person; cook, clean, go to bed on time etc. but when he leaves my life turns into a shambles.

I find myself avoiding food, usually drinking too much alcohol and just lying on the sofa opening and closing apps on my phone. I can get myself sorted to go to work of course but I find myself cancelling most other non-essential appointments and finding a way out of any errands I need to do. My normal sleep schedule also goes completely out the window. I often end up sitting in silence in the flat, KNOWING that it's too quiet/I have things to do but it's like I'm paralysed.

When he comes back and asks me about my day/weekend I feel so embarrassed and lie about what I've been doing.

One of my closest female friends told me that she wants to try escorting, that this idea of easy money for sex intrigues her. I was kinda disturbed by that news and I sought advice from another close friend of mine. That finished me off, she told me that she might think about it as well because she doesn't really have future plans and they both hate their current jobs. 

They are both far from poor and honestly, it seems to me like laziness and greed. I'm severely disappointed in both of them and clueless on what to do now. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm quite open-minded and liberal, if they wanted something like OnlyFans then why not, it's your body and if you want to take advantage of gullible men and your attractiveness then go for it.

735,Hello reddit here is my story.  I'm currently married and living with my wife. But I am getting a divorce.  I met someone recently. We hit it off great.  One thing led to another and we messed around over the phone and then on video. Then one night I went to her house. We messed around. Day or so goes by and I ask her out. She says yes. We are now dating. Everything seems to be going very well. I go to her house after work we cuddle watch TV things like that nothing sexual as she got sick. About a week or so later she starts barely texting me.  Here's the kicker we work together so I still have to see her everyday.  Monday comes i ask her to go to lunch with me.  We do.  She starts crying saying her ex called her and gave her closure.  But she realized she was still in love with him. Then tells me the worst part is that if he had asked to come over she would of let him. Now let me give you a back story about me.  I was married once before I found out my wife cheated on me with my best friend brother and got pregnant. So back to my current story.  She then tells me it's not fair to be telling me she was just not going to say anything but felt bad. Then she turned around and told me she wanted to stay friends but wanted to make a promise to each other that we will not be with anyone else because she wanted to do things right with me while she got over him. Well needless to say due to my insecurity of my past I didn't handle this so well and went into creep mode. Before creep mode we had that talk and she stopped texting me while we were not at work. Only when we were at work would she text or talk to me. I ask her to hang out after work she says she's busy going to gym or something. Tells me maybe next week. I know I did all the wrong shit by going creeper mode and I know it's because of my insecurity with cheating. I can't stop thinking about her tho and then I have to see her at work and it makes it worse. The other day I talked to her and apologized for going all creeper and asked for a second chance. She then said I don't feel like I did last week and I dunno because I need to clear my head. I'll be ok after I clear my head. Of course I won't hear from her.

I was VERY close to my grandma I loved her so much and seeing this disgusting 🐷 say her prayer made me want to die. Also on the day of her funeral he molested me so yeah. 

🐷 has molested me 4 times on different occasions. Once every year since I was 9 as we meet him at least once a year but thankfully because of covid we didn't meet him this year. Now someone will say 'just stay away for him' I tried to but the thing is he doesn't molest me at day he does it at night when he thinks I'm 'sleeping' but obviously I wake up. Also it's like major harasment like taking my shirt off to touch my b**bs even touching my a** and you get it right. Once he even made me touch his d***. I always think of shouting but in that horrifying moment I just freeze and pretend it's a dream. Also in my country there's no trend of renting a hotel room or something when on a family wedding or something we all sleep in the house of the person who held the function. So he just comes in the room I'm sleeping and yeah. 

 Anyways earlier in may of this year I finally told my mum about what 🐷 does. Obviously she was angry. And supported me and stuff. She said she would try her best to protect me from him but we can't tell the whole family because she doesn't want to put 'dirt' on my image. I wanted her to be outraged which she was but I wanted her to call his wife and tell her everything and basically tell the whole family what a disgusting excuse of a human being he is. I don't blame my mum entirely because she  was raised actually most of my society was raised in this mentality. But thankfully because of the internet I know that this mentality is wrong. In her mind she just thinks she's doing the right thing. 

I want to confront 🐷 yell at him, hit him, even kill him not just throw looks at him. 


 Should I confront my mother about this? I really want to just forget about this whole thing but I can't. It bothers me even though I pretend it doesn't and is putting me in a dark place.

 Also cut my mum some slack she's very nice and loves me it's just that she was raised to think this way. This mentality goes way back in my society. 

Also I can't really take help from the police. I live in a country where things like this don't matter. The police will be of no help. They don't even care if someone has been r*ped. I'm not kidding a women in my country was raped at night in front of her kids as she was driving back from her friends house at like 8 pm and took the motorway where many people don't go to and the police head of that district said 'why did she take that road. Police isn't responsible for people's bad luck' 🤦🤦

743,"My Girlfriend is in the last year of her sixth form and has constantly been pressured to go to uni by teachers, her parents and friends. With the added stress of course work in 3 lessons and trying to find a job, she gave in and applied to 5 Universities to make it less stressful for the rest of the year, so she can get her head down and finish the next few months of sixth form. 

Uni has never been a direct goal for her, she’s thought about it, however, she’s been more focused on getting a full time job and moving in with me after Sixth form. I’ve been trying to keep her positive about the situation, but she has seemed to have gotten more stressed after applying, as she feels like if she turns down all the universities (which was her plan) she’d let down her family who were very happy that she applied. 
(Little side note: She wanted to apply for 2022, so she could think about it, but her teacher sent it out wrong and she’s applied for 2021, which has added to the stress) 

What I’m hoping to get help with is people who have gone to university, hopefully people who have studied Mental health nursing, could maybe give me the positives or even negatives of going to uni, how it effects you financially, and if helps you in the future, so we could make a plan.

He’s never told anyone else about his sexuality, i’m the only one that knows. But ever since he told his mom &amp; she wasn’t very accepting of who is he, he’s not changing up on me... I was into him not only bc he’s a freaking GORGEOUS looking man, if only I could post a picture of him... y’all would be in awh.

Point is, man is freaking drop dead gorgeous, flannel shirt, jeans, boots and cut of Patagonia vests. My heart every time I see his texts or calls would skip a beat every time I see his name pop up. I was glued to my phone all day bc we would talk all day for weeks, months even. 

But the day he tried to come out to his mom, she was beyond shocked... She was unaccepting and told him that was unacceptable and ever since that day earlier this week... He hasn’t been the same towards me, told me he needed space, told me I had to slow my roll with texting him because people are asking and wondering who’s he texting constantly, and he doesn’t want to throw and red flags bc they’re very christian.

759,"  

***Hello.***

Thank you for stopping by, it means a lot to me. Lately, I've been struggling to understand this one guy I've talked to in social media. Maybe he’s considered as my friend. I’ve been talking to him for a couple of weeks now (or a month, I guess). He is 1 of the 3 guys I talked to, it's a small steps for me to try to talk to guys as I struggle a lot with social anxiety when it comes to interacting with people, especially men. Btw you can call me Li, I'm 19 and I'm a girl (female? woman? Idk).

Well, I found out he does music. He seems happy when I said that I will check his music out later. Things going pretty good until I said this, ""once I found my courage maybe I'll try to check your music and even support you"" ""but for now, let's say I'm a little shy"". He seemed curious about it and asked me if I can explain why but I insisted badly and ended up annoyed him. He later on said ""whatever"" and we stop talking. I didn't explain it because I'm afraid he would be weird out by it. 

I messaged him back today, we haven’t been talking for a week now and I can’t wait any longer as this guilty feeling and thoughts of him not wanting to be my friends anymore haunting me. He left me on seen again today. I was so disappointed in myself so I cried.  

I honestly don't know what to do. He left me no choice other than to assume things (I know this is wrong but it's the only thing I can do). I don't understand the situation here. He didn't say anything. Did he lost interest in talking to me anymore? or is he just mad? Do I need to spam him with my explanation? or should I wait for him to say anything? Am I wrong in any way? How can I seek for his forgiveness? What should I do really? I overthink and I can't make the right call or decision. I seemed to be desperate now. I wish I can talk to someone about this but I'm afraid if I'm not supposed to do it. 

I’ve posted a detailed explanation about this in my other post. The first post is too long so I hope this one is more simple and easy for you to read.",12Dec2020,1
760,"When we were children me (14/F) and my cousin (15/M) used to play together all the time with the other kids. I was always what parents see as a ""good child"" so I used to hear stuff like ""you should date my son!"" ""you will marry my son when you get older!"" and ""I hope my sons dates a girl like you in the future!"" quite often, my grandma is one of them. She used to say all the time me and my cousin would get married when we were older, because her and my grandpa were cousins too.

At puberty he isolated himself and became quite the awful guy so I distanced myself. Now everytime I go to her house she keeps telling me to go down (to his house) to talk to him. She tells me that ""he misses his little friend"" and keep setting dates with me and him only instead of trying to make him go out and socialize with male friends. And I know she does it with other girls too, as there's never boys she calls to see my cousin but many other girls who are ""part of the family"". Curiously none of us are actually related to him; some are grandma's goddaughters and I'm her stepson's stepdaughter. 

It's very awkward to have to sit down in a dark room alone with a guy you never even talk to (who is also a perv so kinda scary) playing video games and try to make it not so awkward instead of being with the rest of the family. She knows I'm uncomfortable with it but she just don't stop trying. I don't even want to go there anymore so she won't bother me.

I was driving in CT, going down a hill with a slight turn. There was a rock in the middle of my lane that I didn't see till last second and slammed on the brakes but I hit it anyways. I stopped the car, removed the rock from underneath my car, it was about 30-50 pounds, and just tall enough to catch a cars under area. My car is now leaking oil. A lot of it. It's probably already gone. I quickly drove to a nearby O'Reillys and got some advice. 

Called my parents and triple A. Parents say I need to take a picture of the rock and file a police report do that I might get refunded by the department of transportation. I'm currently waiting for my car to be towed to a nearby place to be fixed. Towing will cost about $22. 

Car is Volkswagen rabbit 2008.

Heres where I need advice. Should I bother with a police report? Would the department of transportation even reimburse me? I have no proof that the rock was placed maliciously other than it being in a perfect spot to get hit by a car. I think maybe someone else also hit the car, further down after I drove away (about 15 seconds driving) (they were past a hill so I couldn't see them till I drove past), because they were stopped with their hazard lights on as well.

I threw the rock into the woods next to the road, so I could conceivably go back when my car is fixed and take a photo of it.

Thanks to the guy at O'Reilly I know it's an oil leak and a pretty big one. Also know fixing it myself is pretty much out of the question.

Apparently those were the terms before the lockdown which were lifted temporarily during the lockdown but have since been initiated again after the lockdown ended without any notifications. 

I joined last December and I had never opted for work from home, never enquiried about it so I didn't know the policies, and after the lockdown lifted I started going again because I missed working with my office friends and it had been quite a while since I had seen them, but during the lockdown, working from home made me realise how much comfortable and convenient it is for me . So in October, I opted for work from home, and my boss had no problem with it, he simply asked me to coordinate with my supervisor everyday. 

So I continued my work from home and it was all fine, I recieved my last month's paycheck and I spent it accordingly, (since I didn't know that I won't be getting one next month) and in my office we're paid on the day we joined the office, like I joined on 9th of December last year so I get my salary on 9th of every month, and so I was expecting a paycheck 3 days ago but then a day went by then 2 days and now finally 3 days, so I called our accountant and asked him what's up, and he just casually said that he accidentally sent me my full salary last month when it should've been half of what I get so I'm gonna have to adjust with what I have and consider that an advance.

Obviously I got mad since I didn't know all this and asked him if he was joking but he then told me all about the terms of work from home and what not, and he expected me to know about it since it was written in the orientation documents (who even reads those). Then I asked him about the fact that we were being paid full during the lockdown and we all were working from home to which he replied that ""it were unavoidable circumstances that we didn't have a say on, so technically no one opted for work from home, we were all forced upon it so we had to pay you all your full salary"". Now I'd argue to that guy more but he's a pretty rude guy and I'd rather not loose my temper on him and recieve a complaint. 

So as far as I know, he should have told me last month that he accidentally sent me my full salary and that I'll have to send back half of it. Honestly I wouldn't have been okay with that but since these are the rules to I'd have to agree upon them and maybe I would've started going in to work regularly after that.

I'm gonna talk to my boss about it but I don't know what should I say or how should I put it. I mean I don't even know if I am in the right or not. So please can anyone if you could help me with what I should do, do I go to my boss or drop this thing? Because I have no idea how these things are handled.",12Dec2020,1
779,"This happened a few days ago. It goes without saying that I know how stupid I was, so I won't linger on that too much. 

While incredibly drunk, I sent explicit images via a dating app (one of which contains my face, though not in the same frame as my body). The images were then screen-grabbed and sent back to me by the scam artist, along with a list of my Instagram followers. Of course, they demanded payment and threatened to release these images to my Instagram followers unless I obeyed. I had no intention of paying, and I didn't, but I nonetheless played along in conversation for a few minutes to bide myself some time and try to think. Eventually I decided to call the police. While on the phone to the police, the scammer tried to place a call to me via Snapchat, which was obviously immediately declined. They then sent me another screen recording, showing them deleting the images from their photos library, announcing that they would take it no further, and saying that I should ""be more careful what I share online"". Point taken.

I've since put all my social media handles on private and significantly reduced the amount of public information available on them.

My question is really just to provide peace of mind – what happens now? Is it safe to assume I've dodged a bullet in this instance? Certainly, I won't be doing anything as dumb as this ever again, but  I'm in a pretty bad place as a result of it. Am I likely to suffer any consequences from this going forward?",12Dec2020,1
781,"Ok so to sum it up, I do like my mom a lot. I've had my fair share of issues with her over the years and she was horrible at times, but she's not a terrible narc mother or anything.

When I was a kid, for years I suffered from severe anxiety and I would call her every. single. day. multiple times to know where she was. If she didn't pick up, I'd throw a fit and bawl my eyes out thinking she was dead and picturing different scenarios of everything bad that could've happened. I just outgrew that- she never took me to therapy for it unfortunately.

I also used to sleep in the same bed as her when I was 11 or so, holding hands. Im not sure if this is weird. I don't remember why. But I had no problem being an affectionate kid.

Right now though, the idea of saying ""I love you"" is weird, and anything affectionate grosses me out. I don't like discussing my personal life with her or being too close with her, having conversations, etc. I said I was gonna move out and live alone and she was like ""yeah so I'll stay with the cats cause I won't live alone"" and it grossed me out so much that I just said ""why do I have anything to do that?"". It was rude, but the idea of her being bothered by me moving out disgusts me? It bothers me deeply. to me its like ""why do you even care, just let me live my life without being upset about it because I need to get away and be my own person and I don't wanna be tied to you"".

I know this makes me sound like an absolutely horrible person, but I'm not sure if anyone experiences this? I'd appreciate any advice. I'm 18 btw.",12Dec2020,1

784,"Hi all
Apologies for any spelling/grammatical mistakes I'm dyslexic and really don't have the time to proofread (takes me about an hour to see mistakes)

Basically I'm in my last year of UK high school and will be sitting my gcses in May (some btec exams in January). There's 4 teachers that throughout 2020 have been there for me. They all were just an email away throughout lockdown, before lockdown they all had dealt with the emotional wreck I was and when we've come back have made it clear that if I email them or ask them in person to come up to the year 11 area at the next break they will come no questions asked or they'll email back saying a more suitable time for them. 

To put it bluntly these teachers are the reason I'm still alive and thriving. They understand me and supported me when I came out as trans nbi at the start of the year and have respected my name and pronouns (they/them). I don't think I show them how greatful I am for them and at times can be self centred (I am autistic). 

For Christmas/the holidays, I want to write them a personal cards thanking them for everything and wishing them all the best for the new year. My issue is because we recently had exams it could be seen as me trying to suck up to them even though its not my intention. They mark out exams and i don't want it to seem like I'm trying to get them to mark me nicer as all I want to come across is my genuine thankfulness for these people. 

So should I write those xmas cards even though they could be seen as bribes of sorts.",12Dec2020,1

Most of all, he is my best friend, we often spend 48+ hours together easily, even though we don't live together. He supports me and makes me feel safe.

My problem is that deep down I know we won't get married. I can't see myself spending the rest of my life with him. If he proposed (he wouldn't, because we are both young) I would say no.

Is it wrong to date someone, knowing that your relationship isn't really going anywhere? I don't want to break up because I'm happy, but I almost feel like I'm lying to both of us. I never worried about this with my high school relationship because we agreed early on that we would break up when we both went to college, and thats exactly what we did. But now that I'm older it feels different, the future is so open ended.

Am I being too dramatic? Is this a fear of commitment? Am I a horrible person for staying with him? Any thoughts would be great.",12Dec2020,1
789," 

Hi guys, this might be a long one.

So I'm a pretty young guy, only 22. I've had the same group of friends since Year 7, I'm from the UK, so to those in the States that's 6th grade (or aged 11/12 everywhere else), and I'm quite frankly done.

I know it's perfectly normal in a group of guys to make fun out of each other etc, however I feel we always go a tad too far, and it's affecting me. Badly. It's constant, and it's purely just to drag each other down. Nothing is good enough, everything needs mocking. The littlest mistakes are picked up on and amplified to make each other feel like absolute morons and pure shit. I've had enough. I feel like I would be better off without them.

I want to focus on myself. I won't be lonely as I have other friends who I'm not as close to, but can still talk to/meet up with etc if need be. I also have a girlfriend who I've been with for 2 years now, who isn't close with my friends (she doesn't seem to like them either, and I feel she has only been pretending to for my sake), and I'm pretty close with my family.

So you may be asking ""why don't you just cut ties and make no attempt to contact them?"". Valid question, however it's not that simple. I currently live with a member of said friend group, and I simply cannot afford to live alone at this point in time. And I'm currently in the middle of a contractual tenancy agreement with him on the lease of the house. I also won't be able to afford to live with my girlfriend, as she only works part time at the moment, and still lives with her parents, so I'd have to support us both.

I'm just sick of them all. I want to leave. I want to live alone. I'm sick of making myself feel like shit because of them. Any form of being mature and talking about this is met with more mocking, as to not show ""weakness"", probably so they can avoid being mocked themselves.

Thanks for any serious responses in advance.

TLDR - I hate my friends and want to leave.",12Dec2020,1

791,"okay so, I can't decide if I love, or even have feelings for my boyfriend. at the start of the relationship (we've known each other since we were four but only started being a couple when I'm 15) we would just have sex and joke and it was honestly really nice and I liked that, but then we started dating and things just seemed to change. 

so my boyf has a lot of girl friends, which never seemed to bother me, but now when he hangs out with them it annoys me, not because they're girls that he's hanging out with, but before we would all hang out (I have my own friends but I also used to hang out with these guys) and it was cool, but now it just feels like I'm hanging out with my boyfriend's friends and it's strange. 

also i just find that I need so much more space, like I just need to keep not hanging out with him. he's not clingy or toxic, he's actually pretty perfect, I just need so much more time away from him, because I feel like I'm just hanging out with my boyfriend rather than someone I really want to hang out with yk ? 

so that's the bad stuff, here's the good stuff.

he gives good sex, he's my first so I have nothing to compare it to, but I like it so I feel like that would count as good. 

he is suppper sweet, like he will literally do anything for me and I love it. (btw I care about him and would do anything for him to, but like he does it in such a sweet way) and he does things without me even asking, like the other day I was sleeping at his but I needed to leave and so he got all my stuff ready and then kissed me awake and told me that he would miss me on the ride home 🥺🥺. also, we have folders of photos of each other and the other day i noticed that he had the folder open and I asked why and he was like ""yeah I just like to look at it sometimes bc ur so adorable"". aaaaaaaaaaa hes so cutee. also, I really do care about him. he's been there through everything and we are a good couple and stuff, but I'm just not sure if I'm in LOVE, I've never really seen him as anything else besides a friend, and when he asked me out I just said yeah bc I didn't think anything would change with that, but it did. we've been dating for two months and that's how i feel.

I was sexually abused when I was a kid. I completely erased the events from my mind until they started to resurface a few years ago when an event triggered panic attacks and depression and I have been suffering from depression and anxiety ever since. 

Also, ever since this triggering event, my behavior towards life and relationships has drastically changed. I walked away from friends and started to self isolate, feeling lonely. 

This year I finally had the courage to tell my parents what happened to me when I was a little kid, it didn’t help much. If anything, this year has been the hardest for me, as these memories from my childhood are coming up more and more often. 

So I had spent some time thinking about letting my friends know what happened to me, as a way to explain my erratic behaviors through the years and was just wondering if it’s gonna be a good thing or not.

I know that gas contains a lot of strong and toxic fumes. I've been breathing them in over the last couple of days should I be really worried?

We still care for each other a lot, he’s learned a lot from his mistakes in our past relationship, and we have gotten to a great place of healthy mutual friendship and it’s really important to me considering I only have one other close friend that lives four hours away. 

My family is very judgemental and protective so they pretty much hate him. They hate that I’ve been so on and off with him and how he’s hurt me in the past.

He has some problems communicating but he has been trying to drive me out for like three monthS. He will act ok to my face and act fake if I try to talk to him sometimes but then do little stuff behind my back or if I confront him aggressively about a problem he just makes up stuff and throws it back at me and tries to upset me. 

I’d really love to punch him in the face. He’s basically caused me to lose a great place to live. We have two other roomates who are his friends and brothers. He know I’m moving out now and is still doing stuff to aggravate and upset me. 

There’s no point in saying anything because he just gonna fight with me and act completely  unreasonable as usual . He has no intentions on fixing anything. He feels he has to get me back and I’m just on his shit list.

808,"A few months ago my sister came home to my parents house crying. Apparently her husband had hit her. For some reason, everyone but I was passive. I was furious, but nobody wanted to do anything, and I wasn't going to cross boundaries. A week ago, she comes home crying, again, with her kid, my niece. It happened again. She files for divorce. She goes to her her things from the house that she paid for but is in his name. He gets angry, starts destroying the house, and he hits my sister AGAIN. They hide in the bathroom where they think they're safe, but he literally breaks down the door. There's no doubt he's scarred my niece, but he assaulted my sister for the third time, and caused lots of property damage.

I want my sister to be okay, obviously, and obviously I want her away from him, as does everyone. He's been going insane. When I learned about the last time he laid his hands on her I was furious. I sent him a text saying, ""If it happens again, I'll see you soon. I don't want to hear back."". Of course he responds exclusively to talk shit, for lack of better words. He starts talking crazy, so I say ""I'll be watching out for you"". With that, I meant ill literally be watching out, like for my own qnd my families safety. Not like I'll be out watching him or looking for him. Evidently, I didn't pick the best words, because, as I go check my blocked messages, he's sent a dozen or more saying that he's now looking for me. He asked if I was at work, which I wasn't. Later he texts me, ""Work was slow today huh? Taylor told you to stay home?"". My manager, who was working at the time, was Tyler. I thought he'd come in. Turns out he'd only called, but now my manager is on edge enough to be paranoid about a guy who came in and then just left. Tyler said, when he called that this guy told him, ""Hey is Corbin working? He makes this mochacino drink I like.""

He's still blocked and I don't plan on unblocking him, or even confronting him. I know that was a bad decision to text him qnd tell him I'dwant to confront him, but I was furious. He'd hurt my family, badly, and I was angry. So I acknowledge that, and will not contact the guy again. But I am wondering about any possible solutions for my sister to not only just get out of the relationship, but also if she could get out better off. She's a single mother now. I'm also wondering about justice. With me feeling hurt, the support my sister is getting and this man's justice are all I'm looking to. How can this man face the true consequences of his actions? He's out of hand qnd has no visible intention of getting any help.

I (23 F) joined a very popular charter school in my area as a teacher. These charter schools are known to hire experienced straight out of college students. I previously worked at an afterschool program and recently graduated from college (2019) with a bachelor of science in biochem. I applied to be a ""co-teacher"" since I don't have a teaching certification. I was offered a position in which I ""facilitate"" an individualized learning class. I teach back to back from 8:00 am to 3:15. I have a 30-minute lunch break and after school, I have to attend mandatory meetings on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays that last an hour. I am the only teacher with 200 students and I am expected to call parents of failing students after class to fill them in on the situation. I have so much work that I end every day at 8:00. I am not salaried and I get paid hourly but can only put in 8 hours daily. I get paid 18.46 an hour but they remove 20 hours from my salary in order to be able to pay me during holidays although when I applied it said paid holidays. I am exhausted every day and this is taking a toll on my mental health. When I joined 100 of my students were failing and I have to deal with the pressure of parents and other teachers. After-tax deductions and everything else I earn 950 dollars every 2 weeks which makes it impossible for me to move out. Today  (Saturday) I HAD to participate in a recruitment event in which I had to pass out flyers in neighborhoods. I receive no help from any other teacher even though everyone else has 50 students and the expectations they have from me are extremely high. Is this normal?

820,"Hi there,
I’m currently a college student in the middle of online finals and I typically work a part time job during breaks because I’m usually away at campus. Due to Covid restrictions this year my school has been online and so I was working before midterms and finals hit. I decided to take a break from it for two reasons. One due to my shifts typically starting at 4 at I found this to be way to exhausting, so in order to catch up with all of my work and be ready for finals I knew I had to take time off. Second I have a very poor immune system and my mom is immunocompromised due to a chronic illness and I knew my boss and coworkers had been less than cooperative while following covid guidelines, for example I know for a fact that my boss does not wash his hands ever (even after using the bathroom) and  always wears his mask under his nose. Recently one of my coworkers has gotten covid and despite the fact that he had been working up to the day he got the test, the store never even closed for cleaning and none of my coworkers were required to get tests. I’m not sure which one of my coworkers it is exactly but I am pretty much the only part time worker at the store and I’ve seen the schedules so I know all of my coworkers have been working full time this whole time. Anyways despite me telling my boss that I would not be able to work until Christmas he has been constantly texting me asking when I will be coming back, and I always say the same date. After I found out about the covid case I texted my boss and said I would still work on Christmas so that way my coworker could have Christmas off, but I wanted to keep my shifts short and only if they really need me due to my covid concerns. He responds back walking me if I could work five mornings in a row... during my finals week still before the date I told him I could return. At this point I say absolutely not because I had told him multiple times about my availability, and he got very upset with me, and texts me having a little fit. I have a feeling I should just quit, but I like my coworkers, and my job pays a decent enough amount, the only issue right now is how my manager and his higher ups have handled everything. Am I in the wrong here? I have replied politely each time until I felt I had to put my foot down and say that I absolutely couldn’t work during finals, but what should I/ can I do in this situation?",12Dec2020,1

822,"I’m looking for help to gear my future in regards to what path I should take my career in. 
I will appreciate any advice about where to go next including advancing my education, specific companies within my descriptions, other groups to post this on, and any other advice related to my qualifications. 

My background:
-I have a general associates degree. Additionally I’ll graduate in June with a degree in Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ultrasound). 
-My educational background is strong in biological sciences, however, I also spent time within the communications department.
-I was the recipient of a full ride acting scholarship, 2 years in a row. 
-I love public speaking, organization, and working with people. I’ve also always enjoyed teaching.
-I have an extremely strong work ethic. I hate the way that sounds, I am just very committed to self progress. While in my first two years of full time college I maintained a 4.0 GPA while also working multiple jobs totaling 70+ hours/week. 
-For 5 years I ran my own in home pet care business. We were the largest licensed in home providers in my community. I sold my business when I moved to pursue my degree in ultrasound. 
-I have a variety of professional backgrounds, many in leadership positions. Some of the positions I’ve held include; business owner, recreational leader (city position), investigative aide (federal government), server, customer service representative, sonographer, and more. 

What I’m looking for in my employment/ furthering education:
-I am willing to relocate anywhere in the US.
-Opportunity to grow and advance within my career, even if that means starting at the bottom and working up.
-I have progressive values, while I’m able to  separate that from my work I’d find it extremely rewarding if it could play a part in my career. 
-I would love to work with people, any opportunity to present or speak publicly would benefit my skill set. 
-I imagine I’ll likely have to return to school, and since I am completely financially independent I’d like the opportunity to pursue something within the limit of a bachelors degree for the time being. If I work for a company that gives rewards for advancing my education, I will reconsider at that time. 
-I am NOT interested in even considering the military.
-This is the biggest and hardest ask which makes me the most puzzled to find something that will suit me. I would like to make a minimum of $60,000/year. This is $15,000 LESS than the National average, but the minimum I’d  feel comfortable living off of. 

I would like to request that people recruiting for companies (MLM, military, etc) do not contact me.",12Dec2020,1

824,"To kinda summarize the story, I went to a Target optical a few months ago to get my contact prescription renewed and get some more lenses. Since I had a few more months left from my last order I wasn’t too desperate for them, but anyway long story short they tried charging me these ridiculous fees for a simple eye exam. The employee who was working with me was a POS, and kept trying to get me to pay and giving me sketchy answers as to why I was paying all these extra charges that I had never paid before; “Well maybe your insurance changed?” No, it clearly hasn’t. “I can’t print out or show you a breakdown of what you are paying for until you actually pay it.” What...? So yeah, shitty experience, would not advise going to Target for this stuff. So after some arguing I just told them to cancel the order, which they said they did, and didn’t take the prescription. The odd thing was that she ordered the contacts for me before I even got to pay or see a summary of the contact prescription... which I thought was sketchy. Fast forward about a week and I get a box of contacts in the mail. I haven’t opened it all this time, thinking they may ask about it but I haven’t heard anything yet. I’m kinda thinking this is their mistake and find it odd they haven’t asked about it ever since. But yeah... is it bad that I want to keep them?

825,I’m not a stranger to self-induced isolation—I’ve been like this for virtually my entire life. It gets lonely. For the past few years I had roommates and that probably helped? I’ve wanted to live by myself for a while. Should I expect to feel worse?,12Dec2020,1
826,"So, for context I’m 19 now and I live at home with my mom (55), my dad (65), and my sister (6.5). Most of my adolescent life has been normal except for the fact that I think I live in a toxic household, but I’m not entirely sure. My girlfriend says that I need to leave because my mom is “borderline abusive”, but I think she just struggles with a lot of mental illness since my older sister died five years ago. But, the more I think about it the more I realize how messed up some of this stuff is. I can remember distinct instances where my mom punched me (once when I was 13, another when I was 15), where she made my little sister eat her own vomit (she wanted food and then refused to eat when she was younger, she got sick and my mom made her eat the vomit), and a few moments where she threatened to backhand my sister. More stuff has happened, of course, but it all boils down to my mom’s dramatic mood swings. The earliest time I can remember my mom “going on vacation” as my dad calls it is when I was about 11. I didn’t want to walk the dog and she got very upset, yelling about how I never helped and how she always did everything for our family. She then went into my parent’s shared bedroom and stayed there for three days. I remember being so heartbroken I even left her a note expressing my love for her, she never looked at it and left it under the door where I slipped it in. Things progressed dramatically when my older sister passed, my mom got significantly worse. Every month she’d go into these angry, volatile states characterized by a hair trigger and a lack of hygiene. These would last anywhere from a few days to three weeks, and seemed to come at go at random. During these states, she’d stomp out of her room only to get food or smoke a cigarette. She hardly interacted with me or my little sister, and when she did interact it was out of annoyance or just to yell at us for something. She would do everything from threaten divorce on my dad or threaten to send me to a hospital. As this progressed, I found myself unable to much of anything besides watch my sister while my dad went off to work. I became a sistermom when my mom didn’t feel like being a mother, and I remember two entire summers spent caring for my sister. It was mostly to keep her out of my mom’s way, because my mom always expressed a disdain for my little sister, going so far as to say she didn’t love her on one occasion. My mom also has a habit of threatening suicide when she gets low, she’s done this four times. Each time I’ve wanted to call the police, but my dad never lets me because he doesn’t want the cops to “red flag” our house and have our guns taken (he’s a gun nut). At this point, she’s on a steady dose of menopausal relief meds, anxiety meds, antipsychotics, and antidepressants so her moods have become better managed. However, she still acts snippy and rude, and I don’t like her personality most days. She constantly brings me down and she never asks me how I’m doing. She’s never expressed much interest in my life besides the negative parts. She doesn’t even know I’m dating my girlfriend! I am afraid to tell her because the last time I dated a girl, she freaked out and refused to let me see her. She threatened to call her mom and break us up, she also called me an abomination and unnatural (I’m a lesbian). I feel incredibly guilty for hiding my relationship from her but lying has kept me safe. It bothers me every night knowing that I’ll break my mom’s trust when she finds out. My girlfriend is also upset that my mom doesn’t know, as we’ve been together for about a year and I still haven’t found a way to tell her. I’m so scared to truly be myself. She always finds a way to berate me, and she never really seems supportive. She scoffs at me when I tell her I want to live on my own or move, saying I’m as much as an adult as my sister is. What should I do? Am I just immature? Should I just suck it up? I don’t know if I’m in the wrong or what. I need advice or just simply an outside perspective. I’m open to criticism if there’s anything I could do better on. If you’ve read this far, thank you.",12Dec2020,1

He told me one thing months ago which still bothers me and hurts a lot. 

He was talking about his best friend’s wife, that he is not jealous of him, because everyone hits on his wife and the husband has to fight them.

Now, I care very much about my looks and they are really important to me. I love to get all pretty and dressed up, and he always saw me with my hair and makeup done, dresses etc. I did lose quite some pounds because I was sick, that was the only thing that wasnt right.

I talked to him about it and he got mad and told me-Oh, I meant it in a way that she dresses like a slut, not that she is prettier than you. But it sounded unconvincing and it still meant that men would be more attracted to her. He also told me Im sick because I think he was turned on by her (I never even mentioned that, just that it was disrespectful).

It made me feel like he doesnt appreciate me and my looks (because I get hit on a lot of men, and his friends tell him Im very good looking).

How should I take this as? Talking to him about it is very difficult because he just gets offended. What do I do?

I worked tech support for a few years, and now I’m more socially and creatively involved in my company after moving to a new department. I thought the change would help, but several months in, it hasn’t. If anything, I feel more dread because of my closer interaction with people. 

In certain moments, I enjoy what I do, but for the most part and outside of work, I feel this constant dread of the idea of work, including those that I’m passionate about. I wanted to go back to school to continue my CS degree, but now the thought depresses me. I wanted to resume my data science certifications, but the thought stresses me. I wanted to pursue entrepreneurship in creative work with technical aspects, but after working this new position that is quite similar to that goal, entrepreneurship frustrates me.

At this point, I feel like I don’t want to do anything at all, because interaction drains me and working for money further depresses me. I still keep going, and my performance doesn’t lack, but this void persists stronger than I’ve ever felt in my worst days, as if I’m on autopilot.

I really hate this feeling, especially because it prevents me from applying myself stronger and branching out, but i cannot shake it off. 

I can’t afford the few therapy services available in this “small” town (and I make just enough to where I’m ineligible for financial assistance anyway) even though I’m sure it would help, but I can never get to that if I struggle to seek better opportunities.

833,"The title says it all I think. We all joke when we see something horrible or stupid and say it killed our faith in humanity but honestly the responses I have seen have really shaken my view of the world. For most of my life I believed that unless the person was significantly mentally disabled that most people could make mostly rational decisions for their own life. Maybe not always optional ones but at least not pointlessly self destructive at least after their early 20s. That assumption underpinned my approach to politics, personal relationships, ethics, etc. 

Once the pandemic began and people began getting tired of quarantine I saw a huge change. People began ignoring social distancing and safety even if they acknowledged that it was scientifically backed and the number of people I saw fall into conspiracy theories is staggering. QAnon became massive in my hometown and people I grew up with and respected suddenly believed in some of the most outlandish things I’ve ever heard of which were but not limited to that the world is controlled by satanists who may or may not be reptilians depending on the person and Trump was here to stop them. These same people also made a point to not only ignore pandemic guidelines but to outright break them on principle. Even now in the town I live in a lot of people have gotten covid and refused to get tested because they thought they’d get a microchip implanted in them and some never stopped going out even when sick, only stopping when they were hospitalized, and maintaining afterwards it is no big deal. Even with casualties mounting most people I know are still in denial. 

In addition to people I know I work in a hotel as the front desk person and I can’t help but judge everyone who comes in who isn’t there for work or another non essential trip. Even now, I just checked in an older woman who is going to visit her grandkids all over the state and is calling herself “covid Santa “ and I am amazed that people still don’t take this seriously and it’s not just the guests. I’m one of three people here who actually wears the mask over the nose and one manager never wears hers at all and we don’t have all the protections we are supposed to have. We don’t have the plexiglass shield we are supposed to have by corporate policy and when I got covid I’m pretty sure, and my doctors agree, that the biggest reason why no one else in the hotel got it when I was still asymptotic was because I wear my mask properly and regularly sanitize my hands. I outright told my managers this and it went right over their heads, they just didn’t get it. The problem guests have gotten worse too, I have been yelled at multiple times because of changes due to covid that are beyond my control and the entitlement has only gotten worse since the pandemic started. And our business model enables it. My manager outright said i wasn’t allowed to enforce the mask rule because she didn’t want someone to throw a tantrum and only recently changed her mind when police started taking the mask mandate more seriously and she could get fined if she didn’t.

I know that some people were going to react poorly to this. It’s stressful to everyone and unless you lived through the Spanish flu you’ve never experienced anything like this and have no idea how to react. But to see so many people, including many that I respect and care about, put their and everyone else’s life in danger to avoid the mild inconvenience of wearing a face mask is disheartening to say the very least. With death tolls rising daily to  such high levels the level of callous I am seeing all around me is beginning to get to me. When I was a kid and 9/11 and the Iraq war happened, people rightfully behaved like it was a tragedy and even though not everything that was done turned out to be a good thing there was at least the sense that we should prevent something like this from happening again. Now we have passed those numbers by a lot and a lot of people I know still want to ignore it. I have been trying to ignore it the best I can with escapism through video games, particularly RPGs so I can get the illusion of agency over my life again. This is mostly just a rant that has been building for a while but is there anything I can do to stop turning into such a misanthrope? I really don’t like to think like that but it seems like every day someone I know or otherwise interact with finds a new way to be horrible.",12Dec2020,1

I’m not saying it is one, it’s a pretty big organization with many contributors and a sensible business model, but I’m still skeptical.

So I checked the platform we talked on (that I don’t use much) and saw that she messaged me on the day of the meeting. My question is, how should I respond to this? I don’t plan on going through with it but I don’t want to come off as rude, considering I ghosted her for several days.",12Dec2020,1
835,"Putting this on a throwaway since I don’t want people tracing this back to me. This is crossposted from r/flying so there is a bit of aviation jargon, I’ll try and define it as best as I can. So I got hired as a CFI(certified flight instructor) recently for a slightly rural flight school. It’s a bit of a trip, but the pay is pretty good, and honestly as someone who passed their checkride(in other words I just recently got certified), I just feel lucky to have gotten it. The biggest issue I have though aside from the drive is that my boss, who is actually a friend of mine and got me the job, is an anti-masker. He shows it on Facebook all the time, and told me specifically he does not want me wearing a mask around the flight school or in the airplane. Now I am 21, and aside from a pneumothorax(which put me on special issuance for 3 months) I am personally not really at that much risk of getting more than flu like symptoms looking at the numbers. I am more worried for my potential students, since it’s a rural flight school(which tends to bring in 40-80 yos with expendable cash more than less rural flight schools), many of them would be way more at risk than I would be. 

My plan is to ask my students whether or not they want to mask, and say I do not mind their decision, but I would recommend it for their safety. If he has a problem with me doing that then I can be confrontational about it because if the student is ok with it and I am ok with it, he’s threatening the safety of my student against his will.

Then the neighbor filed a complaint to the management office stating that we make loud noise all over the night, which is not true. After I explained to the leasing office what happened, the neighbor took the action further by putting a note on our door and shouting at us when we leave the building for another two week. Now he threats to harm our safety and damage our property. What can we do to stop him from behaving like this? His threat is really frightening and we would like to report it to the police but we are afraid that he will escalate his actions after that.

838,"I’m 14f and about 5 years ago i got diagnosed with bad anxiety, I was pretty much worrying about every little thing but i kinda didn’t really do much about it. About 2 years ago I noticed that my mind was trying to find things to worry about, I guess it was kinda a habit that I couldn’t escape and it still happens now. It takes over my life and about 6 months ago I started feeling depressed. It’s hard to deal with now because I just want to feel okay again but I don’t feel comfortable in my mind where I feel trapped and can’t stop myself from thinking too much. Any advice on how to deal with this and move on?",12Dec2020,1
840,"First off, I want to say that I (19F) am dating someone who is in fact a guy (19M)and I love him (we’ve dated for almost two years).. which makes me sound absolutely stupid given what I am about to say. I don’t really like most people given that I’m introverted; however, I am really starting to dislike men in particular.. a lot. I keep seeing so many misogynistic posts and comments online towards women to a point that it’s beginning to get to me. I’m also seeing a lot of just.. frankly disgusting guys messaging women as if they are sexual objects, not even human. So many women I know have been raped or assaulted meanwhile all of the guys I know, although I feel are the “better ones”, can be hateful when speaking of other girls (for example using terms slut, whore, hoe even when they don’t deserve the title). I just see so much hypocrisy and I feel like guys have such conflicting and high expectations especially when it comes to my gender’s sexuality. (Also on a slightly related note I want to just add that women have had to take extra measures to make sure that we don’t get assaulted while out at night or by ourselves, which I feel guys write off on a constant basis, but many don’t know how it feels because they have never been in a girl’s shoes. I’ve seen many guys claim they’re victims just as often of sexual assault as well when the statistics show that a whopping 90% of females account for all rape victims and 1 out of 6 women in the US have been victims of completed or attempted rape. NOTE: I am not saying this doesn’t happen to men too.)

Another thing: I feel like guys can sleep with as many girls they want, and be a hero, but if a girl has a high body count then they lose their worth and are looked down on. Him and I hung out with one of his buddies two nights ago who just got laid for the first time by a coworker/friend, who really just wanted let him have a good first experience. Although they slept together and he was nice to her and said he had a great time, he casually told us about it later and called her a “kind of a whore” because she had slept with 8 other guys before him. Whole thing just seems twisted to me. And the crazy thing is that I never would have imagined he’d say something of the sort. I’ve only been with my current boyfriend, but the thought of somebody calling me that because of my sexual history, regardless of my behavior in short disturbs me..

Back to the boyfriend thing.. we get along very well and he’s incredibly respectful to me and kind, but when it comes to other girls he has no problem calling them whores or sluts although I told him that I don’t like it and he tried to avoid it. I have told him how I feel recently about men in general and he doesn’t know what to say to me, at first he laughed but when I told him I was serious he said he could understand where I was coming from. He wasn’t mad and hasn’t had much else to say about it strangely.

Anyways, I guess this is just a short, and incredibly messy rant. I think it’s funny that I’m here hating on half of the population for being male when I used to make fun of the people who felt the same way I do now (especially when the guys I know have been nothing but kind to me as an individual). I guess I’m just offended for others that get treated wrongly and I’m just hoping somebody could make me feel better about men in general. I don’t want to be angry because clearly not every guy is bad and deserves that hatred, I just struggle to see the other side of things I guess. I want to be better.

Guys, please feel free to respond as well because I’d honestly like to hear what your thoughts are. I know that not all of you guys are bad but right now it’s tough. I don’t wish to be like this. Lol.",12Dec2020,1

842," 

Background: My family has been friends with the family of this individual (now 20F), who I will call Brittany, since I was very young. Our families have frequently had holidays and other events together, all of which went great up until a couple of years ago.

Now, I know this is going to sound a bit bad starting out, but PLEASE read until the end (I do not at ALL condone victim blaming, and am all for most parts of the MeToo movement).

Brittany has always been VERY into boys from as long as I can remember; she always had a boyfriend around, and would not stay with one guy for more than a couple of months. Now, that's all fine and good, the problem arises in the fact that she claims that all of them, and yes, I mean ALL of them, were ab\*sive towards her, hit her, a\*\*aulted her, etc. I know about 6 individuals personally who she has accused of being ab\*sive or something of the sort, and she has talked about others. Now, she does have some mental issues, and is in therapy and getting help for them, and I am aware that those issues are one of the reasons she tends to seek attention as much as she does (such has been confirmed by her family).

The problem here arises about 2 years ago; my best friend of 5 years, as well as one of her good friends, come to me privately to tell me that Brittany, who has since graduated and I have not seen in around 2 years, was going around telling people I knew that my older Brother (25M), had texted her s\*\*ually explicit messages, and tried to coerce her into doing s\*\*ual things with him. Now, at the time period she alleges this occurred, my brother was very far away and unable to have a phone (you can probably guess why). I confronted her about this the very same day, and she basically came clean and told me that none of it really happened that way, and she had never really spoken to my brother. Now, I was angry; I went and I told my parents as well as my brother, who were understandably angry, but nothing ever came of it. Now, as our families are good friends, we will often see them around. My mother gets upset with me as I refuse to speak to Brittany or show her any ounce of sympathy of kindness, and she claims that it is making the whole situation ""awkward"".

In my opinion, she is not a good person and since she has not given my family, my brother, or myself an apology, I have no reason to show her any kindness. If I believed that there was any truth to her story then it would be more difficult for me, but she has a history of these sort of false claims and has admitted that it is untrue.

Should I forgive her and get over it? Since the rest of my family has gotten over it and forgiven her, should I just move on? I think false claims of that nature are unforgivable, but it seems it is upsetting everyone in my family how I am acting towards her.",12Dec2020,1
843,"
This week I’ve managed to resist multiple very strong urges to watch porn, even when I had the perfect opportunity to. Now I actually feel like I have control over myself and I have way more hope than I ever have. I know one week isn’t long but It’s enough for me to know I can actually get better 

Today I tried masturbating  but realized that I was thinking about porn, so I stopped. I can’t really think of real people when I’m masturbating and haven’t felt horny in the longest time. I think it’s been months and months since I actually felt horny (naturally). 

Also, as a result of me being extremely self conscious  about my addiction, I compulsively fantasize about porn stars being attracted to me. I think it’s a desperate attempt for my brain to feel control. But I have a huge habit now for escaping reality. 

I wish I could just live full time in reality, and see the brighter sides of it. I have a great chance at life. I’m 17 and its just about to start really, but I think it’s just an old habit that even though I want to get over, I just can’t. With or without porn.",12Dec2020,1

854,"So this story is a bit of a mess, so forgive me if this isn't really laid out properly.

So to start, I live within Ontario, Canada with my family  I am 19 years old, and work as an apprentice (meaning I work 10 months out of the year and for 2 months go to school).  A couple of days ago we(my family and I) got a call from our landlord saying that he is looking to sell the property we live in since he is getting old and wants to sell off some of his properties. He offered to sell it to us, and told us he would give more information later.  When my mom and dad first hear this they wanted to buy the property, but couldn't due to financial reasons, and told me(19M) that I should do it instead. Now, I didn't at the time, and still don't, want to take the responsibility of owning something so large at my age and told them I wasn't interested. They kept pushing and pushing, and my extended family members started telling me I should do it. I was slowly considering it, that is-until we got another call from our landlord.

Our landlord called us again and gave us some more information. He said that we don't have to go to the bank and that he will be the one providing the mortgage. As in, we give him the down payment and the monthly payments instead of to a bank. He will make the property in our name, and it will be just like any other mortgage except he is handling it. I didn't know this was a thing but okay. Alternatively, if we didn't want to buy the property, he said that he will sell it to someone else in around January, and we would have to move out. But can he even do that?

So to kind of sum this up and give some final questions I want to be answered. My parents wanted me, a 19-year-old, to buy the property from the landlord. The landlord said he will be taking care of the mortgage, and that I will just pay everything to him. Here are my main questions: 

 Is this normal? Can a single person just offer a mortgage like that? 

If they can, then would it be wise of me to just buy the property or not? Should we just move and find somewhere else to live? - Doing some math I personally couldn't afford the down payment on it so I would have to borrow money from relatives. 

If he does offer the mortgage, do all the same mortgage rules apply ( like having a minimum downpayment of 5%)?

We do have a family friend who is a real estate agent, should we talk to him about this and see what he says?

And finally, if we choose not to buy this, can he just kick us out like that and sell it to someone else? doesn't there have to be like a notice or something letting us know we have to move out?

855,"I am an (F16) high school student and over the past couple of years, I've had a pretty intense fear of being unintelligent or messing up my cognitive skills.

856,"I recently got my own flat after a very long time of searching - let me stress this is not a financial issue. I had an anxiety attack when being alone there and now I sleep on their couch. (I have a previous history with anxiety but I have not had any major problems with it or even attacks for about 3 years) I have no wish of returning to that flat. Even being there for small amounts of time makes me feel like shit for the rest of the day. 

My brothers are not understanding in the least, both of them are a decade older than me and are convinced it is secretly the finances that are the problem - it's not. My oldest brother freaked out because of Covid because my dad is in the at-risk group. He has wanted me out of my parents' house for a while as he sees me as a failure and in the way. If my mom wasn't alive I'm not convinced I would ever see my nephew and niece again. When my mom told my brother I was at their house he screamed at her through the phone so loud I could hear it across the room.  

I originally moved back to my parents' house some time ago after my roommate at the time decided to live with his girlfriend and I couldn't stay there as his mother owned that flat. After moving back with my parents, our relationship was more codependent both socially and financially - I was not a child living at home so much as I simply lived with them.  

I realize that in western cultures like mine, Denmark, a child is supposed to leave the parents' house at a certain age. It's what the culture is like, but I was not and am not dependent on them in the same way a child would be. I have just come to realize that I am a lot healthier when I live with someone else than when I live alone - despite pets. I have always kept cats, but they do not replace human interaction. 

I thought I wanted my own place, but as it got more ""real"" a feeling of dread started creeping over me. My eldest brother, under the false pretense of saving me money for the movers, even drove all my stuff to the new flat. He bumped the date closer and closer - probably so he could get me out of the house as quickly as possible. For years he has hounded me about moving out and my parents about moving to a smaller two bedroom flat - always being focused on finances above anything else. Every issue brought to him gets twisted into finances and economy and at every social gathering he talks about who got what, how much did it cost, how much is someone worth. 

Where do I even start? This apartment is new, I have only moved there on the 15th of November, I don't think anyone really understands and the flat is kinda hanging over my head during every conversation. Even talking about going back there to live permanently kinda makes me whince.

864,"Okay, so this one needs a bit of context. Both my parents were born and raised in 1960’s Zimbabwe, where, unfortunately, a lot of segregation between the black people and white people took place. There was also a civil war between both races too. My parents, both white, were raised to believe that they were superior to black people. My parents were never violent , but they grew up using derogatory language against black people, and adopted a racist mindset. It wasn’t until their teens when the country started to get black and white children to go to schools together. 

Many years later, my parents have lived in 3 different countries and they are now in the UK today. I’ve known this guy, who is black, for a few months now and we are now in a relationship. A few months ago, when our interest in each-other was starting, I told my mum about him; and how I was nervous for her reaction. She told me that she’s ultimately changed for the better and whilst it’s still hard for at times she would love any biracial baby I could have regardless, and love it as her grandchild. But she warned me my dad may be someone who’s harder to talk too. 

So I told my dad ... and it was awkward. He was upset. Not with me, with himself. He’s a man of God, so he believes heavily in non judgement and equality and love and peace and told me how terrible it was that this stigma was drilled inside of him. He said he was ashamed he felt this way, but he just struggles to be completely comfortable with interracial relationship and that he doesn’t know why; and that he has tried to not feel that way but he can’t stop. I felt really bad for him. My dad would never say anything to me or my boyfriend, however , it bothers me he feels this way.

My spouse wasn't wearing their mask anymore. Fm#2 wasn't wearing a mask. Fm#2 said they tested negative, but who knows when, plus they have surely been home (and thus could have been exposed since testing negative) &amp; I believe they were supposed to be quarantining regardless. 

I am upset about all of this. I am worried fm#2 may have just exposed us all to the virus. I'm worried that the right thing to do is assume that they did.

Spouse is misdirecting anger at me I suppose. We aren't talking because every attempt has ended badly, and I definitely don't want to be fighting and arguing around our children. Our household is very uncomfortable at the moment, and our big celebratory day is pretty well ruined.

It probably wouldn't do anything to really solve anything, but pretty sure spouse hasn't and won't talk to fm#2 about this because fm#2 has been ""going through a lot"" recently &amp; spouse doesn't want to upset them further.

As stated before, we have children. Spouse is their step-parent. Their other biological parent only gets to see them about 3 times a year because they live several hundred miles away. Children's other biological parent &amp; their spouse is supposed to be here to visit this weekend for Christmas and one of our children's birthdays. The other biological parents spouse may be high-risk, but I'm not 100% sure.

I also have two close family members who are high-risk, one that I see semi-regularly. The other is so scared of the virus that they don't leave their house or have visitors.

I don't know if we should assume that we may have been exposed. I don't know if I need to call the other biological parent and call off them coming to visit. 

I feel like this whole thing may have just ruined our anniversary, our Christmas, our child's birthday, our spirits, so much.

I don't know what to do. I am so upset / angry / worried / sad. 

I want to do what's right. I'd rather be safe than sorry. I don't want everything ruined, and I feel sick about it being projected that I am the bad guy for attempting to confront the problem. I don't want to be blamed for ruining anything for anyone, I haven't done anything wrong, and I would love for everything to be fine &amp; good like it was a few hours ago. 

My spouse is acting absolutely horrible about all this towards me. I mentioned speaking to my parent about it for advice, and was told that I would then be ""really spreading permanent damage."" When my spouse saw me beginning to post this, spouse made a quip about me ""saying lies"". I told spouse that I need advice and need someone to talk to, and I don't feel like I can talk to spouse at all right now. I feel like my spouse is angry at their parent and taking it out on me, which I know is totally wrong / inappropriate / abusive, but I don't know how to get spouse to correct it.

This all really sucks.

I need someone to talk to about all of this. I need advice, please &amp; thank you.",12Dec2020,1
868,"So, my birth certificate looks really odd....

My name on it is

LAST NAME, FIRST NAME - MIDDLE NAME -LAST NAME.

I'm in Ontario, Canada 

So it be JOHNS, JACOBS STEVE JOHNS (not my real name lol)

 and it makes it look my last name is in my middle name. I applied for my a replacement certificate in 2007 and I applied for one this month after I found it odd and thought maybe in 2007 I had put my middle name in the wrong part. I did my form this year and I made 100% to not put it in the format that reads above.

Is this common? Why on earth would my parents put my last name within my middle name? I mean it has to be right as it's from the registar office. I just in my entire life have never seen my name this way...my parents (deceased) never mentioned this and on all my other forms, this doesn't show up...I'm so confused and feel like the only one",12Dec2020,1

871,"Okay guys this post was going to be way different as I literally was extremely drunk yesterday. 
So this particular apparently isn’t laced ? 
My boyfriend isn’t really a smoker but the first time we had this weed I was panicking so bad just after two puffs. Him on the other hand was very calm but felt sick after and turned very cold  towards me and couldn’t move. Usually when’s he’s tired my boyfriend doesn’t realise  ALLOT! That’s when he’s like only focused on sleep, however the weed made it worse as when I was puking and asked for help he didn’t move and got upset.

So yesterday Again there was a party and everyone thought maybe we were not in the right mood when we took it. But I didn’t touch that weed yesterday due to that green out so I just drank which wasn’t the best idea as I had anxiety meds before. So this is what I remember it was 1 am I wasn’t feeling right to the point I felt like I was hallucinating and thought everyone got arrested lol and my boyfriend seemed happy but then was at his tired phase again. This is when he was angry again, I kept trying to wake him up and all I remember was getting a little push like a nudge but when I was drunk I literally thought he pushed me badly. There was also a point where he closed the door on me outside and locked it. So at first I thought wtf this is out of line cause why would u lock the door on your partner. Anyways turns out I was following him everywhere when he was trying to clean the Airbnb and put things in his car that he locked it for a minute and then opened so I don’t mess things up. We both are confused though cause I’ve never reacted like that on alcohol even with anxiety meds ? And he never is the type to not care on weed or even in general. 
I feel so bad cause u ended up dumping him and him not reacting until getting my memory back where he helped me almost the whole night puking and peeing that he got tired. The only thing I was confused about was the door lock. The push was also like a small nudge when annoyed when he was asleep but when I was drunk felt hard. I also thought people were getting arrested lol and kept hearing sirens",12Dec2020,1
872,"So I just recovered from a rather severe bladder infection. I thought it was just flu or something and took me a week before deciding to see a doctor (a very bad idea to delay my appointment). Anyway, I live in S.E Asia where it is very common to blame any illness on supernatural/mystic stuff and the person who got sick as if it's punishment for them (yeah victim-blaming, I know).

&amp;#x200B;

My father's second family is like that and they want to talk to me by next week about it. Having experienced it before several times, I have a pretty good feeling that it will be all about my supposed guardian spirits punishing me because I didn't do stuff and the reason why they didn't even bother to check on me (they never even send a social message asking how I'm doing even if they know I am burning in fever day in and day out) is because it's the test of the spirits or will or some weird stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it will be all my fault and honestly, I just reached thirty last November and I don't want to put in the effort to even process or accept what they are saying but I have to go and meet them or it will be a whole lot of drama if I don't. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can I pretend to listen, care, and agree without letting it through my head or heart? As is, I am still recovering physically and emotionally from my illness and have no time nor intent to process what they have to say yet I have to go there and pretend that I do.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of people out there in the world who is an expert on dealing with similar scenarios with their overzealous family members. I will appreciate any tips and tricks to get me through this. Thank you in advance!",12Dec2020,1
873,"Basically the title. I had a group of friends that I thought were really my friends but they just seem to do things among themselves now and never talk to me anymore and I'm not really sure why. As quite a sociable person, it's really difficult just being alone which will be the case for weeks until uni starts again. I have my own friends at uni but all of them live so far away that, especially considering the current situation, it's just not possible to do anything. I've really got no idea what to do I'm just driving myself insane, I'm losing interest in everything and just feel myself dissipating.",12Dec2020,1
875,"I'm 25F and I had to move back in with my parents after graduating college this year. I had 4 years of independence and now it's gone. I feel like a failure and loser because I moved back in with my folks and I'm literally working the same job I had in high school with the same manager and everything. I'm a fucking loser in every sense of the word.

I keep applying online, but I can't get a job because I don't have any experience because I can't get a job. At one point, I though I found an online job that would give me some experience, but it turned out to be a scam (don't work for Course Hero).

Now it feels like I'm a teenager again, but at least when I was a teenager, I was in high school which gave me purpose. Not I just work retail, the customers treat me like shit, my co-workers are fine but not people I have much in common with. Sometimes they point out the fact that I'm always in a bad mood. It feels like I'm running on a treadmill, trying as hard as I can, but going no where.

I went to college in another city, so when I moved back in with my parents, I had to leave behind all my friends and my boyfriend. Now we're all long-distance and it feels SO lonely. I've hung out with my co-workers outside of work but it's not the same.

Now, I'm just some girl with no friends, living with my parents, on anti-depressants, getting rejection E-Mails from jobs and spending all my free time on the internet. 

It's pathetic.

\- Sorry that this turned out so long and angry, I'm obviously not in a good mood right now.",12Dec2020,1
876,"Some context: The other day my mom, sister and I were watching Avatar, and

(spoilers)

we got to the part of the show where Mai and Ty Lee betray Azula. After that I told her that I wanted to stop watching and draw, and because my mom kept pushing about watching another episode I raised my voice and told her no. She told me I was acting like Azula, so I jokingly asked if that meant I was abusive. She just nodded her head so I asked if she meant that (twice), and she said that yes, I was abusive, and it was the way I said things. I just kind of left quietly then, and normally when my mom would say things like that I'd cry, but this time I just felt kind of confused and numb.

She once described me as abusive when speaking to my grandmother, and she's called me other things too, but I don't think I am that bad. Maybe I'm wrong, but I never yell at or insult anyone, and the worst thing I do is get an attitude when I'm grumpy; if anything, I feel like I have to sit and listen to my mom call me names and compare me to bad people. But anyways, that's not my question..

I'm starting to realize I'm not as horrible as I used to think I was, and I just get angry like people do sometimes. I used to beat myself up all the time, and I had a million insecurities; I feel more confident about my physical appearance now, but I still haven't completely embraced who I am inside.

How can I teach myself to love myself, and convince myself that I'm good and worthy of love? What are some good habits I should start? Nowadays I have positive affirmations I tell myself throughout the day, but honestly it doesn't feel like enough.

Anyways, thank you if you decide to comment! Any advice is appreciated. ☺️",12Dec2020,1
877," 

just a little note, I'm 16F so don't expect perfect grammar or.. not cringy writing lol. this is probably not the right subreddit to ask this but its the only one that came up in my mind.

anyway, i realize that this is a habit I've developed and sometimes i cant help but feel annoyed if someone is venting and they take it out on me. i tend to let my emotions overcome me and then i turn the conversation back to myself.

this has happened before but i know that there are times when ppl i know are going thru something or that they actually didn't sound like they were mad/annoyed with me at all, but regardless i cant help but feel annoyed because of them, when i know they feel like this for a valid reason. it has become a bit of a problem in my relationships.

i might be seeing a psychiatrist soon (for this and other reasons as well) to see if there's an underlying psychological cause to this, considering i live with an emotionally n verbally abusive mother. that, or maybe im just a shitty person lol.",12Dec2020,1
878,"Hey there 

So my bf and I have been together for a year and recently he’s been hanging out with his friends a LOT and that’s fine and all, but I just get really jealous over everything. He has more fun with them, it seems to me. It makes me sad because I feel kind of ignored I guess, but at the same time, he deserves time with other people and he doesn’t need to be with me 24/7. I feel like total shit for being upset. 

This has been going on for a couple of months I guess, recently he took a couple days break from them just to be with me and I felt really happy but also kind of guilty. Since lockdown he can’t call me and be all lovey and flirty with me cuz his parents are around, which makes me feel more like a side piece friend, but that’s not really his fault. He also stopped looking at my vent twitter account which just makes me feel like he cares even less about how I feel but I know that’s not true. 

He told me he feels guilty whenever he hangs out with his friends cuz he knows it makes me sad but I don’t want to be sad about it. I don’t know what to do. I feel like he likes them more than he likes me no matter how many times he reassures me he doesn’t. He has so much fun with them and it makes me feel terrible cuz he never has fun with me like that. Today I asked him if he wanted to play a video game with me and my friends and he said no, he said he wanted to watch a movie with his friends instead. That’s okay. They do that every night, it’s like a ritual I guess. 

I’m in a really vulnerable spot right now so i don’t want any comments telling me I’m being a clingy bitch or that I’m in the wrong cuz I know I am. I want advice on how to cope with it and how to solve this issue where we’re both happy. I don’t want to mess up my own relationship over this stupid thing. I just, I don’t know. Serious replies only please, no bashing or being a dick.",12Dec2020,1
