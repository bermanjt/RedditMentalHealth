1,I'm a chubby highschooler with quite a few siblings so there's always sugary foods in the house and I'm not sure how to steer clear of them. Any ideas? I really need to lose weight and all the little Debbie's at arm's reach aren't helping at all.,21Jun2020,2
2,My friend I‚Äôll call A constantly used to talk to me about all the guys she‚Äôs been with and all the stuff she‚Äôs done (I don‚Äôt judge her for this at all) however she used to constantly berate me for not being like her and putting me down for not having a sex life like her. I called her a slut to a family member and although she doesn‚Äôt know and we have pretty much grown apart but I feel really really guilty about saying it. I completely respect her choices but that‚Äôs just not me.,21Jun2020,2
3,"I just can‚Äôt sit down and study. I don‚Äôt have ADHD or anything like that, but my brain just feels tired and worn out from all this time spent locked up studying for previous exams. It doesn‚Äôt help that this is a particularly tough and boring class with an asshole professor, and since quarantine and online classes destroyed my study habits, I didn‚Äôt pick up on much during the semester.

Despite that, things are going well for other classes, and it‚Äôs likely that I‚Äôll get good grades in all of them. I also have a make-up exam for this class I can take next month in case I fail this one, but that would be my absolute last chance of passing.

So what I‚Äôm wondering is...is it okay to just give up? Normally I‚Äôd be confident in my ability to cram the night before and still get good results, but this time my brain just feels...not up to the task. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs psychological or not, but I really do feel abnormally tired and lazy right now. It‚Äôs also an open-book exam, so I suppose it‚Äôs possible to miraculously pass with minimal studying if the questions are easy enough and I can pick everything up from books and outlines and previous exams. I‚Äôm studying Law, by the way.",21Jun2020,3
4,"I (23, M) recently stopped drinking, 3 weeks ago tomorrow. I‚Äôve definitely straddled a fine line of alcohol abuse, not necessarily full blown alcoholism but I could see where it was heading. 

I‚Äôve been going through quite the rough patch this year, depression etc.. It started getting bad after the quarantine began. I was drinking heavily and working from home especially enabled it. I met a girl who I was absolutely enamored by and it seemed like it was reciprocated, but a few weeks ago she more or less ghosted me out of no where (there‚Äôs a bit more to it than that but doesn‚Äôt matter to this post). Basically, the pain from that led me into a much darker hole and I realized I wasn‚Äôt dealing with my problems but merely just drinking to mask them, which has been a habit for several years now.

I‚Äôm sober 3 weeks. I‚Äôm still dealing with the depression but I‚Äôm in a better emotional state now than I was when I was drinking. 

The problem I‚Äôm running into is being 23, it‚Äôs almost the only thing any of my friends do. I‚Äôve been getting outside; hiking, fishing, etc.. I‚Äôm lucky to live in a state where the outdoors are very accessible. My problem now is my social life has basically become nonexistent. I can be around alcohol but I do have a problem when it is the sole focus of an outing. 

I‚Äôm really lonely which has really been playing into the depression. I‚Äôm not quite sure how to meet new people or what to do. It seems everyone (even girls/dating) needs or wants to go to the bars to meet and grab drinks.. 

Any advice would be great, I need some help.",21Jun2020,15
5,"Hey guys I'm in need of a little advice and guidance and hope you guys can help!

A little back story first, right before quarintine my fiance√© and I broke up after 5.5 years together. During those years we obviously grew very close and began sharing hobbies with the other. For my end, I introduced her to thrift shopping, ""serious"" gaming, and shot glass collecting. 

Since we broke up I've just been unable to do those things without thinking about her and making myself sad, and I've gotten to the point where I just stopped doing them. I left 3 games with over 350hrs (one has well over 1k hrs) in them because we would grind them togeather, today I went thrift shopping and kept reaching for my phone to send her pictures of stuff, and even though she never started collecting them she ended up buying about 1/5 of my collection for me. 

I'm just trying to get my hobbies back man...

6,So me and my mom saw a lady in front of the grocery store with a sign that read something along the lines of ‚ÄúI have two kids and I need money for food‚Äù. We didn‚Äôt have any cash on hand so we went home. My mom then asked me to drive back and give 10-20 bucks. So I did and then I thought it over and I wasn‚Äôt sure if she actually was in a tough situation. My moms friend said she‚Äôs been asking for money for a couple weeks now. So I told my mom she wasn‚Äôt there anymore (she was) and drove back. Should I go back and give the money? I kinda feel bad now. Also should I tell my mom the truth?,21Jun2020,2
7,"There‚Äôs a lot to say about her and why all the rest of my friends feel like dropping her and I‚Äôve really stuck with the girl for the longest and like her and all but I‚Äôm really thinking about dropping her for a couple of reasons.

But I‚Äôm like the only reason my other friends tolerate her (not even).

Basically what made me stop wanting to be friends is me realizing how much effort I made for her that was never reciprocated.

She dated a guy in our friend group (they broke up, also a reason ppl wanna drop her) and while they dated he always tried to stand up for her, because she‚Äôs quite insecure and always thinks we dont want to include her in things (because the other people didn‚Äôt like her much) but I assured him we we‚Äôre, and we did, but she never hangs out with us.

I‚Äôve invited her to countless things, she suggests to hang out, I do, all that, and she never shows. And she still feels bad about herself as if we didn‚Äôt want her there. She tells me, honestly, that she doesn‚Äôt feel like going, and I‚Äôm like okay that‚Äôs fine. But she lies to everyone else ‚Äòmy parents won‚Äôt/wouldn‚Äôt let me‚Äô ‚ÄòI‚Äôm busy‚Äô blah blah blah, but she isn‚Äôt. She does have mental and physical conditions, but not so much so that she can‚Äôt just hang out every now and then. 

Other things I‚Äôve thought about is just her trying to get with all they guys we like, (doesn‚Äôt really happen to me, it just sucks for me to see it happen to other friends) and she really broke the guys heart and she‚Äôs just such a half assed person it sucks.

Aside from the blowing off and feeling bad for herself, she doesn‚Äôt do anything to me directly to warrant my hate like my other friends so I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I can be more specific in the dms but I really need help with what to do because my other friends have already kind of stopped talking to her and everything.",21Jun2020,2

9,"For reference, im 16 M and have to choose what school or sixth form i go to for the next 2 years. Im stuck between 2 options, one is a very big traditional a level sixth form and one is a small IB school that is attached to the school i already go to. All of my friends are going to the bigger one and they think i should too, but i think i would enjoy the smaller campus more due to having anxiety. Even if i do go to the bigger one, i'll end up making new friends due to the fact that i probably wont be in any of my current friends classes. My friends are all  strongly insentivising me to go with them but I think I will get on better with the people i meet at the smaller school due to it also being international ( i have an international past). Both schools have good education but the bigger one does a-levels and the smaller one does the IB. Guidance on which i should pick would be greatly appreciated.",21Jun2020,1
10,"I know the title makes me sound nosy or controlling but, I promise I'm only asking this because I have good intentions. 

Minor background (feel free to skip): my family has a strong history of bad marriges, abusive relationships, broken and abused children, and babies born for reasons other than love and desire for a family. It's a generational curse that has caused everyone in my family to grow up broken and miserable and unable to behave normally or function in society. We're all severely fucked up and it's just a never ending cycle of misery. People who arent raised right have a hard time finding happiness. That's a fact, I believe.

The issue at hand: Im 22. My sister is 25. She just found out she's pregnant after screwing her boyfriend of 6 months with no condom during a vacation they took. I don't think she's ready for a child at all and I'm scared for this potential child to have a shitty and sad life like everyone else in my family. I'm not sure if it's appropriate to tell her this or try to convince her to reconsider but I'm just worried.

My reasoning: My sister only week prior to this admitted to me that she's breaking up with her bf, that she rather stay single,  she lacks confidence, and she wants a man to treat her like a queen. To add onto that, her boyfriend now was a rebound from her failed engagement to her ex of 6 years. 
-She has serious anger/aggression problems and fights with people in public for minor things. She absolutely refuses to get therapy because of the cost. Oh, she has no insurance by the way and can't afford it.
-She is very insecure and is constantly checking her BF's phone to see if he's even looking at other women. She even stole his password and searches his cell. 
-She is not especially considerate to the needs of others and will leave her puppy at home alone for HOURS on end because she wants to party or something. Wont even bother looking for someone to watch the dog for a bit.
-She literally said if her BF didn't ""want a kid so bad"" she would abort it for sure because isn't ready
-she doesnt own a home and lives in a tiny apartment in a dangerous neighborhood 
-she still has a lot of things she wants to do first like travel or pursue music.
-Her BF's ex is sabotaging his job and the BF's mother is actively trying to break him up from my sister because she hates her. 
-Her BF does not have a degree or steady career
-My sister is a stubborn racist, homophobe, and ableist 
- she said she doesn't want a girl because ""she'll have a period"" (???)

I'm not mentioning these things to belittle or criticize my sister (I care abour her despite her problems of course) but, they're serious concerns to me for the future child. Her life, relationship, and mental state just seem so turbulent and our family is simply awful and full of terrible energy and opinions and just.. EVERYTHING!! 
As they say, it takes a village to raise a child. But if that village is full of assholes, liars, abusers, and broken/irresponsible people, I fail to see how this child can have a peaceful life.

Should I say anything to her?",21Jun2020,1

12,"Ok so here we go: 
I find myself overthinking a lot about things being unfair for me. For example I have dreadlocks and I‚Äôm white, and I get a lot of hate and it hurts my heart. I feel like I always want to argue and rant about how ridiculous my fellow progressives are. I get really angry about tumblr feminists who think they know everything because they took a woman‚Äôs studies class (I‚Äôm a feminist too but I‚Äôm better at it). I feel like I don‚Äôt quite fit in anywhere, and I‚Äôm getting older. I‚Äôll be 30 in a few months and I barely have any friends. I don‚Äôt know why... it feels like I‚Äôm the only person like me. 

Anyways, I didn‚Äôt come here to rant. I want to know how I can become less self centered, and be better equipped to be around people. I guess If I can‚Äôt make people like the real me, maybe they‚Äôll like me because they feel good being around me, by me complimenting them, and helping them. But I don‚Äôt want to change who I am just because I feel like a failure. I‚Äôm just focused so inward and so angry about the state of the world, I can‚Äôt be good to the people around me and I don‚Äôt know how to turn it around, it‚Äôs like a bad habit I can‚Äôt shake. I‚Äôve tried mindfulness and meditation, but I don‚Äôt get anywhere. I want to donate to causes I care about but I don‚Äôt have the funds. I just don‚Äôt want to be selfish and angry and bitter.

13,"After living by myself for years, I'm back to living with parents (halfway through my 20s) because of life situations. We had a very bad relationship, my intention was to stay estranged forever, but things happened, I'm back to leaving with them, our relationship has improved, there's no fighting.

The problem is, my dad (almost 60) just becomes more annoying through the years. My room is right next to theirs (separated by the same wall) and my dad is always listening to TV full volume, music on full volume and his cellphone on full volume at the same fucking time. We have some pet dogs and my dad pretends he's our female dogs and start speaking like an idiot, then taunts the dogs, the dogs start barking loudly, then aggressively tells them to shut up, then starts speaking like a dog again. While blasting everything full volume at the same time. This goes for hours and hours every single day. 

I'm getting tired of telling him to lower his voice, he's clearly ignoring what I say. It's not only me, my mom stays away from him all day long, she's never in the same room as him. I've seen my mom telling him to lower his voice and he ignores that. He's not letting me sleep, and he's always waking me up in the morning with the noise.

I know the obvious answer is ""just move out"" but I can't do that because of the virus, I'd do if I could. If I try confronting my father he starts a tantrum like a child. Also I pay all my everything and give my parents money.",21Jun2020,1

15,"I went to my nephew's birthday party today and hung around my in laws family including my SIL and felt unwelcomed. My brother was quiet, meek, looked emotionally drained and not himself for whatever reason. My family (especially my parents) was very distant emotionally and seems to put on this fake persona of caring about their grandchildren when they could care less about them or others around them. I feel very Hypersexualized (like I have this feeling to breed but NOT horny!) lately and have this feeling of sex yet I want an emotional connection &amp; support. 

Anyways I was talking to my SIL's friend and she was really excited talking to me (like no other guy) and was asking if I had a place to stay and I did. Then later on her mom starts to stand by me and I didn't understand at first until later on. Then before left she mentioned how my brother and I look similar, then mentioned how much better looking I was than her fiancee. I really was starting to feel the urge and having sex with her but I stopped. She would mention random things about a shirt motto of being wet.  Then her aunt comes by and sits next to us and she said to her, ""I told you about this twice now!"" and I got the hint she might have wanted to have some fun. 

My brother gave a smirk to her and she started laughing about it while I was sitting next to her. 

I really wanted to smash her but it would ruin my whole relationship with my SIL (she's close to her)  &amp; my  brother.

18,"Hi everyone,

I have a huge issue with my father and have NO IDEA what to do. He's an alcoholic. A drink a handle a day, say nothings wrong, got fired from his job for drinking on the job level of alcoholic. My mother (who divorced him years ago) and I dropped everything that we were doing to help and get him to rehab. I literally live four hours away, took him to the hospital, and drove him four additional hours (out of my way) to rehab before heading back home. He was released yesterday after a 2.5 week stint at rehab, and today my family was worried about him, and so my mother drove to his place and found him passed out, half of a handle gone, and his place an absolute wreck.

At this point, we have no idea what to do. I've been trying everything I could. I dropped what I was doing multiple times to try to have an intervention. I would call him every day. He would just lie to me, tell me nothings wrong. We've gotten him medical detoxed at the hospital. We've gotten him to his brothers in another city. We've gotten him to rehab. And Every. Single. Time. He just goes back to drinking. I want to help, but right now I'm literally COVID-19 positive and I can't help even if I wanted to--not to mention I can't leave my job as I used ALL of my vacation days getting him in and out of the hospital and rehab.

my grandparents we arguing that he deserved what he got,  that he was a criminal and that these people needed to stop tearing down the statues  and that the media is lying and trying to paint him as a good person (which isn't even true they're literally doing the opposite) but they even went as far as to say that they should just shut up and stop complaining and that black history and suffering is all a lie and life was better when they just kept quiet and didn't cause a fuss. 

I am so angry and insanely uncomfortable with this. anyway at dinner my family basically decided that we would no longer bring up political discussions with them because it just causes problems and I'm so angry at them now because I don't understand how they can move on from this and pretend everything's okay because it's really not. 

I don't think I can look at them the same way. my mother wants to go visit in the coming holidays but I think I'm going to tell her I don't want to go. I know it definitely won't go down well and she'll get angry at me and tell me I'm overreacting and being stupid but it just wouldn't sit right with me if I don't say anything at all.

29,"Throwaway account. This is the first post I have even ever made on Reddit, and I hope I can phrase this well, I am just extremely stressed out.

I (23M) was with my ex-girlfriend (23F) for approximately a year and a half, and even though nothing particularly bad ever happened, we supported each other and are absolute best friends, I had recurring doubts that would creep in and terrify me, and eventually I made the decision to be alone and to figure out what that's all about.

Leaving a ""happy"" relationship was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life, but I knew in my gut I needed to do it. 

After our break up last month, she has completely fallen apart. She never showed any signs of depression/anxiety, but it seems this has totally thrown her off. Recently, she is telling me that she is constantly thinking about suicide, and that she wants me back. I know in my heart that part of this is manipulation and emotional blackmail, especially since she knows I have severe trauma regarding suicide (3 very good friends of mine have killed themselves), and mental health. 

I have spoken to her friends, I have offered to even put her through therapy with my own money if she needs it. I honestly thought that we I could sort of ""be there"" for her during all of this, and get her the help she needs. I thought that when we broke it off eventually that we did it with mutual respect and love.

I still have love for her, but her behavior since the break up has been toxic and I am constantly on high alert and stressed. The mental health facilities in my country are infamously terrible, and so I am worried about calling the police next time this happens.

She begs me to come and see her and that she wants me back, though I tell her that it would only make it worse and I would be enabling her. 

I'm extremely worried because this is extremely unlike her, she has an amazing family and was always the bubbliest person in the world. She tells me she cannot help herself and she accepted to see a therapist. However, the threats are still coming.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I make the drive to see her when this happens? Should I ghost her completely? I'm ashamed to say when she calls me screaming and saying she wants to die if I don't see her right now that I tell her ""just sleep tonight and we can talk another time"". I'm not a therapist, I am not qualified, and I just want her to be okay. 

I've dealt with my own depression for years, and through therapy have the tools to cope and be better, but she has no experience with this. 

Apologies for rambling, and thank you. This toxic and manipulative behavior is totally new. When she is in hysteria she will curse at me and even say ""Thats why so many of your friends died, because you don't help"" and then apologize and say that its not her.",21Jun2020,2
30,"Okay, so firstly, a bit of explanation.

Last Friday, I fucked up, royally. I got very drunk, more than I usually am, my phone and wallet were stolen.  At the end of it all, I brought a girl home, sex and fun were had but I eventually had to deal with the fallout. Now my mom was initially supportive but when I was going out again, she put in restrictions. Come back home by a certain hour, don't drink this, don't do that, etc. 

Now, you have to understand, I had next to no control over my life for the past few months. Although I am 19 and soon off to university in England (I live in Switzerland near Geneva) I couldn't really choose where I would go. When she sort of tried to get the Dean of my chosen Department to get me in, she would only talk to the university she liked best, not the one I liked best. And she would repeatedly dismiss my pleas to finally choose the uni or consider the one I liked. Compile this with the Covid-19 pandemic and you can see that I was pretty miserable for the past few months. 

Then, Switzerland entered the third phase of easing restrictions, so I could finally go out to a pub, meet some people and have some fun. This how what I described in the first paragraph happened. Now I am no stranger to alcohol. Before the pandemic hit, I frequently went out, met people out on town and got drunk to various degrees but nothing on the scale of last week. My mom jumped to the most extreme conclusions.  She called the girl I slept with a whore (because we had sex on the night we met) and she said I shouldn't drink any alcohol, which I know I should cut down on but I still want to have some fun with it.

I have known about him for a while but I thought that the fact that he was a creep and what little photography he has done is very poor but alas 3 years later he is somehow still capable of using these groups on Facebook to get new and inexperienced models to share compromising photos with him and if they say they don't want to work them he guilts them using his mental disorders",21Jun2020,1
36,"Hi everyone,

I hope you guys are staying safe during this pandemic. Everyone has been treating this differently, and I have been on the more cautious side because my girlfriend has asthma and we don‚Äôt know how COVID-19 would impact her. I don‚Äôt have any pre-existing conditions so I‚Äôm not as worried about myself as I am about her. I just graduated college where I met my girlfriend and she lives near there, so I have been quarantined with her since March, and we really only leave her house unless we are going shopping or doing any other essential things. We don‚Äôt have any people over and really don‚Äôt see anyone outside of each other.

My immediate family seems to be treating the virus much differently. My dad mainly works alone, and my mom is a dog groomer and interacts with many people/dogs every day. My parents still go to work every day and my mom touches dogs that are pet by their owners all the time. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad to go to work during the pandemic, I‚Äôm just saying there is some risk associated with it. My younger sister has a boyfriend who comes over quite a bit and she also goes to his house as well, and my family has people over every now and then that they hang out with.

Now, to the point. I just graduated college last month and I am starting my first job in about a month. My family has asked me to come home and live with them many times, but I do not want to put myself (and therefore my girlfriend if I ever decide to see her) at risk of contracting coronavirus if anyone in my family were to contract it, and my family is not willing to change their lifestyle to help me feel more comfortable with living there. I know that might sound selfish, but I‚Äôm trying to limit any risk of my girlfriend coming into contact with the virus. So, I found myself another living situation by myself for the time being. 

Since I‚Äôve been quarantined with my girlfriend since March when I was still in school, I haven‚Äôt seen my family much at all since then and they continually tell me that they never see me anymore. I miss them so terribly and want to see them so badly but I am afraid that I could be putting my girlfriend in danger by doing so. It is starting to come between us and they are starting to think that I don‚Äôt care about them. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I really don‚Äôt want it to seem like I don‚Äôt love my family because I love them very much. Any advice on what to do would be much appreciated.

TL;DR My family is starting to think that I don‚Äôt care/want to see them anymore because I have been quarantined with my girlfriend with asthma since March and I don‚Äôt want to put her at risk or getting the virus by seeing them.",21Jun2020,1
38,"Today my older brother(22) and my father got into a really stupid fight that led my brother to smash a ceramic mug into his head cutting his forehead while my father screamed at him to leave his house and never show up again. Yes, my brother was taken care of and is currently out of town with my eldest brother in his home but I find myself very lost. Unfortunately this is not the first time this kind of fight has happened, but was definitely the most severe. Both of my parents have been very emotionally toxic to all my siblings and I and are both raging alcoholics who refuse to get help or acknowledge their issues. They also deny and refuse to believe that the problems I have are due to them and are in fact the result of me being moody, lazy, unappreciative, or a piece of shit.

I am not sure what to do, I am about to be a junior in college but am currently jobless and the only plausible answer I can think of is to essentially hide in my father's home until school begins, and move into the apartment that I already have a lease to and at least first month's rent paid. I plan on working again to support myself during the rest of my college career as I did my first 2 years. The problem comes to the present, I don't see myself being able to hide for two months and have no family to turn to, my eldest brother is already way out of room now with my other brother and my mother is planning to stay with her sister(my aunt). I thought I was going to go with my mother but she asked me if I had anywhere to go because I could not go with her. 

My second request for advice would be, is it worth it to cut my parents out of my life ASAP? There are some good moments but they are overcast by the extreme moments. I find myself slipping into depression every time I go home (which my parents force me to do by threatening to stop paying for my school). Should I just declare myself an independent and put myself into debt to get student loans to attempt to finish my degree? Sorry for the ramble, its difficult to get my thoughts together.",21Jun2020,2
39,"My boyfriend and I just moved into an apartment with my best friend and her boyfriend. He's not a very good/responsible person, so some of this doesn't surprise me. But, about 5 months ago, they decided to adopt 2 dogs that they wanted to train to be emotional support dogs. I'm not sure what their breed is, but I know they're part husky, so they're big puppies. 
My roommates will lock them in a cage that is about 30 inches wide and 50 inches long. They keep BOTH puppies in that crate with no blanket ALL DAY EVERY DAY. They'll cover it with a sheet so the dogs don't whine when they see people. 
They will take the dogs out to pee maybe 2-3 times A DAY. Feed them one bowl of food and maybe 2 bowls of water a day. They don't play with the dogs. When they are out, it's to go outside to pee then straight back inside the cage within 10 minutes. 
When the dogs whine or bark, they smack the cage and yell at them to stop making noise. If they continue to whine, they put shock collars on them. I don't even know the last time they gave those dogs baths either. 
They pee in the cage almost every day and it's ruining the floor the cage is on. 
They say they're, ""crate training"" the dogs and want the dogs to be ""emotional support animals,"" but there's NO way this is the right way to ""train."" This has been hard to watch and I am seriously considering calling animal rescue. I'm just not fully sure if I'm overreacting or if I need to do something. Help?

Now, I'm all for people believing in what they want to believe and I fully support her belief system so I would never ask her to leave her faith.

I was looking through some videos online and came across a video made by this dude that goes by Nick Shell on YouTube. He talks about a way to predict hair loss by looking at pictures from when you were younger. He talks about your 1 year old hairline is the one you will have by the age of 35. Considering that you don't have something that accelerates your hair loss. Apparently because the hair you are born with is the hair that will not be affected by DHT. Now people of this subreddit, who I assume are experiencing hair loss, I ask you this. Is this a load of bullsh\*t or is there some logic behind this. Did you guys have a lot of hair when you were born and throughout your toddler days and end up starting to go bald? Try to get a photo of yourself at 1 years old.

57,"I just cannot get along with my dad. Now I don't fight with him every day, and he's not abusive or drug-addicted or anything, but I just can't tolerate him much. He seems to have no sense of cleanliness. He leaves wet towels on the bathroom floor after he showers, and he sometimes doesn't flush the toilet after he uses it during the night. Now I can understand that he might be feeling tired or stressed or whatever, but that doesn't justify disgusting behavior. 

Also, he seems to spend a \*really\* long time doing things. For example, maybe he is microwaving a burrito or something, and even though the instructions say that it takes 10 minutes, he could spend close to half an hour in the kitchen, doing something really dumb like verifying the instructions on the Internet, or cutting it up and adding extra cheese on the individual pieces.

Apart from his weird habits, my dad makes people really uncomfortable at times. When he sits down on the couch to watch TV, he puts his bare feet up on the table in front of him, and he just grabs the bowl of popcorn and puts it on his lap and then scoops popcorn out with his bare hands and eats it. Now we are perfectly okay with letting him eat popcorn, but not when he eats it like that. Again, this behavior is not abusive or immoral or anything, but still it makes me want to cringe and die inside.

The weirdest thing is that he sings all the time. He sings when he is dusting the furniture or driving, and he sings really off pitch. It makes me super angry and annoyed, and he doesn't seem to care. I told him that he could just listen to music instead, but he says that listening to music is not as good as singing out loud.

I've talked to my dad about it, as well as my mom. My mom tries to help my dad improve his behavior, but he doesn't even try to improve. So I'm wondering if my dad has something like depression or ADHD that needs to get inspected. Or is my dad just being annoying on purpose?",21Jun2020,1

59,"TW for mention of rape and discussion of an abuser

i went to uni with this guy a few years back. we didn't know each other well but had many overlapping friends and lived in the same building for a while. he was known for being very touchy feeley at parties and things, and quite a sexual person. when i was on my year abroad he raped someone at a party, and sexually assaulted another person. there is no doubt this happened - later when challenged, he admitted as such. it was a night with a lot of drink and drugs for all parties, but he crossed boundaries. it was not reported to the police (this is very common). he lost most of his friends, graduated, and moved away to a larger city. 

the thing is we both work in the same arts industry, and he became friends with people i know or have worked with and had started working with friends of mine. with a great amount of conflict - i do not know the wishes of the people he hurt, beyond their anger, and i was not even in the country when it happened but heard and confirmed through our friends - i told a handful of people what he did, all who i know personally, and who work in the industry. i felt that there are people who would want to know - i would personally want to know if i was making art with a rapist, or supporting his work, as i know how painful it can be seeing people doing this. i think if he had made reparations - if he was honest about the harm he caused, and about his actions - or wasn't in this kind of work, i would have left it, but he harmed people, changed location, and did not tell anyone in his new life. i found this last issue out the worst way very early on, by telling one of his then closest friends who didn't know what he had done (not realising they knew each other - we were talking about abuse in the industry, and i brought up his name - the conversation afterwards was very difficult, as you can imagine.). i need to highlight this really isn't about punishment and killing work for him (he's definitely still getting hired) but trust, especially in an industry that can blur personal and professional boundaries, and means working in close, emotional ways on personal work. i have only told people i have trusted, who trust me. for me, this kind of shared knowledge is part of that trust.

why i am posting here is i know someone has said they are compiling a list of abusers in the industry. someone i have told has given his name, and asked me if they did the right thing. i am hugely conflicted and wondering if we should retract his name for these reasons  

\- on the one hand, he did a harmful, horrible thing, not even that long ago, after a sustained pattern of behaviour, and has been untrustworthy both before and since. i believe people should be able to make informed decisions on who they're working with, and i know many people would want to know. whisper networks can help a lot of people, and normalising these discussions and knowledge can create huge positive changes, prevent more harm, and help repair damage. my network is small, this person's network is larger so more people will know. this is another form of telling people, which is something i was already doing anyway. i have been given no reason to think he has been more honest, or taken any other action to repair harm other than remove himself. the people he hurt were still carrying a lot of anger the last time i heard, and he clearly caused a lot of damage. i was not even the one to submit his name, and it has nothing to do with me really - it is not my story.

\- on the other hand, that is exactly the point! it is not my story. but the name was submitted due to my actions. i do not know if this is an action the people he harmed would want to take. for various reasons i don't believe i can ask them now, but putting his name on a list made by a visible person (a list which i dont know whether it gives any other contextualising details beyond his name - see Shitty Media Men list) brings up the worry it may come round to the people he has harmed. i really believe actions should be led by survivors - these lists are usually compiled by anonymous survivors - which is why i ve only ever told a limited number of people i personally know because i know that was within what was okay from the discussions at the time. this feels like a step beyond (is it ?) and i am worried that there may be larger personal repercussions.

being asked about his inclusion on the list has thrown up wider questions for me - i no longer know what the survivors would want, in terms of people knowing. and should he be on a list of abusers - for an event a few years ago he felt guilt for, and with nothing to indicate he's done anything since? (not much to indicate he hasn't either. . . let's not forget he was a confirmed creep at the time!). i totally believe people should be allowed chances to change - how do we judge that? am i even in the position to judge that? what makes me think i can know?

WHERE I NEED HELP: i don't know how to talk about this any more, or tell people, or whether i should even be telling people. and the list - does my friend message the list maker and withdraw his name? or do we let it stand? am i worrying over nothing? he has little power right now - he's no harvey weinstein in that way - but then, if i stay silent, and his successes keep building, will i regret not speaking out in 20 years? is this how abusers gain power - through silence? 

i've tried to keep this really simply written but may have opened a big ol' can of worms. will clarify as much as i can do.",21Jun2020,1

65,"Sorry for the long story. It takes place over the past few years

Originally my (20F) BFF and I went to the same school in the midwest then I moved to the south around sophomore year. Everything was fine except I ended up getting promoted a year because of credits and graduated and started college 1 year before she did. Currently were both 20 years old. I'm soon to graduate in December and she has about 2-3 more years

My friend ended up moving as well her senior year (my freshmen year of college) but struggled  making good friends and adjusting. Meanwhile I was trying to adjust to college life and meeting new friends. I was as supportive as I could be. I would video chat with her whenever she wanted sometimes when I was walking to class to make sure she was okay. I felt like I was always there for her while figuring out a bunch of my own stuff. 

Fast forward to her starting college and video chats become rare and elusive. She says she's always studying or always doing homework. However her snapchat would sometimes tell a different story. It became harder to reach her. So I stopped trying and let her choose chats on her schedule at which she always forgot or cancelled at the last second. I cut her a lot of slack then because she was just experiencing her own freedom in college and I remember how I felt adjusting. 

However, when I was visiting our hometown (big city with lots of friends and family) it was a mess to get her to hangout. She had every excuse in the book and I ended up barely seeing anyone clearing out days for her. Because she moved about 2 hrs from out hometown it had to be an overnight ordeal. I kept bending over backwards to adjust only to see that everytime she was with her college friends in her last week after school ended before move out day. Instead of making time for me, the supposed bff since prek that lives 2000 miles away she didn't bother because she wanted to have a few last hurrahs with her college friends. 

My final straw was when I had my first broken heart and I was actually devastated. We talked about me and my SO fighting the week before but that was it. Then while I'm dealing with my breakup she's nowhere to be found. When I snap her about being sad or wanting to talk she left my shit on read everytime. 

Sometimes she'll start a conversation off of our streak, but I just don't feel into anymore. I feel like she's had all summer to reach out and even today is about to forget about the plans that she initiated after leaving my message about me visiting again on seen. 
I do have others I consider best friends. And one of them lives in our hometown. But we've been friends since prek and I feel like ever since SHE started college she never talks to me makes time for me during visits, or cancels plans. Even during summer. 

I talked to her about how she blew me off for her college friends and she apologized, but i feel the overall effort still isn't there. Should i bring it up again or just stop reaching out to her completely and see what happens. Any other suggestions are welcome",21Jun2020,1

The same happened last year, she was very down for the whole of June. I understand that everyone deals with grief and sadness in their own way, but all I want is to talk to her and to help her. Instead, she's shutting not only me, but everyone out. I've tried bringing it up but she won't talk about it with me. 

It feels like I've got no one, since lockdown started, my friends have forgotten about me. I've messaged them and gotten no reply. The only person who's been there for me at all is my ex-girlfriend's ex-best friend.

I used to really like her back before I started dating my girlfriend, and I only found out afterwards that she felt the same way. I think it's mainly due to her being the only person that really cares about me at the moment, but I can't stop thinking about her. Not in a sexual way, and I don't think it's in a romantic way either. I just can't stop thinking about how happy she's been making me lately.

I don't think I want to date her, I think she's taken anyway. Even if I did want to, I could never hurt my girlfriend like that. I just don't know what to do, I feel so emotionally confused.

I feel loved, yet alone. I feel sad, yet happy. I feel like these emotions are being caused by the wrong people and I don't know how to fix it. I don't even know if I want to fix it. It doesn't make any sense.",21Jun2020,1

70,"Sorry about the wall of text, i dont know how to format.  TLDR at bottom but id appreciate if u read it all.

Backstory.  An old friend that i was extremely close to had some problems and a bad childhood.  I was very close to her and we used to tell each other everything.  We were so close that i ended up falling for her, but i knew that she didnt feel that way about me.  One day she called me and started confessing things to me ""how she felt and things like that"" and i didnt know what to say.  I was pretty fuckin happy to find out she liked me so i went for it and i told her how i felt in return.  But then she hit me out of nowhere saying shes choosing someone else and hung up.  That was 3 years ago and since that day she blocked me on all social media and i had no way to reach out to her.  I was a mess and it threw me into a deep depression, but with therapy and time i managed to dig myself out of that hole.  Now all of a sudden, she messaged me on instagram with a poorly worded apology (She has always been terrible at this i wasnt surprised).   Now i guess i should say i dont know how to approach this?  Do i re open that wound?  I still feel for her, that will never change, but it seems as though she doesnt even remember our last exchange so for all i know she probably doesnt remember telling me those things.  Do i talk to her?  Half of me wants her back in my life, other half just wants her to stay a memory.  Any inputs would be great.  Please and thank you guys.

71,"I should probably put an abuse/suicide warning up here.

I'm going through possibly one of the lowest lows of my life right now with no end in sight. My entire life I've never ONCE been able to escape the sadness and depression and anxiety and I'm so tired at this point I just don't want to do it anymore. I desperately try to be happy and try to show people that I'm happy and friendly, but as soon as I'm alone and theirs no reason to hide my sadness anymore I lose it. I can't control the tears and the thoughts anymore. 

I read the other day a therapist asking someone if they had thought about suicide and that's as far as they've gotten or if they had a plan and I can say I've honestly been planning for as long as I can remember. The depressed person said she had just thought about it and the therapist said she was going through a major depressive episode. Is it possible to be going through a major depressive episode since preschool?

Imagine a seven year old holding a knife to her belly thinking about stabbing herself to end the suffering? That was me. I did that. I did that every day for weeks possibly months. I thought about hanging myself, cutting my wrists, and jumping in front of a car all at the age of seven. It breaks my heart for that little girl that she was so abused and hurt and sad that as a CHILD she wanted to make it all go away and then I remember that child is me and I lose control. 

I blame an extremely abusive and manipulated upbringing for a lot of my problems, but then I was thrown into the world on my own at 17 and was met only with more hatred and abuse. Cheating, beatings, more manipulation and abandonment. It's hard to want to live in a world that is so full of hate when you're fragile and in desperate need of some love. 

It took my doctor three years to guess that I had mental problems because I was so afraid to tell her or anyone what kind of thoughts I was having. I was 16 then and my doctor retired a week after she promised she'd help me. I still haven't found the words to tell anyone else until this reddit post because I'm afraid of myself at this point.

74,"I (F14) have been dealing with my helicopter mother and it‚Äôs driving me crazy. It‚Äôs getting to the point where I can‚Äôt even talk to her anymore because she makes everything into an argument. I have no idea what to do. 

My mother, H, is very narcissistic. H and my dad are divorced (have been for 11 years) and they both have half custody of me. As I started getting older, H has just been getting more and more overprotective and now it‚Äôs getting ridiculous. Here are some examples...

1) I was at the skatepark alone with a large group of trusted friends. H said I wasn‚Äôt allowed to go unless she could wait in the parking lot. I agreed only because I was desperate. Turns out she stalked me from behind the trees. She thought I didn‚Äôt see her, and when I brought it up with her... she laughed it off. 
2) She makes my food, dictates my clothes, and baby talks me. All of this sounds like normal parenting stuff, but not to the extent that H does it. She‚Äôs scared of me using a knife and she still talks to me like i‚Äôm 5!! I try so hard to have a normal conversation with her. 
3) She *tries* to choose my friends. She always tells me that I should be friends with so and so. She also says that if my current friends get me into trouble or aren‚Äôt to her liking, she‚Äôll make sure we aren‚Äôt friends anymore. 
4) She had her boyfriend work at my school to monitor me. He became the principal and would report back everything I did to my mother. She would then use it against me. I can‚Äôt escape her! 
5) She won‚Äôt even let me take a walk in my own neighborhood alone. My father, C, is the opposite so when i‚Äôm at his house, I have a reasonable amount of freedom for a 14 year old. H says that if I go to the park alone, she‚Äôll talk to my father and make sure that never happens.

Someone please help! I‚Äôve tried talking to her and she doesn‚Äôt listen. She has the same excuses each time. It‚Äôs completely ruined our relationship and i‚Äôm afraid if I do something, she‚Äôll blackmail me (she threatens to call my father or a therapist or take me away from my friends). I don‚Äôt know what to do. Please any advice?

78,"So about 7 years ago I met this girl and I fell in love with her. We were super young and like an idiot I just went up and told her and we were just kids so it really did not matter, and we kinda just became friends. And over the years I would do stuff for her trying to get her to like me, but that doesn't really matter. Basically i'm a good guy. I like good Christian girls who don't do anything like smoke,drink, and anything like that. A Lot of my friends do it I don't really care, I just wanna have a good Christian girl because i'm a good Christian guy. But she has changed a lot. Shes does so many bad things, and I don't know why I care so much. Shes blocked my number, Blocked me on snapchat, Hurt me so much, Unfollowed me on instagram. And we have barley talked in about 2 years. But I still think about her everyday, Dream about her every night, and I just feel trapped. Normally when I see a girl doing this stuff I just loose interest and move on. But with her I always get super sad. One night I was thinking about her alot and stalked her vsco and saw she was sad, and I cried for a few hours because I couldn't help her. But I just wanna get away from her but I cant. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everywhere I go I see her. Im kinda friends with her friends so on there social medias Ill always see her. Literally Just hearing her name or seeing her feels like I got shot in the heart, and Instantly get super depressed and sad, and just cant function so I go home and sleep for hours. Eventually I muted her friends on all social media to get away from her BUT still I see her from other kids that once in a while will hang out with her. And Yea i get jealous when shes with other guys, I don't like that but I do, Just thinking of what can happen makes me sick. LIke even at school I know where she walks to her classes just buy going to mine and seeing her so I have to Look down the whole time and go the super long way just to not run into her so I dont ruin my day. One day I went to go eat out and guess who I just randomly ran into there that came 5-10 minutes after I did? 

&amp;#x200B;

Her LOL with A ton of Kids from school for a birthday-party. And like any high school girl they were talking about a ton of guys and bad things and I had to sit through that. But Its summer now so I might just get rid of social media completely and take a break, but oh wait doesn't end there. I make youtube videos and a few years ago when we were friends she made her channel and posted like 3 videos and youtube recommended them to me! I just feel so trapped and stuck. I've been so depressed about her for years now and I just wanna be happy and help people with what i've learned. I'm sorry if this is really bad writing or missing a ton of stuff i've written this a ton of times trying to get it off my chest. Like Even at work when I see a girl that even looks like her I get a mini heart attack and it turns out to be some 60 year old women. But I just don't get why shes in my heart, Why do I care so much about her when she doesn't even care about me. I feel trapped and stuck like i'm just suppose to be depressed and sad. Anytime I get happy she manages a way to make me depressed. I feel like she Knows, when obviously she doesn't because we don't talk anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone experienced this or Knows anything about this and/or give me some advice? I would really appreciate it, again sorry for all the grammar errors,spelling errors, and me just missing years of stuff, I'm just super exhausted. Saw some things on snapchat last night and cried for hours and couldn't sleep all night. Also, I feel like im a failure and a looser. Ive never been successful in anything ive done. All my businesses have failed, I literally failed 1st grade, I never had a Girlfriend, Ive never been good at any game Ive played for years, And the thing I care about so much youtube, Ive gotten no where and still suck at editing even tho ive been doing it for years and know soo much, I just still suck. I even wanna make music, but obviously my voice sucks. And Im not trying to fish for compliments I just wanna get everything off my chest. I just feel super ugly, unwanted, forgotten. I feel like a ghost. For years I was the class clown, Kinda popular but know one really cares about me. They just want my help to edit there school video projects because thats what im known for, and other help. Anytime I say something in class everyone ignores me and its super awkward Im 17 BTW but anyways I doubt anyone has read this far if you did thanks so much.

So im 19F and all my teen life i used to sneak out and live my best life with my girls friends and bla bla bla... but most things have to come to an end. So i got caught not once not twice but three times. 
Since its the thirst time, my parents said that its too much, they changed the keys and changed the alarm system. Fortunately, theres no cameras.
So i found an amazingly incredible way to sneak out, in our downstairs bathroom theres a window and that window lead to the neighbors's bathroom window.
My neighbor is an old woman living alone and she's so nice and respectable.
Since i know her, i thought that i propose to help her with the rent because i know shes having trouble, like paying her 1K&amp;amp;/month and she would give me the key and i could just open my window and jump to her bathroom window at night and the key would be like to exit and enter her door without waking her up as it would so late instead of her opening me the window AND the door at night. 
So what yall think of that plan ? Would she accept the grand ?

My daughter is only 2 and a half, and for the first year of her life, I was the primary caretaker ie. changing diapers, bathing, feeding, watching, staying up at night with her, everything that a parent is supposed to be doing while unbeknownst to me, her mother was out partying with friends, doing drugs, and cheating on me with at least one other person that I am aware of. Our relationships came to a quick end after I confronted her on it, and am now in a much better place mentally with someone who actually cares about family and has 2 sons of her own. For the next year, my ex and I have been pretty good on getting her half and half of the time going back and forth. But it slowly started to get worse over time as in me seeing her less and less. It came to a day when I was messaged over Facebook Messenger with her asking me if I wanted to give up my parental rights and allowing her to have full custody. I absolutely refused and asked where she would even get that idea to ask that question, AND SHE SAID HER MOTHER TOLD HER TO SAY THAT. I told her I wanted equal shared custody, offered to have the paperwork typed up and notarized to be official without having to make it a court matter and she accepted the offer. Now the Corona Virus has made it a little bit more difficult in getting something like that made up, but a month ago, I went to check the mail and found out she went through the process of setting up a court summons for next month. Since April 4th, she has had our daughter and refuses to give her to me because our 2 kids at home here might make her sick, and she doesn‚Äôt want her around other people. But I know for a fact that when she goes to work, or her boyfriend goes to work, that she is either babysat by her sister, or her mother which makes absolutely no sense since that is just putting her at risk even more isn‚Äôt it?

I told her I am not going to come to her grandmothers house just to see my daughter just because she can‚Äôt agree to let me have one day with her because personally, I might make a scene and cause an argument if I have to be around her family who thinks it‚Äôs okay to prevent me from seeing my own child. Her only offer is I can come there for an hour then leave, or force me to have a FaceTime relationship with my 2 year old daughter.

Im good friends with a woman (We'll call her Jane) who owns a nonprofit organization. Last summer, Janes mother hurt her hip, and I spent a lot of time with her since she is alone most of the day. Id stay with her for a week at a time. Janes mother had surgery a week ago, and Jane asked if I could stay with her mother again. Of course I said yes. Jane tells me to go to her house first, as she wanted to see me and talk to me for a bit.

Im 20 in college. Im doing research with a professor, and our meetings are twice a week, 2 hours each. Janes mother doesnt have wifi, but Jane does. I told my professor I wouldn't be able to meet on Thursday, since I wont have wifi.

I arrive at Janes house, who eventually tells me her mother has a nurse that visits til the 24th, and wont need me til then. Jane said I could stay with her til then to help out. I said sure, though I was annoyed. Id rather spend my time at home with family before going back to college. I could help for a few hours then go home, rather than staying a week. However I do understand that Jane has a lot on her plate so the help would be nice.

The next several days were practically a nightmare. I thought Id be helping with yard work and stuff. I asked her every day if there was anything I could do, she would always respond ""not right now"". Jane had her two granddaughters over the whole time, both around age 6. Jane also has four dogs. Every day I was there, the girls were climbing on me, trying to grab/mess with my phone and laptop, and yelling and screaming. They wouldn't listen when I told them to calm down or stop. On top of this, the dogs would pee in the house or on the carpeted deck. So the floor felt grimey and the dogs and furniture smelled and were dirty. This whole time, I was trying to do my research.

I asked Jane if I could come home for Saturday and Sunday because of fathers day. She said yes but to come back sunday night to help with a THIRD grandchild that was coming to stay, who is very rowdy. I left my suitcase there, since I figured Id be back sunday.

If I go back, I will not be able to meet again all week with my professor. At Jane's house, the kids would be rowdy, and I wouldn't be able to focus or talk with my professor very well. At Janes mothers house, there is no wifi. I was already pissed that I had to cancel one meeting. My time with my family is limited, since I spend half the year at college and alot of time at Janes mothers house.

I think Jane just wanted me to babysit the kids so she won't have to deal with the kids. I wanna tell her that I wont be coming back til Wednesday for my things before going to her mothers house. I do know Jane needs the help and we already agreed Id come back Sunday night. I feel bad canceling on her and leaving her to deal with the kids while she tries to work. Would I be the asshole if I tell her I wont be back till Wednesday?

97,"So I recently had a severe muscle strain at work that was causing intense pain. It was caused by constant strain from certain activities I do at work. I told my employer it was probably no big deal, that I was pretty sure it was muscular, but I wanted to see a doctor. She told me to go through workers comp which I did. I worked Tuesday and Wednesday then on Thursday morning my back locked up while working and I had to go home. I missed Friday too because I was in a lot of pain, but worked all day Saturday. At the end of the day I did about 30 minutes of very easy work on a personal project that is on site. About 2 hours later my boss called me and immediately questioned, ""why couldn't I come to work Friday, but I'm fine to do my own stuff the next day?"" And ""how could my injury just get better after a day?"" And heavily implying I'm trying to either get out of work or scam the system.
Is this legal? Like wtf, do I need to explain that I have no idea why my muscles don't work right sometimes? I think I've missed a day and a half maybe 2 total. Am I an asshole for thinking this is completely out of bounds?",21Jun2020,2
98,"My younger brother who is 11 years old has about 500 hundred followers on TikTok and he is obsessed with the app. My parents are a bit conservative and overprotective, and I wasn't allowed to have any social media until I was 15. He is not supposed to have a TikTok account, but he doesn't care because he's so caught up in the idea of becoming famous. He also created a Snapchat account (which he is not allowed to have either) so that he could talk with his followers on it. It makes me feel so uncomfortable that he is 11 years old and complete strangers are watching him and talking to him, and he doesn't realize how dangerous that can really be. It's consuming him. I talked to my cousin(23F) about the situation to get her opinion. I don't want to be a snitch and expose my brother to my parents, he would get really mad at me. And he won't listen to me if I tell him to stop, either. But my cousin wants to tell my parents and she doesn't think we should let this continue. If my parents find out, my brother's consequences will be severe.But if we let him continue creating content for everyone to see on TikTok, it could also be detrimental. I love my brother and I feel genuine concern for him. What is the right thing to do?",21Jun2020,2
99,"So this legit happened a few minutes ago. So me (16 F)and my ex were dating for seven months and we were happy.

I know I did something wrong and I want her to tell me but she won‚Äôt tell me! At the end of her message she said that she ‚Äúwanted to still be friends but if that was not okay then I will understand.‚Äù So I‚Äôm confused and I want to think about everything that has happened. So I send a message saying ‚Äúlet me think about it.‚Äù And she said ‚ÄúNo, I understand we shouldn‚Äôt be friends.‚Äù I tell her my feelings about how I trusted her and that I cared for her and she has the nerve to say that I am verbally abusing her over that fact that she wanted to tell her feelings.

100,"I (15F) am a rising senior in high school. My parents keep trying to ""help"" me figure out what I want to do with my life. For a long time now, I've known that I want to pursue a career in the Navy. Originally, I really wanted to go to the Naval Academy, but I don't meet the age requirement. Now I'm planning on doing an NROTC program in college. Every time I try to talk to my parents about it, they write it off as a joke or say something about how I'm going to die or ""throwing my life away"" or ""being unreasonable."" They think that the only reason someone would do it is if they needed the financial help or something. Academically, I've done really well in high school and my parents think I should pursue something more academic.

I understand where they're coming from, but they won't even listen to me. I know they have my best interests at heart. I've thought this through extensively and it's not a rash decision. How can I explain this to my parents?",21Jun2020,2

102,"I‚Äôll start off by explaining why I got mad at her.

Ever since me and my siblings were little she would always yell at us, and verbally abuse us, said very hurtful things. Then acted like nothing happened. I grew used to this. But then she would start calling me the worst daughter in the world, and would want to make me cry when she was in a bad mood. Whenever she is in a bad mood she likes to put it on others as well. She also doesn‚Äôt have friends, so when I get close to some people, she tries to drive them away, or tells me that they are only using me. I mention this because she can be very mean, and I can‚Äôt do much to stop it.

Today, she was talking bad about my brother, I had about enough of it, so I snapped. I said, ‚Äúthe reason why he acts this way is because you never taught him, you would yell at him at his darkest times, you don‚Äôt take him to therapy(my brother is super depressed), you never understand him, and you don‚Äôt give us the chance to ever explain ourselves when you yelled at us.‚Äù I continued to tell her how she always treated her bad. 
(When she was talking bad about my brother she said it in Spanish so he wouldn‚Äôt understand, and by the time I spoke, he had left the room)

Then she started crying. And my brother walked into the room.

She explained in a sad/angry tone that she never was raised by her mom, and how she never had a dad, she explained how hard it was for her to care for me and my brother at the same time(only 1 year apart), and she explained all the difficulties she endured. With my dad always working, she never had help. She explained when she yells it‚Äôs because she has had enough. She even started going into how she never went back to school because she never believed in herself(her mom made her quit school at 12 to care for her siblings). 

I started to feel terrible.and my brother started getting angry because I made her cry.

Who was I to tell my mother she didn‚Äôt teach me and my siblings well. I have good grades, I like school, and I respect people. Whenever I want something, she will most likely get it for me, she gives me money when I ask for it. She does everything for me. But she isn‚Äôt emotionally there for us.

I feel terrible for telling her those awful things, so once my brother left the room, I told her I didn‚Äôt mean any harm, I told her I was sorry, and I tried telling her that I had no right to say that because she never had a parent to learn from.

But then I also remember the times where she said really hurtful things for no other reason than to get us angry. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do. She has already forgiven me, but I feel like this is something to actually talk about, and get into. 

I feel really bad because I don‚Äôt like hurting anybody, but I got very angry. She is for the most part a good parent. But she does some questionable things.",21Jun2020,2

104,"Here's some details to maybe help give me better advice: My mom is 51, and my dad is 55-56 I don't know his exact age. My sister is 21,and big brother 22. My parents are kinda-strict Muslim-Moroccan parents, and I am 13 years old, in 7th grade. Everyday, I feel very sad and most days I cry. My parents are making me really stressed and sad, and my siblings aren't helping either. Tonight, we were having dinner, and my mom and dad were talking about getting a new sink. Then my sister starting talking about how she was gonna pay her college tuition, and she said she was really stressed about it. My parents ignored her and kept talking about the sink. My sister (semi-jokingly) said, ""Wow, you just completely ignored me."" Things quickly escalated from there, and my mom said, ""Yeah! The sink is more important than your tuition! The sink is leaking and it will create mold!"" That seemed a little harsh, and my sister kept saying forget about it, but my mom kept yelling and yelling, and I just sat there, feeling powerless. I didn't know what to do. I feel like I could help, but I would just make things worse. When the fight was over, my sister saw me sitting at the table, looking sad, and said, ""Go watch TV, there's no reason for you to feel sad."" That made me feel like was sensitive, and that I shouldn't be as sad as I was. I get that she was just sad too, and that she probably wanted to be alone, but still. Things like this have always happened, and it's really the only relationship between my mother and sister that I can think of. These fights have been going on for the past 5 years now, some very very horrible, some not so bad. It's the same with my big brother. He unfortunately got into smoking at 16, and my mom was devastated when she found out (well, I don't remember, this is what she told me). They have always been fighting from then on, and while things have thankfully gotten much better between my big brother and mom (they laugh and fight at a kinda-normal level, at least what I think is a kinda-normal level), things have gotten much worse between my mom and sister. I really don't remember when our family was truly, actually happy, and I long for the days when I had a truly happy day. For the past year or so, my mom has been yelling at me every day! I'm not exaggerating, she finds things that nobody would notice , and calls me to clean it up, or fix it, or move this. And when I politely say, ""Ok, can I rest for a little more? I feel really tired."" She gets mad and says I'll end up just like my sister and big brother. I feel like I do so much for her, I clean everyday, I keep the house and my room really tidy, and try my best to make sure she can't complain about anything. It gets exhausting, yet she still complains. And I don't know why! We have a beautiful, big house, lovely furniture, nice cars, she has luxurious clothes and shoes, she's very beautiful, has lots of friends, and I cook and clean for myself and she still complains about the littlest scratch on the fridge, the tiniest crumb on the floor, the smallest imperfection on a painting. She says, ""Why can't you be like other kids! You're still little babies!"" Even though, I know I do more than most kids in a rich neighborhood. And even at school, I don't feel happy. I hate the work (the work isn't hard, I just feel it's time-consuming and useless), I don't really like my friends or my classmates, and I dislike most of my teachers a lot.  I remember even 2 years ago, I was very happy. I really enjoyed my friends company, I had fun in school (5th grade), my mom seemed much happier and calm, and my family was much more happy. Now my only real friend is my twin brother, but even he infuriates me a lot (but this is probably just normal, right?) Maybe I was just too oblivious to what was happening, but at least I was truly happy. I really want that feeling again, I really do. Sometimes I think to myself, ""Why is this happening! Is god punishing me? Is he testing me?"" or, ""Am I just too sensitive? Is this what being a teenager is about?"", stuff like that. My big brother is away right now, and has been since late January. He was gone last year too from July-November. He barely spends time with me and my twin, and it seems like he prefers spending time with his friends rather than us. In the last 2 years, we probably went out together like 10 times. I really like him though. He's funny, gives mostly good advice, and is very talented. I just wish he would spend more time with my twin and I. My big brother tells me, I need to sacrifice my wants for my parents, because they deserve it, and I understand, sometimes I do complain too much, or ask for too much, but I try my best, and I feel sad that the only place I can turn to is Reddit (no offense), and not my family or friends. And, trust me, I don't hate my family, I really do love them, but it's getting harder and harder to be happy at home or at school. (Sorry if this is too long, I was feeling sad just typing this, and wanted some advice.)",21Jun2020,5
106,"I am 38 years old and have turned into the loser my parents always figured I would be. When I wanted to move out and go to college my parents said they never put away any college fund and wouldn't help pay for it because they figured I would just stay a waitress. That was a low blow. So I left for college and payed for it myself. I then went on to finish all of my Phd and finished all except the end of my dissertation. Needless to say I can not find a full time job. I have been working as an aid for my special needs brother and get paid through his state funding. My mother likes to brag how he is my boss and I have to listen to him. Even bragging that she has to sign off on my hours as his managing case person. It is humiliating.

108,"There's a girl I work with. She's pretty nice, kind of funny. Idk I thought she was kind of cool. So I asked her out over text. I didn't sound desperate or anything and I didn't just outright ask her. I opened up with just asking about the state of things at work and whether or not business was picking back up, then a few replies later asked, ""I was actually wondering if you wanted to get a drink sometime?"" I'm already terrible at social skills, and I've only done this two other times (first time freshman year high school second time sophomore year) and to me this time felt the least cringe, probably because it sounds more adult to ask if you want to have a drink sometime because you can actually do that and out of the 3 times this time sounded the most casual. I was worried it came off weird so I followed it up with ""Sorry if that was weird, you just seem cool so I thought I'd ask."" She replied ""Yeah, sorry. Just not my thing. Have a good day."" Now I don't feel bad or anything. This time felt the most relaxed and it was a nice relaxed answer. I wasn't beat up. Trust me. However, now that I return to work in 2 days I realized that I'll see her again. I'm swelling up with anxiety thinking if she'll think I'm weird or creepy or worse if she told everyone and everyone's going to look at me like that...I know we're all adults and all but I can't shake that feeling.

114,"I also posted this on r/legaladvice, but I posted this on here too hoping there‚Äôs more people who can see this that can give me advice.

So, to get started, I act kind of like my dad‚Äôs translator at times, since my dad doesn‚Äôt speak English very well (we‚Äôre all chinese). I admit that I‚Äôm not very good at translating at times, and in my dad‚Äôs words, always look at things from the other side‚Äôs perspective and never in our own defense. In this sense, I probably have messed up a lot during this whole thing. Even if I‚Äôm not very good, my family relies on me quite a bit for calls, letters, applications, and other things. We don‚Äôt know anything about anything legally related things, so please give some feedback for us. Both my parents work as waitress and chef at a chinese restaurant, so we have never encountered something like this before. Also, we live in Florida.

We just received a summon from someone from the government court person(??). I don‚Äôt know if we should have accepted it. My dad says that we shouldn‚Äôt, and always refer to our insurance agency. He‚Äôs probably right, but I will continue to explain the whole thing in detail.

The things I am going to explain are all from my dad‚Äôs perspective, translated. Oh how I wish I was in that car with him when the accident happened.

It happened on June 20, 2019. It was early in the morning around 10:00am. My dad was driving out for work from his apartment that was close to his workplace. He was on a road driving normally and made a right turn onto the right lane of another road (he‚Äôs driving into a main road). He immediately switched lanes into the left lane after he made his turn (there was only two lanes for each way of the main road). It‚Äôs there to note that my dad did see the other person‚Äôs car, but he knew that he did indeed have enough time to make that turn and for the other person to react to his lane switch by pressing on the brake, etc. After around 4 or 5 seconds, my dad saw that car come from the grassy median of the road and hit his car from the left. It hit my dad‚Äôs left frontside of the car around the upper front left tire and caused a little dent in his car. The other person had her front right side door of her car hit. (We have pictures.) After the crash, both my dad and the other person parked their cars on the other side of the road (not the median, but on the right side of the road) which is also grassy.

My dad got out along with the woman in the other car and asked the woman if everything was alright, and she answered yes. He asked her (with limit in his English) that if they needed to call 911 or anything. The woman refused and told him that everything was alright. She asked my dad if we needed to call 911, and my dad answered yes since he didn‚Äôt know how to take care of this situation. My dad insisted on calling the police just in case, but his English was very limited, so he asked the woman to call the police for them. After she called the police, they started to wait. After around less than ten minutes, her daughter stepped out from the car. According to my dad, he wasn‚Äôt aware that her daughter was in the car, and the woman only took her out because she was crying. The little girl was in the front seat of the car, and she didn‚Äôt look any older than 5 or 6 years old. Her height was maybe from the ground to the top rim of the small Nissan Altima car window that the woman was driving (probably a little shorter). (We have pictures) Since my dad was surprised that there was a child that was also in the car that crawled her way from the front seat to the driver‚Äôs seat and out, he asked the woman if they needed to call the ambulance, again. Again, she refused. Also according to my dad, there were buckets of paint in the back seat of the car too, if that‚Äôs anything relevant.

It was around this time that my dad took the video and pictures. Also during this time, the husband of the woman also came on scene. There, they all waited out in the sun for more than 30 minutes.

Around thirty minutes of waiting or so, a police officer came and asked if everyone was alright, if they needed an ambulance, etc. Everyone again said no. The police officer told the two to wait for the Florida Highway Patrol.

After waiting an hour more for the police officers, they finally arrived. There were two male police officers. They again asked everyone if everyone was okay, if an ambulance was needed, etc. Again, everyone told them that everything was fine. They started to take care of the case. My dad didn‚Äôt know how to say anything since of his big language barrier, and he had absolutely no idea what the other two were saying either.

My dad explained his side of the story in a VERY rough manner. He used hand gestures and spoke very little English. I should also note that my dad had called his boss (who was also chinese and spoke little English) for at least some translation in the matter (though it was also very limited). The police eventually said okay and went back to their car. 

After some time (around 10 minutes), the police just came up to my dad and told him that it was his fault and gave him a ticket, letting the woman and her family go first. At that moment, my dad didn‚Äôt say anything, nor did he know how to say anything, because he thought it was just a ticket where you had to pay a hundred dollars and be done with it, so he just accepted it without any questions. He also needed to go to work. He didn‚Äôt want to go through the trouble to deny it and everything with his limited English. The police also didn‚Äôt ask for a translator or anything. My dad gave his insurance information to the police and everything, thinking that the insurance company will take care of everything.

After the incident, we all went to our insurance agency and ask them what we should do. They explained that we should try and amend our report from that day. We actually tried to amend the report, and we did, I think. They (our insurance agency) also recorded us talking about the incident where I was the translator, but I fumbled a lot of the words and couldn‚Äôt translate to my best extent there. I did complete it, though.

We did not expect it for them to escalate the manner into even going to court. Everything seemed fine. They have an attorney and everything.

They are now suing us for more than $30,000. In the words in the summon, ‚ÄúThis is an action for damages, which exceed the sum of Thirty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($30,000.00).‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know what to do. We don‚Äôt know what to do. We don‚Äôt know any lawyers or attorneys, or anything about the law. The summons state that it was because my dad ‚Äúnegligently crashed his own vehicle into the vehicle that Plaintiff,&lt;the woman&gt;, was driving and in which &lt;the daughter&gt; was a passenger.‚Äù In addition, they are also suing for permanent physical/mental damages (permanent bodily damage) from the crash to her and her daughter.

We have pictures and videos from after the incident (maybe thirty minutes after) from when my dad was waiting for the police with the two. He has a picture of the child‚Äôs approximate height, and also the state in condition of the car and everything. My dad doesn‚Äôt think that the child should have been in the front seat in the first place.

If possible, we do not want to go to court. We do not want any trouble from anyone.

This is only my personal opinion, but I wonder if it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre short on money from the pandemic that they‚Äôre suing now of all times. They filed for a claim online on June 16, 2020. We don‚Äôt have that much money either, though.

If there‚Äôs any lawyers, or anyone for that matter, please give us any advice possible about this matter. What‚Äôs the best course of action for us? Do we also get a lawyer? Anything on the process of the legal trials are welcome too. We need as much information as possible. Thank you.",21Jun2020,3

Basically, I don't ever feel anxious or more like, I don't feel emotions for very long .... That's pretty much it. I'm a good person, but when it comes to helping others I just can't relate to how they can get stuck in these weird emotional cycles. My solution is to always to just keep on chugging.... I'm not a mean person or overbearing, but I do seem to take life and emotions differently than others.

I tend to lack the ability to see the severity of things, in terms of emotions. People have told me I seem to just quickly forget they were sad and that these emotions take time. Apperantly I do have a high emotional intelligence and can quickly recognize others who aren't like... ""me"" .... and it helps a ton, because people do like to have someone ask about small shit they're going through. But, it seems like my solutions or my state of being can turn people away. I'm just too carefree :/

My main issue is that I always know the right thing to say and it can lead to very manipulative behavior and situations. I can also be realllllly fucking mean at times when people deserve it.

About a month and a bit ago I matched with this amazingly perfect girl during our country's lockdown - we chatted endlessly, videochatting, watched movies together, etc. We openly admitted we hella liked each other and genuinely could see a future together, or at least a long ish period of time together. Of course as it was lockdown we couldn't meetup until lockdown was over. We opened up to each other on quite an emotional and spiritual level - I don't know, we were both very starstruck, we'd both never met someone this perfect or found anyone like each other.

When we finally did meet, it seemed okay but she seemed a bit tense, to which she just really sheepishly/sadly admitted that she's not used to being this intimate with someone after her previous boyfriend (who she dated for a year). She admitted she hadn't really gotten Tinder for anything rather than some validation as shit as that was, but she met me and really wants to make it work with me. I of course accepted this and told her it was 100% okay, and suggested maybe we hang out as much as we can so she could get used to my physical presence, which she was more than keen to do.

Later that night, I don't even know, but I started feeling kinda upset - I felt as if I had been led on all throughout our chats and even though I told her I was happy to wait, I don't know how long I could take just waiting around for her to be 'ready.' I should also mention that she did mention this early on in our chats, to which she wanted to 'tone things down' for a bit, and not rush into a relationship which I agreed to, but she didn't really do this and continued very openly flirting with me. So I really impulsively sent her this long as message saying how I honestly felt (I didn't insult her or anything, it was all in a respectful manner). She replied with a long message saying how she's really not ready and stuff which ngl kinda got to me a bit considering I was constantly ensuring she felt safe talking to me, and asked if she was ready to move forward to a relationship, etc. When I saw that message I kinda panicked and sorta missed the point again, which she just left me on read and we haven't talked since.

I get it - you can't force someone to be in a relationship with you, you can't force feelings, etc. But we connected so unbelievably well it was insane. I've never met any girl that I've connected with so well like her. It also really hit me hard this morning when I open Tinder and have seen her profile pop up, with all these brand new pictures - like wtf happened to not being ready and all that? She promised me while she 'worked on herself' this year before moving forward with me that she wouldn't be chatting to any other guys, yet ghosts me and acts like I didn't exist? How can you be so cold? Yes, I may have come on too strongly and became suffocating and I profusely apologized for doing so - but she preached communication within a healthy relationship and we agreed to always communicate how we feel, but does this? Like why? I'm human, I make mistakes, so why can't she accept that?

I'm feeling so defeated as well because she told me things I've always wanted to hear in someone and she did genuinely mean it I reckon (well at the time), saying how she would never judge me for my specific flaws I told her about, promised I would never fade out of her life or that she'd forget about me, yet just ghosts me and does exactly that. I don't know, like if she wanted to move on from me I would've at least preferred she try let me down slowly instead of leaving me hanging? It doesn't feel right too - she did genuinely care (considering we chatted for so so long day to day) so why just leave me hanging like that? And then just immediately heading back to Tinder like nothing we had was even real or legitimate?

It's so hard because we never actually dated so there are so many questions on how or what I could've done to keep the intimacy going. This all sounds like she's a shitty person but she really isn't - she's very sweet and kind, so as I said it's so out of character for her. I have tried dating around and did kind of go on a few dates with several other girls, but I legit can't bring myself to go forward with them because my mind is constantly on her, so I reject these other women. I'm struggling hard to move on from her, I really don't know if I can.

I have been considering testing the waters with her a little bit later, since it's only been a month and a bit so far. I'm not just saying this because I am evidently still holding on, but I feel like she would potentially respond if I sent her something brief and with very low expectations. If i were to hypothetically do this, it'd be a while from now and not anytime soon, but sometime later this year. I'm still debating whether I should, as I feel like if we could maybe meet up and talk this out, it could hopefully clear a lot of air and settle things.

I guess I'm hurting a lot because I never really got closure, and I went from talking to someone daily to just being completely without them. I've never connected with her like I have with anyone, so I've been quite rattled. Her leaving has impacted my mental health a lot, and no we weren't dependent on each other for our own mental issues but we were also very supportive of each other, so it really really felt like it was going to work.

Just really struggling to move on, I don't know whether I can or how to. I miss her so much and wish we could've just talked about it and she didn't just ghost me but here we are.

Sorry for the long read but would really appreciate some advice rn as mentally I'm not doing the best",21Jun2020,1
119,"I posted here a couple of weeks ago about my ex friend who served a long time in prison for raping minors. He got out of prison ten years ago and has since been making indie movies with actresses aged 17-21 (he‚Äôs in his 50s) using a fake name. He has a semi decent following. 

Well, the advice here told me not to ‚Äúruin his life‚Äù because he has already done his time. Turns out someone else almost got their life ruined when he cornered a 17 year old actress and groped her. She escaped and quit. She asked other actresses he worked with if he had done anything to them which led to 3 others coming forward. People found out who he was and everyone in his current production quit.

He hasn‚Äôt been charged with anything yet so I‚Äôm not going to name drop him and have a brigade after him. I‚Äôm just kind of sick to my stomach for not informing them when I had a chance.",21Jun2020,2

123,"hi, so i‚Äôm a 16 yr old female and i have a weird panic thing wrong with me. i have never had a therapist or anything like that and never been diagnosed with anything but ever since i was a tiny child i have been terrified of dying.

it‚Äôs actually kind of embarrassing. from ages 5-10 i used to think i was dying if there was something a little wrong, or even nothing. like i would have a panic attack from a bloody nose, and don‚Äôt get me started on my teeth. anything that has to do with teeth pain, or mouth blood scares me the most. 

this pretty much all stopped after i was around 10. my mom always told me it would go away and i believed her, i even had a couple teeth pulled and a crown put on in the time of 10-16 and i hated it and cried but i was okay.  but the other day i got a popcorn carnal stuck in the gum of the crown, trying to get it out, idk what happened but i felt pain. it doesn‚Äôt hurt anymore, it‚Äôs not air or water sensitive or anything but i still had a horrid panic attack for hours and still have felt panicky for a couple days. 

i don‚Äôt know what is wrong with me. will it go away with time or am i always going to be afraid of teeth? and if so, how bad of a thing is that? how do i stop feeling so panicky when i do? do you think i have something like panic disorder?

124,"i‚Äôm a little nervous to write this as it might come off ignorant. also if there‚Äôs a different sub that fits better let me know.

TL;DR - my parents lifestyle might end up making me a adult child whose parents pay for everything

ok um i guess i‚Äôll start at my upbringing and my parents jobs. my mom is the chief pathologist (a specialized doctor at the hospital) of the city i live in (at both of the hospitals) and my dad is the senior electrical engineer of the city. i am very proud of my parents success as they have worked extremely hard. my childhood was good, we had everything we needed and were taught to be grateful. my parents did not allow us to be spoiled, or brats or anything similar. however as my parents succeeded in their jobs our spending increased. we became more privileged 

privileged such as 
- travelling to a different country every year (or a different location) 
- buying whatever clothes we want and even going to different cities for their big malls 
- getting a car at 16 for my sister and then one for me 
- eating out at any restaurant 2-3 times a month or getting takeout at least once a week 
- never checking the prices while grocery shopping, if you want that drink or food you can get it, along with my mom‚Äôs weird obsession with organic fruits and veggies now 
- asking for money and just getting it, like if i asked my dad for $100 he would give it no questions asked 
- having a college fund and not having to worry about student debt

there‚Äôs other things but the best way i can describe the privilege from my parents is my sister, her situation is also where i became self aware and concerned for my future. my sister entered college last year. we moved all the way with her because my mom wanted to make sure to be close in case anything happens, we moved about an hour away from her school. we left my hometown and kept our house there. on top of that my mom payed her full tuition, books, dorm and gave her a credit card to which she picks up the bill. Then when my sister was nearing second sem my mom was set on buying her a house, ruined now cause of corona, to live in with her friends (her friends pay rent) and pay for everything else as well.  my mom doesn‚Äôt want her to get a job because she‚Äôs afraid it will stray her away from her studies (she‚Äôs premed). on top of that my parents just bought a new house, which they are also getting interior decorated. and they are still thinking of buying my sister a house! &amp;gt;:|

now i‚Äôm certain this same thing will happen to me, i can see that my sister has no life skills and i‚Äôm afraid it will happen to me as well. my parents add her to their accountant to do taxes, so she doesn‚Äôt even know how to do them. i‚Äôm afraid that my lifestyle is going to fuck me up later in life. like if i decided to go through college alone. i would have no idea on how to budget for groceries or anything. what do i do? i asked my mom to get a job and asked if i could put that money towards my college fund and my sister blurted ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point in that? she‚Äôs paying for it anyways‚Äù

126,"Hello there..

Im F19 and he's M19. I met this guy online via tinder, because quarantine and all I was open to relationships/friendships. We became acquainted since we both played video games and I started talking to him 3 days ago. We've been talking on calls, etc. 

Things we going well! I thought I made a pretty cool friend, until he told me he's planning to kill himself on July 2nd. He failed attempting suicide last month and was put in a psych ward for 5 days. He stabbed his gut when he was 8 to kill himself. He has a loving sister, good friends/best friends, lived a great college life and partied/joined a frat, he met the love of his life and dated but they split due to not being able to do long-distance. However, most of it roots from his mother who abused him and his sister and pushed them to do well in school in a toxic way and is blackmailing his sister for 30% of her income. He said killing himself is a way to get back at his mother and possibly make her realize her terrible ways and relieve his sister from her chains. 

I myself am dealing with depression and would say my life hasn't been the best and have thought about suicide, attempted suicide, self-harmed. I understand his suffocation and hearing this left me utterly devastated. I've only known him for 3 days. Yet, I feel terribly upset. He's a great guy. He says that it's a shame because we could've been good friends, or that he wishes he could take me to get a drink if he was in the same state still (he was in my state and moved to visit his sister, he messaged me after he moved because his mother in my state doesn't want him to play video games). 

I tried to talk about his plan and possibly gear him towards to rethink it. He said if he fails he'll be mad at himself. I just don't think he should die. He's too young to give up on life. I have an emotional void with everyone in my life but I have hope that one day I'll be happy. I just feel so sad for him because I can't help him or I don't know how to. 

Please help. I don't know what to do. I told him I'll keep playing games and talk to him as usual and make him feel comfortable. I didn't know why he told me. Why he would put this burden on me. He said it's because I probably won't be terribly hurt and move on anyways. And that he doesn't want to just disappear without a word when he does kill himself. He hasn't told anyone except 1 more person and has distanced himself from his friends. So, I am the only one he is mainly talking to right now.

129,"I'm incredibly worried for my best friend Jessica's safety, I went to primary school with her and she was/is my best friend. She was the only person to fully understand and relate to the family situations i was going through at the time. Her name is Jessica Smith, it's a pretty common name here in the UK. We had both been heavily abused by our parents and I was forced to move far away due to my circumstances. Unfortunately jess didnt have the same choice, she ended up being adopted by her grandmother, who has also been abusing her. Jessica's grandmother is unnaturally calculated in the way she abused jess , she is truly sick and twisted to the point of subtlety physically abusing her while also manipulating jess into thinking she hurt herself. Shes been on my mind for the past 5 years, I havent seen her in 5 years and since i moved away from her I've never stopped having a gut feeling that shes trapped. Jessica's situation is immensely bad, she isnt allowed friends over at all, i was lucky to have been over their once, Jessica is only allowed on her phone for 30 minutes a day to play games, shes not allowed to have any text conversations at all, shes not allowed any social media and has a strict timetable of where she can go in her own home at certain times of the day (not allowed in the living room after 8 oclock). It breaks my heart knowing shes in this situation. Before I left home she gave my a present with her number written on the back, Jessica's grandmother found out about it and started deleting messages i would send her so jess would lose interest I  keeping our friendship. Jessica's grandmother does regular phone checks making sure she has no online communication. She always hated me and my mother because we both knew what was going on, Jessica wasnt being touched in a loving or caring way at all. 
To put things into perspective of how bad things really were, she came over to my house not long after we became close friends, at this point I hadnt met her grandmother or knew what her situation was at all. Jessica suffers from stress induced skin rash, whenever shes stressed the skin on her cheeks becomes red itchy dry and flakey. The first half an hour of h
Jessica being at my house her skin had cleared completely, she was free from tip toeing around her own home and could just be normal in a house for once. I believe Jessica was being beaten by someone in her house (she lived with 15 people) because my mum put some sun screen on her face and she flinched away as if she was scared of being  touched on her face. It was about 20 minutes before we had to take her home and she pulled me aside and said ""please dont let me go back, I want to stay"" she begged me and my mum to let her stay for the weekend so she didnt have to deal with her grandmother for an entire day, at least school took up 6 hours so she could stay in her room away from everything. 
I cant go to the police or child protection services because all I have is her name, her grandmother blocked my mum and my number on Jessica's phone and on her own phone. I need to find her somehow and hope to God she has a social media, I've tried asking people I went to primary school with if they e heard from her or if they follow her on any social media but no one has heard anything  from her in a while. If anyone has any idea on how to find her, please please please let me know, my mum is willing to adopt her to get her away from everything so she can live an actual life, Jessica Smith is 16, the same age as me, but she has bo control over her own life and I'm worried that shes hurting herself because of it or that shes even taken her life, her mental health was already in a bad way and it kills me to admit that I wouldnt be surprised/ I've mentally prepared myself in the even that she has taken her life. All I need now is to know it shes dead or alive  because I cant keep waking up thinking of my best friend and not knowing how her situation is.

133,"I want to keep everything on the up and up in an industry that is known for not being exactly honest about money. So here's the backstory- I graduated barber school and got licensed during the whole lockdown thing. Two shops didn't work out before my first day because I would not put up with the bs, being jerked around, and drama. I kind of panicked and took an opportunity to rent a booth at shop number 3. I pay $200 a week, and as a booth renter the shop owner legally is supposed to be nothing more than a landlord. They can't dictate my prices, my hours, my days, or anything I do really or I should be classified as an employee, paid hourly, receive overtime, and receive all of the benefits/protections of being an employee. 

On the contrary, despite being promised one I do not have a key to access the shop, I am told what days and hours I have to work, told what tools I have to buy and use, have to use cards with the shop phone number, instagram, and address on them and not allowed to have my own, am not allowed to give people my information because he says that clients belong to the shop and not the barber, I've had to pay for a towel/appointment guy that I didn't agree to or know about before I had to give up 75% of my first week's earnings to him, I'm not allowed to get a business license, I'm not allowed to carry my own insurance, but instead have to pay ""my portion"" of the shop's liability insurance, I'm not allowed to sell retail but am to direct them to the owner who will sell them retail, and so on.

 I was supposed to not have to provide anything but my tools and myself, but I've ended up having to buy cases tp and paper towels for the entire shop out of my own pocket, the owner has used 3 full jars of my pomade this week alone(that I paid for out of my pocket) because he's too damn lazy (or stingy) to buy his own, and he makes me come get him to ""check my haircuts"" after I'm done. No, they're not going to be 100% instagram quality because I'm still learning an entire new set of tools that I was made to buy, but they're still good haircuts that nobody would have a problem wearing, and nothing really wrong with them which makes me look like a damn idiot. It's all little stuff like one hair growing on the top of an 80 year old man's earlobes that I didn't cut off or he'll make me stand there and watch him cut and not take clients for a couple of cuts so I'm missing out on money. He's grabbed my tools out of my hands and finished my haircut then took the pay from it because ""he could see I was getting frustrated"" and so forth. Today alone I had 3 customers get up out of my chair and go to his before I even got the cape snapped because he told them that I'm good, but I was new, don't know how to do things his way and he'd be checking my work after I was done. He insists that I pay my booth rent in cash and won't write a reciept for it. After my first week I started giving him a check and he griped about it because I wanted a written record of my expenses. After 3 weeks I'm in right around $950 in expenses and only a little over $600 in services I've been paid for (I've been forced to comp a few services because the shop landlord knows the client in my chair and tells them that I won't be charging them for this service because it's a ""learning experience"" for me, I've had to buy all new tools, all new hair products, and so on.)

So I guess this is what I need advice on: I have 1 regular client that followed me from barber school and a few here and there clients, and this is my first shop. Should I be looking for a new place right now, or stand neck deep in horse shit for a while until I my books are built up then bounce? 

Should I get a business license, visit a CPA, and all of the other legally required stuff like my own insurance without him knowing to cover my own hind end come tax time even though he told me I'm not allowed to?

Do I need to keep paying my ""booth rent"" by check so there's a paper trail? (I put that in quotes because I know that he's illegally treating/classifying me like an employee but making me pay him rent so he avoids any tax responsibility.) Part 2- if he hands me an independent contractor tax form (which is 99% of the time illegal in the hair industry) do I file my taxes as an independent business like I should or file the papers like the shop owner/landlord wants me to? 

Should I start running my own Facebook and instagram campaigns to try to build my books? Also, should I have my own cards printed with my info on them to pass out? (Legally the clients I service are under the individual tenant, not the shop owner/landlord and the shop landlord has zero claim to the shop tenant's client information) 

Any other advice on the matter would be really appreciated.",21Jun2020,1

Family members and friends comment cute innocent stuff on some of the pictures.  Not the same people across profiles though.  She told me her best friends name and  the best friend had some comments on both profiles, including a strangely identical comment (same emojis and large number of exclamation marks) on the same photo uploaded 3 days apart across both profiles.  Best friends profile checks out as legit with pictures of the two dating back several years, no names tagged that I can see though.

My only theory is: she told me her parents were divorced, and I see two much younger kids of different ethnicity in family photos, could one profile be for one side of the family and the other for her step-fathers side?  Maybe she got adopted and took the new name?  Not really a solid explanation though because of the different first names (maybe name B is her middle name and birth fathers name?)

143,"Just graduated from a university program. Made many friends but no close ones. The group I was closest with has group chats where they are all in and they are closer because they lived together for 8 months and I had a one bedroom apartment. The one I‚Äôm closest too in the group is my romantic partner. I think my partner will break up with me and I‚Äôll be pushed further away from the group. 
I don‚Äôt have a back-up ‚Äúgroup.‚Äù

I‚Äôm working remotely for a company so no office acquaintances. I moved somewhere new and my neighbours act like I don‚Äôt fit in with them (openly rude, asking me how it‚Äôs possible I could buy a house in their area, asking me how old I am).

I‚Äôm lonely and I‚Äôm realizing I didn‚Äôt make a lot of strong connections in four years of university and it‚Äôs really hurting.",21Jun2020,3
144,"Heads up this will be a long post.

So I‚Äôm currently 18 and I recently graduated from high school. I had a friend the same age and gender as me.  Let‚Äôs call her X. So we became friends in grade 7, and in grade 10 I became friends with this boy. Let‚Äôs call him Y. So I talked to Y quite often, and X told me that they were close and they used to always talk. One time during our lunch break, X and I sat together when she told me that she thinks Y liked her. And of course I was pretty upset, because she said this right after I told her my feelings for him. Later that night I told her not to lead him on because of her flirtatious nature, and to this day I still regret saying that. I was stupid and didn‚Äôt know any better at the time. So our friendship became pretty rocky from then onwards. I ended up having a relationship with Y, and X and I had a very rocky friendship. I would sometimes talk bad about her to our mutual friends and feel jealous because she would sometimes still ‚Äúflirt‚Äù with Y (apparently, it wasn‚Äôt flirting, it was just her personality). 

Fast forward into grade 11 and our friendship rekindled somehow. I cant remember every detail. We follow each other on social media‚Äôs and often kept each other updated through snapchat. After graduating from high school, I truly thought we rekindled our friendship again. A couple months ago, she stopped sending me these updates and did not say a word. So I stopped too. I‚Äôm wondering what went wrong. Perhaps one of our mutual friends let the things I said about her, slip out, and she now hates me for it. Of course that‚Äôs entirely my fault, and I know it was wrong of me. I‚Äôm the lowest scum and I still hold a lot of guilt and regret for the things I did and said. I don‚Äôt think I explicitly trash talked her badly, but talked more about my feelings of jealousy towards her. I posted some stuff on my social media over the past few weeks and last night but she didn‚Äôt interact with them either, despite me interacting with hers. I feel that she purposely didn‚Äôt interact with them too. I‚Äôm certain she found out what I said, or she just wants to move on. It‚Äôs not like we were best friends, but we did talk sometimes online and at school. 

Confronting her is not an option because It‚Äôs probably unwanted on her part right now and if I‚Äôm overthinking it, then the situation would be even more awkward. I have apologised to her before for some stuff but I now I look back and feel they weren‚Äôt sincere enough, even though I truly meant it. 

So, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I think it‚Äôs best if I moved on. These thoughts of her despising me keep swallowing me up and I feel a lot of regret and guilt. I keep thinking ‚Äúwhat if I could have been a better friend‚Äù. What if I could have changed this outcome. I don‚Äôt know why it bothers me so much, because I‚Äôm sure she probably doesn‚Äôt even think about me anymore. Reddit, how does one move on?

TL;DR: Had a friend and ruined our friendship. Now I‚Äôm trying to move on but I hold a lot of regret and guilt.",21Jun2020,1

149,"Just hoping to get some insight or advice from anyone who‚Äôs moved from one city to another with a partner. What could go wrong and what could go right? I don‚Äôt really have the city pinpointed, but the general plan is that we‚Äôll move to a province with much warmer weather. I‚Äôm just getting anxiety thinking about if this is the right step or not. We‚Äôve been together for 3.5 years and living together for 1. 

Reasons Why I want to move:
1. Biggest reason: I want to live in a Warner climate. Currently,  I live in a very cold city. The winter lasts from September to April. When I say winter, I‚Äôm talking -10 degrees Celsius to -30 Celsius for 8 months, along with heavy snow. The days are also shorter for a significant portion of winter as the sun is only out from 8am-5pm. It‚Äôs hard on my spirit. I hate commuting or going out when it‚Äôs cold. I love fashion but it‚Äôs hard to look good and feel good in heavy sweaters, jackets and boots for so long. Plus I want a dog but I wouldn‚Äôt be ok with walking it in such cold weather.
2. There isn‚Äôt much sight seeing  nearby. The mountains are hours away and there‚Äôs literally no good beaches, both of which are things I wish were closer to me or within an hour drive. Plus the beaches here are very ugly. The cities I‚Äôm considering have both beaches and mountains nearby.
3. The government in my province is very much against healthcare and education, which makes mine and my partner‚Äôs careers unstable and constantly under attack from budget cuts. It very easy to find jobs in our field wherever we go however.
4. We‚Äôll be closer to my Partner‚Äôs family, and we both have some friends in the province we want to move to that we could see.

Reasons Why I don‚Äôt want to move:
1. My family and friend group is in this city. I have trouble making friends so I‚Äôm nervous about moving away. I‚Äôm hoping my mom or siblings would follow but they have their own lives.
2. My partner and I both have stable jobs at places we like so giving that up seems like a waste
3. Financially, the city we want to move to will be more expensive and our money won‚Äôt go as far. We might be renting a more expensive and uglier place compared to now, and buying prospects would be very expensive. We‚Äôre undecided if we want to buy a home in the future or remain renting.

But I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her and then is makes me sad because I know it‚Äôs never gonna happen between us but I can‚Äôt help it.

He‚Äôs now dating this girl, posting pics of her and she followed all his friends on Instagram already.

158,"Long story short, my mother yells at everyone and everything for the tiniest little things. She always argues about thing that aren‚Äôt controllable by anyone, or even when people try to help her. I decided a long time ago that I never ever wanted to be like her. 

Well today I was setting up a guitar, and my dad was there telling me everything to do. And it frustrated me a bit. So I carry on, and my dad was suggesting something, I don‚Äôt even remember what, but I was so frustrated and I yelled at him. I don‚Äôt know why but I was so frustrated. 

So we finish up, and but all the tools and the guitar away.

My dad says he wants to talk to me and tells me something along the lines of ‚Äúif you we‚Äôre working on a job, and you treated someone like that while they were trying to help you to stuff it, and wouldn‚Äôt help you again‚Äù

And he‚Äôs right, I was out of line and I can admit that. He was just trying to help and I started yelling at him.

But I realized how much that was something that my mother would do, and I finished the conversation with him and then left to my room and had a complete breakdown, because being anything like my mother is giving me literal trauma. 

I don‚Äôt want to be like her ever but I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm becoming like her and I don‚Äôt know what to do. All she ever does is yell at people no matter what they do and it doesn‚Äôt matting if you‚Äôre trying to help her or not she yells.

I just did that to someone. He was trying to help me, and all I did was yell at him.

And now I‚Äôm actually breaking down and I can hardly breathe. I don‚Äôt want to be like her at all, and I just did something that she would do. I don‚Äôt want to do that things that she does and be like her.

Now, I'm just going to say that I can't really talk to my family about it, partly b/c they don't really believe me and also how do you bring that up. (The last time I mentioned I had been catcalled my sisters kinda downplayed my story and went back to themselves). 

Anyone, how do you deal with it? I want to speak up but I also feel like it would make the situation worse and that it might escalate.

Everyone who comes over comments on how much my cat obviously loves me (whilst being stand offish with everyone else). He will just sit on the arm of my chair staring at me and purring. I love him so much. However he has moments of aggression but that has been manageable and rare. 

After 6 years of owning the car I have since got married and we got a puppy about 12 months ago. My cat can not be in the same room as the dog (dachshund) as he goes feral and tries to kill the dog. He latches on in a viscious attack and won't stop until I peel him off the dog. So we have always kept them seperate which has been a logistical nightmare.

We have now had a baby and are moving into a new house. The layout of the new house is such that we can't keep the animals separate bar locking them in the shed at different times. 

The cat being the aggressor makes the most sense to rehome but he hates people and is sometimes aggressive so who would take him. Im sure no one will be able to love him as much as I do. Whereas the dog is a highly sought after breed and will love anyone so would be much easier to rehome.

182,"Hello, fellow users of Reddit, I was wondering if you could help me with a little issue.

I¬¥m now a 21 years old student who is studying the last year of college during virtual classes, on my bachelor's degree for Human Resources. The classes are okay, (I usually pay attention at class) and not too difficult to me to comprehend, but sometimes we are overloaded with homework or projects. I also work part-time in a volunteering group who now focuses in video calls and volunteering activities using Zoom Video Communications. I lead a group of Environment activities, but since we aren¬¥t allowed yet to reunite outside to get planting trees or picking up trash, my area of effect is limited...

Although my family is eating well in this quarantine, I am a little worried that we run out of subsidies given to us from the government, and end without food. I see several classmates and friends who study and work full time ... And it makes me want to try something similar with freelancing or a call center company, but I don¬¥t want to stress out myself to quickly.

The dilemma is whether to quit my job as an environmental volunteer manager to work and earn extra money, or to continue studying and volunteering more comfortably. Right now, my family only receives government subsidies to subsist, and we keep eating relatively well during this season. I can entertain myself writing, using Twitter and Reddit, playing video games and reading books, and spending time with my friends online (whenever is during a volunteering activity or just chatting). Still, a little part of me thinks that I *should* be making money in this quarantine, at least to be able to buy sweets to celebrate, and being able to pay my tuition every semester (which it is not that expensive, only a mere $ 12 for six months). And I still want to help people, even if sometimes it gets hard to communicate with them due to my fear of being rejected‚Ä¶

She was very upset when we talked about it and I think she still misses him a lot. Her parents haven't let her really grieve or done anything like a grave or something so I thought it would help her feel better if I set up a very small informal thing, just the two of us. 

The plan is to take her to a lake, and bring some paper and candles and a special lighter that the two of us have made 'ours' with other important celebrations. I would make a few paper boats with her, set some tea lights in them, and let them out on the lake with her. Is this a risky idea? I would like to give her some time to mourn him properly, especially since quarantine has been hard for her. Do you think this might just make her upset?",21Jun2020,4
188,"I (20f) live with my bf (20m) since I was kicked out the day after high school graduation. He has finished his first year of college, and I took two years off to work and support him as we get no help from his parents either except for a place to live. I‚Äôve been his driver, the one responsible food and groceries, and I pay small rent and also most things we buy so that his money can focus on school. This year I‚Äôm going to school to become an LPN, which is only a year, but for me to do that my money and time can no longer be solely focused on him. So the problem is, we‚Äôd really like to move out and not share a house with a lot of other...very strange people. We found an affordable place very close to all the things we need to get to. We can afford it, BUT, he would have no way to get to school on his own. Here‚Äôs the choices - 

Option 1, we stay at his house for another year, which would save money for sure. I go through school, he sees if his parents could drive him to his school until he gets a car and license, which would also be affordable in this situation. 

Option 2, we move out and he takes a gap year. He‚Äôs said he likes the sound of a year off where he could focus on himself and hopefully get a job, which would mean we would have a lot of spare money (all his savings and all he makes) to definitely live comfy and get him a car and license while I‚Äôm going through school. Cons, his friends move ahead of him in school but he only really has one that he hangs with and they don‚Äôt have the same classes anyway. I also really want him to stay in school, but at the same time I‚Äôve taken two years off to support him, maybe he could take one year off now?

It‚Äôs very important that I go to school this year, after I graduate I‚Äôll be making a lot more than I am now, so that‚Äôs the priority. We‚Äôve always talked about moving out, our living situation is pretty bad right now...dirty, crowded, depressing. But should we stay there and try to handle the stress of that as well as both of us going to school, or would a year off for him not be terrible? To clarify, we can afford this place now just with or savings, the main problem is just him getting to school which I can‚Äôt be on the hook for anymore, also if we had all his savings to buy furniture and his income to save for next school year and a car, we could be pretty well set. 

What should we do? We don‚Äôt want to live where we are anymore and we can afford a nice, central place to ourselves, but is it more worth it to try and stick it out one more year with his parents?",21Jun2020,1

In February, I moved into my first apartment (I‚Äôm 18). It‚Äôs not so great but it‚Äôs cheap and has plenty of space for my cat and I. When I was signing the lease papers (I have a private landlord) I noticed a bunch of junk in the ground floor apartment so I asked if he happened to live there. He denied it and said he has many places he stays. He has out of state tags (probably a 30 minute drive from where my apartment is located). So far, since I‚Äôve moved in there has barely been a night he isn‚Äôt here. He‚Äôs not even cleaning out the first floor apartment. It‚Äôs full of junk and garbage. He‚Äôs always in my business and I don‚Äôt like that. I feel like a kid sneaking in and out trying to avoid him so he doesn‚Äôt talk to me

What should I do? Can I break my lease?

191,"I've always been kind of a ""jealous"" girlfriend and I understand that that isn't the best situation to be in but sometimes I can't help it. My fiance and I have been together for 8 years now and there is one girl who he is friends with that I can't help but be super jealous of. They always make plans together that to me, sound more like a date than a friend day (ex. going to her house to watch Christmas movies and make supper together). I think this bothers me so much because he has never went out of his way to introduce us to each other. His excuse is that she only speaks French and I only speak English. I just can't help but feel like there is a reason that he's avoiding the introduction. He has the perfect opportunity to introduce us to each other this week since they are meeting up with another one of his friends (also a girl) to eat food in the car and ""catch up"". He says that this isn't a good time because it's an ""intimate"" meeting of friends who used to work together. I've told him before that the only reason I am so jealous of her is because I've never even met her. This same girl has also been the cause of quite a few of our arguments because of how they make plans together and he doesn't even tell me about them. It's like he's sneaking to meet her behind my back. Am I overreacting and crazy about feeling this way?",21Jun2020,2

197,"My story is as cliche as it gets. I was the smartest kid in school, my Asian parents were obviously expecting me to do medicine. And I was never given any other goal or direction in life so I did exactly that. Got admitted into the top medical college in the country. But when you get to the top, you realize you‚Äôre not as smart as you think you are.

Flunked my second semester, and barely scraped through the rest. And now I‚Äôm here at the final. But with each fight, it‚Äôs like I just got so much more depressed, and resentful, and the fear of failure has become crippling at this point. I avoided going to classes and stopped giving tests, couldn‚Äôt open my books without crying. Then last year, I severely broke down and had to get therapy and medication. And so I ended up I having to give my final exam this year (tomorrow). And how‚Äôs come to a point where just thinking about going to college again or trying to study gives me anxiety. I feel alone and depressed and scared.

I‚Äôd considered dropping college so many times. Every year. But my family (parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents) have invested $60k at this point. And the thing is I know I‚Äôm not incapable of doing this. Besides my one semester, I did clear each exam and I was definitely not the worst student. But I just don‚Äôt feel like I want to continue anymore. Maybe it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm lazy. I had all the time in the world for this exam and I did nothing. But I swear I was never like this.

209,"Hi Reddit,

**I'm going to begin with some background info:** I just got home from work. I am a part-time retail salesperson and obviously, during COVID-19, it's been rough. Though today turned out to mostly be regular, mind you regular includes taking shit from customers and still giving service with a smile, today? Today was the last straw.

I've had a bit of a history with this person since first starting work here over a year ago. She's gotten complaints from me and my other coworkers about her behavior before and it really only ends up with a slap on the wrist for her every time. Supposedly she's been working there for 6 years...

There were three people involved in this ""final straw"" incident. There was my Assistant Manager, let's call her Karen, and another ""Leader,"" like a senior salesperson with some extra responsibilities, let's call him Jack, and then there was me. Just after closing time at 7 PM tonight is when it happened. We were over at the cash registers; I was the closing cashier person, Jack was the floor salesperson, and Karen was the Manager on Duty that also mostly walks the floor. The only cameras in the store look over the registers that are next to the entrance, and luckily this interaction was caught on tape though I have no idea if HR or anyone would really be able to look back on them if I were to report this incident.

I checked out the final customers, Jack was seeing them out the door, and Karen was next to me since closing Manager on Duty roles are to take the money out of the registers at the front to take to the back room, count it up, and put some in/out of the safe in the back room. Jack closes the door and then Karen rips off her mask and says, ""Whoo, I'm free, I can breathe!"" Immediately, I'm feeling uncomfortable because keep in mind, COVID-19 is still running rampant in my country and its leader(s) haven't done much to prevent it or give any guidelines, though luckily city (and now state) ordinance makes it so that masks are a requirement. She could potentially have COVID-19 and be asymptomatic since we've been having to work with the general public. Then again, I could also be... I don't really say anything as I'm pretty much done with her and have somehow managed to stay on her good side (I think), I just play along. Jack also kinda plays along though obviously I have no idea what's going on in his head.

**Here's the part I'm going to actually ask advice about:** What Karen does next is what made me feel like my life could potentially be in danger. She's standing 2-3 feet away from me and ""playfully"" blows her breath several times in my face with her mask off, all while Jack witnesses the whole thing. Not trying to break any ""amicable feelings"" we may have for each other, though to be truthful I fucking hate the bitch, I keep playing along and just go ""Nooo!"" and slightly cringe.

Jack has to leave since his shift ends at store closing time, and Karen and I have to stay for 30 more minutes to make sure everything closes smoothly. Nothing else happens from here, I just somehow do things normally while internally having a giant meltdown, then it comes time for us to leave and I head home to post here for advice.

**Here's what I ask of you:** What do I do? I feel like my life is potentially in danger even though I'm nearing 21 and am not in the demographic of people highly sensitive to the disease. I mean there still have been people my age dying from it. I really don't feel safe around Karen anymore. I don't want to have COVID-19 and spread it... I did text the Manager to ask for the Human Resources contact, which she provided, but is this really something I should take up with them? I'm a (Pre-COVID-19 commuting) part-time university student that lives with my mom, so there's no way I could lawyer up and kick her ass if there is any legal action to take. I have to go back into work tomorrow and face Karen again. Tomorrow's Father's Day in this country and I was planning on visiting my dad while wearing a mask and keeping my distance, but he is part of the vulnerable population. Things have been really shitty because lately, things have really been hard on him with the divorce my parents are trying to go through. I wanted to at least see him for myself and make sure he's okay. Now I can't. To be honest, there have been a lot of things going on in my personal life lately, too. Anyway, that's beside the point of this post. You lovely Redditors really keep me going and I'd really appreciate any and all advice from you all. :) Please please please, stay safe!

218,"Hi there! So, I've been thinking about this for quite a while and I've noticed that the way that I react towards certain things differ quite a lot from other people. For example, lets say somebody died and everybody would be giving sympathy and feeling empathetic towards the loved ones of the individual who died -- I don't feel that.  My instant reaction is ""its just another human life, people die everyday.""  and I generally feel nothing. Or if a friend is going through a tragic event, I'm able to help them because I'm their friend, but I don't feel much for their situation. Or if I hurt someone's feelings, I struggle to feel guilt for that.   
I wouldn't consider myself careless, I still CARE about my friends and family, I wouldn't want to lose them, of course.

224,"For extra context I am currently 16 and live with my mother; my sister is in her 20s and is about to move far away from where we live currently and is concerned for my saftey.  

My sister recently told me that she KNEW my mother was doing meth and talked about me moving in with my dad, she brought up this topic in the first place because we bumped into eachother on an animal crossing trading subreddit and she looked at my post history. One of these posts was made 7 months ago where I vented about not being happy living with my mom- I don't have the best mental health and at the time I was mainly using that account for private posts so I didnt use a throw away. 

The truth is, yes, I am not happy living with my mother we get into fights constantly and just generally don't see eye to eye most of the time, whenever we get into arguments she purposely dead names and misgenders me (I identify as male but was born female) which is generally a slap in the face considering she acknowledges how I identify and atleast tries most of the time; only to maliciously deadname me or uses my current name in a mocking tone to get a reaction out of me.
 However, at my moms house I get to be alone most of the time since it is only me and her here, I get my own room and plenty of space to myself; something I don't get at my dad's. This sounds like a stupid reason but I value this time to myself and I'm not necessarily happy living with my dad ethier as he really doesn't acknowledge my identity in the slightest. Also I am 16 and am saving up money to move out on my own when I am 18.

Now; the problem I had with my sister's accusation is she said she ""knew"". Yet had no evidence to support this claim other than my mom was at a guy's house who she knew did meth. This guy is also mom's tattoo artist. The reason why I was so inclined to believe this at first is because my mom often borrows money from me; which a lot of it she has yet to pay back despite promiseing she would, the amount of money she has borrowed from me was up in the 200-300 dollar range, a large chunk of that being money I saved up for my cat's vet visit but she unfortunately died before we could get her to one. Whenever I brought this up to my mom she basically said what I stated previously, he happened to be her tattoo artist and theres really no evidence other than my sister saw her at his house.

I understand my sister is concerned for my saftey but honestly all this situation has done to me is caused fusteration and stress; I don't know how to handle this at all.

TL;DR: sister made meth accusations against my mom, which I initially believed due to the amount of times she's ""borrowed"" money from me, however upon closer inspection theres no evidence to back up these claims.",21Jun2020,1

229,"TL;DR My IRL friend got ahold of pictures of my female friend who I met online (yes she is real) and now he is spreading these pictures around and I don't know what, if anything, I should do about it.

So, I made a group of friends online and I am in a Discord server with them. Many of us uploaded some pictures of ourselves. One of these people was my friend who is female who I met in an online game. She and I have become pretty close friends, we talk almost every day. Anyway, after a while, a few of my IRL friends joined this server. At the time they were talking behind my back in another chat that I was not apart of; they were complaining about how I ""only"" play with my other friends and of course they called me a simp because of my female friend. They posted pictures of her in this chat. Okay, if they want to be perverts, I don't care. They had easy access to those photos, and there wasn't much that could have been done.

Anyway, the whole thing about them talking about me behind my back is something of the past and that chat has been deleted to my knowledge. But now, one of my friend who is also my neighbor has showed those pictures of my female friend to a group of neighborhood kids, including a 9-year-old kid who I'm pretty sure mental issues. I'm not gonna confront the guy who showed the pics, but I am considering making my female friend aware of this and just tell her to stay away from the guy who shared the pictures for the sake of her privacy and to delete the pictures to make it less likely that he has access to them unless he has them saved, which would be pretty gross.

Bottom line, I want to know what people think about me telling my friend to stay away from the person who shared the pics and to delete them. Otherwise I would just keep her in the dark, but I feel like she should know what is happening with her own pictures.",21Jun2020,2

Yes, very first world problem, I am so sure this is a place of insecurity but I also want to vent/ask for advice.

My boyfriend (23m) and I (23f) have been together for 2 years everything is great. I know his family and he knows mine, we hang out super regularly and rarely have huge fights 

The problem is that he won‚Äôt post me on social media. When we met he had a Facebook and instagram. We didn‚Äôt add each other on Facebook but i saw he posted several pictures of his ex. He deleted his Facebook after about a year of us dating. He had an Instagram and we had each other on it and he would post about me maybe for the first year but it all stopped and the first argument we got into, he blocked me and deleted his account. 

He is only left with Snapchat. He will post a lot of stuff like his hobbies and random stuff but will never post me. 

I know I‚Äôm being insecure but it‚Äôs a shitty feeling- it feels like he is embarrassed of me.

I‚Äôve confronted him and told him it makes me feel insecure but he would tell me I‚Äôm over reacting and that he just doesn‚Äôt like posting his personal life. But he had no problem keeping pictures of his ex up for months after they  broke up and at some point he posted me.

Any advice on how to deal with this mega first world problem would he appreciated.",21Jun2020,1
236,"TW for eating disorders and just saying I‚Äôm using a throwaway that I used for other stuff

I (21F) started vaping like two years ago, but it was only socially and I genuinely wasnt even a little addicted. I‚Äôd hit it with friends and then put it down for months at a time and forget i even had it. Then last December I started using it heavily to cut my appetite due to anorexia. I‚Äôve since cut from 50 mg juice to 30 mg, but I‚Äôve definitely gotten super hooked on nicotine. It‚Äôs hard to go a couple hours without it and I get anxiety if I leave it behind.

I‚Äôm moving into an apartment where I can‚Äôt smoke in mid August and I really desperately want to quit. I also notice it‚Äôs effects on my health. I just don‚Äôt know how to deal with the withdrawls, and I really use it as a crutch for my eating disorder and anxiety. If I‚Äôm being honest I‚Äôm not super interested in fixing my eating right now because I‚Äôd rather focus on one thing at a time and quit nic first.

Thanks in advance! I hope this is an okay post for this sub :)",21Jun2020,1
237,"For some reason, I struggle with guilt more than the average person. If I do something wrong, I will literally not stop thinking about it for days - months, even. I won't go into detail about specific situations but I can assure you they are SO minor. If it involves another person, it's something that person would be over in less than a day.

I do struggle with anxiety and some seasonal depression (covid made things a little worse), but the guilt is what's really making me struggle.

How do people deal with this feeling? Are their coping mechanisms for it?

Note: I do see a psychologist and I have an appointment with her in just a few days. I plan on talking about this, in case that's anyone's suggestion :)",21Jun2020,1
238,"
I struggle with this so much because I don‚Äôt know what else I can do to make myself attractive. I‚Äôve lost over 80 pounds, I‚Äôve bought a car, I have nice clothes, I‚Äôm good socially, I‚Äôve done everything I can to make myself better but I‚Äôm just not good enough. I just want to say that I honestly don‚Äôt hate my personality, it‚Äôs the only part about myself I don‚Äôt hate. I‚Äôm good at being social and I can read a room, so I‚Äôm never really clingy and I‚Äôm really good at being able to read people. Regardless, I‚Äôm ugly and I‚Äôm not sure I understand how I can make myself good enough.

I pay for tinder gold but I haven‚Äôt even gotten a swipe right in over two months, I‚Äôm considering paying for bumble and hinge so I can stand a better chance. It just feels like I‚Äôm too ugly for anyone to love me, my mom and sister told me a few months ago that I‚Äôm a 2/10 and I believe it. I don‚Äôt even care if they care about making me happy, it doesn‚Äôt have to be equal at this point. I‚Äôm okay with doing whatever it takes to make a girl happy if I just had the chance to make her happy, to have a real impact on someone. I know that getting uppity and expecting to find someone that‚Äôll expect me to be their equal is kind of unrealistic at this point, it‚Äôs really not even something I‚Äôm worried about at this point to be honest. Like I said, the opportunity to make someone else happy would make me happier than I know how to describe.

Nobody loves me as it is. Nobody cares if I kill myself or wake up tomorrow, so anything is a move in the right direction. As it is I don‚Äôt want to live like this anymore. I feel like I can‚Äôt endure this to even 22, let alone a lifetime of sadness and isolation. I can‚Äôt find happiness alone, I‚Äôm just not that type of person. By myself I‚Äôm easily disposable, extremely worthless. But I feel like if I had a girl I could make happy I wouldn‚Äôt be so disposable or worthless, it doesn‚Äôt have to be story book or Disney like. As long as I get to make another person happy forever I‚Äôd be so content with my life :). 

I just can‚Äôt be alone anymore, I hate myself. I have a therapist and as wonderful and great as she is I‚Äôm just not capable of being fixed by myself. I hate myself, and being by myself just makes me realize how okay I am with dying. I can‚Äôt even look in mirrors anymore because I‚Äôm so disgustingly ugly that it ruins my day to see the utter disgrace I look like. I don‚Äôt even blame women for not wanting me, any positive trait I feel like I have can be found on guys who are much better than me that are a swipe away on tinder.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I feel like I‚Äôm not going to be able to be strong enough to last another 6 months to a year alone. I‚Äôm so tired of being alive in a world where I don‚Äôt matter to anyone. I just feel like it would be better for everyone if I just didn‚Äôt exist anymore. I wouldn‚Äôt have to be the ugly guy bothering girls anymore, I wouldn‚Äôt have to make anyone uncomfortable to look at, I wouldn‚Äôt have to leave a carbon footprint, and I wouldn‚Äôt have to pay off my student loans! 

All in all it just feels like I‚Äôm a burden, I can‚Äôt think of anyone who cares if I‚Äôm alive or not. At this point it feels like I have a much more negative impact on the world by being alive than not. I can‚Äôt even remember the last time I had a hug or someone told me I mattered (because I don‚Äôt). I don‚Äôt mean to sound like an incel, because to be honest I don‚Äôt hate anyone. I just wish I had been born better so that I could share the love I feel for everyone else. Instead I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm just going to give myself carbon monoxide poisoning in the next couple of months so I don‚Äôt have to worry about being the ugly/creepy loser ever again.

If you guys have any advice for me please let me know, it‚Äôs all greatly appreciated. Thanks",21Jun2020,2
240,"All right, so i'm 22 and still live with my mom. But i'm also a man and have needs. 

I met this girl online, we've had a couple dates and things are progressing pretty fast. Now She's hinting that she wants to come over to my place, that she wants to go all the way. The problem is, the fact i live with my mom. I have 2 younger siblings living here, they're constantly here, my door doesn't lock and they barge in constantly, so there's no privacy. I haven't told her any of this, i keep coming up with cover stories, like i'm busy plus she thinks i live alone. I tried turning it around and taking me to her house, but she won't let me come over because she has a kid and a nosy roommate. 

There is nowhere we can go to sleep together. I've asked my friends if i could use their place but they keep saying No. I feel i need to go ahead and seal the deal on this before she loses interest.

I don't know what to do.",21Jun2020,1
241,"Wasnt sure where to post this but hopefully this is ok. I'll try to make this short as possible:

So I'm 24, when I was 18 I had my first girlfriend ever. We were together a little over a year until I dumped her. Ever since then, on and off she has continuted to be a part of my life still one way or another. She's been harassing me online, making false accusations that could potentionally get me and trouble and even trying to turn people against me.
For the last 3 years shes had a boyfriend, and for some reason hes on board with it too and harasses me too and I have no clue why!

Minor backstory: so I hitchhike and ride trains, these two do the same. My friends tell me where they are sometimes and its not random that theyre atleast in the same state as me!!! I feel like I'm always evading them. Every once in awhile I'll run into them and I'll try to talk to them. They ignore me and get someone to try shoo me off and continue to talk shit about me online.
So for awhile now ive just been totally ignoring them, acting like they don't exist. A few internet comments is something I don't care about anymore. I swear I've forgotten about them even!! Until a week ago. I was waiting on this date with a girl in MY hometown. All of a sudden I see them. I wasnt too surprised and to be honest I was pretty drunk. So I just chuckled and said ""hi"" because I wasnt sure what to do. They talked amongst themselves and then left.
15 minutes later her boyfriend comes back to me looking high as fuck and starts yelling at me and pushing me. I was so confused. He kept trying to get me to fight him but I didnt want to. I was confused and not angry. He pulled my hair twice but tbh I was so drunk I barely even felt it. He did alot of dumb shit but never actually hit me so I didnt need to defend myself I feel. I just kept saying WHAT DO YOU MEAN the entire time haha.

Afterwards I thought it was really funny! But the next day when I sobered up I was really really angry about it, and felt so disrespected. For a week now i can't stop thinking about it.

Like, when will any of this end? I dont even know what to do. Now that I'm trying to settle down where I am and they're not leaving where I am, threatening me and such, I dont know what to do. Of course I'll always stand my ground but i can't take it anymore it's driving me crazy. I would never call the cops on anyone to be honest so I've been thinking of alternatives to this. I'm just at a loss here.",21Jun2020,1

249,Basically I went to a small retail store interview today. It was 5 minutes max but he was also working the register. He told me that I was basically hired and that he would call me on Wednesday to come in and get started because he needed to get the paperwork to the main manager. Is he just trying to brush me off or is he serious about hiring me. My boyfriend told me he was trying to let me down slowly.,21Jun2020,1
250,"I (22M) recently started working at a fast food restaurant because my previous retail job closed because of COVID and I had heard nothing about them reopening. The thing is, my new job is quickly turning into a toxic work environment. 
They don‚Äôt give any breaks unless you‚Äôre a minor. It‚Äôs technically in the labor laws of my state that employers don‚Äôt have to give adults breaks, so I‚Äôm still working 8+ hour shifts and I can‚Äôt get five minutes to get a drink of water or use the bathroom, let alone any meal breaks or anything. 
Literally nobody‚Äôs willing to help anybody else out at their station when able to. Whenever I work at the second drive thru window (the one that hands out food and drinks), I have to somehow keep things stocked while passing things out and keeping drive thru times under three minutes. It‚Äôs rare that somebody floating is willing to get ice for me, or whatever else. And then I get in trouble for going to get things I literally need in order to do my job. 
When I‚Äôm taking orders in drive-thru, I get yelled at for not rushing the customers along (the drive-thru timer starts when they start ordering). I get yelled at if the customer has a big order and takes a while to order. I got yelled at because I was just handed a pre-order and I didn‚Äôt know how to put it in because no one ever showed me. 
When I‚Äôm taking payment in drive-thru, I get yelled at if the customer is searching for change. They yell at me to send them up to the first window, then yell at me for not telling them that I‚Äôm sending the customer up. They never showed me how to do gift cards. Or how to swipe the 
loyalty cards. Managers have to check any bill over $50, and if a manager takes too long to come check it, I get yelled at. Then, whenever I need a cash pull or more change, I have to keep waiting because the manager can‚Äôt be bothered to bring me change or do a cash pull until the register literally doesn‚Äôt let me do anymore transactions. 
The trainers don‚Äôt do the job they‚Äôre paid to do half the time. Instead, they just shove new people by the register and tell them to watch me doing my job, even though I barely know what I‚Äôm doing. 
I get to work early every day, as is expected to me. Yet I regularly have to stay 15 minutes to an hour after my shift ends. And it‚Äôs always because the people who are supposed to replace me are either late or the manager tells them to do something else, so I‚Äôm stuck there and I can never get a straight answer as to when they‚Äôre going to replace me. 
I leave every day extremely stressed out. Not to mention the whole fast food environment is wrecking havoc on my skin, causing me to break out like crazy. 
All this for a dollar above minimum wage. 
Now, I‚Äôm currently living at home with my mom, and I contribute to bills and I pay my own phone bill and for a $10/month gym membership, along with paying for streaming accounts the whole family uses. It‚Äôs maybe $100 a month. So I don‚Äôt have a ton of expenses. I also have money saved up from my old job and my stimulus check. The main reason I even applied for this job was because I want to start saving up for a car, but seeing as COVID got everyone staying at home, that can wait. I also started applying to other jobs, and I reached out to my old job to see when they‚Äôre going to reopen, and to a place I was supposed to interview for in March before everything closed. 
My job is ‚Äúat-will‚Äù employment, so I‚Äôm not contractually obligated to stay for a certain amount of time. 
Should I quit? Or should I stick it out a bit longer? 

TL;DR: I took a job at a fast food place and it‚Äôs a toxic environment where I get yelled at for things beyond my control, and never get to leave on time, and it‚Äôs stressing me out a lot. I don‚Äôt have a lot of bills and I have a good chunk of money saved up. Should I quit?",21Jun2020,1

And when I turned 18 I decided to take my mental health into my own hands and I finally felt like I had a bright future. And I didn't smoke to the point where I was ""high"" it was to regulate myself, focus on the present instead of obsessive suicidal thoughts. I had trouble eating and it increased my appetite.

Well long story short I got caught smoking in my room and, I admit, it was dumb to do it in the house but it wasn't my first time so I figured they wouldn't be able to smell it. But now, I am staying at my aunts and I am worried for my future. I can't leech off of her forever so I need a job- which will be hard during covid.

I had a really bright future ahead of me- and the me that smokes weed accomplished all of that. I found my first job after smoking, I wrote a beautiful college essay after smoking, I got into a great college- it's scholars program at that while smoking, I am a hard worker and it feels like I have to start all over again because of this once incident.

I am not sure what I want to hear right now, but anyone's input would be grateful. My mother said some extremely hurtful things(basically said she wished I was dead) and I just want to make sure that I don't deserve to die after this incident. I have no idea where to go from here.

256,"We have been together for 10 months and recently i found out that he had cheated on me for the last couple of months. He was paying for girls premium snapchats and facetiming and paying girls for phone sex. He has been begging for me back ever since and he‚Äôs been trying really hard to get me back. Hes been telling me that he‚Äôs changed but I am still contemplating on taking him back. We‚Äôve been going through these problems for about the last couple of weeks. it‚Äôs been rough. 

So we‚Äôve talked about him hearing a voice before about a month or two ago and i tried so hard to get him help but he‚Äôs so stubborn. He always said that if he got help he didn‚Äôt want to be put on medication and if he talked to someone about it out loud, that it made him sound so crazy. So I never completely dropped it but i sort of let it go because he said it worsened whenever we talked about it. 

After i found out he was cheating it was really bad for us. It really caught me off guard and i didn‚Äôt know what to do but we kept talking, but not nearly as much as we used to. We‚Äôve hung out a few times and have been talking about what we‚Äôre going to do but it‚Äôs been a struggle, which we knew would be. But he‚Äôs very willing to change in a lot of ways for this relationship to work. 

Today he was begging for me back again as usual and then randomly he told me that the voice he‚Äôs hearing is getting worse. He told me he had an appointment with his doctor and got referred to a therapist and he‚Äôs been trying to make an appointment since. He said that the voice is getting way worse than it‚Äôs ever been and it‚Äôs been really evil.

It‚Äôs been like this since we moved in, over a year ago and I have addressed it but this time I cracked and was so upset. My roommate started crying. I feel so bad for making her sad as I know she isn‚Äôt happy with it either and is embarrassed - but I can‚Äôt live like this.

What can I do to help with the situation so that we can all live a much happier life? 

Thanks so much!",21Jun2020,1
261,"



I work in a resturaunt, we were all getting drunk and playing drinking games, at some point we were playing never have i ever, i was trashed at this point, the questions started getting sexual,( i didnt ask any of them but i did put my fingers down for the ones i had done), they were questions like ""never have i ever been spanked and liked it"" ""never ever have i had sex in public""

Anyway i put my fingers down trying to be discreet, and some one called me out and was like damn, youre a freak!! i felt embarrassed, and everyone stared at me. i think its because i dont look like someone who is into that kinda stuff but i feel weird about people knowing that stuff about me, it was a big group and idk why im the only one that was called out, his girlfriend was also next to him and she seemed annoyed by his comment. I also poured the same dude tequilla earlier in the night when i did mine and was waiting for him to tell me to stop and it was a Huge cup but he split it, so we were laughing and his girlfriend also looked annoyed when he was telling the story, but i was just waiting for him to tell me to stop pouring the shot

I work monday and i feel really awkward now, am i over thinking this?",21Jun2020,1
262,"I've always been someone to be very happy/be the life of the party around my friends. I normally don't let people in or speak my mind about my feelings because I don't think people really care most of the time. But I've always been the ""one call away"" friend and honestly I never minded. I knew having most of my relationships be one sided would eventually give out. 

On April 1st my dad passed away from a heart attack. He was 77. My parents were never married but I was extremely close to my father so it hit me very hard. What was worse was that I currently was quarantining at a house away from home because of college. My mom was positive and bed-ridden for corona and family really couldn't come together to grieve. Also, my step-father had already been in the hospital for corona so I didn't want to burden my mom even more. All I had for weeks was myself. Trapped in a room. Occasional FaceTimes from people checking in. But all I had was me. And every time someone would call I would always tell them I was okay cause I didn't want to worry them. I eventually found comfort in a guy I had met about a week before through a mutual friend who told me that his dad had also passed. Let's call him Abel. Abel was someone who I met by chance one day that my friend wanted to get food. We hit it off as soon as we met and as soon as my friend dropped him home, my friend told me that Abel lived with his ex-girlfriend and also was in love with some other girl. AKA very very complicated. I immediately knew I wasn't going to get involved and if we would ever get close it would just be as friends. 

The day my dad died I had told Abel over snapchat and he immediately sent me his number so I could text him because he knew what I was going through. I was hesitant at first because I didn't know him but the following day I decided to shoot him a text. This text turned into a 4 hour FaceTime call at 3am, with the both of us drinking and singing. It felt like I had known him forever and also, I was happy? Being that I couldn't be with anyone I found talking to him to be some sort of release. For the next following days we continued to do the same thing -- FaceTime, drink, talk, get to know each other. I heard about his dad he heard about mine. It was everything I needed. 

I went back to our mutual friend and told him that maybe I was starting to Abel more than a friend. He warned me that his situation was extremely messy because he lives with his ex-girlfriend and he hasn't moved out yet because he doesn't have anywhere else to go. I asked him about the other girl he had fallen in love with and he told me that they were fuck buddies after him and his ex-girlfriend broke up but that it never worked out because of the fact that Abel still lives with ex. Also, him and his ex still have sex and this was a huge red flag for me. 

After about 2 weeks of FaceTiming we got food and hung out at my place. He was so friendly and open with my housemates and such a good conversationalist. But of course, the night ended when he had to go home because he cooked dinner for his ex. At this moment in time I tried to tell myself over and over again that I could only have him as a friend but who was I kidding? Side note: I'm someone who barely has sex (by choice) and it's very hard for me to let any guy near me. Just due to bad experiences so the fact that I was already so close to this guy I felt like maybe it was a sign?

Now one of the things me and this guy had in common was that we liked to do molly. I personally have only done it at raves but he had mentioned doing it at home since it's a different experience. So one day after work we did molly together and it was the best night of my life. We were just listening to music, dancing around my room, watching videos. Everything was so innocent. There was even an embarrassing moment where I threw up and he took care of me. It was genuinely two friends just hanging out and it was great. 

I knew we weren't going to have sex that night because I had told myself we weren't going to. Sex has always been a painful experience for me and also I knew once we had sex I would be tied to him emotionally. The following day we laid in bed all day naked, again nothing happened, we just got drunk and listened to music. No touching of any kind occurred, which in these days when do you ever hear of that??? He went home that night and the next day he got COVID so I actually didn't talk to him for 3 weeks or so. After he tested negative for COVID he came over my house one night just to talk. I had missed him so much so I was all over him and hugging him. Eventually leading to cuddling on my bed. We were nibbling each others noses until we kissed and then one thing lead to another. I had a trip planned to miami in 2 days and something about the moment it just felt right. We had sex. He knew sex was painful for me and I've never really had a pleasurable experience so he talked me through it and was a gentleman about everything. He slept over and the next day he wanted to see me again before I left and we ended up having sex again.

I left for Miami and the whole time I was away as much as I was having fun I was in my head about what I was doing. I decided that I couldn't continue this because I was going to get even more hurt if I let it go on. The day I came back to NY I cut it off and we haven't spoken since (so about 2 weeks now). It was already hard not talking to him but I knew it was the right decision. Then about 2 days ago I tell our mutual friend (who btw is a great friend of mine) that my boobs were hurting and I wanted to go to the doctors cause that never happened when I got my period. Then he asked if I had taken a pregnancy test and in that moment I had never even thought about it. I went to go take the test and it came out positive. I went to the doctors but the appointments were booked for the day so I'm waiting to go Monday. 

With everything that has occurred in the past 3 months alone -- my dad passing, my mom with covid, living alone, finishing undergrad and graduating even though I was in no way mentally stable, and then allowing a guy to enter my life. It's just been too much and I want to deal with this the healthiest way possible. I don't cry, I don't feel anything. Every blow life hits me with just feels like ""okay another thing"". I am not planning on telling him because it will just make it worse for me. (But conflicted cause morally it feels like I should tell him). I feel like I'm going to reach my breaking point. 

TL;DR -- Dad passed away 3 months ago and since then my mom has had COVID, along with my stepdad who was hospitalized for a month. I lived away from home so when everything occurred I could not be with family. During quarantine I met a guy who helped me deal with my dads passing and I eventually grew feelings for him. He lives with ex-girlfriend. We had sex twice and I got pregnant. Conflicted about what to do, and more importantly how to stay sane.",21Jun2020,2

268,"so quite a few months ago i hit an all time low in my life, i was really unhappy where i was as i had just moved across the world and hated my new life in the new country. 
about 3 months after i first left, i pushed away arguably my best friend from back home. i gradually cut him off. when he texted me asking me what was going on and why i was being so cold to him, i replied a paragraph full of bullshit evading any actual explanation as to why i was actually pushing him away. 

we stopped talking completely then, and last night, 5 months after we stopped talking, i am visiting back home (where i used to live) and we were both invited to a birthday party of a friend we are both close to. we both went, and didn‚Äôt engage for the whole night - there was no drama or anything it‚Äôs just we didn‚Äôt talk at all. 
it was the first time that i remembered the entire situation with him since it happened, and has just hit me like a truck until i had the epiphany that in reality, i pushed everyone away from me - not just him. 

i don‚Äôt know why i‚Äôm pushing everyone away. i don‚Äôt know why i pushed him away and i don‚Äôt know what to do about it. i gave him no real reason as to why i cut him out like that, because i didn‚Äôt know myself. i still don‚Äôt really know why i did, but i did realise that i have since been cutting off almost everyone from my life and feel so alone. he naturally is really angry and hates me and everything i did to him by cutting him off just like that and i feel crap now knowing he never got a reason. 

i want to try fix the situation or just simply understand why i did what i did because i feel like i owe him at the very least an explanation. but, at the same time i don‚Äôt want to just waltz back into his life and explain it 5 months later and expect anything to come out of it when he has every right to hate me. 

why did i push him away? do i talk to him about it, or should i just stay out of his life now - for his own good? why am i cutting everyone out of my life?

i‚Äôd really really appreciate any advice on this whole situation. i feel really lost and alone about it all and clueless as to what to do. üñ§",21Jun2020,1

I get turned on, but I don‚Äôt even want to masturbate any more. I like to masturbate and it‚Äôs helped me stay a virgin to this day. I‚Äôve never been excessive with it, it was always a healthy, normal amount. 

I really like this new medication. It‚Äôs changed me for the better. I was so depressed and anxiety stricken everyday. Now I can wake up early, go to bed early, get out of bed, feel happy, and the best part is my anxiety is practically gone.

275,"First off, I was caught stealing a $4 item at a local grocery store. I've not done this before and I can't explain why I did it in the first place. I always felt like I had my life in order and had a lot of integrity but, after being laid off, COVID, family sickness, death, and what feels like a depression, I've lost myself. 

It was a quick and a good wake-up call. I'm seeking help from a counselor and have gone to meet for one session so far. After it happened, I was almost in shock at myself. I signed a form that I would never go back on any of their properties and another that I would pay the company for their troubles. I've tried contacting their lawyer and plan to pay without any question. I was told the police would not be involved.

I feel horrible for what I did. Everything about it is breaking me down further and it was suggested that I should find a way to move forward to grow. I think I want to write a letter to the store manager, company manager, and the security person that I talked with to apologize and praise the security person for the job he did. After it happened, he talked with me in a way that made me still feel human and, even though I did something wrong, was almost comforting to me that I could get through it.

There's a chance that I won't be able to go back in their stores again. It would be nice to be allowed back but I understand if that decision isn't changed. That doesn't matter though; I'm also actually thinking of not putting a return address and not signing my name because I just want to imagine my photo and info isn't with a company like that. Do y'all think writing a letter to apologize and praise the security guard is a good idea?",21Jun2020,1
276,"Throwaway because this is weird and embarrassing. Quick backstory- I have been with my stepson's father since he was three, so I have been in his life a long time. His father and I also have a daughter together, so I am his sister's mom. His mother and I have, until fairly recently, had a very contentious relationship, and it has only been in the last couple of years that she has been civil to me and more heavily relied on me to help with my stepson and step daughter (his older sister). My step daughter has a lot of problems, so he has been somewhat overshadowed by her and not received as much attention by either his parents or me (it's pretty sad to say it..)
So here's the thing. His father and I have been out of work due to the pandemic, and I have made it my new job through this to keep my daughter and step son on track for school, helping them with remote learning and all, and it has been a joy to bond with my step son a bit more. He's quickly becoming a teenager, yet is still the sweet little kid I've known and loved all these years. But something strange has started happening when he hugs me goodnight or goodbye when his mom picks him up- it started with him brushing my breasts with his hands as he pulled away after hugging me. I figured it was accidental, and adjusted the way I hugged him to maneuver his hands away from that zone. Then, he started placing his hands kind of on my butt when he hugged me. I have no idea if I am imagining this or if it is accidental or if he knows exactly what he is doing?!!!?! I haven't said anything to his dad, it's just so weird and I feel bad about suspecting him of acting inappropriately. I have been harassed and endured unwanted touching by many guys throughout my life, yet for some reason I am really bad at identifying it when it's going on-- I always hope it isn't happening, or isn't what I think it is.  And right now, I feel a mixture of that, and like I am overreacting and jumping to conclusions. Maybe he is just a hugger and likes physical contact? But I was harassed and groped when I was his age by kids his age, so I know it's not beyond the scope of possibility.
I feel like I am completely failing as a parental figure, missing an opportunity for a teaching moment about boundaries and respect, all because my compass is broken.  Any perspectives and advice would be much appreciated.",21Jun2020,1
277,"So I (F,20) work at one of the Big Three and have recently got another job forty-five minutes away from where I currently live that is only ten minutes away from my college. I go back to school in August and this job will be very helpful. For some reference, I make $7.25 while delivering and $8.00 in the store. I would make $11.50 at this new job (a grocery store chain).  

Yesterday I spoke with the owner (a close family friend) about working on my schedule to suit both jobs. He said he would be willing to work with me. Today, I opened with my two favorite coworkers. Night shift comes in. A new worker and a coworker who is known for causing issues are the main problem. Or at least the start. 

They first start talking about sex with a female coworker (one of the two I opened with). I make a joke about not being sexual with men. They both proceed to berate me asking about my boyfriend and saying a lot about mine and his sex life. Saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre f***ed up‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre crazy‚Äù, ‚Äúsex is important in a relationship‚Äù, etc. Myself and my friend shrug it off. 

After coming back from a delivery, the coworker is changing the air filter. I ask if he knows which way he‚Äôs putting it in. He says, and I quote, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you let the men handle this and worry about washing dishes and making babies?‚Äù While a manager proceeds to make a joke on how I should just be barefoot and pregnant. I immediately go get my money and demand to be clocked out. Both managers, night shift and the one who said I should be pregnant said that since I am so depressed and makes jokes about that and my father‚Äôs passing all the time, I have no right to be upset about this. 

The owner, who is a very close family friend, has done a lot for me at this job and in general. Including working around my school and being a pallbearer at my father‚Äôs funeral. Is it wrong if me to quit with no notice? What do I do in this situation??",21Jun2020,1

279,"No, i'm not here because i'm suicidal or had any thoughts of that. Recently though, I have made some bad decisions. There are two things here I want to talk about and really need someone to talk about this stuff. I just graduated High School about 2 months ago just for clarification.  I met this one kid sophomore year, he just moved here, as so did I. We became best friends, and I clicked with him like I did with no one else. This kid, Matt, introduced me to weed in 10th grade and I had no experience with anything, even alcohol. I would smoke maybe once or twice a month. Then once 11th and 12th grade hit, I was smoking everyday. I never did any hard drugs of any kind, and had NO interest in doing them because I know they ruin lives. He was a big pill head in 11th grade, but I knew never to touch them. I know what's going on in his home life, and I can tell you for sure that's most likely where he started using drugs. Anyways, these past weeks have been pretty tough on me.  I used acid, xanax, and coke. It might not seem like a big deal but I feel ashamed of myself for it. I always think to myself if I would of never met this kid, I wouldn't have done any drugs. Anyways, that's where I got the xanax from and why I used it. Yesterday night me and two people each took a bar of xan, and obviously I don't remember everything. I know we slept over at a girls house, my two friends fell asleep, and me and the girl go to her room. I know we had sex but I know for sure I didn't have a condom on. The thing that's really itching and making me nervous is I can't recall whether I pulled out or not.

Pretty quickly I gained self confidence, purpose, healthy friendships, relationships, a decent social life, and I felt like I knew who I was and carried myself with dignity.

Eventually I bought a scooter, got a beautiful apartment with 2 friends of mine, got into a serious relationship, and decided to go to school for a 1 year hvac program.

So I was in school or work for 75-85 hours a week, without any days off and still trying to be present in a relationship with someone I really cared about.

So, for a little bit of backstory ‚Äì My mother is a full-blown narcissist. Due to her being her crazy self, I never had any contact with my dad growing up. My head was filled with lie after lie about how he never wanted me, how he cheated, how he hit her.   
 When I was a teenager, I did get to go meet him and spent about a month with him. Although being a depressed kid who thought her dad was this villain I didn‚Äôt really put in much effort, and it was just hard‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt know this man. Contact between him was hardly maintained after that trip.

I went down a second time a year later to meet my now stepmother who is an absolutely wonderful woman. They wanted my opinion on who she was, and I was the final say as to if they got married. I went home excited, and happily awaited my trip back down south for the wedding.

The trip never came and I was crushed. My mother who intentionally kept me from going (without my knowledge) relished in seeing that same anger and resentment she has towards him grow in me. 

I thought I was just this unwanted extra kid that my dad had. He was content with his new family, and I was just a financial burden because of child support. So, I grew up and just moved on to except that ‚Äúreality‚Äù

Sadly in September my Dad had a very serious stroke. Because of this, him and I started talking again. As we talked and reconnected, we learned of all the ways that my mother pitted us against each other without the other knowing. Luckily, he is a part of my life now, nothing major but we are slowly growing a very strong bond.

Each phone call we just learn more and more way‚Äôs that I am exactly like him, its mind blowing. All the strange small quirks of mine, he is the exact same way. It‚Äôs so strange having a Dad‚Ä¶ Hell it‚Äôs strange having a parent that genuinely cares about me and my well-being.  
 I just don‚Äôt know how to handle Father‚Äôs Day. I want to do something nice and special sense but I have never done the whole Father‚Äôs day thing before‚Ä¶ I love my dad to death and I want to make up for the nineteen years I didn‚Äôt get to tell him how much I love him and amazing of a man he is.

292,"Okay so throw away because I know people on Reddit, and I apologize in advance for grammar I'm not the best.

A couple of days ago my friend opened up to me about how they were sexually assaulted or something of the like and I felt horrible because I had asked the question that lead to it instead of it being something they came to me about. I only got the most bare bones explanation of what happened and then it was over.

In the moment I immediately shifted to something more light hearted and she seemed to be perfectly fine afterwards but I just felt terrible inside, not only that but in the back of my mind I still had so many questions and I still do. i don't want to make my friend relive whatever happened but some sick sense of curiosity keeps scratching at my head and it makes me feel sick to my stomach I don't know what to do. Again I don't want to make her talk about this or even allude to it but I don't know what to do I can't stop thinking about it.

I have never felt worse about a situation before. After she left I apologized to her about it being brought up but she said it wasn't even an issue and there was no reason for me to feel bad but that just made it worse. Why can't I forget about it I want to be there for her I really do I want her to be able to tell me anything but this has turned into a swirling shit storm for me. The fact that I wish I had never heard it makes it worse and now that I had that overly apologetic reaction I'm afraid that she won't come to me about problems or things like that in the future.

I'm just crushed under the weight of my own thoughts not to mention that it's not even about me it happened to her how could I be the one who feels this way about the extremely brief conversation we had I legitimately have no idea what to do. I want to forget it but at the same time I want her to talk to me about it not for some sick perverted reason but just because she was so vague it's not even a trust thing like I want her to tell me to prove she trusts me. Every time I think about it my stomach ties up and I feel as if I'm going to puke and I get angry at almost everything around me mostly myself for wanting to know more I mean what the hell is wrong with me who could even think to ask someone for something like that and why can't I let it the fuck go.

Sorry this is more of a rant than anything else but I have no idea what to do with myself I don't even know if I can receive advice on what to do and again I don't want details about what happened but more around what happened. I'm 16 male if that helps at all",21Jun2020,2

295,"Hi all.

My boyfriend's roommate's new gf is very clearly attracted to him. At parties - coming onto him, flirting/teasing, taking her clothes off directly in his view, placing her ass literally next to his face when he was sitting on the floor against the couch while she was sitting on top of it....yeah. I get that she wasn't sober, but that doesn't make any better. There is insecurity on my part as she is much fitter than I am, even though my bf has reassured me she is not his type and it's not even about looks alone either, that he loves me in totality. And he's disgusted she would do this to his roommate, who is sooo in love with her. 

Boyfriend and I both talked about it extensively, and are trying to find a solution without ruining the group vibe. We're honestly very confused because we don't understand why she would so blatantly disrespect me and her own bf, who we do care about a lot like a brother. She was not all over her bf at all. And they're in a new relationship! I don't get it. 

So. It's about that time again where we want to get a lil messed up this weekend, and me and my bf are looking forward to it, as times have been stressful. However...his roommate and his gf wants to do it too. Will this fuck up my high? I've never been in a situation like this before. I'd rather not ruin my high with her presence if I can help it. I love the time that me and my bf get to get dumb together. It's cathartic. And approaching her about it might result in her saying ""I don't know what you're talking about""...that would really hurt his roommate as well, so I'm trying to avoid it til it's the last resort. I'm hoping there are tips I can grab to not feel so insecure, basically. Or whatever else may help.

Does she want the guy to make a move? Or is it one of those things where the guy shouldn‚Äôt do anything and just let these small things keep happening?

We moved out together into a nicer place and then he was going through some financial issues and needed to bounce at the end of our lease with aboht 30 days notice. I couldnt afford the place by myself and I wasn't going to just live with anyone needing a roommate. The rental market in the area had gone waaaaay up since I last lived alone and couldn't afford to live alone at all. So I moved in with a friend and that ended terribly.

I was forced to move in with another friend but I didn't really have my own space. I was in a public area of the small house with my bed in the corner of the room. I did that for about a year and then moved in with another friend but this time with my own room. I got a big promotion back in October and can now afford to live on my own again. I'm signing a lease tomorrow on the perfect place for me but I'm having some anxieties about living alone.

I'm a nervous that the loneliness might cause my mental health to spiral. Typically I'm never home anyways but with the pandemic I'm working from home and not going out like I normally do. I go to a few select friend's houses here and there but I'm mostly just home for about 90% of my time nowadays. My mental health is doing well right now but I struggle with mental health issues. I had some recent family trauma and I'm afraid that dealing with that being primarily physically alone will be difficult. I go to therapy but of course its over video chat at the moment and I've been in therapy for years so I schedule appointments as needed nowadays.

306,"My downstairs neighbor told me that the other night while he was smoking a cigarette a man was walking down the street, It was 12am-2am and this man was on the phone, I assume he lives in the next block over in a rowdy house, Which I need to say, is full of ghetto people. Well while this man was on the phone he said loudly according to my neighbor he wants to kill somebody. My neighbor smokes in the dark and this man came up between both our cars, which are parked curbside in front of the house, stared while speaking for a bit and asked if he lived there. My neighbor readily said no and upon further questioning said he is just a visitor. My neighbor has a wife and a little son so he said this to avoid problems for them. The man directly asked if the doors to my apartment are still wobbly and easy to breakdown (not like that but I can't remember the wording.) My neighbor said he doesn't know and so on so forth.

In about a month Ill be told when they will start renovating the appartment.

Now Im thinking about subleasing an one room appartment. Now the problem is, that I would have to pay 4 month of double rent(until october I would have to pay), which would eat up all my savings, on the other hand normally they find a new person pretty quick. 

Or I could just wait another month and see when they will start renovating the appartment and hope it\`ll be then done pretty quick(not later then october), so I only have to stay 3-4 more month or at least know when they start renovating and then decided if I want to move or not.

I think it woulkd make sence to move out in a month, because it\`ll take at least until october for the renovation to be done and I\`d rather stay somewhere else for 3-4 month , but then I would maybe have to pay rent twice, if they dont finde someone else in a month, which I think they would, but dont know.

313,"Hey guys! If you don‚Äôt want to read too much, basically, I‚Äôm studying engineering right now, but I‚Äôm realizing more and more that I don‚Äôt really enjoy engineering, and the only reason I got into it was because it was financially stable, had upward mobility, and didn‚Äôt require too much school. The career that I feel passionately about is journalism, but I‚Äôm worried that it‚Äôs too risky, financially. Not many journalists ‚Äúmake it‚Äù and the ones that do don‚Äôt get paid that much. Based on your experience, would you choose a career that pays well but makes you feel drained every day, or a career that you feel passionate about, but is riskier?

If you want more details, here are some of more considerations:

1. I‚Äôve worked a full-time 4-month co-op in construction engineering. I know it‚Äôs not representative of all engineering jobs, but I know I didn‚Äôt enjoy that job very much. 
2. I really dislike my classes. I know classes aren‚Äôt the same as the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù but I feel like it‚Äôs a bad sign. The only reason I‚Äôm hanging on is because I‚Äôm a quick learner and I love learning in general
3. I got into a really competitive tech university, but it isn‚Äôt great with the arts, so I‚Äôd have to switch schools. Also, since engineering and journalism have nothing in common, I‚Äôd have to start my whole undergrad over again
4. don‚Äôt know how good I am at writing, or how much I‚Äôd actually enjoy journalism. My whole life I‚Äôve prioritized math and science, so I‚Äôve never really had any practical experience writing. I‚Äôve always gotten good grades in english classes, but it‚Äôs not the same
5. I tend to have ‚Äúgrass is greener‚Äù syndrome, where I believe that when I just achieve this one thing, everything will be perfect. I‚Äôm worried this is making me think journalism will be better than it really is

She doesn't get it. She has no personality of her own (does like music, tv shows, books, etc) besides talking of how lucky she is for having someone who doesn't have worse double standards.

She calls me yesterday and goes ""we should count our blessings that our parents are so kind. They don't even beat us like other people"" I was kind of pissed at this so I told her it's the default and she goes ""sometimes I think we don't deserve this treatment. We're not good enough"" when talking about my mental health. She meant well but this was the breaking point.

I feel sad for her but I can't keep being associated with her as it makes my mental health worse. I've cut contact with my brother as much what should I do?",21Jun2020,1
321,"Hello! I need help asap. Rather than going to a professional hairdresser to get my hair done, I usually have my mom do my hair for me. When my mom does my hair, I usually get either box braids or senegalese twists. After getting my hair done, my scalp isn‚Äôt tender or in pain. So for Fathers Day this year my dad wants to take pictures and I was letting my natural hair breathe for about a week or two to catch itself after getting back to back protective styles. My mom got a recommendation, I don‚Äôt know where from, but someone told her to use free tres curly hair for senegalese twists rather than the usual pre stretched braids I‚Äôm used to. I started on the hairstyle but ended up not finishing because I ran out of braiding hair. So yesterday (I am posting this sort of the night of getting these faux locs but it‚Äôs already early in the AMs) prior to leaving the house to buy gifts and more of the free tress hair, my mom gets another recommendation from my grandma to use marley hair in my head and when she had shown me the style, I noticed it was faux locs. I found a pretty full proof tutorial on YouTube how to do them so me and my mom went down to the beauty supply store and bought everything needed. When it came time to start the hair, I was expressing how tight it was but I assumed that it was normal because in the tutorial they said to wrap the hair tightly so it doesn‚Äôt unravel. Flash forward to now, it‚Äôs almost 2 am and I cannot sleep. I can‚Äôt even lay down. My scalp is super tender and the hair is too bulky for me to lay my head down. If I run my fingers through my scalp, I can feel the uneven parts where my hair is being pulled to tight and it‚Äôs causing my scalp to raise. I honestly just wanna sleep in hopes that the locs will soften up but at this point, I feel like I have to sleep sitting up. I don‚Äôt want to take down the hair either because it took hours to install and I don‚Äôt want to waste the hair style. I‚Äôm very uncomfortable and I can feel the waves of pain and tension going through my scalp, sometimes the pain is so bad I can start to feel it in my teeth. I really just need quick tips on how to loosen them and soften them so I wouldn‚Äôt have to take them out. Please help if you can!",21Jun2020,1

323,"Hey reddit

This isn‚Äôt advice for me but I am trying to help one of my friends who is in a bad time.

I‚Äôm gonna try and keep this post short and if anyone needs clarification i‚Äôll respond in the comments.

Basically one of my friends who I care about a lot has recently started this phase and I don‚Äôt recognize her anymore. I‚Äôm not exactly what sparked the change, but she started sleeping with any guy she could and doing started drinking and doing drugs. she has told me that she no longer sees a point to life, and how basically everything (including all the substances she started taking are pointless).

At first I tried being supportive and told her that if she wants to live her life this way then she should go for it and be happy. The more time this has gone on however I feel bad for her and want to help. Maybe that‚Äôs not what I should do and it isn‚Äôt my business but I am really close to her and i barely recognize this side of her. 

I would just like any advice on ways I can convince her that life has a meaning and that there are better things to do than drugs and sleeping with everyone.

If i am wrong for wanting to reach out to her let me know too because I am not sure if i‚Äôm being a bad friend by losing my support in her decisions.

Thank you reddit.",21Jun2020,1

I have a nice job and I go to university. I feel happy and fairly confident. I have my bad days but I think everyone has those. I had suffered from depression for longer than a year. Now I don't feel depressed anymore!!

I have always had a lot of performance anxiety. In school I always wanted to have good grades and if I got a mediocre grade I would be devestated. 
My parents always pushed me to do great but to an extent that I developed performance anxiety. 

I was able to get rid of this anxiety in school and work. 


I have had 1 girlfriend and our sex life was good. I did have some problems with anxiety. My heart would race and my throat would close up. I was always scared to lose my erection and it happened once. Our relationship ended because of other reasons. I haven't had sex ever since. 

I have been dating this amazing girl for the last few weeks and we are getting closer and closer. We haven't had sex or any touching yet, just kissing.
Now we are getting closer. And I don't want to screw it up.

Questions :
1. How do I cope with stress and anxiety when having sex. (performance anxiety)

2. Do I tell her I think sex is a bit scary or exciting so she will know I haven't had sex in a long time and I might need some help?

And lastly do you guys have tips on overcoming this anxiety because I would love to be closer to this girl. Without any anxiety or problems

326,"This might be a weird issue but let me explain;

I'm a graphic designer/artist and I do all sorts of creative stuff. Whenever I make a new piece or graphic work or really anything else, I want to share it immediately. Like, I hate letting anything sit unseen. To the point that I have really no semblance of style or clear voice in my art. I just make something and then post it. I can't seem to just be cool with making it for me and having restraint on what I post. 

Any advice on what I can do to, like, trick myself into not doing that? Haha. I know that's odd. I need to establish a clearer voice and story with my art but I can't help but just share every single thing I make.

327,"So a little backstory on this. I grew up in a pretty broken household. My parents divorced when I was 2 or so and my mother got the house that my parents owned together. My father and mother shared joint custody and I spent half the week with my father and half the week with my father every week. Sometimes I would spend a day at my grandparents and so I ended up getting really close with my grandmother and grandfather.

Anyway, my father ended up getting a house literally one block away from my mother's when I was around 5 and that was probably one of the worst things that could have happened. You see, my mother is, to put it gently, a narcissistic, manipulative, alcoholic, toxic individual with undiagnosed/unmedicated bipolar disorder. So of course this led to many many instances of her coming over and screaming at me and my father, her throwing me out of her house to walk over to my dads only for her to drive over and scream at us both, and of course many of those times my father and I had to call the police on her.

Anyway, this continues on for years until I turn 18 and graduate high school. A couple of months before graduation we have an absolutely massive falling out on Christmas day and after a few heated phone calls where I finally break down and call her out for the years of abuse I basically stop speaking to her. I collect my things while she's not home and bring them over to my father's and never speak to her again.

Since then I changed my number and I've only received 2 Facebook messages from her(after the second I blocked her), 1 of which she told me she wanted me to stay away from ""her"" family, aka. my grandmother, whom I still have stayed in close contact with. That was maybe 6 years ago and I haven't seen or talked with my mother in about 10 years to this point

Anyway, I never stopped talking with my grandmother and we've continued being close. But my grandmother is getting older and I see her health deteriorating faster and faster, and early onset dementia is apparent. My mother still talks with her(which I've never had a problem with, and in fact I've been happy my mom has been keeping a good relationship with my grandmother) and unfortunately she has been constantly manipulating my grandmother to try and guilt trip me to make up with my mother and has even made me out to be somewhat of the bad guy. She's also been making it sound like the rest of the family, especially my father, turned me against my mother. I've explained why I don't want to talk to her to my grandmother and why we're estranged but like I said, her mind is deteriorating and she can't really understand why it's an issue, even though my mother has also been horribly abusive to her as well numerous times and still is at times to this day.

The main issue is that I'm worried that a time will come and my grandmother is going to be on her deathbed and my mother is going to prevent me from seeing my grandmother in the hospital during the process. This has all been even more worrisome recently with the threat of covid-19 and the fact that my grandmother is smack dab in the middle of the most vulnerable group of individuals.

If I show up at the hospital while my grandmother is dying does my mother have any right to turn me away? If she stands in between me and my grandmothers hospital room I can't necessarily force my way past her, nor would I want to. It's bad enough I would even have to see her in the first place but I love and care about my grandmother and it would kill me to not see her in her last moments.

**TLDR;** My mother, who I'm estranged with, is a narcissistic horrible person and if my grandmother ends up terminally ill in the hospital there's a good chance she would try to stop me from seeing her even though I'm still very close to her.

**Side note:** We've tried to convince my grandmother to draft a living will so there won't be concerns about who will be in charge of medical decisions when my grandmother is unable to, whether that's my mother or her older sister. Also confirming her burial rights and dividing her estate. Unfortunately my grandmother wont have it and doesn't want to admit that she's getting to that point in her life and no amount of convincing has helped. Can anyone offer any advice on ways we can make the process easier for her?",21Jun2020,1

For a few months now there have been these yellow bugs showing up on the couch sometimes in one of the living rooms and I just avoid that side of the house altogether, because I tried everything I could to get rid of them, but they keep coming back. My mom doesn't really care or want to help because she blames my brother for not cleaning it, but in my opinion that's still her fault for never making him clean anything growing up

My bedroom is on the other side of the house.

I frequently deep clean my bedroom because I just really fucking want a clean environment, ya know? It's the only place in the house that I dont feel grimy and gross

I laid down in bed and started to fall asleep, only to feel something crawling on me... I turned on the light and saw 3 of those yellow bugs on my sheets, they crawled away when I picked up my pillow, I dont see any more anywhere on my bed. I dont know what they are.

340,"So I hope this is the right reddit for this (I am not an active redditor) and I've been debating whether I should post this or not but I gotta get this off my chest. So basically I have a friend. I'll call her L. See we have had a very toxic relationship. For short* and I'm not sure who's fault it is? She says it's because she's a victim to a lot but I'm not so sure it justifies her actions..

*For long; My boyfriend and I decided to try polyamory (relationship of three or more people) because you only live once and we thought it might help some problems we were having. Well we met L who at first seemed perfect. She had our humor, gothic, had the same interests, and wants for a relationship. So we gave it a spin and at first things seemed fine but it slowly got worse and more toxic. See my boyfriend and I had never slept with anyone other than eachother. So we told her we weren't comfortable with it being super sexual. Which she didn't respect. So I tried respectfully telling her that we might be open to it later but we wanted to see how serious the relationship was. Then she started flipping out on me saying I was an a**hole, and insulting me left and right. I'm a rather aggressive person but considering how sensitive she was I did my best to stay calm. Said that I just wanted to work this out so we could have a healthy relationship. Then she blocked me. Then my boyfriend tried to stand up for me so she blocked him. After many days of trying to wiggle through a labyrinth of contacting her family in order to get stuff we lent her back she decided to unblock us. So being a (way to forgiving) person I decided we would try friendship. Which things got steadily worse. See we ended up returning her things but she continues to be difficult with us. I've also hung out with her a few times and all she ever does is complain. She is very manipulative from what I feel. Plus she constantly makes it out as if certain things aren't what they seem. For example my boyfriend and I ended up taking some time apart so I could explore my sexuality so she ended up consenting and we messed around (nothing serious) then my boyfriend and I did eventually decide to get back together so I felt bad not telling him. When he confronted her about it she basically accused me of sexual assault. (Which I have text proof of her saying that I didn't take advantage of her or anything like that) then anytime a tiny dispute comes up she just deletes the group chat we are in and kicks us. Sometimes blocking us, and other times just repeatedly saying goodnight/goodbye. She also started threatening suicide a few nights ago so we immediately called her mom who said she was fine, laughing and so. Which makes me think she was hiding it. Or if she wasn't then that means she was leading us on to think she was going to do something that drastic to either get in our heads, or just make a sick joke.

So sick of the bull. Him and I confronted her. And she blaimed it on ptsd, depression, getting over abuse, and the recent loss of her pet.
Which I do completely understand that it's rough and mental illness is serious. But having struggled with many similar problems I think she's using it as a front to make her seem like the victim. And I feel really bad saying that. But after everything. Why does she always seem to be the one who's pure, and never the problem.
All my boyfriend, and I do is try to make her feel better about her situation, try to hangout with her when possible, but it's just dragging us down. It leaves us feeling warn down, depressed, and it just hurts because after all this we do care about her a lot. But it feels like nothing we do is good enough.
She also doesn't have many people she trusts in her like so I'm scared of what she might do if we leave.

So if you managed to get through that. Am I the bad guy? Do I need to change? What do you guys think I should do?

349,"My cousin, who goes to college in New York, has asked my parents if she could come stay with us-we live in SoCal-for the rest of the summer because she feels extremely lonely in New York. She says that she has been quarantining for the past month. Because she is a family member, my parents have accepted.

Also, she wasn't even about to get tested before coming, until I asked her to. AND her test results are not coming back until after she gets here.

She's not someone I hung out with often, but she is a person I've known and been friends with since 2015. Our friendship started online over facebook and I helped her get through some hard times. She was always super sweet. We went our separate ways as we got older but we accidentally met irl for the first time on July 4, 2018. That is when we hung out for the first time. 

She came with my friends and I to watch fireworks. Afterwards, I took her home. She asked me to come in and hang out for a bit. We cuddled, talked about her future/helping her get on the right path (bc she had went through some shit) and we ended up kissing, a lot. I really really liked her after that, but we ended up drifting apart and she got a bf. We hung out one last time a few months later and I had a lot of fun, as friends of course.   


We've talked some off and on since, and every time I saw her irl  in public (which lately has been a lot) we always talked, hugged, and said we loved each other (just as good friends would say). The last thing I told her was that I loved her and hope she continues to do well. 

I feel guilty. I feel like I have no right to be upset about any of this because we didn't talk much right before she died. I keep crying off and on though, I keep picturing how she died even though I have no idea how she died. All I know is that the car ended up catching fire, and that she could have burned and suffered a horrible death. I can't get it out of my head. 

I don't know how to deal with this. She didn't deserve this. She was such a bright, wild, and beautiful person. She was finally starting to be happy.

351,"I was wondering if anyone had any good advice for finding lost games or if someone remembers this game. 
So I‚Äôve been looking for a game that I played for a while now with no luck and am hoping that someone else remembers it because I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. 
It was a flash game that involved solving puzzles and finding objects and progressing through different settings. 
I remember the first part of the game involved finding objects in a castle garden and then finding gems inside a castle before going into a village. 
I‚Äôm pretty you were a princess looking for a prince that was taken by a witch by it might‚Äôve been the other way around. 
I remember the village part had a parrot that had a speech bubble and was saying something but I can‚Äôt remembrer what. 
The village part is what I remember best and there was a little cottage with a wooden sign and the parrot was sitting in the sign. The cottage was a sandy colour. 
There were lots of other parts like a cave and swamp sections and the last part o remember was something to do with 3 vases. Again I don‚Äôt remember a lot of it that well but I could prove Amy recognise it if I saw it again. 
It was a really long and kinda hard game so I found a walkthrough for it and the walkthrough had a lot of parts to it. 
I found it on a girls game site under the ‚Äúquest‚Äù category but last year when I started looking for this game using the way back machine I couldn‚Äôt even find a site that had the ‚Äúquest‚Äù category and didn‚Äôt see any game in the puzzle or adventure categories that resembled the game I‚Äôm looking for. 
I‚Äôm pretty sure it had the word ‚Äòprince‚Äô in the title but again I‚Äôm not sure. 
Because it had a walk through I‚Äôm assuming that this game existed on other websites and was somewhat popular.

352,"so i live in minnesota, i just got my permit last week,i am set up for behind the wheel training, and i turn 16 in about 7 months. but things were already backed up before covid, and now i had to show up 10 mins before it opened so the line would only 1 hour to take the knowledge test for my permit, instead of 5 hours. so things are even more backed up now.

353,"As the title says, my dog is pretty old. She's a maltipoo, and all of her other siblings have since passed at 11-12 years (she's currently 14). Her health hasn't been the best as of late - she's had a couple seizures, has some tumors on her tummy, and is currently getting checked out for a potential tumor by her bladder since she's had problems with incontinence and straining herself.

Point is, she's old, and she's been through a lot. She had her uterus removed last September and is still somehow kicking. I've had her ever since I was about 7 years old, and today my mom said it might be time to come to a decision to put her down.

She's seemed so invincible lately. But the constant trips to the vet as of late have been really, really wearing on me. She's worth it to me though.

I spent a good amount of time bawling my eyes out about it, but it really doesn't feel like her time yet. Still, I'm scared, and this has never happened to me before. She means the absolute world to me. I want to spoil her while I can, but what should I do after she passes? I know it's going to hurt a lot, but I want to at least..be able to cope alright.

(Context: I deal with a lot of mental health disorders, and (tw: suicide) she's one of the reasons I'm still alive today. Emotional regulation is a bit, difficult.)

I know one thing I'm doing is that, when she does pass, I'll make a little shrine for her. I have a lot of plants and stuff, so I want to make her a little garden.",21Jun2020,1

I have some serious anxiety about my upcoming move and how it will probably descend into tears between my mom and I. It seems anytime my opinions/decisions differ even slightly from her own, she gets completed offended and angry. Recent conversation that has ACTUALLY happened:

Me: I‚Äôm thinking I would like to put up some new shelving in the laundry room to put the dog‚Äôs stuff on. 

Mom: You know what you should do? You should put up those wire shelves so you can hang your clothes on them! 

Me: You know I really don‚Äôt like how the wire shelves look, I‚Äôm thinking about maybe wooden shelves or something. I already have a clothes rack anyway. 

Mom: But the wire shelves.....

Me: I get that, but I really just don‚Äôt like how they look. I‚Äôd rather have ....

*back and forth a few more times*

Mom: You know what? Do WHATEVER YOU WANT. I don‚Äôt even know why I talk. 

Me: Mom it‚Äôs nothing against you.....

Mom: I‚Äôll just shut up. It‚Äôs clear you don‚Äôt want my opinion anyway. Maybe I‚Äôll just stay home. 

At this point I apologize but don‚Äôt agree to put up wire shelves. Afraid to bring it up. The conversation is very similar for anything equally minor.

I had a crush on a girl from my old school. We didn‚Äôt really talk, but we had tons in common. I knew that I was leaving and I felt bad about transferring so I started texting her afterwards. Her friend knew because I told her. She acted really interested, would shower me everyday with love, and we would talk for a very long time... about many things.

One day she invited me to a party, I went, got nervous, said stupid shit because I was nervous in front of her friends, was kind of on her, and she left. She got angry at me when I confessed and then she ghosted me.

Her friend told me that she was saying bad things about me in girl group chat. The thing about her friend is that ever since last year started, she‚Äôs always been super mature, she supported my crushes, she said that I was an amazing person... one time she helped me when I was going through something difficult, and she said she‚Äôd always be there for me.

...I think I might have feelings for that friend... we don‚Äôt text... and she goes to different school now... and maybe we don‚Äôt have as much in common as my ex-crush... but, should I try it......? I kind of... want to.

Please help me... {Backstory} Kentucky, USA

:Note: I also posted in r/legaladvice

I (28 f) have a yet un-diagnosed, sudden outset seizure disorder linked to stress....my cousin (41 f) suffers from various mental illnesses, we are roommates on a rural family compound. My parents own 3 portions of a 31 acre farm, broken up by my maternal aunt's 1 acre to the right of my house (formally my grandparents) and then my maternal uncle's acre to the left. My uncle married a woman that I welcomed at first with open arms. At their destination wedding 2 years ago, she invited some ""friends"" that I never would've imagined. There was a girl close to ODing on the steps of the rental cabin when we pulled in and another one in withdrawal upstairs, accompanied by their abusive, creepy and misogynistic male counterparts. I said nothing and continued to show good faith, until one of her male guest exposed himself to my cousin, informed us we could not ""leave the property without a man, inappropriately touched both of us (caressing legs and arms) and came into my bedroom while I was sleeping. This convinced me that she set us up to be raped, and I have tried to limit all interactions since.

&amp;#x200B;

Also: She's definitely cheating on my uncle (A Trucker) and got mad when I insisted they move their RV off my property so her boyfriend couldn't hide his ATV behind it at 3am.

When my grandparents property came up for sell, my parents purchased it for me and my cousin to live in. She stirred some family drama...basically saying that my parents (who've had to re-buy the farm after mom's other siblings defaulted on mortgages) already have enough and shouldn't try to save the farmhouse, where we hold all holidays and is filled with precious memories.

This is when she begins constantly bullying my cousin with messages about how she should end her life and that no one in the family wants her to live in the family home-place....or at all. After a few hours of this, my cousin T tells her that she is going to commit suicide. Aunt never messages back and never reports. Thank god T didn't follow through.

{Present}

T and I bought an above ground pool....that Aunt feels entitled to use because we share a water meter, we've well over our usage and she has bought us chemicals and things that we've never asked her to....that she is now charging us for? And we honestly, didn't mind having her in the pool occasionally. But she is angry that we lock up the ladder for safety. We have a 2 yr old that could be in that pool faster than anything. Then, the one time it was left in the pool, we came home to her and 3 of ""those people's"" kids in our pool, breaking our toys.

 Knowing that we'd be out the next day and that her guests would want to swim so badly that they might break our lock to get in the pool, ( later we discovered they attempted to move our patio furniture as a makeshift ladder)....I placed the ladder in our livingroom so that my mother (CPR cert) could get it for them and guaranteeing mom could supervise. Unfortunately, nobody could drop their lives to appease Aunt.

She is now messaging us about bills, or money we ""owe"" her or making fun of me for my seizures. Now, that she knows that they are stress related I think that she strategically messages hurtful and upsetting things while I could be driving, or working or alone in the hopes that I'll be injured. She's also back to targeting T, provoking her into suicidal thoughts. She keeps saying that well never see our uncle again.

Now, she's threatening our pets for being on ""her property"". When half a building and part of their chain-link fence is on my property...so is her patio furniture.

Do I have any legal recourse? Harassment? Cease and Desist? Move away? Move your stuff off my land if your gonna be a horrible person?

Also, the title to their mobile home isn't in their name, but a deceased relative of which my mom is the executor, because uncle refuses to buy a fire extinguisher and pay for an inspection.....Eviction??

&amp;#x200B;

Should I even try to pursue something like this? I don't wanna loose my uncle, but I truly feel like she's using knowledge of our disabilities to harass and physically hurt us. I could seize and seriously injure myself or die. T might listen and take all her pills. 

I need any advice at all, please",21Jun2020,1

I pecked him on the lips, we giggled and left the room, it lasted about 1 minute. I went to take a shower and another family member asked him what we did and i got lectured.

365,"I have this friend, let's call her Emily that's known to be a goody two shoes and she puts on this good girl complex in front of literally everyone. And everyone loves her. Thing is, IMO she's not as nice as she perceives herself to be. I don't know if she knows this or not. 

She constantly slut shames this one specific female I'm friends with. Let's call this friend Liza. It's normalised at my class because no one likes her. But no one else SLUT shames her, they make fun of her accent and stuff which I don't get why but anyway it's the minimal stuff that I don't condone with either. But let's focus on Emily here. I initially wasn't close with Emily and I noticed myself just going along with it when they made fun of her just to ""fit in"" and it took me time to stand up for my friend and almost all of my friend realized their mistakes as I pointed it out and they apologized. I may sound hypocritical but I've apologized to Liza and I've opened up to her about this as well. Well, my friend Emily on the other hand refused to see what she's doing wrong and all of us just pushed past it. And my friends would constantly tell me, how Emily is hypocritical and insensitive but no one would say a thing. One day, I did and as expected, she got all defensive about it. ""It's my opinion of her and it will not change. And I thought as my friend I could open up to you. The others get me"". Don't get me wrong but I KNOW the difference between an opinion and straight up bitching about someone. And her first defense is always ""you know I don't like making fun of people, who would do that"". Like, you did!!!!!? 

Well, that's that and she doesn't talk about Liza to ME again. But then, Emily fat shamed this guy we came across by stating that ""his tits were bigger than his"". The situation is worse cus this was on a live video and the guy was talking about how he overcame bullying and went to become a dancer. And she had the audacity to comment that. And honestly idk what to do about it because I know she'll either get defensive or get angry. And no one will take my side because she's the good girl loved by all. 

The problem is, the good times are really good and there are times like this.",21Jun2020,1
367,"Maybe 7-8 months ago I was at lunch with this girl I liked who was living out of state for school, and was good friends with. One person teased us on being a cute couple and she said I don‚Äôt see him like that at all. After that I got a bit hurt and cut back on the time I hung out with her. 

Then she‚Äôs back for spring break and quarantine starts, so she asks me if I would go hiking. I say yes and that first hiking trip turned into 3 hiking trips over 3 weeks. After that we start snapping more and one night she gets drunk and snaps me saying I love you and gets really mad when I don‚Äôt say it back. After I do she gets super happy and snaps me some shit of her rambling and stuff. 

After that daily she would send me ‚ù§Ô∏è emojis and would say I love you and I would respond love you too. We would talk about aspirations, things that bothered us, hardships and just became close. Then a few weeks ago she started acting a bit different. It would just take a bit more to get a conversion going and she stopped texting I love you as much, and stopped responding to me as much. 

Then last week we went to a lake to hang out with friends and I thought we had a good time. But after that she has stopped texting any sort of form of i love you, doesn‚Äôt respond as fast and has started to act how she used to act a few months ago. 

Idk what to do did I screw it up with her? Or did she never like me in the first place and I just misread things? Thanks",21Jun2020,1
368,"So i guess ill just start here and say that i was into a pretty hard drug scene in my teens - early adulthood. Im now 6 years clean, have held an average job for 5 years and have a partner with 2 kids. Now when i was in the drug scene in my stupid stupid youth i did a few questionable things (i didnt rob people and i didnt hurt people) but illegal things at the end of the day.

Now when i left the scene i did still talk to a few of the close friends i had made over the years, like we chilled out every now and then and had a couple beers every blue moon and i still considered a few of them as my best friends.

One of the close friends who i have been friends with for about 12 years now has been going off the rails for a while now and has been in and out of jail the last few years and just hasnt been getting any better. My whole family has extended their hands and helped and helped him and taken him in many times over the years. Now i cant explain how hard i have tried to help this guy but hes a give and inch and he'll take a mile sorta guy and eventually it became too much. 

He rocked up to my house a couple months ago late, like 9.30 at night all beaten up and i was working a midnight shift that night so i had been asleep for a few hrs already. He let himself in and was telling my partner (who was 8 months pregnant at the time and dealing with our 1 and a half year old on her own) that she needed her to wake me up to drive him 30 minutes away because he had just been in i bad fight with one of his other close friends. 
She said no but he kept bugging her and eventually drove him herself. She told me how pissed she was at him and how rude he was and i snapped and that was the last straw and i decided to cut him off.

But our friend circles interlock quite a bit and have just been bound to run into eachother every now in then and its always a bit awkward because he has got the gist that i wasnt talking to him much anymore. 

Aaannnnyyywaaayy. The dude was like my brother who knows everything. And he was close with most of my family and friends.

So yesterday someone made a few alt insta accs and was messaging my older sister and threatning to have me put in jail and tell all the police all this shit to get me locked away. Talking about how he is going to make my partner raise our kids on her own and all this horrid shit, also threatning her with her address and saying hes planted shit at her house (we both moved house 9 months ago) and if she doesnt want all this to happen all she has to do is send nudes. 
Now we werent sure but the night before she had woken to what she thought was somone running on her balcony. She went and checked and didnt see anything and went back to bed. 
He was also just trying to stir shit up in both our relationships with the accusations he was throwing out.

But there has been so many clues in the account names and the way they talk and how many personal details that only very very few people could know about that make me believe its this guy. But i have no solid proof. He about 40 messages overnight, reffered to about 10 people without dropping names and then deleted all accounts. Some of the personal shit he was saying literally made me sick to my stomach and i just dont know what to do next. So any advice other than just go to the police would be appreciated. I do have screenshots of the messages saying they had planted shit. 
And yes i do realise if this shit escalates past empty threats or i feel its too far i do realise i will have to get police involved",21Jun2020,1
370,"My girlfriend was messaged by a guy from her hometown that went to high school with their younger brother trying to hook up with her. My gf said that after she told him she was in a very committed relationship he respected that and kinda backed off, which I was fine with, he didn‚Äôt know she was dating someone and backed off immediately according to her. When I got home from work (night shift) the conversation was brought up and usually when something over text/message happens she‚Äôll just pull it up because it‚Äôs easier to read from it than to recall from memory, but this time she didn‚Äôt. A few times she would reach for her phone to pull it up and then would remember what was said and not pull it up. 

Fast forward to the next day. I had been thinking how weird it was she wouldn‚Äôt bring it up and so when she was in the shower I looked through the messages, which I realize I shouldn‚Äôt do but she‚Äôs gone through my phone before and said I could go through hers whenever, although up till now I haven‚Äôt because I had no reason to. 

The messages between the guy and her started off the way she said, but then they started talking about sex, like their favorite positions, whether they like using condoms or not, etc. Then at one point she asked if he could come over tonight (the night I was at work) and he was like ‚Äúwait I thought you were in a relationship?‚Äù Then she respond with something like ‚Äúoh yeah, never mind lol‚Äù then it continued on talking about sex and partners in the past and stuff. Then she said if he ever needed a friend, not in any sexual way just a friend then she‚Äôll be a friend basically. Also said that she‚Äôs not just some random dudes booty call. Then he respond saying thanks and was like ‚Äúbut don‚Äôt lie you were interested too‚Äù and my gf said ‚ÄúI mean you had my interest for a minute‚Äù

TW for self-harm

Names are changed

I'll go ahead and explain the whole situation, I really just need advice on whether or not I was out of line or did the right thing..


Last night I(13m) was talking to my really close friend, Regina(13f). It was extremely late and we were having a nice conversation and joking around like normal until she said something like ""how great the blade of my little pocket knife feels"", and I kinda freaked out asking her what she meant. She does have a tendency of acting pretty edgy, so I had no clue if she was serious or not.

She said she'd just show me and proceeded to text me a photo of the back of her wrist with a bunch of cut marks on it.. The marks didn't look deep or like they broke the skin too much but it was still a LOT.

I have a history of self-harm (though I have been clean for a while) so I really take stuff like this seriously, especially when it's with people close to me.

Anyways, I asked her why she did it and if something happened, to which she replied that she was ""just bored"" when she did it. It became pretty obvious that she was lying so I told her that she didn't have to tell me exactly what happened, but that I'm super worried and she can tell me anything if she wants.

At this point we both started to cry a bit when she just quietly said bye and hung up. I'm still super freaked out and kinda panicky at this point because I don't want her to harm herself any more and I ended up messaging her oldest sister (the only family of hers that I knew how to get in contact with) about it, asking if she could talk to Regina or get her parents to. And for context, her family isn't the crazy type that'll scream at her or something, they're really understanding.

Her sister messaged me back this morning saying that their parents were talking to Regina about it and thanks.

Now Regina is pissed off at me for telling them but I really am just worried about her and want her to be safe, though I understand how it may not have been my place to inform them.


So... Did I do something wrong? Was it a bad thing to tell her family?? I didn't know what else to do since she's not in the same state as me anymore- And if I did do something wrong please tell me, I haven't been in a situation like this before and don't know if I'll ever get into one again- 

I'm just so confused right now and just have so many thoughts and I feel terrible for snitching on Regina but also like I did the right thing, because maybe now she'll be able to get help but I'm just..... I don't know..",21Jun2020,1

And I raged out and messaged him on Facebook telling him he needs to disconnect and lose contact with my mother, or it could be a fight on sight the next time I saw him. 

As a result of this altercation, my mother contacts me and tells me I am in the wrong for stepping in, it‚Äôs not my place and that I should have not done anything. 

I‚Äôve had to watch by the sidelines for quite some time and my mother is in her 40s, I know she is scared that she‚Äôll be alone in her life so she settles for the bottom of the barrel scumbags that will be around. 

What do you do? I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm posting or what I‚Äôm looking for honestly but what would you do in this situation and was I really in the wrong for trying to stand up for someone who didn‚Äôt have the desire to stand up for themselves even though they are in a tough situation?

381,"I'm a pre op transgender female and I feel intense gender dysphoria almost everyday. I've started listening to an asmr video every night as I'm trying to fall asleep. The video is just a woman repeating the phrase ""you're a good girl"" over and over again with slightly different wording. I've since moved on to an rp video where ""my girlfriend"" notices I'm feeling dysphoric and comforts me. The problem is that during the video I feel great; feminine and acknowledged. But after the video finishes and when I wake up the next morning I feel incredibly lonely and sad because it seems sad that I have to resort to a youtube video to feel any sort of gender affirmation or romantic affection. It doesn't help that my two best friends are both in happy relationships that they bring up all the time while I just have to sit there and act happy for them.

Had some hiccups, but we still talk, and his wife who I'm really good friends with too.  Lately I've noticed 3 of my friends don't communicate that much on our group chat, haven't made any plans to hang out or video chat, and are basically MIA. It's been months (3 months ) since I've talked to 3 of those friends. I wouldn't count commenting on a post or liking a post on social media as communication. If I say something, only Gary and his wife would respond. The others read the message, but don't say anything. I've noticed lately that those two of those friends have a real problem of bottling things up and snap to your face randomly. If I made a mistake, please tell me and we can talk this out like adults. Mistakes happen and we learn from it. Another thing is that it's always something going out with those two aka drama and the world as to revolve around them. 

I'm at that age where I don't want this anymore. I want communication, maturity, no drama, treating everyone right...etc. Those three friends especially the two lack everything. Should I just drop them as friends or just minimally stay in their lives? I don't want them being part of my lives nor do I have any interest being part of their lives.

394,"Hello, hope this is the right place to post this question. If not please let me know, and I do apologize. Also, if there is another thread like this, please let me know too.

I'm about to enter grad school, but have been having doubts and experiencing burn out and disinterest for the last year about the major I chose (it's an art major). 

I'm not really sure what to do now. I've already wasted away my undergrad, and money is not easy to come by. I think I may have been too naive back then when I chose the major. At the time, I believed I could do it. I had my teachers' support, but I think just because my instructors really wanted me to continue studying the major, doesn't mean that I should have gone that route. 

Sometimes, I wish I had stayed with my initial choice, which was to study animal science. But part of the reason I didn't go that route was because I sucked at math and science in high school. (I understood math much better in community college. It was precalc, which I failed in HS) I'm not sure what would have happened if I tried. 

I don't want to disappoint anyone because my instructors have already invested so much time in me to get to this point. It doesn't really mean anything cuz I'm at a mediocre school (I'm trying to save money). I already invested time and financial aid money that can't be taken back. But I feel really unfulfilled and just dead.  When I think about the state of everything, I think that art will not help anyone. 

I don't think I would be able to be successful in this career path now.

395,"Hi all, this is my first time posting on this subreddit. I want help with an objective look at my situation because it feels like I'm stuck, and I want to see if there's a way forward that I'm missing.

I'm a middle-aged dad and I've experienced severe depression all my life. I can't really overstate how serious it is, but that's not what I want to focus on.

I've been working on solutions and strategies against the depression my whole life and I feel like I've hit a bit of a plateau currently. The present situation is that I feel ok a third of the time, am uneasy a third of the time and am depressed a third of the time (roughly).

I live alone, and I'm an immigrant. As my username suggests I come from the UK originally. I have two children in this new country. I'm also diagnosed with autism.

Right now I'd say my overwhelming problem is that when I'm not looking after my children I feel worthless and as though life has no real meaning. Sometimes I can work on projects that give me something of that feeling, but my day-job doesn't do that for me; rather it's depressing for me.

So like I said, I feel stuck. It's like for every need I have, there's something stopping me.

I'd like to have a circle of close friends, but my autism makes socialising extremely unpleasant. I'd like to find a more meaningful job, but since I'm an immigrant and autistic I've had no luck in my applications and because of my children I don't dare risk unemployment or starting my own business. Likewise my autism and my childcare responsibilities make it hard for me to develop an interesting side project because I don't have the energy.



Based on what I've said, do you see any way forward for me that I've not noticed? Any perspectives appreciated. 



To answer some possible questions: I'm already on medication and in a queue for therapy services; I've had quite a lot of therapy already. I stay physically fit and don't drink alcohol, to keep my energy levels as high as possible. I'm also studying as much as I can, to improve my chances of different employment and find friends, but after a year, no luck.",21Jun2020,1

399,"i need to know if what i‚Äôm experiencing within this relationship would be considered red flags.

to preface this, the guy who i (f 19) am with now (m 20) has been my boyfriend for only about three months. before we began a relationship we were off and on best friends for 7 years, mostly depending on my relationship status with other guys. throughout all of this, he has had feelings for me that were never reciprocated up until recently. And throughout those 7 years of friendship i was well aware of his feelings for me. 
When we first began our romantic relationship, everything seemed fine. but over the past three months a few things have happened that concern me- only i‚Äôm not sure if my own issues with commitment are the problem or if he is being controlling. 
1. he has made me block all ex boyfriends on social media, even ones i am in good standing with and still friends with. 
2. will not let me hang out with an entire friend group because a guy who used to like me is part of the group
3. has made me delete all past instagram posts and stories with ex boyfriends, even if it was a group picture. 
4. constantly checks my snapchat score. for example: we will be hanging out, he leaves the room, and checks my snap score while he is out of the room to see if i talk to anyone else
5.  overall gets extremely angry when i hang out with anyone other than him. he wants to spend every day together. also gets mad on days that i don‚Äôt want to hang out with anyone including him.
6. gets angry if i don‚Äôt ask permission from him before doing certain things.
7. wants to move in together within the next month. 
8. when he is angry with me, he degrades me and calls me names. for example: when i asked to go hang out with friends he got mad at me and made implications that i am a slut because of the outfit i was wearing. (jean shorts and a t-shirt. seriously) he also has a tendency to say ‚Äúf*ck off, f*ck you, shut up, cunt‚Äù, etc. 
9. every single time i pick up my phone around him he makes a comment along the lines of ‚Äúoh, you texting one of tye hoes?‚Äù

that‚Äôs pretty much the general idea of everything that bothers me. some of it may seem insignificant but when all added up every little thing seems so suffocating. but my question is this, am i holding too much on to the past and not fully committing, or is he being irrational and controlling? 

what should i do?",21Jun2020,1
400,"So I woke up about 2 hours ago and have stayed in bed because when I get up I have to go wish my stepdad for fathers day and give him a gift. Doing this takes a lot out of me. We don't get along very well, mostly because we have clashing personalities and because he wants a relationship that's more intimate than what I'm willing. He wants a father-son type of relationship, I don't.
The way I see it, he's just my moms husband. They fell in love and got married, I didn't. He's a good guy and all, he gets angry easily over little things which annoys the shit out of me, but overall he's not a bad guy and never gets violent with my mother and she seems to be able to handle when he's making a big deal about things that really don't require it. I'm glad they're together because my mom won't be alone when I move out and go my own way. They're married and I'm happy for them. I just don't like that everyone expects me to act as if I fell in love and got married with them. As soon as they got married people started calling him my dad and stuff, but I don't feel that sort of connection to him and it bugs me that everyone insists I should. I support their marriage and have no objections, I accept him as my moms husband, I think that's quite enough.
For context, my biological father never wanted anything to do with me. I naturally have some aversion to father things and so someone trying to weasel their way into that role is just not gonna fly.
I know it makes my stepdad feel bad that I don't accept him in the way he wants but I just don't feel the way everyone wants me to feel about it. The more people tried to force me into it, the more resistant I grew.
So here I am, chilling in bed typing this, they've both walked past my room a few times looking at me expectedly. I'm going to wish him for fathers day and give him a gift, but I'm only doing it because he expects something and if I don't do it then it causes tension in the household and eventually it gets to my mom. I feel stressed as heck. I do this every year and every year I dread it. It feels so insincere and I hate that I do it because I feel I have to do it to maintain peace rather than because I want to do it.
Am I bad because of this? I don't feel particularly bad. I support the marriage and accept that he's my moms husband, I just don't want him as a father, and I think that's perfectly fine. But everyone in the family treats me as the villain in the movie whenever this topic comes up. So am I bad because of this?",21Jun2020,1

Second is that I miss my little siblings I could go into detail about why but it'd turn into a 20 page essay.

Since 6 years back I've dealt with accepting I'm someone's assaulter I was thinking about killing myself over it but ended up stoping myself after losing someone else I care about. The situation in question happend when I was 14 and 17 without going into to too much detail I sexual assaulted someone close to me repeatedly when I was 14 without understanding the ramifications of my actions and the trauma. The other was when I was 17 and I assaulted someone who was drunk. I asked for consent but she was  tired and drunk while I was just tired. She thought she was raped until i told her what happend. At the time I didn't do it with malicious intent but I had a horrible lack of understanding of what is considered consent. And that hurt someone that I knew well. 


The latest year I've been accepting my past more and more accepting that I'm not that person today I've also talked about it with close friends recent being a casual partner. They give me the benefit ofthe  doubt but they are close to me so its easy for them. I'm also trying to meet a professional that i feel comfortable talking about it with since its a bit hard atm. Overall things sre improving but at the same time the more I read about victims story and educate myself about rape culture the more the thought about my future actions as abuser comes up on my mind. The discord around abuser often brings up about how the abuser needed punishment to stop harming future victims or victims asking if they should out their abuser in hopes to get closer/protect others. I'm not going to lie I'm afraid of that situation. Feels cowardly to say and I wish I could just accept it as my punishment for being a horrible monster but I can't. The thoughts governs my actions everyday. I say no to career goals. I am afraid of making new partners/friends. And I get anxiety when people give me compliments of me as a person. It makes me not want to exist because the idea that I need to tell my partner about my past when I'm not ready,  or thar I get fired because I'm getting outed online or that my victims still thinks that im that horrible person. Yeah those are just things that make me fall into crippling depression. I apologized to them both and I wish I could do it again (it was a pathetic apology) but they dont want to talk about it. 

So what should I do? I want to be a better human but the discord about abuser is often that they need to stopped or canceld.

411,"I'm going to preface this text post by saying: It's 4:08am as I type this sentence, I start my 9 hour shift in four hours. It is obviously formatted on mobile. This post may be triggering to those who suffer from depression or anxiety. Sorry &lt;3

I am 16 years old, and I suffer from chronic depression diagnosed in late 2015. Doctors said I would be on medication for a year, and five years later I've switched medications and therapists more times than I can count on my finger. Yay. I am not suicidal currently, and I've been SH clean for 6 months.

Since I'm getting older now, I've learnt things about my parents that really, really scare me. My mother has a benign brain tumor, which I've known about since I was 12. Although she has medication, I worry that one of these coming days everything will change and she'll undergo surgeries galore.
My father has a pinched nerve in his left elbow, which disabled him six years ago. He is unemployed and suffers from the same form of depression I do. He doesn't have any friends and is in constant pain from his disability and  terminal pain. Sometimes I cry walking home from work or school, believing I'll walk in the door to my fathers dead body next to a suicide note, because I often hear him telling my mom he can't live like he does anymore. 

All of these things roused severe anxiety and its starting to really really push in on me recently. I sob in the bathroom at work wishing I could hurt myself again. My minimum wage job is draining, and I'm constantly yelled at by elderly people about things I cannot control. I feel worthless, undesired and wish everything would just go back to how it was, when I was 11 and knew nothing.

Is there anything coping wise I can do on the spot in the workplace, or possibly alone in my room that can not only help me sleep at night, but calm me down quick enough to get back on the floor at my job as soon as possible? My boss is sincere and understanding, but my managers are not, and I need the money to help support myself and the family.
Also, yes I see a therapist, I just haven't seen her since COVID-19 as their institution shut down due to health and safety, and have nobody to turn to anymore.",21Jun2020,1
412,"Background - we're a family of 5. My mum has severe rheumatoid arthritis across her whole body and has had ~ 30 surgeries (tough woman!) My dad is not the most educated, he left school at 13 to work on the family business and has been running his own business since 16 when his dad died. 
In 2017 my dad got diagnosed with cancer (throat and jaw) 
Then there's my aunt (dad's sister) who lives with us and she's working at a grocery store and is counted as a key worker during the pandemic. She's been doing 12hr shifts  x 7 days. 
I live at a different location during the week for work and come back for the rest of the week. 

My brother is studying law and for as long as I can remember, he's wanted to be involved in law/politics and he wants to be a barrister.
Before he started his degree, he had to take a gap year and he used that year to help run my dad's business while dad went through cancer treatments. 
Weeks before, dad's storage unit burnt down and we lost all our stock. So it was starting from scratch and we aren't wealthy by a long stretch. We tend to live paycheck to paycheck. 
Cut a long story short, my brother works for my dad for a year then goes straight to uni. 
He claims that dad hasn't paid his minimum wage for his time working for the business. 
When you have a conversation with my brother, he has no emotion attached to him and he talks as if we are in a court room. His language is very ""legal"" and he cites a lot of laws and regulations. 
He's not helping a stressful situation whereby my dad (vulnerable person) is forced to go to work now as we don't have another income whereas my brother sits at home all day/night and doesn't help round the house or get a job. He is now 21. 
Rightfully, dad told him he has to get a job and start contributing towards the bills and threw out a figure of ¬£80 per week. 
My brother lost his shit and brought up all the times when he worked for my dad for free and how my dad hasn't paid him. 
He also brought up the grocery shopping he does and all the times he spent his own money to buy groceries for the house. He's got a full excel sheet with values since 2016. 

Keep in mind, my brother does not pay for any bills around the house at all.

I tried to talk to him multiple times, and for example, he got an internship starting Monday. He refused to tell me anything about it due to ""GDPR"" regulations. 

A week ago, my dad needed his help to draft a letter and he charged my dad ¬£75 for it. 

His behaviour doesn't help 2 vulnerable parents who are extremely stressed out with the covid situation and financial situation. Having him (an adult) add to this and stress them out even more is painful to see. 

I was discussing this with him yesterday and he refused to leave the dining room where our mum was trying to eat, she got up and left and he didn't care. 
He makes my mum cry and bang her head on the wall (physically!!) He doesn't care... 

How can I get through to him?",21Jun2020,1

415,"We‚Äôve been dating for about 8 months now. I‚Äôm 20, he‚Äôs 40. For the past 2 months, I‚Äôve been overthinking the relationship and whether I want to be in it. I care about him. I think he‚Äôs amazing and I‚Äôm attracted to him, yet something feels off suddenly. I want it to be made clear that age gaps are 100% normal and acceptable. I think my feelings might be a displaced for other hidden issues in the relationship itself. 
(Were both guys) 

I just abruptly starting overthinking the gap. As someone that‚Äôs been abused before, seeing everyone around me in ‚Äúregular‚Äù relationships, and then realizing I‚Äôm ashamed of telling them about my boyfriend because they‚Äôd freak out... it just makes me feel really shitty about myself, and the fact that I don‚Äôt have the balls to stand up to them. 

Context for the relationship:

1) Our sex life is dull no matter how hard I try. It only consists of mutual BJs and kissing. 

2) I haven‚Äôt said I love you yet. I was really hurt before in my relationship, so I put a guard up. But the fact that I still haven‚Äôt said it 8 months later has been adding stress and overthinking to the matter. 

3) the past two weeks he‚Äôs been more clingy, which I understand. But as I‚Äôm nearing my finals exams after a semester with corona... I‚Äôm freaking out. He wants to meet 4 times a week and I don‚Äôt have the time. I guess we have different expectations and needs. 

4) I‚Äôm used to having him around. I care about him so fucking much. I just know that if I end it I‚Äôm gonna end up hurting him really badly. 


He‚Äôs a genuine, kind person. So I don‚Äôt understand why the age suddenly became a problem. I just started overthinking the fact that he‚Äôs older and feeling about it out of the blue. And even worse, recently his touch brought back my PTSD/flashbacks. 

I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs so frustrating because I can‚Äôt figure this whole thing out, and I can‚Äôt even write I out. I really just wanna figure out what I should do. I literally posted about this like 2.5 months ago, and I‚Äôm still having the same dilemmas.",21Jun2020,1
416,"Hey y'all, apologizing in advance for the novel. 

I'm a 20 year-old male college student and a Navy vet, to give you a starting idea of who I am. I left for the Navy a month after I graduated high school, when I was still 17. I had no issues getting through boot camp or to my first station in Charleston, South Carolina, where I spent 6 months in the Navy's nuclear field ""A"" school. I graduated that in May 2018, and about 2 months later had some catastrophic medical issues that derailed my Navy career, leading to an honorable discharge in March 2019.

After that, I worked at the VA until October as a receptionist for the hearing department, then enrolled for my freshman semester of college for Spring 2020. Shortly after school began, one of the doctors I had been seeing recommended a pacemaker, which I got implanted in February. Nothing else really notable has happened since.

What I'm getting at is this: I have lived what feels to me like an entire decade in the last 3 years. I have grown and matured both emotionally and physically. Why, then, do I still feel like a high school kid?

This manifests itself in not only the way that I see myself, but in the way I talk to people, in the way I present myself, and even in the way I feel towards others my own age. Because I can't see myself mentally as an adult, I feel like it's reflected in the way everyone else I know sees me. I feel, to a degree, like everyone else I know has at least some idea of what they're doing, where they're going, who they want to be, and how they want to achieve it. Meanwhile, I'm essentially still mentally stuck in high school. It's been 5 years since they told us to start planning for careers, and I *still* have no actual idea of what I want to do aside from the unrealistic dream of being a professional sports photographer (which I discovered recently), and even though I know I've changed over the past few years, it doesn't feel like it. I feel like a child masquerading as an adult and it feels like I'm headed towards disaster and failure.

Is this normal for someone my age? Even if it is, how can I fix it? It's so uncomfortable and quite honestly depressing.

Thanks in advance, y'all.",21Jun2020,1

419,"Hello, I'm in grade 11 now heading into grade 12 next year. When i was in grades 8-10 i had severe tourettes and was unable to do school work and resorted to doing it at home or in the resource room with support workers. Midway through grade 10 i was able to maintain the tics, lose all the weight from medication, be happy, i pulled a hard 180 in my life. But as my support worker training wheels were taken off i found it hard to do work. I HEAVILY procrastinate, and put minimal effort into my school work. From all the school work I've missed i am a bit behind in some of my courses and actively trying to catch up during the summer and have a loaded timetable for next year. I try my hardest to sit down and try to just ""GO"", but cant find enough motivation to do so. I also find it very difficult to sit down, open my textbook and take notes. Whenever i sit down and try and do the work my brain just hits a wall. And when I'm stuck i rapidly lose motivation and take the easy way out by either cheating or barely trying. I end up with grades that aren't amazing but aren't terrible. Now i understand school inst a walk in the park but i want to have that feeling of actual accomplishment. Not only do i want this for myself but my parents put in so much effort to help my schooling but i never pay my do's and complete my half of the work. I heavily believe this all comes from me being lazy, plain and simple. What can i do to find that motivation to do well in my schooling? Especially in college.",21Jun2020,1
420,"First post- please bear with me. I‚Äôll try to be brief. Dated who I thought would be my husband for 10 months and they were incredible. We quarantined together. Both of us are former addicts: opiates/heroin. He had many years clean and we met at an outpatient support group. Started as friends.

I didn‚Äôt know he relapsed. I found that out recently but he was bitten by a brown recluse spider (truly) and his leg turned black. He wouldn‚Äôt even tele-conference with a dr and his response was that I wanted him gone so I could cheat. I‚Äôve never cheated on him in my life.

The situation and my inability to help drove me crazy and I broke up witH him begging to get some counseling so we can figure this out.  He didn‚Äôt but everything was fine. We talking about certain things, he packed up and drove back home out of state.

One month ago with no warning whatsoever I almost died. I had a bowel obstruction and it caused full organ failure. I had to have 10 hr emergency surgery where they redid my Insides and I was in hospital 9 days. Went to my moms After bc I couldn‚Äôt do anything. No drive, lift, twist or bend. 

2 weeks ago I go to my condo with a friend and see so much was gone- my cleaning supplies that I had slowly built up, pictures of my
Father and me, bottles of wine I would
Never have opened From my father year I was born. Thst night he od‚Äôs and get into a horrible
Accident out of state and had no id on him. I learn then he relapsed bc I was emergency contact and tell paramedics over the phone he had been an iv heroin user and narcan worked on him. I can. Hear him and he‚Äôs apologizing and saying my name crying that he‚Äôs going to die. Paramedics can‚Äôt tell me where they are
Taking him bc they need a massive trauma center so I use ‚Äúfind my iPhone‚Äù and find him. His pics are linked
And I see all my
Possessions staged to sell, my purses, sunglasses
And jewelry on random girls I‚Äôve never seen before. He took my muse that I use for anxiety, my home alarm system, rosaries from my family in Italy, my
Shoes- worst part is he took all my journals and he‚Äôs basically blackmailing me. I wrote all of them in the height of my addiction and talked about my double life and if I don‚Äôt do what he says- he will publish. (This between telling me he should‚Äôve killed me when he had the chance and I should kill myself.‚Äù I changed every account but he took checkbooks and I have like 9k missing from my retirement and checking. I‚Äôm in Detroit-Police aren‚Äôt interested in a multi state chase. Zero help thus far. I contacted his parents and they sent me
Some of my things but there‚Äôs so much missing. I need my journals and all my 12-step stuff I feel so violated from that and my money. I take care of my
71 year old mom and 91 year old grandma- they don‚Äôt have money and this was set aside to hire a home nurse hopefully post covid. I still tak to him to try and work on this- when I bring it up he just says I only care about money and I‚Äôm a dumb bitch who will die alone. (He was never ever like that). What would you do? Seriously. At this point I‚Äôm out all my personal belongings - he even took my winter jackets and 3-year -old nasty ugh boots. I‚Äôll eventually rebuild my clothes and life but this was a shock. 

TL; DR- Ex relapsed, took all my
Posessions, money and worst of all my journals from addiction and al my recovery work. He now
Knows all my secrets and threatens blackmail.

422,"I'm reaching out because I feel like I'm at a crossroads where I really need to decide once and for all what I'm doing after undergrad.

To further explain, I was dead set on applying to med school after undergrad. It's still my top choice. However, due to an Aspergers rumor at my campus that got out of hand in undergrad, (mainly as I'm a female and it's rare), I found that I was denied many opportunities due to the stigma and encountered many situations in which I was bullied by faculty for the *suspected* condition. (Keep in mind that I've gone to multiple psychologists/professionals who said I didn't have the condition and a lot of my personality can be attributed to depression, severe bullying, and trauma due to the hospitalizations of a family member.) That being said, I'm worried because I *know* that this will keep me from getting positive letters of recommendation which are an important piece of medical school admissions.

As a back up, I've been considering law school for a while. Ironically, this is the only field that I feel like I could get a letter of rec due to the label. The only caveat is that if I decide to go that route, I'd be delaying graduation by a year to ensure that I could pad my gpa with as many fluff classes as I can as law admissions is solely GPA and LSAT based. The only thing I really have going for me in this route is that I've gotten better at advocating for myself because of what happened above and could probably get letters of rec vouching for argumentation/writing skills.

Tbh I'd really appreciate any advice regarding what route I should take. My friends think the law school route is a cop out, which it is, but I don't want to have to explain/feel comfortable explaining the above to them. However, I'm not sure if applying to med school would be worth it with this set back; if I know I don't have a chance, why try?",21Jun2020,1

428,"Just had a mental breakdown, I'm starting to think I have problems with controlling the way I eat or even just the way I perceive food and I don't know what to do about it. Had a small get together the other day, bought a decently sized cake. It's about 4:15 AM at the time I'm writing this. At about 1 AM, I walked to the kitchen and got a glass of water. I went on my computer a bit, walked back out to get some more water at about 1:30 AM. Only, this time, I remembered that in the other room there's still half a cake left. Without thinking, I went into the room and cut myself a piece of cake. I started eating it. I don't know how to describe it, but I distinctively felt like I had to finish it. It didn't even make me feel good or anything, I just felt like I had to finish it. I even sort of felt like I didn't want to, but I still felt that I had to. All of a sudden, I got the strangest urge - my dad had mentioned the movie Fatso starring Dom DeLuise a few days ago, it's about 2 AM at this point, I have the strangest urge to go and watch it. Not even 8 minutes into the film, I start bawling. I just start crying my eyes out, I pause the film and just sit there sobbing. I keep thinking about that damned piece of cake I just ate. I start thinking about how, whenever I'm bored, I go and look for a snack to eat or something like that. at about 3:30 AM, I start calming down a bit.   


I don't know why the hell this happened. It's happened once before too, a few weeks ago - I posted about it on a different site, although it didn't get many responses I don't think. I was browsing /mu/ on 4chan, saw a thread - super stupid running gag about changing the lyrics of Beatles songs to food with photoshopped images of The Beatles but chubby, very cleverly titled ""the eatles"". I thought it was kind of funny at first, even though it was extremely low IQ humor. I screencapped it and sent it to a friend. Later that day I had the odd urge to search up clips of My 600 Pound Life, the reality show. I spend about 30 minutes watching that, and after that I tried going to sleep, only I can't. I start fucking bawling, thinking about this stuff. Not even relating to me, just fat people in general, the people I know and love in my life who happen to be fat, even fucking feederism, just bawling in my bed alone thinking about this. I sincerely didn't know what came over me, it took a while for me to feel exhausted enough to fall asleep.  


The thing is, I don't even think I'm necessarily fat. I'm 5'8"" and 175 lbs at 18 years old, which, sure, I'm not the skinniest, but I definitely don't think I'm fat.

First off, thank you for sorting by new. I'll just jump right into it: after an incident, my brother (20) is currently hospitalized, has extreme difficulty speaking and controlling his movements/hands, mainly in part to tremors (unintentional trembling/shaking). He means a lot to me and I just want to do my best to help him in any way possible, I have no doubt in my mind that he will push through this and regain self control, as he has been improving day after day (has been hospitalized for 7 days now). I can see on his face that the lack of control is immensely frustrating. The family and I plan on buying him an iPad to help with speech/physical therapy (also per request of the therapists). He has yet to start with said therapy, I believe he starts this coming week. I started doing little things like buying him a stress ball for his hand when he can't stop clenching. He struggles to get words out and using devices will take some getting used to again for him; but I KNOW he can do it with time. Does anybody have any advice that could help in the meantime? Perhaps there are yes/no questions that I am missing when talking to him, some that I wouldn't think of that you may know, or maybe you know of someone else who has struggled with similar ailments? What helped them most? He has the love and support of my family, we check in on him and visit every day. Thank you very much for your time and energy today.",21Jun2020,1

431,"Hi. I‚Äôm a female and I have this friend I‚Äôve known for about 4 years or so (since high school) and I‚Äôve always felt like we were close and always had a good time together, but I‚Äôm not sure if she is being sincere.

I used to try to text her but she always answered really late and never tried to strike up conversations. On the contrary, when we would meet up (I was usually the one suggesting it, or it‚Äôs through a group of friends), I feel like we actually have a great time? About a year ago, we met up and had a deep conversation we never had before, and I felt like we connected even more.

At first, I just thought that she‚Äôs bad at texting and that it is not a big deal, but after some time, I realized that she would actively text others and meet up with them, except me.

Right now, we haven‚Äôt talked for quite a while, and I would think that she would maybe try to text? But she never did. At this point, I‚Äôm just not bothering with her although I do wonder how she‚Äôs doing, especially during this quarantine.

It‚Äôs weird though because we‚Äôre in a group chat together and when she‚Äôs being nice to me I feel like she‚Äôs being fake. I feel like it‚Äôs not really the way she feels about me.

Maybe she never liked me as a friend from the beginning? I don‚Äôt know what to think. It‚Äôs fine if we‚Äôre perhaps drifting apart, but I just wish she would be more straightforward with me. All of this is a lot more awkward since we are part of the same group of friends from high school, and if I tried to cut her off, it would just make things uncomfortable for everyone. Not only that but our families are close as well.

I really don‚Äôt know how to take it. Am I overthinking? Am I being clingy, or selfish?

432,"I (20f) live with my bf (20m) since I was kicked out the day after high school graduation. He has finished his first year of college, and I took two years off to work and support him as we get no help from his parents either except for a place to live. I‚Äôve been his driver, the one responsible food and groceries, and I pay small rent and also most things we buy so that his money can focus on school. This year I‚Äôm going to school to become an LPN, which is only a year, but for me to do that my money and time can no longer be solely focused on him. So the problem is, we‚Äôd really like to move out and not share a house with a lot of other...very strange people. We found an affordable place very close to all the things we need to get to. We can afford it, BUT, he would have no way to get to school on his own. Here‚Äôs the choices - 

Option 1, we stay at his house for another year, which would save money for sure. I go through school, he sees if his parents could drive him to his school until he gets a car and license, which would also be affordable in this situation. 

Option 2, we move out and he takes a gap year. He‚Äôs said he likes the sound of a year off where he could focus on himself and hopefully get a job, which would mean we would have a lot of spare money (all his savings and all he makes) to definitely live comfy and get him a car and license while I‚Äôm going through school. Cons, his friends move ahead of him in school but he only really has one that he hangs with and they don‚Äôt have the same classes anyway. I also really want him to stay in school, but at the same time I‚Äôve taken two years off to support him, maybe he could take one year off now?

It‚Äôs very important that I go to school this year, after I graduate I‚Äôll be making a lot more than I am now, so that‚Äôs the priority. We‚Äôve always talked about moving out, our living situation is pretty bad right now...dirty, crowded, depressing. But should we stay there and try to handle the stress of that as well as both of us going to school, or would a year off for him not be terrible? To clarify, we can afford this place now just with or savings, the main problem is just him getting to school which I can‚Äôt be on the hook for anymore, also if we had all his savings to buy furniture and his income to save for next school year and a car, we could be pretty well set. 

What should we do? We don‚Äôt want to live where we are anymore and we can afford a nice, central place to ourselves, but is it more worth it to try and stick it out one more year with his parents?",21Jun2020,1

436,"I just went to a good friends party and idk maybe bc it was my first day being with a lot of people again, and I felt kind of out of place (even with alcohol in me). And nothing notable happened but sometimes I would find myself being on my phone and what not, and I just felt off. I just feel really insecure about people not liking me and growing up my dad would make fun of me, and I didn‚Äôt have the best highschool experience. This feeling happen sometimes and I just can‚Äôt help but pick myself apart and judge myself harshly, maybe bc my dad would sometimes pick me apart with the meanest insults. 

And today what hurt my feelings is someone didn‚Äôt like the music I was playing (since I try to always be on the aux), and it‚Äôs not even that big of deal bc like 10 seconds after I changed the selection then people gave me props, but idk why that bothered me so much. 

I chatted with a couple people but idk maybe it‚Äôs in my head but I didn‚Äôt feel like anybody really wanted to talk to me except for one or two people. And the thing is I also kind of feel that what I‚Äôm thinking is bullshit and I had an alright time with some laughs, but i just felt a little awkward.

I just feel so troubled sometimes and like my mind is my worse enemy, and I just want to hide in a corner and shut down. I often times think about past embarrassing things and I‚Äôll play them in a loop in my head, to the point where I have to tell myself out loud to stop.

It‚Äôs been especially rough since quarantine and I don‚Äôt exercise anymore and my whole routine and lifestyle completely changed, but idk if I can blame that since it‚Äôs already been three months.

440,"After a doctor told us my older sister had some autistic traits (apparently not enough to get diagnosed with autism I guess?) I started to learn more about autism and how to understand someone with autism and how girls have an easier time hiding their traits. I started to realize how the weird things about me that I started to hide when I got older were common in people with autism/aspergers 

I always eat the same foods at restaurants because I just can't bring myself to try anything new, 
I can't eat certain foods because of their texture and would have panic attacks if I had to eat the food (I always hid this from my parents of course cause I was scared) 
some textures in clothes ect. are also wrong feeling and I can't wear those clothes

 I have a huge intrest (my dad calls it an obsession from time to time) in fnaf (a video game) 

I never knew how to hold eye contact, I just learned to copy the person I was talking to,

when I get overwhelmed with emotions I feel like a child, and do certain things (like take extremely small sips from my drink) that I did as a child. 

Stroking(?) My dads fingernails, and just playing with his hand calms me down, I also stroke fluffy blankets, my own nails, smooth rocks, ect (what ever feels good) 

I LOVE collecting rocks and shells
I always say out loud the brand of a car if I can remember it, it calms me down

I am extremely sensitive when it comes to my senses, I can sometimes smell or hear things others can't, if someone or something touches/brushes against me without me allowing it, I get very irritated and anxious

I have difficulty socializing, I hate socalizing and try to avoid it whenever I can, I hate small talk but have learned it trough the years as my older sister has selective muteism (just can't speak in certain situations) 
I always pay attention to detail, when I see an imperfection in something it's all I think about

These are the ones that I have noticed, and things O have slowly begun talking about to my family and my therapist (just a few of these, not all)

I have depression, anxiety and panic disorder so I'm scared these thing will be dismissed as traits of those, even if I have had these things my whole life, should I talk to a doctor about this or am I just reading into this too much?",21Jun2020,1

I‚Äôm esthetically white; since I was little i‚Äôve always preferred darker dolls, then growing up (around 10 years old) I started to listen more and  more to music made by black people, my favorite models were black and so on
Most of my black friends always tell me ‚Äúi am black inside‚Äù (as a joke OBVIOUSLY, but they just say that because they always say I love everything they love -and not intentionally ofc-and that‚Äôs amazing)
I was very happy and unaware since today: since black emojis came out, i‚Äôve ALWAYS used those, none of my black friends called me out and we were all fine with it
Today instead, i was talking with a girl about it and she told me she doesn‚Äôt like it, and she‚Äôs not the only one
So i did a quick research and there is a whole topic on why it shouldn‚Äôt be done and i started feeling so bad about it, because i‚Äôm so into race problems and i always stand up for minorities 
Now, the main thing: i feel weird just thinking about using white emojis, and I don‚Äôt know why.
For how stupid it may seem, it‚Äôs just like I don‚Äôt feel represented by it.
I am very aware of my white privilege but i really want to understand psychologically why i feel uncomfortable using white emojis...maybe that‚Äôs because i‚Äôve had black role models for my whole life?
Just so you know, I am aware I have African ancestors and I do everything I can to honor their memory.

We fell out of touch because I professed my love to her at school, and she friendzoned me, and I was too scared to talk to her afterwards. She didn't seem to care enough to try and talk to me after my stupid little confession, and that was in school like 2 weeks before quarantine started.

This might be TMI..

I met this guy through tinder a year ago. We started talking and decided to meet up. He tells me he‚Äôs always had this fantasy to fuck a stranger in the dark &amp; wanted to do that with me. I decided to meet him cause it seemed thrilling. I met him and it was amazing the first time for me. For him I couldn‚Äôt get him hard I couldn‚Äôt understand why and I kept getting frustrated at myself. We met the second time / I‚Äôm into the whole dom/sub lifestyle. Because he was my dom at that moment he said I wouldn‚Äôt get anything until I don‚Äôt satisfy him. I was okay with the whole chocking and grabbing part of it until his slaps actually hurt me. My ears would ring everytime he slapped me. There was a time where he had also punched me &amp; when I asked he said no I just grabbed you really hard. And when he was degrading me he kept saying I‚Äôm worthless and I don‚Äôt deserve sex. That was hard to here cause that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve told myself - that I‚Äôm worthless. I did tell him in between that his slaps hurt and he laughed and said I deserved it. At that point I didn‚Äôt react - I just froze. Towards the end I kept telling him to touch me or to get me off and he kept saying. I know I was whining a lot and I just got out of the bed and started wearing my clothes. I then went towards him and told him I was leaving - still very whiny and he grabbed me by my hair and put me on the bed and chocked me I could tell he was really angry/annoyed with me. He yelled and asked me to shut up or he‚Äôll hit me. He tried to calm himself down and then asked me to leave and that he‚Äôll make it up to me tomorrow. 

We texted after that and he was mean and kept blaming me for everything that happened and that he was so disappointed in me. At that point I was okay to never see him again - I anyway had no idea what he looked like. Until he texted me again and asked me to come see him so we could give this another go. I ended up going. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have - I had a thing of putting myself in bad situations. He was very confusing - when I would lay next to him we would talk about our lives, values, what we believed in and he would cuddle me. But on text I couldn‚Äôt recognize him. He would turn into someone else. 

After a few times we met I asked him when can I actually see his face since he had seen mine through the light coming from the window. I always had to have a blindfold on when he was in the room. To that he said why, aren‚Äôt you enjoying what we have. By that time I thought I was falling for him and wanted to tell him that I want to see your face cause I want more than just casual sex. 

He stopped talking to me or asking me to come meet him for a month..I went for the last time where he said I‚Äôll get to see him and that we need to talk. I went and he made me give him head and in between he would laugh and say you don‚Äôt even know what I look like - why would you miss me. He then asked me to wait for him in the lobby and I did. He then texts me and says he can‚Äôt come down and that he isn‚Äôt who he says he is. I‚Äôm sitting there just staring at my phone cause I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I felt so ashamed and sick. 

He ended up blocking me and till today idk what he looks like but up until recently if he had texted me again and asked me to meet him I know I would‚Äôve gone back. Even though he said he wanted to do things to me which I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with and I didn‚Äôt give my consent he said as long as you come Into the room that‚Äôs consent for me. 

I found out a few days ago that maybe I had Stockholm Syndrome with him &amp; I was never mad at him for doing all these things. I got mad at myself for allowing this to happen.",21Jun2020,1

472,"Stuck on podcast names!!

Hi


I‚Äôm a 23 year old female and I am finally going to make my own podcast after being pushed into doing it by my friends!


I want my podcast to feel like you are talking to a best friend so wouldn‚Äôt want it to be solely on one topic, but some of the topics I want to talk about is: advice on boys/dating in general, mental health, trauma, body image etc. 


I am just completely stuck on what to call it, any help would be appreciated!!",21Jun2020,1
473,"I am going to be 23 in two months. I'm a guy who never focused on having a social life simply because I considered it something 'optional' and not necessary for life. I spent majority of my time developing hobbies (playing instruments, writing music, gaming, etc.) and trying to improve my skills at what I study.

I am not graduating for a long time and stuck in quarantine - worse because my country has way too many cases than others. I have no source of income, no friends to count on and nothing in particular to look forward to. The only true luxury I have is the peace I find in my fortress of solitude. I dive deep into books, games, shows; basically any form of artistic expression which hones my creative side to. I want to professionally be a designer and writer someday; and that's my focus for life. 

Everything else though, is not satisfying. I had a girlfriend of 4 years and I ended that for many reasons I don't wish to discuss now. I long for female companionship and physical intimacy - its hard to not appear desperate and be confident about myself when there's so much going on inside. 

I never had any form of negative indulgences like alcohol or drugs; so the only form of escapism I would find would be in video-games. At some point, I want to be part of the real world but not sure where to look. What scares me is that I am almost 23 without any bonds or ties other than my own family; whom I love and adore. 

Not sure where I am going, not sure what I'm supposed to do.

tl;dr - 23-year-old someone needs advice on life.",21Jun2020,1
474,"I'm (16f) the eldest of three.

My father has been emotionally neglectful all my life and he constantly yelled at me and made me feel unworthy.

Now, he acts like the best father a person could ask for.

I feel so bad because I can't enjoy his gestures of kindness.

Sometimes, when he does or says something nice to me, I remember the past things he did and I cry.

I start thinking, 'Why couldn't he have been like this before?' Or, 'Why is he doing this now?'

I feel it's unfair to him, because my feelings towards him have also been greatly influenced with my mom who said bad things about him through the years.

He clearly changed a lot, and he doesn't even know that he hurt me that much, I don't know how to improve my relationship with him.",21Jun2020,1

477,"When in a debate, or any situation where I need to verbally defend myself, I freeze up. I get tense, angry, my mind stops working. I literally have trouble creating new thoughts to defend my position. I start to stammer. I think it is related to my background. (27 M, with aggressive abusive mother and absent father, was bulled in high school and had social anxiety for years.)

I can't argue effectively at all when over the phone or in person. But the weird thing is, if it changes to text, written form like an email or by written word, my argument skills are fine. I can generate points, defend positions and attack the other person's argument effectively. But just in person I get ""shell-shocked"" and can't respond, becoming like a dead fish.

Defending one's positions and standing up for oneself in person in the face of criticism is a key life skill, so I would like to learn how I can get better at doing this. Thanks for the advice.",21Jun2020,1
478,"My (23m) gf (23) and I currently study at a University in Germany. She has applied and been accepted to a Scottish University for an exchange programme that will be from September to December. Due to the corona virus situation we both have been very hesitant to go ahead with the preparations.   


My gf fears that she would miss out on a unique experience in a country she has always wanted to stay in for a longer period of time. Also she is at a point in her studies where she's almost finished, so an opportunity like this will likely not come again. At the same time she is worried that most of this 'unique experience' will consits of sitting in a cheap flat and taking part in online lectures.

The University has already confirmed that the exchange students will be welcomed instead of postponing the programme. Should my gf go ahead and just do it or rather stay at home?",21Jun2020,1
479,"The day I feared most has finally come. This might be sort of a long ramble about my life and the situation I'm in. I hope someone with more life experience can give me even the smallest amount of guidance as to what to do.

My parents divorced ever since I was young, and my father did not sign my birth cirtificate so he didn't have to pay a single penny for child support all these years as he wasn't docummented as me being his child. We've always lived at my grandmas while getting 20 eu a month from the government. 

But, about 6 years ago my life completely changed. A woman wanted to watch over us. She was going to watch over us until I was able to grow up and get a job to watch over my family on my own. My life did a 180, I have lived the life of a normal kid; Buying whatever I want, partying, dating, working out etc. She apparently watched over us for religious reasons, to look good in the eyes of God or whatever. But now, something ticked on her and after arguing with my mother about some video and blocked us on everything.

She cut our only source of income prematurely. I turned 18 a few weeks ago and I'm becoming a senior this year. I can't rely on a job from here as the max I would make is 300 EU, our rent alone would be 200 and the bills exceed 100.

I was thinking of applying for a US Work Visa to go to the US and work there. I have no clue as to how I would go about doing that, would I even be eligible as I don't own any businesses nor specific work skills. I have familly in CT so that's where I want to be headed.

482,"I am a 24 year old woman. When I was 17, I got involved into a relationship with a 14 year old boy who I dated for 6 months to a year, I don‚Äôt really remember the time frame because my brain tried to block all of this out. It is important to note that I did turn 18 while we were dating. He was my best friend‚Äôs cousin and this was mostly a long distance relationship. My best friend knew about our relationship, voiced her disapproval, but ultimately said ‚ÄúI am happy that you‚Äôre happy‚Äù. 

I remember I really loved him and cared about him, but after growing up realize that I was a predator. Our virtual relationship consisted of sexting, exchanging pictures and videos, and even sexual video calls on FaceTime. He was 14, I was 17. When his family was in town for the holidays I conducted a plan where he snuck out of his house and had sex with me in my parent‚Äôs car. I also conducted another plan where he met me at a hiking trail and we had sex in the dirt. I think for one of these encounters, if not both, I had already turned 18 (he did turn 15 but that doesn‚Äôt change how wrong this is). The time that he snuck out, his parents woke up and asked him where he went. Basically, they found out what happened and left town earlier than they were planning. Before they left, they found a way to contact and meet with my parents in a park (without my knowledge) and told them everything. They told my parents that they initially wanted to call the police but then put themselves in my parents shoes and decided not to. My parents tried to talk to me about it but I shut them down and told them I never wanted to hear about it again. To this day, they‚Äôve never brought it up again. 

I started realizing how wrong this situation was only a couple years after it happened. I tried to block it out and I was in denial that I might have statutory raped him or groomed him or something really terrible. At the very least, statutory rape is rape. 

I have also been a victim of sexual assault and rape multiple times throughout my life. I‚Äôm finally ready to fully accept and talk about what I did. This story has been very heavy on my heart for so many years. I guess my question is, how do I stop hating myself and move on from this? I don‚Äôt have any contact with him anymore because my best friend‚Äôs family rightfully shunned me. Since I am victim from previous situations, I know from experience that receiving apologies from your abuser does not help take the pain away... I honestly don‚Äôt even know if he perceives it as a messed up situation like I do. I am not sure if he was ever in pain over this because our encounters appeared to be consensual (but weren‚Äôt since he was a minor). So since apologizing might not be productive, what can I do for myself? Do I go on forever feeling this way? 

I tried to look for some experiences online of people who realized they were once predators, but I only found stories from male perspectives. I‚Äôm not even sure what I‚Äôm looking for from this post. This is my first time on Reddit. Btw, I am still friends with the best friend and we never talk about it.",21Jun2020,1
483,"This happened yesterday evening and I'm still kind of shaking. I (16F) was just getting ready for bed, changing into my sleeping clothes, when I saw my neighbour (somewhere in his late 20's M) walking down the street going back to his house from walking their dog.

My blinds were a bit open and a light was on. I never really mind changing with the blinds open, because I always thought you can't see anyone from down there and we live in a very quiet street.

I was shirtless, just about to put my shirt on, when I saw him. I saw him look up at me and then kind of looked away. Then he kept looking and I tried to hide a bit. I thought he was gone so I went back up and I saw him taking out his phone and putting it sideways and pointed the camera at my window. At this point, I was frozen and still shirtless, but I obviously hid my body from his view. I peaked my head up and saw him now in front of his house, next to ours. He still had his phone like he was filming or taking a picture. He was cleaning his camera with his shirt too, so he was definitely taking a picture or something. I tried to get a look at him and saw him now pointing the camera at his house. Keep in mind it was dark outside and I have no clue why he would take a picture of his own house when you can't even see it that well. After I turned my light off to hopefully let him know I saw him, I saw through the reflection of a car that he got inside his house.

I honestly don't know what to do. I always thought that you couldn't see someone in my room from down the street. I don't know if I'm just overreacting or if this really happened. My parents and I don't talk much to my neighbours and my parents don't really like them so I'm worried if I mention this to them, that they're gonna go up to my neighbours and yell or something. I'm scared, but I don't think he had enough time to actually get me on camera. I would like some advice on what to do, or if I should just leave this alone.",21Jun2020,1

486,"So I got out of what I thought was a serious relationship in February. She broke with me but didn't tell me I did anything wrong. Most of our post break up talk was her not letting me find something wrong that I could possibly fix to keep her around. 

I thought she was the one for me and I felt a comfort and love that I never felt in any relationship before. I wanted to be the best that I could be in every aspect of the relationship but it didn't seem to make a difference with her happiness. I spent time after,  very depressed, drinking myself to sleep and barely eating. It was an extremely difficult time since I was also in the last and hardest part of my nursing program. 

Its June now and after 4 months I still find myself emotionally closed off and almost afraid of meeting someone. I didnt like the mental place I was after the relationship ended. I have a horrible dating streak that ends with me being dumped out of thr blue, but whenever I ask for feedback I never seem to get anything past ""It's not you, its me"".

488,"Hi!

I hope I will be able to articulate my problem well, even though I have not completely untangled it myself.

I am generally able to see any problem from a different perspectives. This however gives me a whole new set of problems. 

Lately, with the anti-racism movement gaining momentum and sweeping the world I am struggling to draw a line and saying 'okay, this person has done too much evil and deserves to be scorned/forgotten"".

It started when I saw people being laid off or having scholarships cancelled for expressing racist thoughts. 
I, personally, don't think that I am racist. However, I operate on a more 'see no color' perspective and I understand this is also problematic. Regardless of my personal perspective though, I feel some sort of sympathy for those people too. I don't agree with their thoughts but I also think they shouldn't lose their job over that. They were not people in power and were not actively harming anyone. Just sharing a controversial(?) opinion on social media. 

But this goes deeper for me than just racist people on social media.
I am able to enjoy art made by people who were canceled for various reasons. 
I also think that even evil people in power in history were not entirely evil. You know that meme that was going around a few years ago with paintings made by Hitler with the big twist at the end being something like ""congratulations, you just enjoyed art made by Hitler"". I was like ""so what? They were nice paintings."" 

I am deeply unable to label someone completely bad. I compartimetalize. They did X bad. But they also did Y good.

This may sound silly, I know, but it is a real problem for me, because people don't take kindly to me saying anything good and sometimes not even neutral about negatively-viewed people. 

So, I guess, I am asking how to become a better and more moral person and actually stop giving credit to bad people.",21Jun2020,1

My very religious (German) dad obviously did a lot of praying at that time and in one of those prayer circles was a girl who apparently prayed for me a lot. (I don't know how these things work) Her family lives in the US. My dad gave me a letter in German that he wants me to translate and send to her. And I REALLY don't like this letter. I wouldn't have a problem writing a letter to her saying: ""thank you for praying for me"", but the letter he gave me says things like: ""Jesus listened to your prayer, he saved me"" ""God hears your prayers"" ""I hope you get to experience many more of gods miracles"". AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. Jesus didn't save me: I SAVED MYSELF. I worked SO HARD to get myself out of this dark place I was in FOR YEARS and this letter makes it seem like it was some sort of miracle, like God or Jesus or whatever just snapped their finger, because this 11 year old girl prayed for me. That's NOT TRUE and feels very invalidating to me and my hard work. And I don't feel comfortable lying to this litte girl to support her in her faith, when I don't believe ANY of it...

Because of having low confidence from all of this I went to all my friends and doubting myself and now they treat me like the stupid person of the group.

506,"I'm turning 15 in a few days, and nearly my whole life I've been so proud about being German. I would boast about it to my classmates when I still went to public school and I would get mad at others for saying they're German and then having nothing to prove for it. But of course I had something to prove :-) A citizenship I won't get until I'm 18, and that's it :-)))))) 

Anyway, I've been wanting to learn German for years but I've literally been putting it off for three-four years now uh (excuses excuses). But I don't want to anymore. I just don't know where to start when learning the language and culture. I don't know how to plan it all out I guess. And I have to do it all for free oof.

507,My family is planning on talking to my mother (50s) today about our concerns about her behavior. She has cycles of paranoid delusions and then snaps back into reality and it seems never ending (4+ years). She was doing good for a while but she refuses to stick to her medication and therapies and it just starts over again. It‚Äôs getting worse now because she‚Äôs started bringing other people into it (texting a family friend and telling him he‚Äôs lying about his cancer). I‚Äôve cut her off multiple times for my own sake and it obviously hasn‚Äôt moved her to get help. Any advice on what to say or how to approach this?

508,About a year ago I was involved with a girl. It's a long story and we were both awful to each other. A big part of me believes her actions where influenced by her parasitic relationship with her friends. I blocked her a year ago. I'm considering unblocking her or using a friend to find out if  she realized most of what I said was true. Most of it did come to pass so I wonder who she feels about me now. Truth be told I do miss her friendship but I do remember the hard times where she put me on the edge of insanity. What's the right way to gain closure on this matter?,21Jun2020,1

517,"I lived with my grandmother in her beautiful Victorian house. I had everything going for me. It was great. The house was huge. And my grandmother had no animals and had cleaning ladies so it was always clean. And the kitchen was redone in 2014. 


Anyways, back in February some guy from south America, El Salvador i believe, came around looking for work. I told him no. He came again 4 days later. I told him no. He ended up coming back when i wasn't home and talked my grandmother into unnecessary renovations. 

He ended up contaminating the entire house with asbestos and massive amounts of lead. He ruined our central air system, ruined our kitchen entirely. Our entire 4 acre yard was covered in lead paint chippings too. 


I ended up having to go back to my parents house and its disgusting. There entire kitchen is full of ants, there bathroom shower is full of black mold, there 2 dogs get up in the middle of the night and won't stop barking. There are hundreds of flies and other bugs in the house at all times. 
There is no central air. And the upstairs of the house becomes a fucking tanning booth if it's even somewhat hot outside. And my old bedroom was turned into a room for the cats. It's disgusting. It's all full of piss and stuff. And I have no privacy. 


I thought to myself, ""well I could just turn the basement into a temporary living space"" well, i went down there and it ended up being completely full of cockroaches, crickets and their is no ceiling. It's all fiberglass that's hanging down. 



I hate it here. However, this Mexican contractor caused about 200 thousand in damages to my grandmothes house. We dont have that kind of money.

Anyways, I bring this up now because I was looking at messages from an old group chat and saw one of them share a picture of money around 8k. However, this didn't make any sense because they are students and never had money like that ever and are not from rich families. Not only did he post 8k but bought a car within a close time frame of all of this. Even my other friend posted a money picture of about $500 and claimed he was to buy a expensive item worth about 3k that same day. These messages are new to me I just saw them now and am putting the pieces of the puzzle together. I lost my watch late Apr 2018 and the messages are from June 2018. Also, last night I was with one of the two friends and the conversation of Rolex buyers randomly came up and they were completley quiet about it. Later on I came to realize what happened that night was a sign as I randomly stumbled upon the messages from 2 years back later on during the same night. When I lost the watch, one of the friend implied that I forgot it in the other friends parents car. I never asked him about it, but I strongly believe it was left behind in the car and they ended up selling it to a jeweler.

One time I went they measured me at 5'5, another time measured at 5'7, another time 5'9. Just yesterday I was measured at 5'8 1/2. I am not 5'8 1/2, how do I know? I have a friend he is exactly right at 5'10 or 5'11 I appear to be 4 inches shorter than him (my friends and I took a picture and I stood in the middle, another friend to the left of me and my 5'10/5'11 friend he was visually 6 inches taller than my friend (5'5) and
3 to 4 inches taller than me. I'm sorry but this is just annoying its like I do not have a height. Can being small weight wise make you appear different heights? Because my weight ranges from 125 lbs to 129 lbs all the time at every checkup. Oh and everytime I go to the checkups and the doctor measures me he/she (depending on the nurse) never has me take my shoes off (sneakers) so I dunno if that is adding to my height? 

What really PISSED me off was yesterday at a check up this nurse accused me of being ""anorexic"" because she thought I was ""too small weight wise"" for my height because she measured me wrong and thought I was 5'8 1/2 (which is impossible because I'm not almost 5'9 I do not look 5'9 compared to my 5'10 friend) I just hate being accused of something I am not because she didn't measure me right (didn't let me take my shoes off for a proper measure, and the measuring thing did not even touch my head it was farther up a few points). Then a few months ago i went and was told i was 5'3 i am not that short lmao. Is this normal? Do nurses just guess ur height?

Today me (16 Male), my uncle (51 Male) and my 2 cousins (16 Male &amp; 20 Male) where discussing a topic, it was about the BLM protests and about Black Pete (it belongs to a Dutch holiday called Sinterklaas) 

When we were discussing I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what the colour is of ‚ÄòPete‚Äô the important thing is that the children are having a fun time because that is the main goal‚Äù

My uncle immediately called me a racist because I support Black Pete because I don‚Äôt care what he looks like, he shouted that I cannot show compassion for other people because I said that the colour of their skin is not important.

I tried to explain that I meant was that they can be any colour not a specific kind like black, white or brown because and I told him this, it would be offensive.

He replied that because I did not rule out black Pete that I am still a racist. My response was that someone who is black could still play ‚ÄòPete‚Äô because in Holland it is accepted now to be any colour of ‚ÄòPete‚Äô, That‚Äôs why I did not rule out any kind of colour for ‚ÄòPete‚Äô.

So my point is, everyone can be ‚ÄòPete‚Äô and I am okay with that, Pete can be white, brown, black, blue or purple, the important thing is that the kids are happy.

529,"Hi guys,

Appreciate your time here. I feel that I‚Äôm internally struggling a bit and trying to put on a brave face for my friends and family, so I decided to come here to get some unbiased advice.
My cousin (f28) and I (f27) recently got in a text war over something that I interpreted to be innocuous (turns out she strongly felt the opposite). Basically I had told her that I felt that she was acting to ‚Äòavailable with men‚Äô and that I was scared to see her hurt again... she has a bad, bad track record with pick‚Äôn em! Anyway, I think I was harsh, that‚Äôs for sure, but what I said was absolutely true. I explained that it was coming from a place of love and that I felt that I wasn‚Äôt being a good friend to her if I didn‚Äôt warn her about her behaviour with the new guy she is dating: Driving to him constantly 30 mins away, obsessing over his calls/texts etc, not being upfront about what she wants/feels to avoid turning him off, agreeing to plans he makes last minute etc. 
Anyway, this girl is my best friend. She is the closest person to me by far. Before this we spent almost every day together since we were infants, talk all day every day, if anything, maybe we‚Äôre TOO close. 
She hasn‚Äôt spoken to me in a week now. I recently got a new position at work that she knew I was so excited to hear back from and she hasn‚Äôt called or texted me to congratulate me. Our mothers are sisters so she knows that I got it. I‚Äôm really sad, I‚Äôm scared that our friendship could be over and that‚Äôs crazy because I truly thought she loved me like a sister. Why would she want to lose me over this? I even apologized and I‚Äôve heard nothing back. I‚Äôm starting to realize that perhaps she isn‚Äôt the person I thought she she was all of these years and that‚Äôs terrifying me. How could our friendship mean nothing to her? We are literally each other‚Äôs other half. 
What should I do? Do I have to leave it at this point? Should I just leave it and give it time? Is this friendship worth saving if she could easily drop me for something like this? Sorry for the rant but I‚Äôm just genuinely lost about this. Thanks guys.",21Jun2020,1

This time my mom informed me that my dad has broken up with his girlfriend. She also told my brother later and finished off with ‚Äújust pretend I didn‚Äôt tell you.‚Äù 

It seriously ruins the trust for me. I doubt I can tell anything to either of these 3 women without it being told to at least someone else.

I don‚Äôt tell either of them things they aren‚Äôt supposed to know. I used to do but realized along the way that it was just wrong. I just don‚Äôt know if I can really do anything?

I was never taught to apologize or even talk problems through, it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve had to figure out myself. It‚Äôs really hard in such a dramatic environment because I can never solve the issue or apologize before the whole family knows.

536,"For some context: at my job I am usually a really hard worker, I‚Äôve picked up extra hours and days due to other coworkers refusing to work them. I believe I go above and beyond for my company, so this write up came as a surprise. I also work in a deli area, and as anyone who works in one knows- there is a program you need to go into to insert temperatures of the food to save our asses in case anyone gets sick- that‚Äôs what this write up is about. 
Now onto the story: I (f19) have been with the company for 3 years now, And for a company with such a high rollover rate I would say I‚Äôm doing fairly decent there. A year ago I was transferred to the deli part of the store, and also a year ago I got my first write up for something very stupid. Then it wasn‚Äôt a big deal, it was a minor offense write up- they had pictures to prove I was acting a fool, and in my opinion it was completely justified. Friday I got written up again, as someone with anxiety- I just agreed with what I was in trouble with so I can gtfo there and cry. This write up tho (because I still have the first one on file) turned into a higher offense- which now means I am on thin ice. I cannot transfer out of the department (which I had been very open about trying to), I cannot get any pay raises, and if I do so much as look at someone funny I‚Äôm gone. This write up was from not doing one of the 10 temp checks (this one specifically was not cleaning the slicers)
Now onto why I think it was unfair: there were 4 people scheduled to close, which only gives me a 25% chance of even being the one to need to do this. During the write up neither manager provided any proof I needed to do this during my shift, and with me being 1/4 people there I feel like it was a petty write up. I have a picture proving the board that tells us what we need to do for the shift (for Thursday which is when I was ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to do the temp thing) was completely empty for Thursday, and only shows Friday. I did take the picture Friday tho- and I highly doubt either of the managers who wrote me up can prove I was supposed to do the task. Should I try and refute my innocence?",21Jun2020,1

I can‚Äôt really leave this job as I don‚Äôt really qualify for anything else. So I was thinking about going back to school and going into something that‚Äôs a little more desirable to employers and was wondering what I should at least look into? Any advice I‚Äôd appreciate, thanks!",21Jun2020,1
540,"My life goals were always pretty mundane and ""cookie cutter"". I hoped to be able to support myself, live on my own, eventually date and settle down with a nice girl, and maybe get a dog or two. But, I've come to realize I'm not capable of giving myself those things, for one reason or another.

The difficult part is that I feel like I'm perpetually on the outside looking in. Like, my two best, closest friends are a couple. They live together in a house, they love each other, they have two adorable dogs. Granted, technically, it's not ""their"" house; it's the house she grew up in, and her parents moved out and allow she and him to live there, and it's paid off, so they just pay the upkeep costs. But they have the life I always dreamed of for myself.

Heck, even my coworkers are all doing better than I could imagine for myself. My boss's mom helped her buy a house (her mom is fairly well off), and now she lives there with her kids and boyfriend. My one coworker basically inherited a paid off house and is now moving in and will just be paying the upkeep costs. My other coworker is much younger than I am, but both she and her boyfriend live together in a solid co-op.

Meanwhile, I'm in my early 30s, can't afford to move out of my parents house (I've been crunching numbers for a while, now, and I don't believe I could even afford to rent a studio apartment), and am just kinda stuck. I feel like I need to be making $4-5 more per hour at minimum to be able to support myself, but I don't see any way of making that happen any time soon. Maybe in 10, 15, 20 years, but by then, it probably won't matter due to inflation. I couldn't complete college, I have no skills or affinities to guide me towards a better career path.

The reality for me at this point is that I'm going to be living with my parents until they die. After that, I don't know what happens. I certainly can't afford to take up paying for the house we live in, and I can't afford to live on my own. And not being able to support myself, not being able to live independently, that closes a lot of other doors for me in life, as well.

By now, I've fully accepted my fate. And make no mistake, I know I did it to myself, and I know it's my fault and due to my failures that I've been unable to give myself the life I dreamed of. But it's still very difficult to be on the outside looking in, to see everyone around me having fragments of the life I wanted for myself (or in the case of my best friends, the whole dang thing). Does it ever get any easier? Is there anything I can reasonably do to ease the ""outside looking in"" feeling?",21Jun2020,1
542,"My parents are 60 and 53 . My father was always controlling her since they married, and since we come from eastern europe, it was not strange to even hit woman. Fast forward to 2020 he is pretty much forbidding her to do anything alone. She only goes out alone here and there for a walk, but otherwise they go together everywhere. He trained her that she doesn't know much stuff, aka not smart enough, so she is not doing her papers, everything is done by him. I know even by now you know it's abusive. I'll continue. Back in the past I remember when they visited own country (they live in other country) and when family gathered, if she said something, he would tell her ""what the hell do you know?"" in front of everybody which is huge mental hit. As I am saying he mentally trained her that she doesn't know stuff and she is less smart than him. I know I don't even have to write more, but I have to explain the whole situation.

They are introverts both, so they are slowly losing the contact with more and more people, as my father as soon as something is not his way, starts calling others idiots and they are crazy, and wants my mom to stop having a contact with them. They had quite few friends when younger, and year by year they stop contacting more and more of them, I know the case that my father gets in ""fight"" with everyone and they stop having a contact. He says how stupid they are etc. So I know the problem is my father, he can't get along with anyone, and in the end obviously he wants to permit my mother contact with those people. I moved away from my parents for a work, and I know when I lived there I would go mentally mad because of my father, I could even cry sometimes because of him, but he mentally abuses you and prevents you doing things that he doesn't agree, otherwise I would be kicked out of the house, so as soon as situation appeared I searched for a job and gtfo.. leaving my mom alone.

My father can't make other people really respect him I guess for who he is, so he tried to always buy a respect with lending family a money (as we lived in richer country due to war). But every time he lend money they liked him for money, when he took money back they didn't care about him anymore, and he realized that, so he doesn't like family as well. You can't buy respect. Situation that hit me now, is that my father wants to prevent my mom to contact her sisters and brother etc. I am in foreign country so can't do much, and as every time we make a call he is there so I can't really suggest her much.

I also know the fact that my father locks all websites with own password so my mom can't see (as she caught him talking to other women once on facebook), but she can't change and he has all access to see what she writes to everyone. crazy.

When it happens that he is out and she calls me, she sometimes cries and tells me that it's hell for her, but my hands are cuffed. I suggested her to get a divorce, but she is so trained that she wouldn't be able to survive alone, that she doesn't know much stuff (exactly what he was doing to make her thing she is dumb and not able to live alone, as most of family is in original country, so he sisters and brother are not close).

So as you can see when person is totally trained to believe that it's scared to divorce and stay alone. What I am doing is that I am encouraging her to learn things. I bought them macbooks few years ago, and I also Iphone to learn how to call me, how to use different things, and I am encouraging her to learn english. Whatever I suggest my father says, why does she have to learn that she won't need it, but she is learning and that's fine. When she is alone I explain her that by more she knows more independent she will be and stronger. That's step 1. But the more she knows it's going to be easier for her to have more confidence and maybe get divorce.

My aunt lived with my uncle which is brother of my father, and she was never permitted to say anything when at family gatherings, after he died she opened like no one else, and she is very smart, smarter than my father.... Imagine that.

Now my other aunt from my moms side asked me today what is going on that mom said to her to not call her for now(as my father was pissed on whole family). My aunt she knows my father and she already suggested my mom for a divorce when they visited when they were alone, as my mom opens herself to my aunt she trusts her.

But now I know a lot that my aunt doesn't know, so wondering if I should call my aunt and tell her everything so she makes a strategy and confirms to my mom that she is not alone that my aunt is there to have her if they divorce etc, main problem is that my mom is scared of loneliness and how is she going to manage things if my father is not around. I already told my mom that I would help her as son with everything of course always, but she is still scared, so I don't know what the hell to do, I know it all depends on my mom and her decisions, but it's so hard to watch her mom not-living a life, that's not a life. I feel bad for my father as well as he is my family and every human being is made different, he is just made introvert, insecure, but my mom suffering because of him, it's not fair.

I am thinking of calling my aunt and explain her everything as I need more people to work with this, but I feel like I am betraying my father in that way. I know what my father is doing is totally fucked so I want to help my mom.

Any legit suggestions to start helping my mom strategically? Should I involve trustable entities, like my aunt as I feel stronger when someone that I trust helps me with this? I want to go slower not to aggressive with this? What would you suggest here?",21Jun2020,1

544,"Hi all! 

TL;DR at the bottom. 

Like the title says, I have a problem with my (former) best friend. I'll try and keep this short, but bear with me, I have alot on my chest. English is not my first language, so it might be a couple of spelling errors - sorry!

First off, I (24F) have known this girl, let's call her Gigi (23) for about 4 years, and we quickly got really close. Three years ago, I met my boyfriend, Dave (30). Gigi and Dave are also friends, and we all studied together. We have since graduated, and Gigi bought and apartment in the same street as where Dave and I lived. 

Both Gigi and I have dogs, and we did everything together. And by that I mean, we went grocery shopping together, walked the dogs together, we played videogames, and just really played a huge part of eachothers lives.

Over the years Dave have told me in several occations that Gigi have said som stuff to him that I have told her. Stuff about my thoughts on the relationship, when I was angry with him, and so on. 

For some reason, I have never confronted Gigi about this. Even though it is definetly a breach of trust. I guess I was terrified of losing my best friend. 

That was until last week, when she crossed a line, the last line. It all started last monday, when she asked Dave if he wanted to take the dogs out for a late night walk. I had gone to bed, because I needed to get up early for work the next day. 

When Dave met up with Gigi, she had brought two beers, and then she said that she needed to tell him something. He said that if it's about the relationship between him and me, he didn't want to hear it. She ignored this, and then went on to tell him that I had told her that I thought he was controlling, and that I wanted to break up. 

I have NEVER said these things, this was a flat out lie. Dave eventually told me after a few days, and I just snapped. I knew Gigi was at work, so I sent her a text asking why she felt the need to do stuff like this. She didn't really have an explanation, nor a good apology. All she said was that she thought she was helping us, and that she had ""fucked up"". 

We have not seen og spoken to eachother since. And here is where my problems come up. First of all, she have a key to our apartment, and we have a key to hers. I want our key back, and give her key back along with som other stuff that belong to her. The problem is, she have a much stronger personality than me, and I am really dreading meeting her again. How do I deal with this situation? 

The second problem is, if I don't think about all the stuff that she did, I do really miss having a best friend, someone to rely on and so on. I also miss all the stupid stuff we did together, and it feels weird to not have a friendship with her. But, if I forgive her, I know that I could never trust her again - and what kind of a friendship could it ever be, if trust is not there? Do you have any advice? 

TL;DR: Bestfriend told my boyfriend that I wanted to break up, which is not true. Now I dont know how to deal with the situation.",21Jun2020,1
545,"Last night I was at a gathering with some friends. We were all in the kitchen, but I was feeling a little tired and overwhelmed so I went to lie down on the couch in the next room over. After about ten minutes they assumed I had gone home, and they started talking about me, not knowing I could hear everything they were saying. One girl in particular, who I was just really getting to know and thought we were getting along really well so far, said a lot of hurtful things. After that I just got up and left quietly, so they don‚Äôt know that I heard them talking about me. 

I‚Äôm not mad at them. Everyone needs to vent about people sometimes, and I‚Äôm guilty of doing it myself. Everyone gets talked about, and I knew that meant I get talked about too, but it was hard to have to listen to it. 

The thing is, the girl I mentioned earlier who was really ripping into me (let‚Äôs call her A) has her 19th birthday coming up tomorrow (this is a big deal in Canada, as 19 is the legal drinking age here). Our group of friends has plans to go out to supper and then have a party for her afterwards (coronavirus restrictions are very loose in my province now, we haven‚Äôt had a case in weeks). I‚Äôm not sure if I should/want to go. 

First, it‚Äôs pretty clear that A doesn‚Äôt like me, and I don‚Äôt want to crash her party because she feels like she has to invite me just because I‚Äôm part of the friend group. Second, and more importantly, I don‚Äôt feel comfortable around A after hearing what she said about me. I think I would feel very self conscious being around her and I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable being myself. I‚Äôve struggled with that in the past and I don‚Äôt want to do it again. But I don‚Äôt see how I can get out of it. A bitter side of me wants her to know I heard her talking about me, but I‚Äôm not going to tell anyone because I know that would just cause more tension. However, if I make up a classic excuse like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel well‚Äù, she and my other friends would see right through the lie and think I‚Äôm rude for not being there on her birthday. 

I just need advice on what I should do, not only on A‚Äôs birthday, but every day after when I‚Äôm with my friends. I just got out of a place where I felt so self conscious and unable to be myself around people, and I don‚Äôt want to fall back into that place again.",21Jun2020,1

I haven‚Äôt had any vocal tics and it‚Äôs only been almost 2 weeks so I don‚Äôt know if I can get a diagnosis but I‚Äôm just kind of scared. It‚Äôs so terrifying to feel like I don‚Äôt have control of my body. I can‚Äôt tell my parents because they don‚Äôt really believe me. They don‚Äôt think I have ADD (I‚Äôve been given a diagnosis by a professional). I‚Äôm living at home currently so my options are a little limited.

551,"I don't have a lot of friends. I spent my college years and up to age 30 living in one of the most populous cities in the US, and had tons of friends. But at 30, I moved back to my small home town to help with family, and I honest have 1 friend here, let's call him Scott. And he's a complete f*ing jackass lately.

We've been friends for 20 years and typically we only ever fought when alcohol was involved. Scott can't seem to stop once he starts, and I do love me some whiskey, I'm of Irish descent an all, but I hate being around truly drunk people. My parents are alcoholics and it's a sore subject me for. 

Lately he's been going through some anxiety, and he's starting to put all these limitations on our friendship. Telling me what I can and can't talk about, bc something might stress home out. I'm one of those people that would literally do anything for the people in my life. This was proven when once a different friend asked me to get him Gatorade and cigarettes bc he was hungover @ 7am, and without a car, I didn't even bat an eye, walked my ass to 7/11 to help him out. Did hurt me, but I could help someone in need, and that's who I am.

I've never had someone so close to me put limitations on my speech. As another example, I once got back together with an ex that he didn't like, and Scott made an agreement that I wouldn't talk about my relationship. I dated him for a year, and couldn't talk to my best friend about it.

Scott man had been there for me for a lot. But I have a strong opinion about mental health, and that if you aren't willing to seek help at a certain point, then it really is your own fault. It may sound callous, but I've been treated for depression and anxiety for 20 years, so I know the difference it can make. He won't get help. So how is it I'm the one getting hurt by this? We've both gone through medical crises this year, and I couldn't talk about mine because he said I was story topping. I thought I was sympathizing with him by contributing how I could relate, but who cares if it was story topping honestly, bc I was in dire pain with several broken ribs during the heught of covid and couldn't breathe to walk up the stairs. I was scared for my life that I was going to get pneumonia, and not be able to get proper treatment because of hospital overrun and lack of ventilators. Did I not deserve a moment to be scared and confide in my best friend?

I love him dearly, but I'm absulely sick of someone telling me what I can and can't talk about with my only friend. What do I do?

Thanks all. I'm a grown ass woman but just have no idea where to ask for advice at this point.",21Jun2020,1
552,"Hi guys, I‚Äôm currently a rising senior in high school, and I‚Äôm suffering from a motivation/productivity problem.

My parents are what many may call the typical Asian ‚Äútiger parents.‚Äù They generally belittle my interests and my emotional issues and are generally in denial of the unbalanced, bizarre nature of my upbringing. When high school started, they made me study a niche culture in depth and write research papers in order to improve my chances of getting admitted into a university of their choice. I have no problem with that culture, but I can‚Äôt ever find it fun because it had been forced on me. My parents don‚Äôt understand how I can‚Äôt love that culture and cherish it as I would my own.

I have other interests. I like to work on lockpicking, and my parents, for some reason, allow me to pursue it (albeit in a limited manner). However, otherwise, I have no motivation to do anything. I sit around all day and watch YouTube, play the same video game on my phone over and over, and do the bare minimum for the academic tasks my parents impose on me.

I feel myself wasting away. I can‚Äôt think as quickly as I could a few years ago. My writing skills have dwindled to the point that I can‚Äôt even recognize my writing anymore. These pale in comparison to the fact that I have lost the motivation to do anything useful for myself. Worse yet, it seems that I‚Äôve forgotten the fun and inherent value of learning something useful. Before summer break started, I planned to take basic online courses on mathematics-related topics such as game theory and scientific disciplines such as geology and environmental science because I had recognized that I was sorely lacking in those areas. However, when I brought the idea up with my parents, they rejected it. Now, I don‚Äôt feel like taking those courses.

The growth of my apathy is frankly alarming to me. I initially thought that my apathy stemmed from my dislike of and lack of regard for the studies imposed on me, but it seems that it has become a habit. I‚Äôm worried that my apathy/lack of productivity and motivation (whatever you‚Äôd like to call it) would strike me down when I‚Äôm doing something that‚Äôs actually necessary and crucial for me. Please give me all the advice you can muster for this situation.",21Jun2020,1
553,"For extra context I am currently 16 and live with my mother; my sister is in her 20s and is about to move far away from where we live currently and is concerned for my saftey.  

My sister recently told me that she KNEW my mother was doing meth and talked about me moving in with my dad, she brought up this topic in the first place because we bumped into eachother on an animal crossing trading subreddit and she looked at my post history. One of these posts was made 7 months ago where I vented about not being happy living with my mom- I don't have the best mental health and at the time I was mainly using that account for private posts so I didnt use a throw away. 

The truth is, yes, I am not happy living with my mother we get into fights constantly and just generally don't see eye to eye most of the time, whenever we get into arguments she purposely dead names and misgenders me (I identify as male but was born female) which is generally a slap in the face considering she acknowledges how I identify and atleast tries most of the time; only to maliciously deadname me or uses my current name in a mocking tone to get a reaction out of me.
 However, at my moms house I get to be alone most of the time since it is only me and her here, I get my own room and plenty of space to myself; something I don't get at my dad's. This sounds like a stupid reason but I value this time to myself and I'm not necessarily happy living with my dad ethier as he really doesn't acknowledge my identity in the slightest. Also I am 16 and am saving up money to move out on my own when I am 18.

Now; the problem I had with my sister's accusation is she said she ""knew"". Yet had no evidence to support this claim other than my mom was at a guy's house who she knew did meth. This guy is also mom's tattoo artist. The reason why I was so inclined to believe this at first is because my mom often borrows money from me; which a lot of it she has yet to pay back despite promiseing she would, the amount of money she has borrowed from me was up in the 200-300 dollar range, a large chunk of that being money I saved up for my cat's vet visit but she unfortunately died before we could get her to one. Whenever I brought this up to my mom she basically said what I stated previously, he happened to be her tattoo artist and theres really no evidence other than my sister saw her at his house.

I understand my sister is concerned for my saftey but honestly all this situation has done to me is caused fusteration and stress; I don't know how to handle this at all.

TL;DR: sister made meth accusations against my mom, which I initially believed due to the amount of times she's ""borrowed"" money from me, however upon closer inspection theres no evidence to back up these claims.",21Jun2020,1
554,"I‚Äôm an Asian, 17-year-old male (at the time of writing this), and the eldest of three offsprings, so by tradition, responsibilities get pushed onto me by default. This may be a very long post, I know, but, I just really want to mention it all......I‚Äôll try to keep it short, and I'll type a summarized version in the comments.

I‚Äôll list off the significant past ‚Äútraumas‚Äù or ‚Äúinconvenient"" thoughts I have had...

1:

My parents have some age gap---some contributing factors over readiness to be in a relationship, and for raising a child.

So, Parents have fought and have almost *separated* on multiple occasions, *distorting my sense of social attachment*‚Äîor, sense of love‚Äîso, that's my first problem.

2:

On a birthday, when I was still na√Øve or *innocent*, father gave me P500 (or $10). I spent it to acquire an in-game item, wherein my dad thought it was a scam. Someone was sent to confirm it, and what was reported was that it was half the price I should‚Äôve spent. However, I had already been informed that the normal variant of the item was indeed half the price, and what I acquired was a special variant. But, father took a rather aggressive stance in this, and, in this one causation...I learned that (1) things are not truly dedicated, (2) my *social connections* can be severed at any time, and (3) I have not been trusted and have been antagonized.

3:

My (male) sibling and I had enjoyed a game, and was made to go to bed. We ended up enjoying talking about relevant ideas, until mother decided to go through the door in such a way that I could only watch as she approached from behind my sibling and hit us both. Commanding for us to sleep to be ready for school.

Even if I enjoyed something, I was shown powerlessness against tradition and enforcement.

4:

After having come home from helping dad with some work by having carried more than around 30 hollow blocks, I took notice of my two siblings‚Äô dispute over the use of a computer. In a fit of anger on my side, I decided to delete some of the older sibling‚Äôs files, but still had the conscience and intelligence to not make it long term---deleting only the files that my desktop also had so that it was no permanent damage, it could be resolved with a USB we had. However, my parents again decided to defend/support this older sibling, and not only was I lead to tears from this, but I wasn‚Äôt even paid the P50 ($1) for the day‚Äôs work that father said he‚Äôd give me, despite having seen father hand someone P500 ($10) for some day.

I learned that (1) not only were my efforts unpaid, I‚Äôve been penalized for it too, and (2) I shouldn‚Äôt defend/support people I like.

5:

I went with my parents to a place with the intention so I could have an internet connection. I had the unfortunate circumstance of my parents not actively giving me actual long-term instructions, and continuously left me with the choice of just watching youtube videos. And, very unluckily, father threatened the destruction of the phone I used if I kept using it (since I kept audibly laughing and smiling at whatever I was watching despite people doing some work around me). With that threat, my anger and thoughts of the past made me throw the phone to the wall with a burst of force.

I didn‚Äôt like that I couldn‚Äôt even go for happiness while I had nothing to do. I even spent a good few minutes just laying in the ditch where the phone landed, not so visible from most angles.

6:

From having heard some enforcing words repeatedly, I abided by an errand to buy ice from somewhere, however, just as I returned to the residence, father (the one who gave me the errand) only then took away the internet connection (an important thing to me) from me. It was eventually revealed to me that the main trigger for him to take it away was that he wasn‚Äôt satisfied with how the chickens (he was raising) were being fed. 

I learned that the causes they were telling me were masked, and I‚Äôve lost a bit of trust for their logic and words.

7: and, the final straw that lead me to finally posting somewhat seriously...

Due to what I do with the desktop I use (and the games I play), I screwed up my sleep schedule, especially since there‚Äôs no school for me during these times.

Mother has taken away the phone from me thrice for the reason that it was making me unhealthy with how I was not sleeping.

It is indeed logical, however...

...(a) she forcefully woke me up that recent one time I didn‚Äôt wake up before 2:00AM. That action was against sleeping, it‚Äôs more technically right to say she promotes some traditional idea than sleeping.

...(b) She‚Äôs ruthless in terms of disregarding the how in doing the what that she thinks is right. My unhealthy sleep schedule is indeed unhealthy, but it‚Äôs not helping me find the reason when she also punishes the body that‚Äôs being punished by reality.

.......

I need my phone and desktop to distract me from these circumstances and my past, she thinks these gadgets are a bad influence, but my brain‚Äôs been set to think of her as the top candidate for worst influence in my life with how bad she goes about in achieving a result.

She has resorted to blaming the gadgets that taught me more than my parents had, and my childishness for inflicting pain against myself---some futile sort of protest/resistance of mine.

My abilities for my future seem nil.

These authorities---these parents---behave on tradition, somehow staying together despite the chances of separation. 

These authorities have not trusted me, and even penalized me regardless of reason.

Implying to me that I shouldn‚Äôt enjoy what I want just so my body can exist (some time) longer.

These three nights where my phone has been taken away have made my philosophical thoughts to think that just as the most significant thing from me is taken away when I sleep, my life may have the ending where I sleep unsatisfied...

This exchange of physical health over mental health is taking some toll, and I don‚Äôt have much power in it.

My reason tells me to disobey and accept the idea of separation since I‚Äôm living more on father‚Äôs paycheck than her (who has compromised with father by finishing her education than going abroad to work).

So... I'm a 16 year old female. I live with both of my parents. My mom is religious. Not ""Crazy religious"" she's just very dedicated to faith.

My dad however, is agnostic. I have a really chaotic relationship with him, but we have topics we can disguss together.

&amp;#x200B;

I was mostly rised by my mom, because my dad worked really long and he wasn't seeing me so often. Mom was teaching me about faith since I can renember. I was attending church, local choir and was going for special meetings with nuns. Now I'm even in catholic school...

However, a few months ago I thought to myself ""Wait, isn't it a little diffrent?"" And I started thinking about everything my school, mom, and teacher tought me. And I felt like most of that is just wrong. I than asked myself ""Do the God really love me?"" and ""Does he exist?"" I wasn't able to awnser that questions.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to talk to my mom about it, because I'm scared how she'll react. And I don't really trust my dad with secrets.

568,"Happy Father‚Äôs Day I guess...this whole situation just came up two days ago and I am honestly completely at a loss about how to move forward. 
A little backstory to start off. My brother recently went through a divorce and moved in with me to save money for a downpayment on a new home a few months ago. Two weeks ago my oldest nephew (age 9 I‚Äôll refer to him as onep) got caught watching pornography after I overheard a conversation between him and my son(age 11) where onep was talking to my son about it and my son pretty much told him that stuff is gross. (They did not know I overheard) so I went to my brother and told him he may want to have a talk with his son and go through his internet history. This is not the first instance of this about 2 years ago (when onep was 7 and my son was 8 *my son is a year and a few months older then onep) they were caught watching porn with a friend and conversation was had at that time. We sat both of them down explained that that type of content is inappropriate for their ages and they are not able at their current ages to understand it. Onep‚Äôs access to internet and electronics was taken away as punishment, I routinely unbeknownst to my son periodically go though his internet history on all devices after the first incident and as far as I know my son has not been watching that type of content since the first incident two years ago. Enough of the back story....

Now my younger nephew (age 5 but autistic will refer to as ynep) when getting dropped off to his mother‚Äôs went to give his mother a kiss and tried to put her hand on his privates. She was horrified but kept calm and asked ynep why he did that. Ynep said he learned it from his onep. Onep claimed he learned it from my son. We sat them down next to each other and explained that no one is getting in trouble we just need to know the truth of this situation. My son appeared completely confused during this conversation, while onep was antsy and eventually admitted to watching pornography while sleeping in the same room as his ynep and maybe that‚Äôs where he learned that. It was late and a long conversation so we left it at that and my brother took onep back to his mother‚Äôs (I forgot to mention onep and ynep have different mothers). The next day I spoke to onep‚Äôs mom and my brother and onep‚Äôs mom said she felt something was missing from onep‚Äôs story. When she talked with him onep admitted that he had not only watched pornography with ynep there but had ynep touch his privates, onep touch ynep‚Äôs privates and apparently have ynep put his mouth on onep‚Äôs. Onep said then that he had done the same thing with two other younger cousins of his, and that 2 years ago when my son and onep first got caught watching pornography a friend (same age as them) that was watching it with them dared onep to put his mouth on my son‚Äôs privates, from what I gathered after having a conversation to my son about this in which my son was visibly distraught and on the verge of tears he admitted to me that that did happen and that what onep did was after being dared to licked my son‚Äôs privates once. Onep then also said that another time when my son stayed at onep‚Äôs and they were talking about a girl onep liked at school and says my son told him he can make him forget about girls and did things with onep‚Äôs privates. I tried talking to my son about this without giving him any details and my son seems to have no knowledge of it he recalls the conversation but says afterward onep was being weird and humped a pillow. 

All of the parents involved agree that the kids need therapy and that we need to get them the help they need and figure out where this came from. I am trying to get my son into therapy on Monday. I don‚Äôt even know what to think at the moment. I do not know what to believe and what to not. Looking back onep has been having Behavorial issues for awhile now(anger lying, someone always seems to get hurt playing with him) it now seems obvious that something was wrong. While my son has had no major issues aside from isolated incidents once or twice a year but typically has been truthful with me and the any behavior issues at school have been minor. 

Please I don‚Äôt know what to do aside from get my son therapy, I don‚Äôt know what type or anything, do I even attempt to talk to my son more? I know that once one of these kids gets to a therapist child services will get involved what can I do to help them or what should I expect?

569,"Honestly more context can be seen on the post on my profile, but the TL;DR is that things with my housemate have deteriorated and she‚Äôs gotten consistently abusive to the point where I‚Äôve decided to move out. I‚Äôve got my plan for breaking my lease smoothly and hopefully my landlord will be on board (I have to give him notice), but there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôm concerned about; my pet. I keep an exotic pet, and while I have a place I‚Äôm looking to move into I don‚Äôt want to be left with nowhere to hold him if the house falls through. 

Is it unreasonable if part of the list of requests for transferring my lease is about the care of my pet, that if needed my pet will stay until I find a place and I will have entry on weekends to feed him (that‚Äôs as often as he needs feeding)? It helps that my boy actually belonged to my housemate‚Äôs uncle, meaning that my housemate does also want him to be safe and probably won‚Äôt mind that he stays beyond her anger at me. 

Obviously I don‚Äôt want him to stay, but he can‚Äôt be moved freely and if I end up flying to my parents‚Äô place to live for a while he can‚Äôt come with me - his species is not allowed on planes.

571,"Ok here's the dilemma.

My mother and I have a healthy relationship, there were rocky times as a teenager but i'm in my mid 20s now and we get along well. She is married to a man that she's been dating for about a decade (my parents are divorced). He has a son who's a year younger than me. We have never really been close because we have absolutely nothing in common whatsoever. Like...whatsoever, just trust me on this one. He is autistic, we don't know exactly to what degree what he is cause his mom isn't into western medicine or whatever, but he can still drive a car and hold a job and stuff. I'm really sorry if i shouldn't have even brought this up in the first place or if I speak on it disrespectfully, maybe some of you could help me figure out how it fits into the whole equation.

Anyway the 4 of us were playing a game in which you use your phone as a controller, his phone got disconnected and I clicked on the URL bar on his web explorer on his phone because that's how you refresh it on my phone. When I clicked on it, his recent history had a bunch of porn icons and I immediately gave it back and played it off because I've been there and it's annoying to have your porn history flash in front of someone. However before I handed it back I saw the word stepsis.

I don't know what to do/think. I'm trying not to think too hard about it or take it personally because I know he'd probably never do anything to like...force me into anything. But just knowing that he thinks about that when he's jacking off is fucking weird. The thing is that I also watch incest porn, so I feel like I can't judge him too much lmao. It's still just fucking weird to experience. I didn't tell my mom because I feel like it would turn into a whole thing and to be honest he probably also watches stepmom stuff too.  I don't want it to ruin their relationship but I do kinda wish that she knew so that she could contextualize if I start acting a little differently toward him. At the same time I really don't want to tell her because she really likes him! Ultimately I don't think I'll tell her but knowing this alone is just like a heavy secret to keep.

576,"Hey guys!

I need some second opinion. Generally speaking I am a very relaxed guy and do not think too much behind certain actions or take it the bad way. This post is also by no means a negative thought post.

I have been wondering about 2 people I find attractive and like. They have been very nice to me and we have had a view talks, between volleyball or going back home from the station.

But today, I felt like questioning some actions. As I said I like both and have been trying to make th step and trying to get to know them better by asking them if they want to hang out. Now I know both for like say 5 months, but due to corona the conversations and connection got slowed down a lot. Now that we met again at volleyball or things in life are slowly getting back on track, I have tried to get back to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Person A I have asked out a few times, but has always been busy or already had other plans (felt like declined politely). Always said with pleasure but said couldn't. This person does not text a lot and is generally a quiet one. Did not think much of it though and just went along with asking occasionally every now and then (months apart).

Person B is also very nice and we have talked a bit more, but during the corona time he was very quiet, which I was too, but I guess I made a bit more effort. Now it turns out he has been meeting with another volleyball team player whom I also know (nothing going on between them afaik apart from being friends as the other one is already engaged anyway).

&amp;#x200B;

Now the question. I do not think much of it or change my behaviour because of this, but now I am feeling after all this while, that this absence of engagement to do something outside volleyball from both looks like a lack of interest from them. Like is it right for me to believe that if the other person does not try to make the effort to accomodate by asking to do something another time or be the one to ask out after having declined, this is a sign of lack of interest? Like I need to read between the lines and understand that I should stop making the effort?

I really do not like this certain way of think or guessing stuff and acting accordingly. I like things to be direct, but no one (including me) is gonna decline and say they have no interest. But on the other hand I usually do not act upon guessing. I am not pushy, I give a lot of time and room and never pressure anyone to do anything. I dont mind asking a few times, but after a while I feel like I should stop (asking multiple times and a lot of time having passed).

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone give me their opinion on this? Do you know anyone or yourself where not writing alot or asking people out does not inherently mean  lack of interest?

I am very confused.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Two people I like, I have tried to make the effort to do stuff outside volleyball and talk (we had good times, talked a few, they are nice to me and does not feel like they dont like me around), but they dont text alot and do not seem to make an effort to meet outside after I asked them out a few times.

Do I need to back off?

578,"I‚Äôm an Asian, 17-year-old male (at the time of writing this), and the eldest of three offsprings, so by tradition, responsibilities get pushed onto me by default. This may be a very long post, I know, but, I just really want to mention it all......I‚Äôll try to keep it short, and I'll type a summarized version in the comments.

I‚Äôll list off the significant past ‚Äútraumas‚Äù or ‚Äúinconvenient"" thoughts I have had...

1:

My parents have some age gap---some contributing factors over readiness to be in a relationship, and for raising a child.

So, Parents have fought and have almost *separated* on multiple occasions, *distorting my sense of social attachment*‚Äîor, sense of love‚Äîso, that's my first problem.

2:

On a birthday, when I was still na√Øve or *innocent*, father gave me P500 (or $10). I spent it to acquire an in-game item, wherein my dad thought it was a scam. Someone was sent to confirm it, and what was reported was that it was half the price I should‚Äôve spent. However, I had already been informed that the normal variant of the item was indeed half the price, and what I acquired was a special variant. But, father took a rather aggressive stance in this, and, in this one causation...I learned that (1) things are not truly dedicated, (2) my *social connections* can be severed at any time, and (3) I have not been trusted and have been antagonized.

3:

My (male) sibling and I had enjoyed a game, and was made to go to bed. We ended up enjoying talking about relevant ideas, until mother decided to go through the door in such a way that I could only watch as she approached from behind my sibling and hit us both. Commanding for us to sleep to be ready for school.

Even if I enjoyed something, I was shown powerlessness against tradition and enforcement.

4:

After having come home from helping dad with some work by having carried more than around 30 hollow blocks, I took notice of my two siblings‚Äô dispute over the use of a computer. In a fit of anger on my side, I decided to delete some of the older sibling‚Äôs files, but still had the conscience and intelligence to not make it long term---deleting only the files that my desktop also had so that it was no permanent damage, it could be resolved with a USB we had. However, my parents again decided to defend/support this older sibling, and not only was I lead to tears from this, but I wasn‚Äôt even paid the P50 ($1) for the day‚Äôs work that father said he‚Äôd give me, despite having seen father hand someone P500 ($10) for some day.

I learned that (1) not only were my efforts unpaid, I‚Äôve been penalized for it too, and (2) I shouldn‚Äôt defend/support people I like.

5:

I went with my parents to a place with the intention so I could have an internet connection. I had the unfortunate circumstance of my parents not actively giving me actual long-term instructions, and continuously left me with the choice of just watching youtube videos. And, very unluckily, father threatened the destruction of the phone I used if I kept using it (since I kept audibly laughing and smiling at whatever I was watching despite people doing some work around me). With that threat, my anger and thoughts of the past made me throw the phone to the wall with a burst of force.

I didn‚Äôt like that I couldn‚Äôt even go for happiness while I had nothing to do. I even spent a good few minutes just laying in the ditch where the phone landed, not so visible from most angles.

6:

From having heard some enforcing words repeatedly, I abided by an errand to buy ice from somewhere, however, just as I returned to the residence, father (the one who gave me the errand) only then took away the internet connection (an important thing to me) from me. It was eventually revealed to me that the main trigger for him to take it away was that he wasn‚Äôt satisfied with how the chickens (he was raising) were being fed.

I learned that the causes they were telling me were masked, and I‚Äôve lost a bit of trust for their logic and words.

7: and, the final straw that lead me to finally posting somewhat seriously...

Due to what I do with the desktop I use (and the games I play), I screwed up my sleep schedule, especially since there‚Äôs no school for me during these times.

Mother has taken away the phone from me thrice for the reason that it was making me unhealthy with how I was not sleeping.

It is indeed logical, however...

...(a) she forcefully woke me up that recent one time I didn‚Äôt wake up before 2:00AM. That action was against sleeping, it‚Äôs more technically right to say she promotes some traditional idea than sleeping.

...(b) She‚Äôs ruthless in terms of disregarding the how in doing the what that she thinks is right. My unhealthy sleep schedule is indeed unhealthy, but it‚Äôs not helping me find the reason when she also punishes the body that‚Äôs being punished by reality.

.......

I need my phone and desktop to distract me from these circumstances and my past, she thinks these gadgets are a bad influence, but my brain‚Äôs been set to think of her as the top candidate for worst influence in my life with how bad she goes about in achieving a result.

She has resorted to blaming the gadgets that taught me more than my parents had, and my childishness for inflicting pain against myself---some futile sort of protest/resistance of mine.

My abilities for my future seem nil.

These authorities---these parents---behave on tradition, somehow staying together despite the chances of separation.

These authorities have not trusted me, and even penalized me regardless of reason.

Implying to me that I shouldn‚Äôt enjoy what I want just so my body can exist (some time) longer.

These three nights where my phone has been taken away have made my philosophical thoughts to think that just as the most significant thing from me is taken away when I sleep, my life may have the ending where I sleep unsatisfied...

This exchange of physical health over mental health is taking some toll, and I don‚Äôt have much power in it.

My reason tells me to disobey and accept the idea of separation since I‚Äôm living more on father‚Äôs paycheck than her (who has compromised with father by finishing her education than going abroad to work).

However, the truth is that I still very much have to depend on them. Yet, I‚Äôve only been gaining more reason from this to be less happy and satisfied. It‚Äôs reasonable to feel like a tool, but not when I‚Äôm being forced to rust.

With these circumstances, right and wrong is ambiguous. My brain has forced itself to think faster, yet I only got tears in realization that I don‚Äôt have the authority, strength, and financial value.

I don‚Äôt know what the best question is to ask with this number of issues, I really can only just post this as my feelings are implying me to.

Maybe...for now, I want to be assured of if I‚Äôm still sane, and if I'm justified to feel having been wronged...am I?

I grew up with depression and social anxiety due to things that happened at both home and school. I was a very lonely kid, and all I really had were my creative hobbies, dolls, and anime. 

Now I‚Äôm 19, and I realize that I want to go to college. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll major in, but my only goal now is to do very good on the SAT and ACT so I can get into a good four year university in my state. I know that this will be a stepping stone for me in regards to growing up, leaving home, and starting my own life. I‚Äôm also applying for jobs.

I‚Äôve known for years now that I myself have a very fragile mental state; as I‚Äôm prone to depression episodes. Although I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm bipolar like my dad. I don‚Äôt have insurance and I can‚Äôt afford medical help... and that scares me. 

Why am I on here telling you all of this? Well.. I need advice. From people who might‚Äôve gone through what I have, I believe in God but sometimes I feel so alone.. and sometimes I don‚Äôt think I deserve to live a different life and not follow the steps of my mom and dad. 

And the worst part is it feels like no one understands, and my parents‚Äô lives depresses me too, because regardless they‚Äôre my parents and I want the best for them. But I think sooner or later it‚Äôll be time to leave them, and go my own way. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I wish they prepared me for this when I was in highschool, but they don‚Äôt really pay mind to people from unstable homes anyways. 

I don‚Äôt know how to cope with my emotions, without giving myself empty promises? I don‚Äôt know how to deal with my dad being so evil and mean and cold, or my mom‚Äôs pain. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do and I need your help.",21Jun2020,1
581,"Hi, I graduated hs last year then went straight to college in the fall. It was more a forced desicion from my parents than a decision I actually wanted. I ended up dropping out before the first semester ended and worked the rest of the year at shitty jobs. I am now wondering what I should do next, I am sick of shitty jobs that don't pay well. I am thinking of going back to college but I really don't enjoy school so maybe just a 1 yr program but I definitely can't do more than that because it drives me insane. I love the outdoors, camping, hiking, biking, rock climbing, ultimate frisbee.

584,"We've been living here, with my stepfather for 8 years now and they had many arguements. Today there was a pretty big one, that's why I'm writing this. My stepbrother's girlfriend slept here last night and my mom didn't really appreciate it. Today, when my stepdad came home, my mom told him how much she disliked this. It's important to note that my mom and my stepbrother are very much hating each other and my stepfather is fully aware of it. As they started the arguement about him, yelling immediately started and I was very scared. This already happened many times before.

Now the thing is that I know that my mom wasn't right at all. If she hates my stepbrother why can't she just ignore him? I can't understand why she had to start the arguement at all. I told her many times to stop but she didn't seem to do so.

I don't really like my stepfather tho. He is very strict and has anger issues. But I think he was absolutely right. He is working hard, tired when he comes home, she doesn't want to her my mom yelling at him.

Currently both of them are sleeping separately, my mom in my room and my stepfather is in their room. It also happened that the arguement was so serious that we moved out of the house for a few days. I don't want to bear this anymore. I just want a normal family. I'm tired of moving back and forth between the two houses, I'm tired of listening the tons of arguements, fearing that something bad would happen.

What should I do?",21Jun2020,1
585,"I don't know where else to post this and I'm genuinely frustrated.

My mother has bi polar disorder, and I feel bad for her and wish that she would get the help she needs but for YEARS since I was like 8 or 9, I started to realize the truth about my mother and it's that she is a selfish, terrible person. She was and still is an alcoholic, along with being a drug addict. She would constantly belittle me for everything that I did, she would always scream everything (her screaming caused me to develop PTSD and now whenever someone raises their voice even slightly I start to panic), she would constantly call me out on my weight saying how fat and overweight I was. Whenever I had friends over she would make fun of me constantly in front of them to make herself seem funny or something. She always spoke over me whenever I was talking with her, and if I said something she didn't like, she would call me an idiot or say that I don't know anything. She would always avoid getting called out, walking out of the room when the arguments would turn against her or when she knew the truth about her selfish actions would come out if I kept talking. She tried to manipulate me for years, turn me against my dad and make me hate him when he was actually the one who was trying to help my family and make things better. My mother has done several things to physically hurt me as well, including throwing a knife at me in the middle of an argument to get me to shut up. 

I have endured so much pain and trauma over the years and I am so exhausted and I want to move on. My therapist told me that cutting contact with my mother was one of the best things I could do for myself and I agreed with her, so, after having to take my younger over to my apartment because she was afraid of going home to the screaming and yelling between my parents, I finally told my mom over text how I feel about everything that happened. In short, I hate my mother so much. She destroyed my self esteem and made me feel worthless. She made me feel like I don't matter. I told her that I don't plan on speaking to her again, not unless she changed but given the numerous opportunities she's had, she won't. Mostly because of her mental illness and I recognize that. But I can't spend my whole life like this. I need to move on and this is how I want to.

My older sister sent me a wall of text this morning saying how because my mother is mentally ill, that holding a grudge against her is the wrong thing to do and I should just forgive and forget. This angered me to no end. Not only has my older sister never bothered to come around for anything other than her own self benefit, but she also only came around to defend my mother's behavior. And she had endured some of the things I went through too!  For some reason my older sister has this whole ""I'm better than you"" feel to her entire personality and I stopped talking to her a long time ago because of another situation that happened that maybe I'll get into in another post. But for now, I need fucking advice. I hate how my older sister is making me feel like shit for telling my mother off and trying to cut contact with her. Am I wrong for doing this? I thought that this would be the best thing for me and now I'm just fucking confused and irritated. Please help.",21Jun2020,1

He jokes about two things: me not calling him very often and what a bitch my mom is (they‚Äôre divorced). I know two of his interests, food and the Dallas Cowboys.

590,"Hi good people,

I need advice on my wordpress blog.

It has been 5 months since I started my blog. I don‚Äôt write often and I have only four posts so far.

When I started I was so excited but seeing none of my posts reached anyone, I lost my passion. 
I don‚Äôt have the means to spend money on it.

My blog is mainly about psychology. I intend to write about interesting psychology topics and movies&amp; shows  that demonstrate different aspects of psychology in their storyline.

I have written pieces on cheating behavior and right ways to communicate with people. I also had posts about K-Pax (movie) and Alias Grace (netflix series).

My question is, how can i promote it in the right way? Or blogs are something of the past? I want to write pieces and I want them to be read. Maybe the whole theme of my blog is limited. I want to be creative with it but lack experience&amp; knowledge. 
But if this is a dead end from the start, I will put this little project of mine aside.

P.S I have a psychology degree


Thank you.",21Jun2020,1
591,"I'm a 21 (almost 22) year old university student. 

Im currently in a psychology program which I had initially made plans to go on to graduate school in neuroscience. My grades are good (3.8 gpa) and I have volunteer + work experience related to that, but I'm scared of that path because there's no stability in it. 

Last year in my desperation I applied to a condensed, 2 year nursing program because I liked biology, making a difference in peoples lives and stability. I really didn't think I would get in since Im doing 3 classes of prerequisites this summer but very late in the cycle they offered me a conditional acceptance. 

This threw me into an absolute mental breakdown like I've never experienced in my life before. I was completely petrified of every option that lay ahead, and all I could think about was how much everything might go wrong no matter what path I took. 

If I entered nursing now, what if I don't like it? What if I can't stand it?   
I've done as much research as I could in the last year, I talked to the faculty, I went to information meetings, watched videos, read articles,  I even called a full time RN but I never shadowed so it doesn't feel like enough. I'm still not sure, I hear so many horror stories and I don't know. 

But at the same time, waiting a year means I'll be nearly 23 by the time I'm done psychology. Sure I'll have time to explore a bit more... but if I go into nursing anyways I'll be 25 by the time I'm done all my schooling which is terrifying to me. I worry about being behind that way.   


So what should I do? Should I wait and explore a little more and be far older? Or dive in to something I think I like... but I'm not 100% sure.",21Jun2020,1
592,"So it's not really ""workout"" to some people since it's mostly just aerobic cardio. I started exercising ever since the start of May due to lockdown boredom and the goal to become slim by the end of this year or by next year. I started with beginner exercise by the first month and is climbing up the ladder in terms of intensity each month. My current routine is 30 mins. high-intensity cardio, 5 days a week, and this will change by next month (intensity and days of workout), and the future one will change, you get the point. I also do intermittent fasting (8 pm - 12 pm) to complement my routine. Nearby gyms are still closed until September.

I'm in my second month and I'm already thinking that maybe I'm doing something wrong or maybe it just doesn't work. I was overweight when I started but I dunno if I lost some (no scale at home) since my physique still looks largely the same. But I really don't care about that. What I hope to be gone by now that I once had (random daily outbursts of hypertension and anxiety), only seems to be getting worse. I am often worrying about my health than before, even at the tiniest of problems. I am becoming less motivated to finish my routine day by day. Couple that with the fact that I am still currently experiencing the same problems during workout (painful side cramps, worsening headaches).

This probably isn‚Äôt the right subreddit to ask in but I don‚Äôt know which else this would belong to so I might as well give it a try

I \[M17\] was lied to by my ex \[17F\] for months and eventually broke up with me, leaving me without any clue to why she broke up and trust issues but that‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm asking for help here. The problem is, that my female best friend \[best friends for like 3 years \] whom I‚Äôd tell everything and knew she wouldn‚Äôt tell anybody, just started a friendship with her right after we started dating, so needless to say she knows Her for a way shorter time than me. She (best friend) knows how badly she (Ex) hurt me and for how long she straight up lied to my face. If I would notice that anyone lied to such an extent to someone I would really take a step back from that person, but despite knowing all of that, she meets up with her, well aware of what she did and just doesn‚Äôt seem to care that she fucked me up. I don‚Äôt know if that is selfish a selfish way of thinking but I would never do something like that if someone fucked up a best friend of mine. I‚Äôm questioning everyday if I should cut ties with her or not and hoped y‚Äôall could tell me what you think of that and please be brutally honest bc if I‚Äôm the one who is in the wrong I wanna know

595,"Hey world, 

My wife and I are stuck in an ethical dilemma regarding our recently acquired business that suffered an electrical fire.  Fortunately we caught it in time to cause a lot of damage, but since it was the wiring directly under the roof, water came into the building and obviously the ceiling and such needs to be replaced.

While we have insurance of course, a citizen started a GoFundMe to raise money for the business to be used for as other citizens mentioned deductible, improvements, employee wages, etc.  We're a family of four with two kids under 2 and I work a fulltime job aside from this business.

We've contacted the person who started the fundraiser and verified it's legitimate, but are stuck with the ethical battle whether we should continue to accept donations to it or just rely on the insurance and figure it out on our own terms.  It has since been disabled from accepting any donations further, for the record.

Although it's been disabled our business's page has been contacted about people still wanting to donate.  We don't want to deflate those that want to help by turning them away since it's been a big part of the community for 30+ years.

596,"So, for some background: I'm 20 (M) and in the first year of college. I'm studying foreign languages, especially English, as it's not my first language. I don't like college a lot, but I don't want to drop out, because it's only three years and the first one is almost finished. What I liked in college so far is that I got to see what it's like to live on my own, and I also liked socialising with my colleagues, despite the fact that I'm very shy and I don't speak a lot. What I didn't like is going to classes, as most of them are boring.

On the side, I started learning some programming (HTML, CSS, JS) back in March, and I still learn, as I'm helped by a friend who works in this field. I started to learn this because I thought it is a good opportunity. So far, I kind of like programming, as I don't have experience in this field, and a job in IT would be a good start. A job might be a bit harder to find, but my friend told me it is possible. But I wouldn't like to spend a lot of my life in an office. 

So, why am I afraid of the future ? I'm afraid that I'll never be free again. As I'm only 20, I can say I still have enough freedom. But at one point, I'll have to get a job, I'll have more responsibilities and so on. I know that even if you have a job you don't work all day, every day, but things won't be the same. And I'm afraid I won't be able to fullfill my dream of gathering money, investing it in something, or starting my own bussiness and living free. I don't want to sound like a lazy person, but I don't think that work will ever bring me financial freedom, and that's what I want in life. Life is too short to work for anyone else. And lately, I also had strong feeling of jealousy, because others make more money or live a better life. 

So, what can I do to stop this feeling of fear and jealousy ? Thank you in advance.",21Jun2020,1

3. International; is the degree good in other countries?

I don't keep a small litter tray in the playpen, because the first night I kept him in a laundry basket with a small litter tray and a blanket to sleep on. He used the tray, but also slept in it and dug most of the contents out.

My dreams, my aspirations, family, thoughts, and life could all be pulled at the snap of a finger, and I would have no control over it. I know this sounds a bit depressing and all, but does anyone have any long term coping mechanisms for the fear of death? It‚Äôs really making it hard for me to enjoy the moment and I would really appreciate some help.",21Jun2020,1

610,"So I posted something similar to this somewhat recently i believe but idk. Recently, i‚Äôve had an awful relationship with my family. My parents got divorced around November last year, and my mom moved out in February I believe. I always had a better relationship with my mom (never good, just better then my dads) but she‚Äôs living with her boyfriend and roommates so i wouldn‚Äôt have a room there. It‚Äôs been super bad recently. I never leave my room unless i get food or water. Last night we had a family dinner and i kept getting yelled at even thought I was barely talking. My dad and 2 sisters always call me sensitive, selfish, rude, and not like how I used to be. It really
hurts and they get all offended when I don‚Äôt wanna be around them. Even though I don‚Äôt even live with my mom she blames me for taking her stuff when I only go to her house like once or twice every two weeks. I don‚Äôt get it, nor do I know what to do. I tried talking to my friend about it but it didn‚Äôt help much.

612,"My (21F) girlfriend (23 F) have been together for 3 years. We were long distance and shortly after that we moved in together, which led to us being sexually active. When we first got together, she showered regularly, like at least once a day even if she wasn‚Äôt washing her hair she would at least get in and wash her body. As time went on, I assume she got more comfortable. She stopped taking showers and shaving her pubic area, only taking a shower  every 3 days. I also noticed she wipes back to front after she uses the restroom for number 2. When we first got together, I didn‚Äôt notice a smell to her vagina the way I do now. See I‚Äôm not expecting it to smell like anything but a vagina, but I swear lately it almost has a fishy, urine like scent. She hasn‚Äôt shaved her pubic area as much, she says it‚Äôs hard for her to shave, I even shaved for her a few times. I don‚Äôt mind pubic hair but I have a texture phobia so if it gets too long (bush like) that‚Äôs when I start to mind. We talked about pubic hair preference in the beginning of our relationship so that has already been established. I just really like performing oral sex on her but the smell and hygienic issues are bothering me a bit. When she was going 3-4 days without showering and I would say something she would get really defensive and victimize herself. I‚Äôm not sure what I could say or do, I‚Äôm worried she might have a bacteria in her vagina that‚Äôs causing this issue, or it‚Äôs just her not showering enough. I‚Äôve never been close to another vagina besides hers so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs how they‚Äôre suppose to smell? How should I go about this issue?

619,"i was diagnosed with **Schizoaffective** disorder, anxiety in high school. i didnt believe i had a mental health problem until a incident happened on the internet and i was bullied and harassed into depression because i am gay.  it only takes one incident for something to change. and that was the one incident. my paranoia, anxiety and panic attacks are getting worse. i just lost my sister to breast cancer. after i lost her my views on the world changed and i dont know if its worth it to continue to live. i guess im in shock. i dont feel anything. i cant cry. i cried so much to the point where my tears are dry. so i cant feel. my stepfather is in the hospital due to covid-19 and i dont know if he will make it. 

my views in the world and people changed. i lost faith in humanity. i try to go to church and i still feel nothing, no connection to god. i dont believe god is by my side. i would like to believe. but i dont feel anything. i feel lost. after my sister died i fear death. i know the world dont stop when someone close to you passes away but i feel like my world stopped a long time ago even before my sister passed away. i feel alone. i feel like therapy dont help. i feel like talking to doctors about whats in my head is no help. 

i was committed to a mental hospital a few years ago and that didnt even help. it felt like a prison. they kept me in a room and i felt nothing but loneliness. no one (not even the doctors) ask me whats going on. no one bothered to help me and talk with me and dig deeper and try to find out why i feel the way i feel. i felt more alone in the mental hospital than i did when i had my freedom. 

i believe that after something bad happens to you, that stays with you forever. it affects your way of thinking and functioning. it travels with you throughout your life. 5 years past and it felt like just yesterday. times hasn't healed anything. im just learning how to live with the damage. i dont trust people. i dont even trust my therapist. in my head my i believe my therapist is one of the people who bullied me on the internet. that sounds crazy to say but thats how i feel. my mind is making up things that arent true and i cant function properly. i have a learning disability and i cant finish school because im distracted but my struggles and my mental health. im 31 years old. i havent accomplished anything. i feel alone. i hate myself. i hate the way i look, i talk. i have no self love. my mind is negative. i think negative. all the time. i dont know how to seek help. the right help. i just feel like doctors try to put me on medication so they wont have to deal with me. i need proper help.

621,"TW: mention of sexual assault 

(Throwaway account) I‚Äôm currently seeing a therapist for my ADHD diagnosis and undiagnosed depression (now online because of coronavirus). I‚Äôve been seeing her for around 9 months now but I‚Äôve been realizing how inappropriate and unprofessional she is. I‚Äôm a very socially anxious person and confrontations make me panicky, so I‚Äôd like some advice on how I can end the sessions and what reasons I can give. I‚Äôm not sure if I can be fully honest with why I don‚Äôt want to see her anymore as she might get insulted and the idea of getting into an argument with her stresses me out, but I‚Äôd like to have a closure session with her instead of just end everything over text. 

Here are just a few examples of her unprofessionalism:

1) She talks for most of the session about random things and I barely have room to talk at all, and when I do she constantly interrupts me
2) She CONSTANTLY makes references to her other patients and, although she doesn‚Äôt tell me their names, she tells me everything about their conditions and experiences
3) When I told her about my traumatic experience with sexual assault she said how I shouldn‚Äôt think my abuser is a bad person because ‚Äúbad mistakes don‚Äôt make bad people‚Äù, then dismissed the topic
4) When I told her how disgusted I was with the world after George Floyd‚Äôs murder she began ranting about how minorities are only being discriminated against because they have the mindset that they are inferior, how the protests are uncalled for, and how affirmative action is ‚Äúracist‚Äù to white people (she herself is white)
5) Whenever I make a statement that she finds powerful in some way she pauses the session for like 5 minutes and writes it down and says she‚Äôs going to use it in the new book that she is writing which disrupts the flow of any confessions I‚Äôm making

I just feel very uncomfortable with her and I feel like she might have done more damage than good to my mental health, but I‚Äôm not really sure how to address the problems I have with her.

Edit: thought I should mention how I live in a country where it wouldn‚Äôt be realistic to sue my therapist for any unprofessional behavior so I don‚Äôt think I can take any legal action",21Jun2020,2
622,"I dropped out of university 3 years ago. The reason I believed to be behind this was because I developed tinnitus (ringing in ears) at that time and couldn‚Äôt cope, gradually getting depression. However, on reflection there were other issues such as not being challenged by the work, not enjoying some of the work (bad module choices by me), unfairness in marking (individual grades being the average of the group in group work and having tests marked by classmates who often didn‚Äôt know the correct answer themselves) and not getting any constructive criticism on assignments (they would literally only say positive things).

I didn‚Äôt deal with any of these issues well, particularly the tinnitus but I‚Äôve had help from a therapist to deal with it better. I‚Äôm looking into studying again. I‚Äôll be able to make a better choice of university since I actually only enrolled with this university for an unrelated course, decided I wanted to go down a different path and just stayed at the same university when I switched. However, there is one problem I still can‚Äôt face up to and I‚Äôd like to do so before I‚Äôm forced: I haven‚Äôt told anyone that I quit. Not for 3 years. I have directly lied whenever the subject has come up.

It was difficult to begin with, as I felt like a failure and was embarrassed since I‚Äôd already switched course once. I don‚Äôt like the pressure my family put on me to do things when I‚Äôm not ready, and never felt comfortable talking to them about the tinnitus. I was also settled and comfortable in the city I was in. However, having avoided the situation for so long, I‚Äôm now worried about what people will think of me having kept this a secret for so long, and lied to their faces.

How do I tell my family and friends about this?",21Jun2020,1
623,"i‚Äôm 18F, and i don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. basically, i was dating someone within the friend group. they had liked me for a year and had repeatedly asked me out and i, in turn, had rejected them. but eventually i started feeling like i was the bad guy so i said yes out of guilt. this resulted in a 4-month relationship where the hormones died off about halfway through and then i was just left with all of the reasons i had denied them originally. i tried cutting it off in the most respectful way i knew how and tried to stay friends w them (it was my first relationship, though, so i definitely made some mistakes), but after they made several hurtful comments and acted v passive aggressively (including things like accusing me of using them for emotional support when i was crying about my dying dad after they asked me again and again what was wrong), i told them off and cut them out. 

in the middle of all this, my dad is dying of metastic melanoma. he passes, and it‚Äôs terrible. i‚Äôve never cried so much and i still do. two days after my dad died, a friend i had been talking to p regularly blocked me on all social media out of the blue. no conversation or any problems having been brought up (and, truthfully, i can‚Äôt think of anything that could‚Äôve been the problem except for me having broken up w my ex, but this took place about a month afterwards). this obviously fucked me ip. it‚Äôs been about 2 months since, and none of my friends have reached out to me. none. i‚Äôve confronted one of them about it to mixed results (she was v defensive over text but then got nice during a phone call). they post pictures together but have never even reached out to me once. 

i don‚Äôt know what to do. i‚Äôve never been so angry and depressed before. i see a therapist weekly and it only barely helps. i‚Äôve been neglecting all of my responsibilities and it‚Äôs all coming to its head soon. i‚Äôm also a senior, and i have a bunch of pressure to attend graduation and prepare for it and hold a graduation party, but going to graduation feels wrong without my dad (he always talked about how excited he was to see my graduate) and having a graduation party without any fucking friends sounds like pure concentration of social torture. 

any advice is appreciated. god knows i‚Äôm desperate",21Jun2020,1
624,"I'm 22M moving across the country to live with a relative in a suburban environment where I can find work in my field. Home is in the country where I have no way to get work in my field. I graduated from college in May and I don't want to sit around. 

I have found myself feeling stagnant. Just stuck. Emotionally, mentally, physically. I know everyone back home on a surface level, everyone knows me and I havent been able to really make any meaningful connections with people. I feel like I have exhausted my options so to speak. I haven't had a girlfriend in 5 years, I barely talk with anyone except for a couple of my close friends from high school.

I guess I am asking for advice on how I can avoid this feeling when I move away. I am excited about moving but can't help but be afraid that the same thing will happen. At home, I live with my mother and my younger brother. My mother is a very judgy person so I do not like to change anything about myself when I am around  her because I don't like to deal with the judgment and questions that she asks. For instance, I wore a decent getup for clothing the other day and she asked me if I was going on a date, to which I replied no, and then she asked why I was even wearing it. Well mom I want to feel good about what I'm wearing idk?! It's just frustrating.

So when I move, I plan on changing somethings about myself, my style, my appearance, because I won't have to feel judged on a daily basis. I want to date, but don't know where to start. I want to meet more people and make friends and meaningful connections, but I don't know how to go about that. When you're in high school, you automatically have a group of people you are forced to see on a daily basis and you can make friends  somewhat easily, but I have no idea how to make friends and approach people as an adult. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Sorry for the essay, but I thought I'd give this a try to see what help my fellow humans could offer. Thanks again in advance!",21Jun2020,1
625,"Since the pandemic started, I moved back home since end of March and it has felt like ages and ages. I am type of person who likes to live alone unless it is with someone I have a romantic relationship with then that's probably fine. But yea being at home is pretty draining for me right now.

I don't want to sound ungrateful or unappreciated but every summer we go somewhere and it's exactly around the time when most of my friends I met in highschool finish their uni semester. Like I don't always chat with my friend regular basis or see them thst often. I mean I don't need to see them often but wouldnt mind seeing them once in a while. Its pretty disappointing for me to go somewhere for such a long time and I don't get to see them. It honestly more like I am done with my semester and then waiting for them to be done. But then once they are done with their semester, I am on vacation. Once they are on vacation, I am back for uni. This is especially disappointing given thst I am in a relationship of almost 3yrs.

My partner and I are fine together in person but not great long distance.. So we really don't see each other that often. Probs once a month and try to talk at the end of the day. Usually we would be able to call at night but everyone in the fam is around and I don't feel that comfortable calling then. 

So my parents bought a house in Spain and they can officially have the house mid July. I am asked to go with them already 4th of July and stay for the rest of the month, to 'help out fixing the house' . Now my concerns are one, if I go with them we have to drive for two days and I have motion sickness. Two, I would have to stay with my parents with their friends in Spain(we won't be doing much until we can 'fix the house' . I actually don't really feel comfortable with my parents, without my brother. Three, I won't be able to see most of my friends (haven't seen most of them in like half a year). Four, I won't be able to concentrate the work I need and want to work on. Five, I probably will be feeling very cranky the fact that I am going there without being able to see my partner for more than a month.
Question is what should I do:
A) go with them on the 4th July by car and stay with their friends for a week until they can have the house(mid July) and then stay for the rest of the month
B) go with them on the 4th July by car and leave a week before the end of July
C) go by plane a week after 4th July

I really have no idea what I should do.... I want to help them out to show I care. At the same time, I do give up alot every summer. I have tried to tell them that it's ok I don't have to spend time with the evry summer. I am adult and I have plans of my own. They seem to value family vacation so much that I can't really do much about it... It really sucks cuz I just want to stay and stick aprund to see with my friends can hang out. I don't see them for half a year, worse of all, I don't get to spend enough time with my partner. Evry summer and winter break, it's always me being able to spend only four or five times out of 4 weeks.... And I see my parents practically everyday.",21Jun2020,1

629,"I created this account since I didn't want anyone ik irl to see me.

Anyways, during the COVID pandemic, not too long after online school started, my parents came up with the great idea to move into a new home. This new home was 2 hours away from our current home, knowing my family, that meant we were to never return after making the move. This really made me sad, considering I were to never see my friends or girlfriend again. What made it worse was when we moved, it was a whole new different internet provider or something so I had to go without wifi for around a month and a half. Due to that, my grades went from As and Bs to Ds and Fs. So the move really screwed up my feelings at first and my grades.

I missed my friends and girlfriend, so I tried to text my friends, but they'd never answer. I do message my girlfriend, but lately we've been getting into arguments which caused her to often times block me for a bit telling me not to talk to there. At this point, my grades screwed up, my friends are gone, and my relationship is starting to get worse. How do I plan to solve this? Easy, go on Discord and chat with some of my old buddies from a random server. 2 or so days later, I'm banned from the server and nobody DMs me. No friends, bad grades, rough relationship and banned from my only server. I was sad ofc but I never thought much of it until the next day, which was not too long ago, had I suddenly felt randomly sad. I'm not saying I have depression or something, so far I'm sure I'm mentally okay, but I can't help but cry over the fact that nobody besides my family even talks to me irl, and that even digitally, nobody talks to me. I've tried joining servers but it wasn't the same. As I'm typing this rn, my girlfriend told me not to talk to her around a day and a half ago, my friends never messaged me since I moved, I'm only in one server and I'm having a rough time getting buddie with them.

You should get a stable job."" - fast forward to me being almost 31 years old and having done ""everything right"" according to him - I am doing my (paid) phd right now, I have an ok paying job in IT - but that's not what I wanna do with my life. I am a singer/ songwriter on the side, but never spent enough time on it for it to go anywhere. Part of me wanted to quit my job earlier, but yeah I guess better late then never.

Best friend, 24, (let's call her Sarah) and I (F,24) met in gradeschool. We were fast friends. Lost touch some in HS due to typical drama, but we reconnected in college. She moved across country, but we stayed very close. Sarah moved back years ago. We share many hobbies, and She was one of my (two) closest friends. We didn't always see eye to eye and have a lot of differences, but she was always nice company. Admittedly, I was often frustrated by some personality traits of hers, and we always seemed to be in different ""seasons"" of life (me with a husband, kids, and a house. Her single, living at home, w/ no job at one point) which made it hard to connect sometimes. She had then moved out, and got a job.

Fast forward to January of 2020. Sarah was about to move to another city, and since we had done the long distance thing before, I wasn't very sad. I felt like she really needed this (she was always living under the thumb of family) and it would be good for her.  
She suddenly lost her job, and since she planned to move so soon, she was having trouble finding a new job. 

I work from home and own my own business along with being a SAHM so I offered her a temporary babysitting gig. It was a few hours a day, We negotiated pay and she accepted. 

The first day was spent with her (i still paid her) as my son wouldn't leave me.

THE INCIDENT: 
The second day, was much more successful and I was able to work (downstairs) while she and my son played upstairs. At one point, they came down and she expressed he wanted to go outside. 
I asked her to bring his shoes down to me and I'd help put them on. She agreed, and walked upstairs, my son stayed with me. About a minute later, I was thinking how dumb that was, and I'd just go upstairs and put his shoes on (the door is upstairs anyway).

As I finish walking upstairs, I round the corner and can see the door/shoes/ coat hooks. I started to say ""I was thinking--"" and startle her. I see that she has her full hand inside my purse, and my wallet is pulled out and open. Shocked, I just continued what I was saying, and she had a very quick reaction, and dropped down to grab the shoes, pretending to dig through the pile looking for them. 

I Glance at my wallet, and see it is still sticking out if my purse. I continue to pretend everything is normal (one of my biggest regrets, but I was so shocked) and she ends up sneaking to put my wallet away completely. I continue working, but get no work done, as I keep speaking upstairs wondering if she's going to get into my wallet again. Eventually, I bring my wallet downstairs with me for peace of mind.

Keep in mind, I had already had the cash for the day on my counter with HER wallet, 10+ feet away from mine. Not only is it a complete invasion of privacy and trust, but there was NO reason for her to be there. 

THE CONFRONTATION: That night I speak with my husband. I come to the conclusion that I do need to confront her, as much as I would like to just ignore it. (I come from a family that does NOT talk about feelings, ever.) 
When schedules align(about a week later), she comes over to borrow tools, with no idea i plan on confronting her and before she leaves I sit her down and simply say ""I saw you, you know."" 
She, still standing, immediately knows what im talking about bends over, gives me the saddest puppy dog eyes, and says ""I didnt take anything."" And gives me some excuse that she ""wantes to make sure I was OK to pay her"" and that she would ""feel bad"" accepting pay [for babysitting] from me"".

The following week was her going away party. I had known about this before she decided to dig through my purse, and since I agreed to go, I stuck to my word and went with the intention of keeping it short. 
I arrived, she spoke about 3 words to me (this was a very small get together. There was about 7 people including myself (Me, her mom, grandma, sister, Sarah, and 2 friends I hadn't met before.)) She never introduced me, they giggled and joked the whole time and when it was suitable, I left as fast as I could. She walked me to my car to return my tools, said thanks for coming, and we never spoke again.

NOW: 
Its been about 6 months since this all happened. I have no intention of rekindling this friendship, but EVERYWHERE Iook is a reminder of her. Everytime i leave my purse, im worried someone will get into it. 
I have no one else to share several of my hobbies with, and this COVID situation hasn't helped. I didnt have very many friends to start with. 
I have unfriended her on (i thought) all social media. I apparently missed my personal Instagram (which i dont use) but saw she was in town when I went to make a business IG post. I quickly unfriended her.
Its bad enough, that I've started dreaming about running into her again. 

I dont want to reach out because I don't want her to think im attempting to patch things, and have her shut me down.

640,"I live two states away from my family, but my sister just reported she's being followed by a co-worker. According to her, she used to hang out with him and another co-worker, but after she got furloughed during the pandemic, his behavior became increasingly erratic.

Now that she's back to work, he keeps ""accidentally"" bumping into her everywhere, and following her to and from work and turning away at the last turn.

He's a big guy, and this worries me greatly. What advice can I provide, because my big brother instincts just want to show up at this guy's house with a few of my friends and a baseball bat.",21Jun2020,1
641,"My S/O and I have had unprotected sex a few times, and her period's been a lot later than usual this time around.

We've done research, and we know that it could be stress or other things, but is there a way to know if it's a late period or if she's actually pregnant early on? Like symptoms and stuff?

If she is pregnant, we can't keep it (obviously). We're still students and we're entering our senior year of high school. I'm not fit to be a father, and neither of our households are fit to raise a child in (My family is prone to domestic disputes and outbursts of anger, her family is in poverty, with one parent, raising her and her 12-year-old low-functioning autistic brother). Normally, go-to would be abortion, but her mom is against that, and they can't afford it because her family's in poverty. I don't know if my family would be willing to help cover the cost, either.

We'd like anything that could get this done quickly, clean as possible (i know it'll be physically messy but yk what I mean), and hopefully discretely.

And if all else fails and you have no advice, then please pray for us if you believe in that. We really can't have a kid.",21Jun2020,1
642,"I have known this girl since seventh grade. We're gonna be seniors next year, and in the entire time I have known her she has had 5 boyfriends that I remember by name.

Boyfriend #1 was ok. They're still friends.

Boyfriends 2 3 and 4 cheated on her, lied to her, tried pressuring her into sex, and essentially ruined any form of  romantic intelligence she had. 4 was extremely toxic, and it broke my heart to see her so in love while he bragged to my other friends about having other girls over (in the sexual way- lie or not it's messed up)

After she broke up with #4 I made her promise me that she wouldn't immediately get into another relationship (as she had with all the others) and a month later she was on #5. I wasn't as mad though, because this boy was a close friend of my brothers and despite some vaguely homophobic/problematic shit he's said before, I knew he was 1000√ó better than #4 and didn't want to fight it.

Now in comes another girl I've been friends with for a while, with a somehow even more toxic relationship than the original friend. I'm referring to them as X and Y for simplicity's sake- best friend is X, other girl is Y.

Y's relationship is extremely fucked up. She's been dating this boy for at least three years now- he's cheated on her, manipulated her, and assulted her (she claims it was consentual but she has expressed discomfort with it happening). We know he's cheated because of multiple other mutual friends being like ""you know your boyfriend tried to have sex with me, right?"" Plus, every previous relationship was cheated on by the next.

Something happened involving X liking Y's boyfriend (and I have absolutely no idea why) and they hate each other. A lot.

Now X has a lot of problems, you guessed it, with jealousy and trust. Whenever #5 would go out to lunch or whatever as friends with Y she would get mad (mind you, boyfriend #3 would never let X hang out with #1 despite them just being friends at this point as they broke up for the reason of no longer wanting to be dating each other and then would go behind her back to hang out with another girl who he ended up leaving her for, expressing interest in her during the relationship)

I kind of understand where she's coming from- she knows how fucked Y's current relationship is and because of past experiences, expects Y and #5 to be seeing each other romantically.

They weren't.

Y and #5, along with three other friends, have a friend in another state who they were planning on visiting this weekend. #5 didn't tell X about the trip.

When she found out, she was pissed that he was hiding it from her and going out of state with Y.

They broke up.

I made her promise me once again she wouldn't get into another relationship.

Shes now in another relationship but claims ""it's comlicated"" and ""were not actually dating"" (she posted pics of them kissing, he does her streaks sometimes)

Now, I am a homosexual‚Ñ¢ and have no experience with hetero relationships. I don't understand what it's like to date guys. All I know is X is mentally fucked to the point that she needs that romantic validation but is always so scared to lose it to someone else that she is over the top with protecting the relationship.

I don't really want to get in the way of her being happy, cause she might be happy with this new guy, but I'm terrified that it's going to end the same way as every other one of them has.

Does anyone have experience with people like this? What can/should I do of this one goes downhill again?",21Jun2020,1
643,"So, i have always been a pretty big gamer but not o ly that. I like voicecalling with my friends and we can get pretty loud. After multiple complaints that i am too loud i decided to next to talking quieter bring back the argument of, okay let me put my pc in my room then. Before i get attacked for me demanding i should put our *family pc* in my room its a bit different. Last summer i spent all summer working to eventually buy a 2000 euro pc. I had done all the research, putting everything together, etc. I am also 18, which in belgium where i live is considered an adult so its not like i am a 13 year old wanting it.
The argument that my parents keep putting on is that 1 i barely will sleep then and 2 there has to be a equally powered pc downstairs aka i should work for 2000 euro again.
My mom mostly also says that its not healthy for me cause i dont have enough sleep. It has already been established that i am nocturnal. I prefer being active in the night and sleep in the day. I always get around 8 hours of sleep minimum so i get enough. I have tried the asking if in summer break i could put it in my room to no avail.
So im kind of lost here how can i convince them without needing to lose my vacation yet again to work for another one. I have also tried to get it in the attic or in our unused basement that im willing to fix.
Some personal experiences could also help, hear ur problems and how u solved em

644,"So I've been talking to this girl on a dating app more than I usually talked to anyone else and I'm starting to catch feelings for her. We get along really well and I've opened up to her about things I've never talked to anyone else before and she's been so respectful about it. For the past 3 days or so she seems a bit distant, doesn't reply as fast as before and doesn't initiate conversations. I didn't bother her much because she just had an exam so I gave her space for studying and stuff. But I don't know if she feels something more than friendship for me. Like I know it's way too soon and I think this is an insecurity of mine from the past but I wanna know if she at least enjoys talking to me so I don't get my hopes up. Should I wait more or should I be upfront about my feelings? And how should I tell her without possibly ruining things between us?",21Jun2020,1
645,"This post may end up being kind of long so I'll make sure to post a TL;DR at the end.

Both of my parents are very toxic people and now that I'm 18 years old and will be going off to college soon, I'm feeling even more motivated to do great in school so that I'll never have to rely on them or even see them again. The thing is, I find myself going in circles on whether or not I should completely cut my mom out of my life. 

Compared to my dad, she's the lesser of two evils but she has still said and done horrible things to me, other family members, other people, etc. and I'm just really sick of how toxic and negative she can be.

For example, one day I overheard her saying to my brother about how I'm a ""fake person"" and in that same day, she's proud of me for getting accepted into a college. 

My mom barely has any friends (at least that I know of) outside of one of her sisters and a woman she's known since high school and yet, she is constantly complaining to me about all of the bad things her friend is and does, but the moment she shows up to the house, she's buddying up with her, even if she was just complaining about her seconds prior, and it looks so fake to me.

She's a heavy believer in conspiracy theories so talking to her about anyone in the entertainment industry will lead to her talking about it without fail. Like I don't have anything against conspiracy theories, it's just when the person believing them starts to act like their more ""woke"" and knowledgeable than you that it becomes problematic, which is something that my mom does.

Whenever we have a discussion about just about anything, it'll sometimes end in her saying, ""well you're only 18"", ""you haven't lived as long as I have"", or ""I have more experience than you"" and it completely kills the conversation and makes me feel hurt to see her looking smug as though she just won the argument by saying that.

She has told me multiple times that she doesn't really talk to many of her own family members because they're always acting like they're better than each other yet I've seen her do the same thing multiple times so I'm assuming she's just as bad as they are.

My oldest sister hasn't talked to or seen my mom in years (the last time I saw her personally I had to be 7 or 8 years old) and I have always found it really weird. To this day I still don't have a 100% understanding as to why my sister cut my mom out of her life. I never talk to or ask my mom about it because it feels like it's a touchy subject that'll only make her upset but it only raises even more red flags that I have against her.

There's so many things she's done dating back to my early childhood that she's done that I won't ever forgive her for but I won't pretend like there hasn't been times she's been there for me.

She gives me good advice on relationships (it mostly being about not making the same mistakes she had), she encourages me to pursue whatever career I want, and several other things I'll always be grateful for but it's not enough for me to look past the bad things she's done.

It's gotten to the point that as of lately, when I imagine myself getting married, having children, buying a home, etc., she's never a part of it.

So I'm wondering, when is it okay to cut a family member out of your life?

TL;DR: My mom can be a very toxic person but there have been moments where she's been a decent mom to me but it's not enough to overlook all of the bad that she's done.",21Jun2020,1
646,"I understand a lot of the time when my parents say no to a piercing or something like that. But I also can‚Äôt even have my hair look the way I want. I‚Äôve wanted to do a side shave for a long time but my parents keep telling me no. And I always feel like they‚Äôre judging the way I dress and I feel so discouraged when they give me a look and end up just changing into something else.

So for this reason it makes me really anxious to turn 18 and be able to move out/ do what I want to do. And a lot of people are like be careful what you wish for because of that and say that being an adult sucks. But at this point a lot of stuff feels emotionally draining and it affects me every single day.

She has never mat him irl and hopefully NEVER WILL. But him almost being 18 I told her that was illegal and she should stop talking to him. We then got into a huge fight where she said over and over that ""It's not like I'm gonna go to his house"". I explained to her that HE could very easily go to HER house. Now she won't talk to me.

655,"Welp this definitely isn't as serious of an issue as some of the other ones I've seen around here. Still, it is the biggest one I've ever faced.

Honestly I've always felt much different than other people but have never been able to put it into words. I know each one of us is unique and likes to see themselves as someone special. However I don't believe that to be the case with me (pretty ironic I know). 

Whenever I talk to someone else I always feel like it is small talk. Even with my 'closest' friends I have never really had a truly satisfying conversation. Whenever it comes down to discuss of an abstract idea or concept it is like the person on the other side reaches a brick wall and just can't support me in the conversation any more. Most of my friends (who are quite intelligent, some of them have won international competitions in their area of interest, also tend to be better than me in most regards) easily become cynical when an opportunity for such a discussion arises and while they don't mention it is clear that they regard me as someone who is 'trying to look smart'. While they enjoy music/art... I've always found their understanding to be superficial or even totally missing the point of the piece. 

I often daydream and think of hypothetical scenarios of how a certain meeting/get together is going to be like. I am often able to predict what a person is going to say/ what their opinion on a certain matter is going to be. I honestly never feel mentally challenged in a conversation with my peers. Even when talking to a complete stranger for a long period time, although they present me with a lot of unfamiliar information about their life/discoveries i feel like i am being read a story that I've heard over a thousand times.

I have tried opening up myself to a couple of people but all of them found the conversation uncomfortable and tended to oversimplify my worries/mental distress in a way that it easily fits a model that they could recognize, understand and then present me with a solution that ultimately showed their absolute lack of understanding towards my problems. I am not the greatest communicator to ever live but I always try to express myself in a comprehensible manner.

I am 18 years old, live in Eastern Europe, have studied in one of the best schools in my country (where most of the intelligent ppl my age are supposed to be) but yet i still haven't found a single person with whom I don't consider conversation something trivial, never leading to any new realizations for me. 

It could be possible that I am extremely fixated on my way of thinking and therefore dismiss foreign opinion as superficial or have some kind of mental disorder. In any case I need your advice in finding like-minded people or conducting myself in a manner that doesn't make me feel like i am never going to be truly understood.

P.S English is obv. not my native language so if anything is unclear, I ll try to explain it better in the comments. Also I am aware that I've made myself look like a huge asshole for always looking for a 'deeper meaning' and  regarding ppl around me as 'unenlightened' but I often have a good time when i am out with my friends, it's just that recently it has started to become harder and harder to connect with them on mental level.",21Jun2020,1

The thing is, I‚Äôm about to leave the company anyway in a couple weeks. I‚Äôm not sure whether it‚Äôs worth reporting (do they even care about an HR report like this if you‚Äôre no longer employed there?).

657,"No, this is not a joke, I have a shit combination of severe IBS and a crippling phobia of anuses. I've never liked anuses like in porn, I've been scared that I'll hurt it, or somerhing like that, and that is probably part of what made my IBS so bad. 

I just need advice or insight if anyone else has suffered this problem or something like it. 

Context: In the past 5 months I've changed an unhealthy and inactive lifestyle to eating more healthy, drinking water, and increased excersise, I lost about 60 pounds so far and now have a healthy BMI. My bowel habits, I have none really, I've failed to find a good time to use the bathroom simply because I never really feel the need to, unless if it's gas or diarrhea which I may occasionally get, perhaps if I get too full idk, happened more in the past with my shitty non real foods diet. The last successful bowel movement, if you can call it that was small but shapely turd that didn't hurt or cause any feeling when coming out, how I guess normal bowel movements work.

Every other time, I'm straining or waiting to feel the sensation of a tiny yet hard to pass piece or something, but I never really do feel it unless I'm standing and when I sit the contraction gets weaker and the poop gets stuck. So obviously I need an enema to remove the stool.

That's where my phobia comes in and even at the risk of my stomach rupturing or a fissure, possibly even prolapse, if I keep going the way I am, despite all the possible serious, even fatal risk, I can't get the nozzle of the bottle up my hole, can't get fingers up there, nothing has gone up there, and the one time something did.

I was at the hospital and my dad and a nurse tied to hold me down, my dad is like a foot taller than me, and black, but the second I felt the tub and liquid finally make it in despite all my clenching, I just fucking shot up and got both of them off me then covered my ass while lying on the floor and crying and babbling.

My problem is I don't know if this a real undocumented phobia or some shit,  I get genuine anxiety when it comes to it, I can't think straight and I convince myself sometimes to just give up and let what happens happen. But that's stupid as shit I know it is, I need to take the enema, no other real way around it, so I just ask for advice to help me figure this thing out, why I react the way I do, even when I know myself I shouldn't.",21Jun2020,2

My mother was raise with conservative parents who supported racism and ableism and such. My dad was raised with divorced parents and his dad and step mom were very religious.

I look over and he was masturbating in front of me and said ‚Äúdude I just found out this thing you do where you rub your dick and it feels so good‚Äù or something along the lines of that. Being seven, I didn‚Äôt really understand what he was doing or why his penis was out in front of me and he insisted it was fine and that it felt great so he suggested I do it. I was nervous but gave in because he was older and the ‚Äúdominant friend‚Äù and I started to doing the same thing. I didn‚Äôt really have a sex drive at seven years old and wasn‚Äôt even into girls yet so I wasn‚Äôt getting hard so he insisted on jerking me off. I was naive and didn‚Äôt want to upset my friend who could literally beat my ass so I let it happen and he insisted I returned the favor so I did. 

This went on for about three months. Whenever we‚Äôd hang out he‚Äôd want to get handsy and it made me uncomfortable but I felt like I had no choice. He would guilt me into it and always say ‚ÄúI just wanna help you get the feeling.‚Äù 

I blocked out these events for the majority of my life and put them in my subconscious thoughts but as I got older and reached high school it really hit me that what went on was not okay and our friendship slowly faded. I‚Äôm 21 now and still don‚Äôt know what to think. 

Part of me feels like I let it happen to myself and I should‚Äôve known better but another part of me feels that he knew what he was doing and knew that I was naive and impressionable and he forced an unnatural sexual awakening on me. 

I think about it every day, and I‚Äôve come so close to telling my parents but they think so highly of him still and they don‚Äôt know why our friendship faded.

664,"**TLDR:** A professor accepted me despite my very big red flags. However after working for him I see that he is not a good professor at all, and I want to find a new advisor. I am afraid that if I do something like this it would be ungrateful towards him.

Edit: I am also funded, so I am not paying for my degree. I getting paid a stipend to work in the research project.

\---

I had a sketchy background in STEM, with a very turbulent academic story with some ups and downs. I had some very decent accomplishments but I also had very obvious failures which would definitely be considered as very serious red-flags, possibly deal breakers.

Still a professor in a first-world country accepted me I have been his student for several months. I am extremely grateful for everything. If it wasn't for him I was facing a lot of issues (most likely unemployment) in my shithole home country. The project sounded exciting and it was literally the only place that I accepted me, so I decided to took the opportunity. It was in a similar field to the STEM degree where I have my BSc. When I joined his group I had no agenda whatsoever of using it as a stepping stone, I was sincerely motivated to go for it.

However, I have always wanted to study computer science but I just didn't have the opportunity, I just said hey that's life I wanted to go on. I am doing master's in an engineering field where there is a lot of software use and programming.

I studied really hard the first semester, and had a very nice GPA, and I also worked on the project too. However, I was feeling burnout after some time and I wanted to take some off (maybe a week or two), but he was just dismissive of my request. My GPA is definitely take a hit this semester because I have been trying to go through everything in a burnout mode. I will try to recover it by makeups and everything, but it won't be as stellar as the first semester.

After spending some time under his guidance, I think that I was very poorly guided so far. I learned after coming here that he actually has a poor reputation in the department. Another fellow grad student also said he had a pretty poor command of his research area as well. It is like I am working on a project which sounds exciting but actually a total big mess which is all over the place. After spending almost a year, I have nothing to show for it. I won't go into too much technical details.

So, am I an asshole to want to leave this project and look for another advisor? I found that in my current institution there is a master's program in computer science for people who didn't do their BSc in computer science, and I cannot help but feel that my predicament might be a blessing in disguise for my passion. If that doesn't work out, I am thinking of switching to another advisor within my current engineering department.",21Jun2020,1

it made me lose fear of everything and everyone

well, not even fears, but you know, for example, when i watch someone incredibly successful it sometimes feels like (i think everyone can relate to this btw) they were meant to have it. like they're higher beings or something..

i know that they're not, but its how it is portrayed and its hard for your unconscious not to buy into that.

688,"Hey reddit,

I am a 17 year old, soon to be university student in Western-Europe.  My father died when I was 3 years old. Since my mother is mentally ill, a  consequence of his death was that I could not live with my mother  anymore. I came to live with my foster mother. She was a good person and  did a lot for me. Two years ago, she passed away. From then on I moved  in with my foster mother's sister and her husband. They had also been my  neighbours for about 12 years then, I knew them really quite well. 

A trait I see in my foster parents is that they think that because I  have been through a lot, I should have to do the least amount of things  possible. They (want to) do a lot for me. If I would not take them, I  think I would not have any responsibilities, really. The point is that I  think that giving me responsibilities is the best way to teach and  raise me. If it were up to my foster parents however, they would love to  take care of me like a grown baby forever. 

Sometimes I try to point out certain thinks that I think I should  learn to do myself, like grabbing a drink. They sometimes feel offended  or attacked when I say that, and point out that I am in fact the one who  often asks them to grab a drink. I don't deny this, but I think that  they should not give it to me, even if I want to. I can do it myself.  (This is not a problem anymore, but a year ago it was).  My response  might then be that it's obvious for me to take the easy route - namely  not to do something myself - but that it will destroy me in the end. 

With the passing of my foster mother, an amount of almost a hundred  thousand euros became mine. I understand that for a then fifteen year  old boy, this amount of money was impossible to handle. My foster mother  wrote in her testimonial  that this money can only be used for studying  (rent, books, intuition, exchange etc.)  and only with the permission  of my current foster parents and a judge - until I am 25 years old. 

I understand that it is a huge blessing to have access to such funds;  education in my country does not cost as much as in the United States,  but it still is a huge burden for a lot of people. The problem however,  is that I really feel that it is now time for me to take responsibility.  I think that, besides it being the goal of raising children, it's  really important to learn to control your life. 

I don't know how to feel about the money. I think that I will be able  to control it with responsibility and awareness. I want to learn. I  want to take responsibility for it, as I think that meaning really  derives from that. If I do end up handling it, that is what will make me  happy. But in the situation as it currently is, it feels like it is a  way for my foster parents to keep some kind of control over me until I  am 25. I don't want to ask for money every time I have to buy something.  I will not become a responsible adult as an effect of that.

How should I handle this?",21Jun2020,1

Also, about two week ago, me, my boyfriend, and Daniel were all talking on facetime and Daniel and I had a good conversation. My boyfriend decided to go to bed while Daniel and I decided to talk more. Initially, I did not know Daniel well since he is my boyfriends friend and we didn't talk until that point.

I was shocked when he told me and I told my boyfriend this and he got pissed at him for saying that.

693," The reason for the dispute is quite small in my opinion; dad called mom a ""fucking dumbass"" in front of a kid, mom won't accept an apology, kid has been apologized to. Now mom wants my dad to leave the house and go live somewhere else for a bit (the only option is very very far, about 200km or about 125 miles away).  
 I think it's completely irrational to send away the only source of money, food and housework for a reason like that. That would also harm mine and my sisters mental states, also a dispute between parents is one of the most stressful things their children can experience, so I've heard. Even if they have disputes it would be best for them to live together to the end in my opinion.   
Parents are both about 60 years old.

here's some info:  
 \- dad is frustrated that mom never does anything around the house, just sits around all day.  
\+that mom doesn't have money and needs to always rely on him.  
and it is draining to come home from work to someone who just laid about all day doing nothing, and they couldn't even be thoughtful enough to make food.   
\-mom doesn't have money because loans and maybe other reasons but she won't tell them.  
\+dad always does the groceries (95%) of the time, cooks, cleans (80% of the time).  
\-mom suffers from many illnesses such as heart disease and sleep apnea.    
\-dad feels as though mom is sucking him dry of his money and effort he puts in for the family.  
\-mom doesn't contribute to paying a small part for my sisters rent. - said she didn't promise to pay that

dad also speculated something about ""it's her revenge"" (?) I was strictly against that for that is very unhealthy of a thing to think about and might lead to further conflict.  


I have thought of the options a bit. Maybe coming to neutral ground or having a neutral party to help with it is the best thing to do, but I'm quite unsure they would not want to go to couples therapy or something like that. They both say there is something wrong with the other party, dad acknowledges his short comings, but mom doesn't.   
I could also try to patch it by myself.  
also don't get me wrong, both my parents are good people and want the best for me and my sister and stuff. My mother has never done anything bad for me, I just think that she is too prideful, to an irrational degree.

699,"I[21M] know this is stupid thing to be worried about. Sry and thanks! 

Long story short, I got friendzoned but still we talked everyday for 3 months (only on 4 days we didn't talk) and she called and texted and shared a lot of stuff. Everything was going well until one day she said she got some work and from there on she just replied with one words or one liners. She definitely can't be busy all day, I know her this well + she comes online on social media every now and then. 

Should I get a closure? Or just leave it be? She's clearly not interested in me anymore(not even a bit) *as if somebody said something about me to her*. NOW I carry all the convos and she never msgs first. Been 4 days since we talked. BUT she often told me she gets so sad sometimes that she doesn't talk to any of her friends for a week or so. Could it be this? (just being optimistic here)

Ngl I have very low self esteem and I have insane crush on her. Its was even fine for me being just friends. I just don't want her to have any impression of me which isn't even mine.

Tl;dr : got friendzoned, talked a lot for 3 months but she suddenly stopped talking (one word or line replies). Should I get a closure of what happened or leave it be?",21Jun2020,1

703,"I (19M) am looking for advice to try and refrain myself from hurting my sister or even kill her (I've been having temptations about it).

To start, my sister is a 15 years old mother of a year old child. During our childhood, I got beaten up a lot by my parents because she would hit me, and then cry when I hit back. This resulted in me deciding to move with my dad and my step mother when I turned 12, leaving my sister with my mom. The latter was having a bad time disciplining her for a year as she would shout at mom and even attempt to kick her. They decided to let her come live with my dad too.

One night, after dinner, I heard shouting from the kitchen and came to know that she ( then 8 years old ), insulted my step mother, who left for good and never got back with my dad. 
Dad and I lived alone for a while and it was heart breaking to see him cry every night bc of how shitty life was.

Side note : My dad was a tough man who would beat any guy that did anything wrong. He was the strongest of persons we all knew.

He started getting into drinking bc of how alone we were. One day, she showed me a picture of a woman and told me that she will come home soon. She did and she soon became my step mother. She brought a little balance to the family. We even accepted my sister back and she was so spoiled.

Fast forward 3 years, my sister confronted my stepmom about helping with chores and straight refused to help. What upset my step mom was that my dad let her talk without any respect to her and accepted that she went to the room without helping. She left dad the next day and dad didn't even talk sense into my sister. We don't have dinner together since that day.

Another year later, we learned my 14 y/o sister was 3 months pregnant. She would always come home at around 5pm after school which finished at 2:30pm and I would have to wait outside because she had the keys. Yet, my dad never said anything to her.

He even accepted her home while she was pregnant and the whole family insulted me for not accepting her back, even telling me to get the fuck out of the house if I didn't agree. I shut my mouth for a whole 5 months, not talking to anybody, went into depression and finished my HSC. 

My sister would often talk rough to my dad and my grand mother (who sadly passed 2 weeks ago).
Even though I didn't always talk to them, I always defended them when my sister would lash at them and they wouldn't dare to put her right into her place and command respect. Most of the times, I had police called to ""reason"" me and to tell me to quit causing them trouble. Eventually, she had the baby and I'm attached to him, but sorry I despise his mom.

Today, as it stands, the family gathered for an evening. My sister brought her new boyfriend because as I predicted, the father left.
I went into my room and I heard my sister tell my dad to fuck off from the house (his house).
When my dad asked her how she would get food, she straight up said that she doesn't give a shit about the food and him being here. Of course, she called him so many names that I won't mention.

I went to tell my dad to get inside, away from her. Guess what? He started talking loud to me, telling me to quit provoking them and even told me to get the fuck out of here. I didn't talk back a second and I went to my room. Half an hour later he knocked on my door and as I am writing this, he noticed I didn't reply and said "" what a shameful kid you are "" .

Idk how I kept my cool but tbh I don't wanna keep calm. I wanna harm her for good bc she cost my dad 2 wives, she killed the happiness of this family and she doesn't have any remorse. She disrespects everyone and yet everyone forgets and forgives. Always.


What does this kind of person deserve? What would you do?",21Jun2020,2
704,"So this is going to sound typical and I know I'm not the only one who's felt like this but honestly I don't know what to do.

It's your regular boy (me and I'm 18) who can't stop thinking about a girl (also 18) and just really want to get over it as quickly as possible. I don't know if I'm in love with her, I feel like I am. I've never felt like this.We spent the first year at university together and I was always attracted to her and honestly I was super jealous when she gave other attention who wasn't me. But never really felt like this. Over the last month or so, slowly she has taken over about 80% of my headspace. It doesn't matter what I'm doing I always start thinking about her and my heart just beats super fast. It won't stop. The only way it does is when I work out.

Shes had a boyfriend the whole time I've known her, but it's been complicated. She had her 1st boyfriend, left him. Got with another guy. And then over the last period gotten back with the 1st boyfriend. She always messages me about what's going on and what she did the night before and it drives me nuts. She talks about getting smashed (both in booze and by her boyfriend üòë) and honestly it really hurts. Like really hurts. She sometimes take hours to respond to me and the entire time I'm just waiting for a response and again I hate it. I want to just cut her off. Like just not talk to her. But I'm living with her again next year and I suspect it would be super awkward if I randomly just cut her off. But at the same time I really just want to focus on myself and not on her. I've already deleted Snapchat because I didn't want to see the stories and I don't know what to do.

I know this is super hollywood and typical but like I said, I don't know what to do. I've never felt like this and just want any advice that can possibly help. Thanks in advance.",21Jun2020,1
705,"I'm on mobile so forgive any weird formatting.

For quite a long time now my brother has really bad anger issues, when he's angry he'll scream at the top of his lungs or stomp around or hit soft objects (such as the couch). He'll threaten suicide and accuse everyone of being against him, we've tried getting him to get therapy or go on medication but he completely refuses. He's around 6' and I'm only 5'6 and he's such stronger than me so I'm terribly afraid whenever he's angry.

He'll be extremely manipulative and verbally abusive. I also have a history of being sexually abused from child-teenage years (not by him, thankfully) but I have a big fear of angry men because of it and i'll end up in a dissociatice state sometimes.

I don't know what to do, I don't know what I can say to my parents to get them to finally get ahold of his behavior because it's just expected of him now and they don't even try anymore.

Same thing today, I'm eating breakfast and freaked out internally. I had to slowly breathe to calm down. Randomly I keep telling myself I want to die, don't know how many times. That voice never goes away, it gets repetitive. Sometimes I feel so weak I just have to cry. I'm really tired lately, I wish things weren't this way.

708,"Coronavirus is incredibly scary to my mom. Where we live, the rate of infection has been very stable since late April/beginning May. The government is opening everything up &amp; making everyone take precautions when going outside. It's all very well organized. 

I ask for her to allow me to go out every time I make plans because I know that if I don't, she will take it as an insult. For the past two years I have been working hard to build our relationship from the ground up, since we have never had a good relationship. I genuinely have been trying my best to get closer to her, to be a good friend and listener, to console her when she needs it... I have done everything in my power. She never noticed the switch in demeanor and still finds reasons to be angry.

My mom wouldn't let me visit my boyfriend's house due to the coronavirus when I asked. I have asked multiple times over the past month. She only recently let me go out on dates with my boyfriend again since the coronavirus is less dramatic-- still not calm enough to visit a house though. 

Today, on a date with my boyfriend of 5 months, there was an emergency and he had to go home to take care of his nephew with severe ADHD (could be autism too, we don't know yet). No time to drop me off to the train station (and truthfully, I'm unsure if I would want to take the train anyway), I ended up going to his house. 30 minutes in, my mom calls me &amp; she knows I'm at his house from the way I'm talking and how the background sounds. 

When I come home, my mom threatens to kick me out of the house, tells me I will not be seeing him again nor going on the trip we have been planning. My father is less aggressive and hears me out. Tells me all the things I expected to hear: this is disrespectful, I should have kept my family's best interest in mind, I was being ""reckless"" (potentially exposing family to corona), my mom only wants the best for me, etc.

Some context on my mom: 

-  I'm pretty sure she's a narcissist; she only hears what she wants, anything she thinks is law and anyone who disagrees with her is a liar and a monster. Anything I do that she disagrees with is a personal attack to her (even if it's something small like putting condiments back in the wrong place she starts yelling). 

-  She sometimes convinces herself that events happened one way, when all evidence points to them happening another way. Won't listen to anyone telling her how things actually happened. 

- She thinks I'm weak and incompetent, unable to handle myself and irresponsible although I've been able to live on my own in the past with no trouble.

- She only knows how to scream and yell-- normal discussions are not a commonality. She won't listen to anyone else so arguing is always a dead end. My father and I agree she's sick in the head. 

Now I'm not sure how to talk to my mom. What should I say? In the end, I did disrespect her by going to his house knowing she did not feel comfortable, potentially risking coronavirus exposure (which I highly doubt happened, but this is irrelevant). Her reason for not letting me visit is not realistic, considering the state of coronavirus here, however it is also not completely untrue that visiting someone's house might risk exposure, no matter how little the risk is. 

Anyways.. what should I do? Do I go to her and talk about it? Should I wait for her to come to me? WILL she come to me? What do I say? How do I react when she explodes? How do I convince her to let me outside again? I don't want her to put my relationship in jeopardy.",21Jun2020,1

711,"My friend (15F) has been talking to this guy online over the last month or two and they like each other. The guy has a bodycount of 15 at age 17, and intentionally had a kid in freshman year. He broke up with the mother (also 17F now) in sophomore year. It was the mother's idea to have the kid, but he did agree to it. The mother got disowned but the father's parents were rather supportive? Now he takes care of the kid and whatnot.

I personally see several major red flags. First, they live across the country from each other. Second, I think intentionally having a kid at 14 is irrational and stupid.

Another close friend of hers thought it was wholesome and shows his like involvement in stuff, but together with the long distance and impaired judgement I don't see it going well.

712,"I (23 m) moved into a 2 bed 1 bath apartment with my girlfriend (20 f) in February because our two friends (who are dating, 18 m 18 f) needed my credit score to get approved anywhere.

I thought this was fine since we lived with them for a few months at a different location with no problems. 

About a month ago the girl (Kay) in the relationship got upset with my girlfriend because my girlfriend asked her not to have two specific people over at the apartment when she is home because she has a negative history with those people. My girlfriend said she didn't care if they were friends, but didn't want them over. Kay said all good and that was that. 

Kay has even admitted through text to my girlfriend that she is a fake friend to these individuals and that she enjoys being fake to people and that she enjoys getting others to feel bad about themselves and to feel sorry for her. 

The day after this conversation is where it all began. Kay deleted and blocked me and my girlfriend on Facebook and has ignored the many attempts of ours both in person and via social media to talk about what is going on. Kay simply storms out of the room if we try to talk while cussing under her breath. 

Kay has been very passive aggressive the last month, slamming cabinets and car doors, eating obnoxiously loudly (because we don't like the sound and she knows that) turning the on TV too loud when she gets home when I'm already playing music in the living room, burping loudly, taking long showers, taking no responsibility for cleaning, etc.  

Jim (her boyfriend) and I are on good terms, but he doesn't try to reconcile the situation.

 However, three weeks ago they decided to break the lease (that extends until Feb 2021) leaving a cost of living higher than my girlfriend and I can afford. The prospective roommates that we had in mind cancelled last minute and we have been unlucky at any other attempts. 

Jim and Kay have really put us in a difficult situation and they seem to be having a ball with it. They move out July 1st and part of me wants to wreak havoc on their rest of their time here but I'm not that type of person. I don't know how to handle this situation. 

I have so far simply tried to make eye contact with Kay Everytime she is in my viscinity, hopefully to strike up conversation, to no avail.

What would you do in this situation? Essentially, I've been playing this ignoring game with her, but it is eating at me (and I think she gets pleasure out of this as the word has it she does this with all her friends).",21Jun2020,1

714,"One of my best friends (16M) is extremely unhappy. He has been very withdrawn and stressed for like the past ten months, but everything has gotten worse for him over the past couple months. He hardly talks to anyone anymore, and I think he hates himself / his body. I know that he is very obsessive about body fat percentage, even though he is leaner than most people. It's like he sees himself as overweight, but he really isn't, and I think he is borderline underweight. I know that he has an awful relationship with food, I'm pretty sure he intentionally goes long periods of time without eating, for the sake of losing fat. Is he anorexic or something? He is seriously not even close to being fat, and this obsession with losing weight has completely engulfed his life. He is already suffering from so many other mental things, stresses, and this just adds to it. I don't know if he is actually turning anorexic because he does care about keeping muscle mass, so it's not like he is trying to actually starve himself and be extremely unhealthy, but I still don't think he is in a good place right now. I think he genuinely hates himself and I don't know what to do about it, or how he could start feeling better.",21Jun2020,1
715,"I'm a 21-year-old girl and I study Computer Science in Chicago. Over the past couple of years, I've been suffering from depression because of my mother. She is very controlling but also emotionally abusive. For example, she loves reminding me she should have had a miscarriage and when my dog was still alive she would threaten to hurt her if I didn't wear my hair a certain way or something.  


Things are only getting worse, but somehow at the same time, I'm getting better. I used to cut myself and I've attempted suicide twice in the past as a weird way of reacting (coping? idk) to her. I don't do that anymore, instead, I focus on my studies an trying to find a job. I have a motto ""Work Hard Leave Ofelia"" (Ofelia is her name). So I think I'm reacting to her better than I was in the past, but I'm still not in the best headspace, I think.    


For reasons I won't go into, it's becoming more and more clear to me that I need to get away from her, but I don't know how to. I only have one more year (maybe 3 semesters) before I graduate college and although most of it is paid for by scholarships, she still covers about 9k a year. I'm applying to software development jobs and internships all the time, but I'm not having any luck. I'm actually considering looking for a warehouse job or something.   


I don't have any friends or family that I can stay with. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do? I would prefer to finish my studies, but I think its more important that I leave her soon. Chicago has great public transport (really gets you everywhere in the city) so I don't need a car + car insurance. I just need enough for the basics (rent, food, utilities, etc.) and maybe 9k to continue studying.

716," 

So basically, I run a flipping business, buying and selling computer hardware. And its paid off, I now have a decent PC and laptop, except there's one issue. My mom shut my business down, she's a bit overprotective, thinking I'll get killed taking the subway or I'm gonna get murdered and kidnapped when I take a walk. I'm 5' 8. she took the funds I earned, and everything I bought but let me keep my Pc. Since no way in hell my mom would approve of flipping, I asked my friend for a $300 loan to pay off. My mom knows about this and wants me to pay him back by parting out my PC and selling it. I asked what about my funds and she said no since it was ""dirty money"" because it wasn't quote ""approved"" by her. I already have $135 dedicated out of the $300, and my initial plan was to sell a component ($250) buy a different component ($250) and flip that for $330 on eBay. if I sold X component, it would render my pc useless for a few days and I was fine with that, as long as Id get that $330. I would then plan on buying X component back for around $250 and use the rest for his funds. My mom doesn't approve of this, saying that I should just sell ""X"" component and dedicate the $250 towards him and not buy another one, basically rendering my pc useless. I tell her that I could just do it my way and have a win-win for everyone but she gets mad, saying I need to return it asap. We are in the middle of a COVID-19 outbreak. I have no idea why shes in such a rush since I can't even meet the guy for another month or two because of COVID-19. She says shell just keep the $300 and give it to him after 2-3 months, which I think is dumb because I could've just flipped it and I can easily pay his money back with time to spare if I had to pay him back in 2-3 months. My mom doesn't approve of this. Any ideas on what I should do?

TLDR: I owe a friend money, my mom wants me to part out my pc to get his money back asap, we are in the middle of a virus outbreak, I can get his money back with keeping my pc, mom doesn't approve.

He was getting mad. 

I got really uncomfortable and didn‚Äôt want to have it anymore but was afraid to say something. I said I didn‚Äôt want to give him head and he kept asking and making me feel guilty and like a prude so I did it. Then I let him go in with the condom because I just didn‚Äôt know how to deal with this all. He asked me to stay the night and I did cause again I was scared. The next morning the same thing happened d he had me face down and he wouldn‚Äôt let me switch positions and I tried three times so It got increasingly painful. Then he said ‚ÄòI almost took the condom off your lucky I‚Äôm a respectful guy‚Äô and I wanted to throw up. He took it off and finished on my back (didn‚Äôt go inside me) which I didn‚Äôt want him to do. When I turned over he slapped my face. It hurt. 

I think things like this I would be into if he asked. I didn‚Äôt say no the whole night but still I felt so violated and pressured. I went home and washed my body four times in the shower because I just wanted everywhere he touched off me. I don‚Äôt know how to feel about the whole situation. was I assaulted?

721,"I made a post on AITA asking whether I‚Äôm being an AH for holding my brother accountable for his money and his committments while he‚Äôs dealing with schizoaffective disorder. I got a lot of replies about him possibly being on drugs because of the amount of money he‚Äôs using.

Short story is that he can‚Äôt work at the moment, my parents give him money every day, but he texts me multiple times a week saying he‚Äôs stuck at the gas station with no gas. He doesn‚Äôt want to ask our parents for more money bc it‚Äôs usually the middle of the night so i send him some money with paypal. My parents don‚Äôt know about this, but they also have been suspicious of how much money he‚Äôs been asking for from them.
I‚Äôve told him numerous times to make sure he has enough money for gas bc he knows how much he‚Äôs going to be driving. But he keeps supposedly running out of gas in the middle of the night with no money.

Every time my parents try to confront him about anything he explodes at them. 

So, if he is on drugs then me giving him money for ‚Äúgas‚Äù is enabling him. But do I just cut him off? Next time he asks, i‚Äôll give it to him but tell him it‚Äôs the last time because I know how much money our parents are giving him and the he should be able to predict how much money he will need for gas?

But also, how do we get him help? Like I said, he explodes at my parents every time they ask him why he needs more money. I can‚Äôt imagine his reaction if any of us just came out and asked him if he‚Äôs buying drugs.

Thanks in advance!

722,"We were both 16 in school, we sat together in one class where some small talk happened. She used to point look at me with her friends when we were in the hall, and asked me for a picture with her on the last day of school, and she got all close to me during the picture. 

She really liked being around me despite being shy. I sort of knew she liked me at the time, but as a 16 year old, I was more interested in video games than girls.

Now I'm being haunted by these dreams which are guilt tripping me on how big a mistake I made by not doing anything. Like 4-5 powerful dreams a month. 

These dreams started since I created a Facebook account this year and found her profile.

HELP! I need advice on what to do. It's been 6 years, both 22 now, same city. Maybe platonic conversation with her on Facebook could de-mystify her and end my nightmares. But It'll be embarrassing if she's forgotten me and doesn't accept my friend request.",21Jun2020,1
723,"My uncle unfortunately passed a few years ago, leaving his wife a widow and his 3 kids without a father. Shortly after my uncle‚Äôs passing, my aunt began dating another man who had kids from a previous marriage.

Seeing him ordering my cousins around and buying them things as though he‚Äôs their father makes me so uncomfortably annoyed. It may be because my uncle was the best person I ever knew and I know that this new guy could never live up to that but I feel like I‚Äôm being a little unfair to this guy. It almost feels like a jealousy but on behalf of my uncle. I‚Äôm jealous that this new guy is getting to father these children that he had no hand in creating.

My plan was to wait to talk to my therapist about it before confronting him but I just couldn't hold it in. He told me that he didn't rape her but there were other things. He told me that he had babysat once and masturbated while the child was in the room. I am so disgusted, hurt, and horrified. He then tried to convince me that I could have raped someone when I was using (I have a long history of drug abuse.) The manipulation and lying is never ending with him. I had a lot of problems that I sorted out but it seems that he has no moral compass. I know that he is a compulsive liar because my parents have told me. I am so enraged that my parents would make me sleep in the same room as a sexual predator with out telling me.

727,"Are the days of moving across the world to see if it will work out over?

I (27f) met Patrick (25m) for 20 minutes in a bar in Croatia last August. He has the best smile. We got separated but caught each others Instagram. He DM‚Äôd me, I had loose plans for the rest of Europe and he suggested I see Switzerland, first offering me a hostel before offering to stay with him. He treated me so incredibly well with hikes to his uncles hut in the alps, time with his family, nights out in Bern and soaking in the hot tub in the morning. He came to Canada for thanksgiving. Everyone loved him. I saw how he could fit.

It was a backpackers dream, and when I returned home I felt very lost. Not just for days but months we stayed in contact. A year later I can‚Äôt drop him (unlike me). He came for Canadian thanksgiving and not a single soul in my family or friends didn‚Äôt like him which is very important to me. As an avid traveler, I‚Äôve had many ‚Äúromances‚Äù but this one I couldn‚Äôt shake.

I always felt if I were to be let go, why wouldn‚Äôt I live with him for a few months? Can this work or do I need to let go. (This is all COVID dependent). But there are cultural issues.

730,"Hey y‚Äôall

Have a bit of a small problem due soon, that‚Äôs bring up a larger one I‚Äôve been grappling with for a while. Gonna try to balance the two without going off the rails with irrelevant details!

The immediate decision I‚Äôm having to make by tomorrow is where to live. I was set to study abroad, but COVID recalled everybody to the main campus, and now we‚Äôre scrambling to determine housing. My school‚Äôs got a pretty unique policy and culture here, so I‚Äôll touch back on this later after a bit of context on why I‚Äôm making a big deal of it.

Essentially, I‚Äôm a rising junior in university, and had a pretty miserable first two years‚Äîpart of that was due to sticking around a friend group that 1. I didn‚Äôt really have anything in common with, 2. I always felt was the bookier ‚Äúfallback friends‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to leave out of anxiety (and the fact that our dorm system really fosters social cliques) and 3. I created all kinds of problems and sources of stress regarding (e.g. trying to change people vs. walking away, picking fights, reading too much into social cues to make myself feel shitty). I‚Äôve certainly had lots of enjoyable moments with this group of 8 guys or so, and I don‚Äôt want to make it seem as if they‚Äôre terrible people or I don‚Äôt genuinely like some of them, but they‚Äôre far from the types of friends I imagined spending my college years with. I‚Äôve (mostly just) thought about meeting new people I could get along better with at several points, but never actually cut ties out of a crucial fear that I‚Äôd be throwing any chance at having ‚Äúlifelong buddies from college‚Äù were I to try and start any new relationships at a time when most people at this small school were already cemented into groups thanks to the school structure.

This is a fear I‚Äôm still on the fence about legitimacy wise. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an invalid concern, and I‚Äôm moreso just trying to think if having these guys as lifelong friends would be better than whatever scrapping of casual acquaintances I could make while walking out of the door. That‚Äôs the crux of the bigger issue.

Now it‚Äôs relevant because in choosing my living situation tomorrow, I‚Äôm pretty much choosing between settling back with old friends, taking a chance with new people, or somewhere in the middle if I lived in my old dorm. Normally my school requires all students to live on campus their first 3 years‚Äîstudents almost always stay in their same residence hall as they are single sex and at their best serve as makeshift frats, at their worst assigned friend groups. I was planning to make new friends while studying abroad this semester, and come back to campus for one more term in my dorm with the added benefits of new friends across other dorms, then moving into a house with the friend group I mentioned for the last year (we‚Äôre all itching to get off campus).

However now that we‚Äôve been recalled this year, the school‚Äôs giving us the option of moving off early, which I could theoretically do with my old friends (although we aren‚Äôt on the best of terms as I haven‚Äôt dialed in to any of our weekly zoom sessions since spring breaking in march, so it could also get awkward). I can also move back into any on campus hall housing including my former dorm with some casual friends, but since my guys would likely be off campus I‚Äôd be sort of making new friends even in my old hall, even though we all pretty much know everyone on some level. This option seems appealing, but I also feel like it would keep me holding baggage that‚Äôs inadvisable for an ideal fresh start. Of course I‚Äôd much prefer to live off campus, but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd get along with the house. I‚Äôd like better friends, but I‚Äôm not sure I can find them from a dart throw, and worry that if I picked a new dorm community I wouldn‚Äôt befriend anybody fast or well enough to move off senior year as planned‚Äîand then I‚Äôd be trapped in a dorm I didn‚Äôt know well with mostly younger students as the worst case scenario. There's also the worry of being the new kid who didn't even bring his own roommate, I'm sure it's explainable after getting to know people but it definitely compounds the pressure I'd feel putting myself out there again at a nonstandard time in college. I know I'm biased in all kinds of unreasonable ways, but ultimately I‚Äôm still torn on the choices and also don‚Äôt really know how any old friends or new are going to react to each.

I‚Äôm anxious about this decision because it presents a real make or break moment in regards to either keeping my good but rocky friends or trying for something fresh. Whereas before, study abroad gave me a safe and gradual way to try out new social opportunities and potentially move in a new direction back at the main campus, now I‚Äôve kind of got to double down one way or the other. I‚Äôm not sure where to place the value between having deeper friendships (which I historically have always cut and run from), having a fresh batch of opportunities, or somewhere in between. I know this is melodrama, but I sincerely do appreciate any help from you guys in discerning the best option here.

Many thanks y‚Äôall.

tl;dr: COVID changing school's housing policy, choice to live in a comfortable or new environment (house off campus or different dorm) making me question friends and whether its more valuable to seek better relationships in the second half of school or to build deeper on the less than ideal ones I have already.",21Jun2020,1

734,"I‚Äôm sorry this will be a long one, I will add a TLDR at the end. 

I (23F) have been working at my current job for about 3 years. I work at a dental office and I work front end, though I am a trained assistant. In dental assisting school, I hated every minute but I carried through the program because I knew of the possibility of working administration instead. I have been going to university part time as well the past 3 years and have been flip flopping back and forth between what I want to go to school for.  

I have a lot of personal problems that I don‚Äôt talk about at work. A lot of family problems, I was kicked out of my moms house, moved in with my bf of 2 months. I have diagnosed generalized and social anxiety and just extremely low self esteem. I‚Äôm just having a really rough time and I have a tough time coping. 

I currently hate my job and it‚Äôs all because I have created these problems myself. My coworker and I were having a conversation about how my manager will go up to her and give her all these tasks that I am easily capable of doing. I was questioning why she would be giving those tasks to my coworker and not me. My coworker said that she thinks my manager is worried that I will talk back or that she thinks I‚Äôm rude. I was pretty shocked and was asking why she would think that. She brought up how at our xmas party my manager handed me a gift and she was telling everyone how angry she was that I didn‚Äôt thank her for the gift. I can‚Äôt remember if I didn‚Äôt thank her for it, I really can‚Äôt. I imagine that I would have said thank you because that‚Äôs the societal norm any time someone gives you anything. If I didn‚Äôt it was absolutely not intentional.

I remember that on this night I was anxious for a multitude of reasons and really did not want to go. We went to dinner and we all thought that it would just be dinner and then we would all go home. Half way through, the dentist and his wife were like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs all go to our house!‚Äù and I decided not to because I don‚Äôt drink and I also didn‚Äôt want to be awkwardly stuck there until 2am and feeling rude if I wanted to leave earlier. I wasn‚Äôt trying to be rude by leaving early, it just wasn‚Äôt originally planned to be an all night event, just dinner. Basically, I think that by doing this I really put a target on my back. Everyone must‚Äôve felt like I just didn‚Äôt want to hang out with them, not realizing that I am anxious. 

Fast forward I couple months and my manager hands me a note with my new (reduced) hours. It was about 8 hours less per week and they were all evening shifts. She told me that they were hiring someone who worked there 10 years ago and she will be working the full time 9-4 shifts (more hours than me). I was/am really hurt by this. I am being replaced. 

I can‚Äôt help but think that I have created all of these problems myself by having an ‚Äúattitude‚Äù and leaving the xmas party early etc. I don‚Äôt know if I can ever come back from this. I don‚Äôt even know if I can use any of these people as my references. I feel like I really fucked up.

Some background info:  Im a 17 year old girl (still in HS) and my brother is 3 years older than me, he's studying psychology in university. The situation is quite complicated so please bear with me!

My brother seems to be stuck in his own head and his thinking patterns.

The main problem being his fear of doing seemingly ""normal"" stuff. I'm not sure how to describe it but he's very anxious about a lot of things in his life. Getting his driver's license, getting a student job, taking his classes in uni,... I understand that is normal to feel anxious about stuff like this but it feels like the fear is taking over his life at this point. The problem is that he doesn't listen to any advice at all. He will come to us and tell us what's going on, but whenever we suggest something or give some tips he will always tell us it won't work and gives us a (poor) excuse. (Important! He does ASK us for advice. Eg: he will ask me how I stay motivated during my finals. He just doesn't listen to what I say or he'll say it won't work for him at all, even without trying it first). On top of that, he's also very moody and defensive, so talking to him is not very easy.

Eventually my mom wanted him to go talk to a psychiatrist and he agreed hesitantly. The doctor said he could give him something (like anxiety pills) but my brother says he wants to handle this problem without help from pills. (He has been to a psychologist too before but it didn't seem to help either) 

I personally feel like we tried everything we could to help/ support him, but nothing works and his situation is getting worse as the months/years go by. On top of that, I feel like everyone's mood has been getting worse because of this, it really affects my parents and me too... 

So does anybody have any advice on what I can do or say to him? I just want to help him and I want him to be happy...",21Jun2020,1

We got into a fight and I had him in a choke hold, I thought it might have been necessary to choke him out but I decided to let go. He gets up, walks over to the knife drawer in the kitchen, and damn near pulls out a knife. Then threatens to call the police on me as if I had been the perpetrator.

He's bipolar and hasn't been taking his meds lately. That probably had a lot to do with this. Regardless, I no longer feel safe in this household, and my mom is talking to him in his room right now. (We're both college students and have been at home the last few weeks because of the pandemic.) I was planning on driving back in a few days, but I'm now thinking that I should probably leave ASAP. I've already talked to my mother about it and we're in agreement that I'm definitely not the bad guy in this scenario, and that I'm not safe here right now.

I told my mom that she should really bring this up with his psychiatrist, but that probably can't happen until tomorrow. Just wondering if there's anything that can/should be done in the mean time.",21Jun2020,1

I‚Äôve been brought down so heavily to the point where nothing is interesting, my siblings are so blessed with life goals and big dreams and ambitions they have been chasing for their entire lives and i‚Äôm stuck, and before you tell me that ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs just that you aren‚Äôt able to go to fit in with the old system and that fucking bullshit. I‚Äôve always had this thought and i‚Äôve always pushed it aside and thinking of it makes me even more fucking worried of my future.

750,"so a little context before i begin: I‚Äôm 16, I live at home with my parents and my sister who‚Äôs 17. My dad met my mom in Brazil, where she was born in raised as a farmer. My dad has always loved drinking alcohol but I didn‚Äôt recognize it as a problem until recently. My dad works as a correctional officer. And according to my mom he had been a new person since he started working at the prison. 
And i believe that my mom hoards because that‚Äôs how she used to live in Brazil, and I have seen it first hand. Its just how they lived over there.
But anyways, my mom keeps anything of value in her corner of the master bedroom or garage. Our garage is just filled with old furniture and clothes and trash. And it‚Äôs hard to clean due to the fact that our garage door is broken. 
So when my dad comes home to a dirty ass house he does what he does on his days off work, gets super drunk and play video games, yelling and screaming at the tv or anybody who walks past all night. It‚Äôs been like this for a few years and from what i can see, it‚Äôs what made me and my sister hide in our rooms all day and it‚Äôs ruining our relationship within our family. The way me and my sister have coped with it was sneaking out and smoking weed all the time. But i‚Äôve come to realize that running from your problems doesn‚Äôt solve anything.

751,"These past months haven't been easy dealing with mental health issues. I have two friends who I trust with my everything and I don't want to lose them. Usually when it gets real bad I text them, and talk about it to ease my mind a bit. Yesterday, one of the two offered to come over and say hi, which is very nice of him. However, my parents (they caused most of my mental health problems) were being absolute dicks about everything they think i'm doing wrong, and I really didn't want them to get mad about said friend coming over. I stressed out and kept repeating myself in hopes that he would get the idea, which eventually worked. He told me he would talk to me in the morning and blocked me, because I was annoying him. When he eventually did, he said he would forget and forgive what I did, yet didn't want to accept my apologies. (Which I offered like 6 times)

In the meantime, I had talked to the other friend saying I was stressed out from fear of losing the first friend and making him so mad. He let me rant but he told me I was annoying him. I stopped and tried to only say positive things, but I failed after less than a minute. Eventually he left me on read and he still hasn't replied.

At this point I'm so stressed about losing them. These kinds of events seem to happen every time I try to talk to them about some of my issues. I know all of this is my fault, and I really want to fix it for good. The easiest thing would be to stop talking about my issues, but that would mean bottling everything up again and getting even more mental problems.

763,My 4th grade teacher was recently found dead behind the elementary school she was transferring over to last week. Nothing has been said on the news or online about it other than a few people who knew her posting about it. Other than that NO ONE has said anything. Just today an obituary was released on a private website. She was supposed to start working at this other elementary school during the start of the next school year. Supposedly she had finished her business at the school and never made it home that evening. People are saying they think she killed herself and that she was struggling with depression. Would it be wrong to leave flowers on her doorstep? When I was a kid I remember her saying the road she lives on during Halloween. I looked up her name to see if there was any news on her death and it immediately showed her address on the same road she said. Would it be an invasion of privacy or disruption of their mourning? She has two kids in their early 20s and a husband. I was going to go but then had second thoughts. I liked her very much as a teacher and she put a lot into her teaching and i wanted to express how much that meant to me. I was gonna at least go and leave the flowers at the door step and silently leave without knocking. Perhaps even leave a small note expressing how much she meant as a teacher. Would it be wierd?

766,".My CEO is something else. He meets with my manager weekly for meetings and my god I wish they could keep it private. Each week someone new takes a beating whether they are remote or in office. I literally overheard my own beating last week and he left straight after. Every time my boss looks defeated. No senior leader questions him. He is friendly the entire day otherwise. Keep in mind we are a 19 person team (right now only 6 in office after covid). 

The expectations are to send over 80 qualified leads to account managers a month. No adjustment for covid. All outbound. I do all of my own prospecting. I use a majority of my time with marketing or literally anything that comes up including financial reconciliation. I am 5 years out of uni and worked in many challenging roles, but this seems a bit ludicrous to do on my own given the oil and gas market. I‚Äôve been pulling insane hours and on so many calls.

My 3 weeks comes up next week. He had 3-4 sales reps before that never lasted.  I achieve about 15 qualified leads a months, without direction. I made up the plan as I went. It‚Äôs been reviewed and praised. But I genuinely think I am on the chopping block. The crisis has hit the oil and gas industry so hard, many companies have no budget or do not want to deviate from the norm.

Her tantrums are bad and have kinda scarred me and my sister. But shes expecting us to just get over them. When I tried to get her to understand that that's a ridiculous expectation she kinda broke down. Making threats of suicide and and also trying to rationalize any bad treatment with how she didnt have a good childhood. Apparently it was really bad.

She was upset because I was avoiding her for the past few days. That was way too much for her to handle apparently and that's what triggered the breakdown. To shed light on why I've been avoiding her: shes been getting upset that my sisters kinda dont treat her too right. One doesn't contact her (didnt grow up in our house) and the other one is the one I mentioned before. 

I overheard her talking to that sisters boyfriend and kinda just sandbagging us. Shes mentioning the ways my sisters treat her but she lumped me and my brother in with them too. I'm lazy sometimes but never malicious. She told my sisters boyfriend how we all dont care about her and how she wants to just leave us never to talk to us again and get some better children.

I was upset at this. And when I tried talking to her about it she basically kept brushing it off saying that we're family so we shouldn't hold grudges. She told me she wasnt comfortable being in the same house as me when I was holding ""animosity"" towards her.

Anyways now she doesn't seem to want to talk to me and I dont care. Just wanna last until the summers over anyways.

773,"As the title suggests, I‚Äôm currently stuck in a cult, which is called the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and plan on leaving as soon as I turn 18 in roughly three months. However, as a result of the isolation and sheltering that I‚Äôve experienced inside the SDA church/cult, I‚Äôm somewhat nervous about plunging headfirst into the real world. My purpose in writing this post is to learn as much as I can from you guys who have far more experience than me. In order to provide enough information, I‚Äôll give a quick summary of my situation, including my past, the present, and my hopes of a better future.

To properly preface this, however, I‚Äôm going to provide a quick summary of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, for reference throughout this post. The SDA church is a sect of Christianity that was founded in the early 1800s by a few extremists who believed that Jesus was returning to earth in October of 1844, and their most well known doctrine is that the day of worship is Saturday, instead of Sunday. The leading and most influential figure in the founding of the church was a woman by the name of Ellen White. She claimed to be a prophetess; purporting to receiving divine messages from god. These so-called prophecies ranged from the mundane to the extreme. For example, claiming divine inspiration, she became an ardent advocate of a horribly misogynistic worldview (ironic, given that she was a woman herself), the spanking (usually beating) of children, homophobia, pseudoscientific creationism, and distrust/boycotting of conventional medicine. Most of the SDA church‚Äôs members believe that all of Ellen White‚Äôs writings are infallibly true, and that they are prophetic messages from god for believers to follow. The SDA church as a whole doesn‚Äôt call themselves a cult, and in some cases, depending on the location, an SDA church and its members may function as a normal christian church. Hell, some of the more reasonable members in larger, more liberal locations have even completely ditched Ellen White‚Äôs propaganda due to how batshit crazy much of it is. However, in other cases, especially prevalent in the more rural and remote regions such as where I live, the churches form tightly knit groups of people who are inherently fundamental, extreme, and exclusive. Of course, they may not look this way on the outside, but once you‚Äôre in the cycle, it‚Äôs very hard to get out. This is the lifestyle I come from. Over the last few years, I‚Äôve rejected practically everything that was taught to me in the church, and have tried to replace it with facts and useful knowledge. I‚Äôve known that I don‚Äôt believe in god since I was around 13 years old, but only came out as an atheist when I was 16 years old. Of course, I was immediately placed on the ever-expanding list of the ‚Äúoutsiders,‚Äù but I‚Äôve dealt with it and have emerged from the entire shunning process with new life skills. I also believe that what I‚Äôve experienced as a child may help me benefit others someday who are going through similar struggles.

Now, going on the assumption that my preface provides enough information about the SDA church, here‚Äôs a condensed version of my past up until now. (For the sake of trying to not make this longer than it already is, I‚Äôm cutting out experiences that are not related to the questions I will ask. If anyone has any questions about anything, feel free to DM me)

I was born into an SDA family who at the time lived in a large city in Florida, but shortly after my brother was born, my parents decided that seclusion from the rest of the world would be the best environment to raise children, so we all moved to the middle of nowhere in Arkansas. (I was 6 years old when we moved) Consequently, I remember very little of the city and the somewhat normal life it provided. Since I was 6 years old, I‚Äôve been living in the woods with a very limited amount of contact to people outside the cult. The only consistent contact I‚Äôve had with good sized groups of people have been at ‚Äúfamily camps‚Äù hosted by the SDA church, which are honestly no fun at all. (Think of sermons all day for week, and relentless Bible study) This isolation from the rest of the world is by design, as Ellen White taught many messages ‚Äúfrom god‚Äù; one of them being that people should move from the cities to the country in order to stay pure from temptation and the evils of city life. As a result of the isolation (and the beliefs), I‚Äôve been homeschooled all my life, and I‚Äôm almost finished with 12th grade. I have begged my parents to let me attend the public school which is a thirty minute drive from our house, but they refused to let me, as I would be taught the ‚Äúevil theory of evolution‚Äù, and would come into contact with bad influences (reasonable). Whatever. I‚Äôm not trying to sweat it too much as I hope to be able to experience a social life once I leave, but the lack of experiencing high school like any other normal kid is definitely a huge social setback for me. While I have had limited contact with people outside via the internet, it hasn‚Äôt been very easy, since my parents heavily control the internet and our usage of it. (It‚Äôs supposed to be only for home school) A few times I have purchased phones unbeknownst to them, but they‚Äôve caught me with them, and as a result, I currently do not have a phone. (I will be able to get a couple of them back as soon as I turn 18; ones that they haven‚Äôt thrown away yet.) 

That‚Äôs a bit of my past, which greatly contributes to my current dilemma. As I write this, I‚Äôm just under three months from turning 18, which will make me a legal adult. I plan to leave the woods within a week of my birthday, but I really don‚Äôt have much experience in the real world, aside from occasional instances of freedom I‚Äôve experienced behind my parent‚Äôs back in the past. I have a few friends who are not members of the cult, but I haven‚Äôt been able to see them for almost two years. I definitely plan to hang with them for a bit and catch up, but I really want to avoid couch surfing. My goal is to get out on my own and be able to support myself relatively quickly. As I mentioned before, I‚Äôm close to finishing 12th grade (2-5 credits remaining, depending on the state I move to) and I would like to finish it after I leave. 

So here are the questions I pose. Please also comment anything that you think could prove useful to me once I leave, even if it isn‚Äôt related to the questions:

Would it be possible to enroll myself in a public school after my 18th birthday? If it is possible, what should I know before doing so? If not, what alternatives besides a GED test do I have? I‚Äôm looking forward to being able to have a social life while being able to finish my education, and high school seems to offer that, but if that‚Äôs not the best option, I would be open to other possibilities as well. I plan to go to college after I complete high school as well, although I‚Äôm not totally sure what I plan to major in.

I don‚Äôt have a car yet, or close to enough money to buy one. I plan on getting a job in order to buy a car as soon as possible (would have to be after I turn 18, however), so what would be you guys‚Äô suggestions for that? What are some good ways to balance school and work? 

In regards to social life, this is something I know I‚Äôm missing. I have good style and an outgoing personality, and have been described by many people as good-looking and personable. As such, I do not fit the stereotypical image of someone inside a cult at all, thanks to my rebellious attitude in regards to the churches rules/guidelines. I‚Äôm saying this because I don‚Äôt think I will have problems fitting in to social groups and the likes. However, my question is this: how would one find a good social group? What are some good ways to expand a social circle? Things I should know about relationships, etc? These are all very important to me and I‚Äôm really looking forward to hearing the answers.

In regards to drugs and alcohol, I‚Äôve smoked weed a few times, drank alcohol, and vaped a couple times. While I certainly haven‚Äôt had as much experience in those areas as most other people, I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself naive. I‚Äôll never fuck with tobacco again, and probably won‚Äôt consume alcohol to any great extents aside from at social events. I‚Äôm still down to smoke weed though, provided it doesn‚Äôt get in the way of more important things in life. Suggestions on the best ways to balance weed with other elements of life would be appreciated.

Any other tidbits of advice would be greatly appreciated. I understand that I‚Äôll probably have to learn many things from experience, but whatever I learn now could only be beneficial to me in the future. It never hurts to ask! :). 

*P.S. One may notice that I‚Äôve used the words ‚Äúcult‚Äù and ‚Äúchurch‚Äù interchangeably. This is primarily due to the fact that while the church‚Äôs doctrine does not technically fall under the definition of a cult, many of the churches and their members act in such a way that makes the SDA church indistinguishable from a cult. The determining factor is typically location. More liberal states will most likely contain more liberal Adventists, and more conservative/right wing states will contain more conservative Adventists. As I mentioned, I live in a very right wing state (Arkansas), and the Adventists that surround me are all bigoted conspiracy theorists who believe that the government is planting COVID19 throughout the USA in order to enforce new laws that will eventually fulfill prophecy and lead to Jesus‚Äô return during this century.*",21Jun2020,2

But yet I can't escape the feeling that I will regret not calling him.

Is this guilt justified, or should I reject it and stop pretending?",21Jun2020,1
775,"So, me (18F) and my mom and little bro (8) have been going on holidays in hotels a lot the past couple years and I've always complained at my mom spending so much money on hotels and stuff rather than campings. I always LOVED going out with the tent and I hate being in a hotel (because in my opinion, it doesn't feel like holiday, but more like being in a more uncomfortable home/house).

Now, after about 5 to 7 years she finally wants to go to a camping in Southern France (my favorite place to go), but I'm really not feeling up for it. She's given me the option to choose to come with or stay home, but she really wants me to come.

First reason I don't particularly want to go is because I've been saving money for a drivers license for years and I'm finally getting it done. I have my theory exam in a week or so and will start driving classes right away, but because of the holiday in between I will have to spend more money and time in the classes.

Second of all I have finally ordered computer parts and planks to build a desk and PC and I've been so hyped to start building it in the holiday, but I won't be able to do it if I go on holiday and after the holiday ends I'll be fully emerged in the stress of my last schoolyear and I won't have time til I get the next holiday which will be in December ish.

Third reason is that I have been online-dating someone for about 3 years and we were finally planning to meet in April, but covid ruined that for us considering he lives in a different country. Now that the borders are open again we were super stoked to finally be able to meet when we both have enough money, but the holiday would delay this by a long time because of both of him having work and me having school and work and studies. We are super super eager to meet and every day longer feels like torture.

Last of all because of illness I haven't been able to work a couple days this year (I only get 5 days off per year). Because it was of medical nature it's obviously a special case and I'm sure my boss would let me go, but I still feel like I'll wrong him for going out considering we're really short on staff. On top of that I'll also be opting out of a lot of much needed money at the moment which is super inconvenient since I have a lot of stuff to save up for...

I feel so wrong for rather leaning to not going towards my mom and brother, but considering the age gap between me and him we barely have anything to connect on. I have been so depraved of human interaction of my own age due to covid that I was really stoked to go out with friends and do fun stuff and now we'll go somewhere even more remote and away from people I can connect with... My mom will be so disappointed if I don't go with her and my brother will be too, and I might regret not going because I'm loveblind, but the rest of the stuff also really bothers me (mostly the work/money stuff)...

I'd love to get some advice as I myself am unable to get myself to want to go on holiday...",21Jun2020,1

780,"Hi. I‚Äôm sorry, this is mostly rambling. Every time I calm myself down enough to open this document again, I get what I think are panic attacks?

Shortest shortened version: I'm 27, female. My parents think I‚Äôll be having my final test this Thursday. In reality, I‚Äôm still 2 semesters short from finishing my degree. I‚Äôm not financially dependent on them, but I‚Äôm scared out of my mind, have been for a long time, which is why I started lying. I need someone to help me out of this mess. Specifically, *keep the lie alive* long enough for me to find alternative housing (I pay them rent, though there‚Äôs no contract) and move out. Someone to help me plan how to string them along.

**The goal of helping me lie is not to gain anything from them, just to get away.** I don‚Äôt have a lot of money, but I‚Äôd pay for help with a plan; I‚Äôm crafty, I could crochet, knit or sew you something amazing; I‚Äôm clever, I could tutor someone in Maths up to and surpassing the A-levels; I could write you a story or a paper, as clinical or hammy as you want. There are many things I know or can do, but my mind just keeps blanking when it comes to this. I just please need someone to help me keep this lie alive and get out.

At the moment, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm scared about more: What they‚Äôd do to me when they found out or what it would do to them. I love them. But I‚Äôm scared of and for them. My mother is under a lot of stress, for as long as I can remember she had to work really hard to keep the small family company (&lt;5 employees) afloat. My father is high-risk for a stroke.

They want me to finish my degree because they want me to be happy and have a high-paying job. I‚Äôd like that, too, but I already have several small steady incomes (like tutoring and crafting on demand) I‚Äôll have to give up. They don‚Äôt count as a job for my parents. And while those gigs would feed and house me for the next few years I get that they want better for me. And I will do it, but first I need to get myself out of here and be able to think again.

784,"I'm (20M) having hard time trusting anyone. 

When I was in elementary up until high school, I got bullied. I have friends but it seems like nobody cares. I never fought back. My parents told me that time to report it to the school but my teachers also doesn't even care. After that, I just think that it will end and I will graduate soon. So I graduated from hs and on college.

Because of what happened, I started being quiet. I don't talk to much to anyone. I never did initiate a conversation to anyone during that time. During the first two years in college, most of the time, I was alone. I have two friends during that time but their friend with different people so I don't hung out with them. I only go with them when they're alone. Also, I started enjoying having my time with myself. I fear that when I met more people and hung out with them, I'll get too dependent to them so I tried not to get involved with anyone. For me, group project sucks. As I've said, I'm having a hard time trusting anyone but in some point in your life, you need to trust anyone so you can work together. This group project did find me some friends. Even if I try to avoid them, they keep bugging me until I go with them. Most of the time, we're doing schoolworks together even if it's individual most of the time, they keep asking me for help. I get used to it until we finally graduated. I tried to trust one of them and opened up. I thought that it will be good for me to trust anyone again. But I think it was my worst decision.

As a result of what I did, I get too afraid trusting anyone again. When I opened up to one of my friend, he seems like he don't care and make me feel like he doesn't any have time for me but has more time with the others. He also made me feel like I'm the one who owes him even though it's the first time I ask and he's the one who's dragging me in the group. I get close to his friends nad because they're his friends, they trust him more than me. So I stop communicating with them but still helps whenever they ask. 

Today, I've become someone I'm not sure I like. I changed my accounts to minimize talking to anyone. When someone is having a conversating with me, I try to get over it as fast as possible. When I'm going to have a fight thru chat to someone, I just keep hanging them. No replies at all. I also become less talkative to my family and I keep locking myself in my room. 

Is it wrong to be this way? I really feel bad ignoring them and just thought that if I help them, eventually, they will change. But I feel worst when they talk back to me after rejecting them. How can you tell that someone is really your friend and is not just using you? TIA",21Jun2020,1
785,"Hello, everyone 25 y/o female here. Today is Father‚Äôs Day as many of you know. I wanted to spend time with my dad and make today a good day.

I feel really bad about it and I have a feeling she is mad at me but I don‚Äôt know how to not feel anxious around her. She likes to vent to me which is usually fine but today it was just overwhelming. I have also struggled a lot with setting appropriate boundaries and telling people ‚Äúno‚Äù so now I am trying to only agree with things I‚Äôm comfortable with but even then I give in a lot.

787,"It started during quarantine when I watched a lot of amazon prime series. There was just one lesbian too many and I wondered if I was being manipulated. The answer was yes, of course. An agenda is being pushed by hollywood, no question. 


So I posted what is going on on reddit and expect a strong reaction. To my great surprise, most people were absolutely fine with it and I no longer understood the world. I have nothing against lesbians or something, but I found it wrong to be manipulated so clearly on TV. 

So I find myself digging deeper. I am now extremely paranoid about the media and question everything that has ever felt right. I hardly believe anything that is not an uncut video without comment anymore. 

I am now called racist or homophobic on many of my posts. This has never happened to me before but I understand why people think that way. Many of my posts address topics that cannot be publicly discussed (eugenics, racism, transgender) and that from a very critical perspective.

789,"I (20M) have a sister (14F) who wants to go on holiday with her friend. (16F) The girl is going with her mother to Portugal for 3 and a half weeks, and they invited my sister to come along. 

My parents are split between letting her go, my father has some concerns but is okay with it, but  my mother has a lot of concerns and doesn‚Äôt want to let her go. There are a lot of positives as well as negatives of letting her go, would be a greats opportunity and learning experience for her, but it also means she would be without my parents for 3 1/2 weeks.

My sister has been friends with this girl for a year or so, they get on like a house on fire, I‚Äôve met the girl on many occasions and she seems to be a sensible and intelligent girl for her age. 

My father said he wanted to meet the mother before he agreed to anything, he is generally a good judge of character and he seemed to be fine with the mother. They fly out to Portugal regularly as they have real estate out there, so it‚Äôs something they‚Äôve done many times before.

I personally am on the fence about it because 3 and a half weeks in a foreign country with a family who are essentially strangers to me is a long time and I would be concerned about my sisters safety. But it would be a great opportunity for her to explore and build character. More importantly she is only 14 years of age, I think if it was when she was 15-16 it wouldn‚Äôt be such a problem.

Annoyingly my sister told my dad that mum didn‚Äôt have a problem with it which was a lie, so he has dived into this and met the mother this afternoon to see what she is like and if she could be trusted. Sister now knows that father is okay with her going, but I‚Äôm worried she will resent my mum if she doesn‚Äôt let her go. 
In hindsight my father should have verbally checked with my mother before doing anything, but it is what it is.

I would like to get your thoughts on it, if you want to ask any questions then go ahead.

I‚Äôm not saying this is my business and I know I have no bearing in this as a sibling, I‚Äôm just curious as what other people would do in this situation, if it was their 14 year old daughter would they let her go, and why/why not.",21Jun2020,1

791,"I (29F) invited my ex ( 30M with his cat)  to move in for a short period (90 days essentially) when his lease was up at the end of May since Covid19 is currently happening and he needed to leave the roommates he lived with at the time. I already had a roommate and 2 cats of my own in a 2 bedroom apartment. 

Little back story to help shed some light. He lived with his ex best friend, their partner and one other person. Said ex best friend transitioned sometime last year and with taking hormones became generally MUCH more difficult to live with. Ex bestie ""adopted"" a stray cat from their neighborhood and didnt bother really getting the poor thing shots, litter box training etc. There were tons of accidents that kept being placed at the exs feet since he already had a cat ( shocking right?) despite no prior accidents of this nature. The previous roommates had other issues with my ex that I generally ignored because I was NEVER over there anymore due to his cat and the tension that was palpable in the household. As thick as a steak Ill say that much. 

It IS worth mentioning that my exes cat was taught inappropriate play from kitten hood and will regularly bite, hiss, and attack ( even to his owner). My ex sees ZERO issue with this but has put the cat on prozac and recently gabapentin at my insistence. He will even attack house guests and my ex will just say, ""oh sorry yea he's kinda a dick"". He doesnt warn them before hand as far as I can tell and 2 people have already been bitten and scratched. 

My main concern when the ex moved in was how things would play out with the new cat. Both of mine Ive had for the last year ( I got them at 4 weeks old and bottlefed them) are great cats. Since they are siblings, they play hard with each other, and are super loving, sweet with me. I adore them. With the new cat in and taking over my living room, myself and my cats are cooped up in my bedroom ( I share with him) because one of my cats is afraid of new cat. He hissed and growled sooooo much in the first 2 weeks of being here, she has learned to hiss back and she hides when he sneaks into my room. I try to keep the door shut and make sure he doesnt come in because all he will do is run mine out. Im angry about this intrusion, this mean fucking cat that hisses at me, my cats, and is given treats by his owner ( my ex) basically hourly. Im upset that I cant even sit in my living room and enjoy my cats sitting on my lap because his cat will literally stare me down and growl. 

Overall, I really resent this whole situation. Am I wrong for this? I was trying to do something nice for someone I cared about ( I didnt even want to date him again just make sure he was safe and out of an emotionally abusive house) but now I really regret it. I really resent HIM, more than I did when we broke up even.

We fought so much for the first 2 weeks I finally told him he REALLY needed to find a place at the end of August but I really wish it was this month. Am I in the wrong for trying to help when I knew this cat would be THE biggest issue? My house is my refuge and I feel like Im always walking on eggshells in my own damn home. 

He is on the lease as a roommate and can be easily removed but Im at a loss as to how to deal with things until he moves. Mentally, Im breaking. Im disassociating so badly I lose track of time. My ptsd has been insane and I find myself having flashbacks and its hindering the quality of my life. I secured a therapist for the time being because I dont know what else to do but I dont know when I can afford to actually SEE her.

798,"I've been working as a cashier at my current job since last December and because of the current outbreak, my bosses have shown their true side of only caring about money and not the employees. My store has been slowly getting back into normancy with the hours and stopping cleaning carts, door handles and frequently cleaning our registers. But we are now mandatory having to wear masks. The masks we were given were the cheap disposable masks and they expected us to ALWAYS have them on, never take them off when you need to. I already had my own mask at this point from my mother-in-law when I was on cleaning buggies duty that prevented me inhaling flumes from the cleaning spray I had to used. But I was never told of this new rule and my mask was in my bag, in my locker, at the back of the store. So I was told to use the cheap disposable masks at the front. 
Now to explain something beforehand, I have a crooked nose that I had since I was a kid. When I was young, I had a door slammed against my nose that caused blood to go everywhere and I didn't know until my older sister's white shirt was covered in red by me. Since then my nose is sensitive to touch, anything tough or something pulling my nose down will dislocated it and I would have to relocate it back into back. 
Having that cheap disposable mask made my nose dislocate so many times. It was too big so it pulled my nose down and it was thick that I could breathe through. So I had to relocate it so many times that I had to take it off to let my nose rest and it keep dislocated after a few minutes. That made my managers pissed so I used my mask, it helped out better but soon dislocated my nose after a few houra of wearing it. So I went to my parents after they showed me their masks that they had, it was fabric with a ventilator in it and you could adjust it. I had gotten mine later and when I tried it on while adjusting it, it was pure BLISS. My nose didnt dislocate at all!. I was so happy to have the mask but recently this last Wednesday, I went to get my mask out of my bag. It wasn't there, now I never take it out at home or even outside. I got worried and looked in the front of the store, it wasn't there. Someone stole my mask, I was pissed that someone stole something from me and annoyed that I had to wear the disposable masks since my old mask was dirty. 
I tried to keep the mask off me as much as I could so I wouldn't have to relocate my nose every 5 minutes but after the 3rd time of me not wearing a mask, my boss J saw me and yelled me 'Do I have to paint a mask on you?'
I turned around at him and pulled my mask out a little from my pocket and replied 'I have mine in my pocket'.
To which he replied 'Well if it's in your pocket it's not doing anything to you.'
I was annoyed and pissed since they know that my nose dislocates and have SEEN me relocate at my register. 
What should I do about this? I'm already looking for other jobs cause this finally broke the camel's back for me after months of abuse from the coworkers at my store. I'm getting another mask from my parents but they have to order it online so I will have to wait.",21Jun2020,1

I lied about something and admitted it right afterwards and he flipped out, but then lies to me right after (which i wanna call him out on).

809,"I'm 32F and since I was in grade school, I feel like I've always had the symptoms. I get episodes of deep sadness and worthlessness and on ""good"" days, I feel nothing at all. I have severe apathy and low energy.

I used to at least be able to play videogames or draw once in a while, but lately I can't even do that. I just sit and stare at the wall while letting my mind wander until it's time for me to work, eat, or go to bed. Which I feel my decrease in energy has been from age. And it's why I'm finally considering therapy.

Like I said, I've been this way since I was very young. I was considered a ""good"" kid because I was never loud or destructive and I'd sink my attention into schoolwork and my art because it made for a good distraction. I grew up in an abusive home, so any distrsction I could take was a welcome one.

And while it took me a long time to learn that daily suicidal thoughts are not a normal part of adulthood, I've never actually attempted. Closest I've come was setting up a means to do it. But I've never needed hospitalization for a botched attempt. Honestly, Idk how I've gone this long without actually trying tbh.

Anyway, I'm kind of ranting. Sorry. But my concerns with how severe my condition is, I don't want to be locked up in an institution and I don't want to be put on any medication without any consideration of how it will affect me first. I know those pills can make depression worse and the side effects of some of them can be deadly. I found a therapist who will take my insurance but I'm worried he wont listen to my concerns first before breaking out the prescription pad or making arrangements for involuntary commitment. I mean, I've gone this long without it. So at this point would seeing a therapist only be detrimental?",21Jun2020,1

817,"
My (21f) younger brother (11m) came to visit and while we were hanging out he said he had sent a picture of what we were doing to one of his friends. I know most of his friends, so naturally I was like oh nice which one? And he says a friend he made online. How old? He‚Äôs 30m. This immediately brought me to be concerned. Not that all older people online are dangerous, but I‚Äôve heard enough horror stories. I pressed him to give me more details about the man and he got defensive, saying that he‚Äôs smart and knows how to deal with people online and that his new friend was a nice guy. He told me that he knew not to give out personal information. I wouldn‚Äôt think it was a big deal if he was just playing games online with the man, but it seems like he was going out of his way to talk to him offline. I asked if anyone knew about his friend, and he said yes. I asked if our mom knew about his friend, and he said no. That was pretty much the end of our conversation.
Fast forward to the next day, I tell my older sister who lives at home about the situation. She also thinks it‚Äôs weird. She winds up talking to my brother about it and he‚Äôs defensive and seeming to not want to give up information. After a while he tells her they‚Äôve been messaging on Instagram, but that the man has a separate account from his main one. An account that he made because his friends/family kept finding his profile and he wanted to keep this one a secret. Big red flag for me. We check out the account and there are no posts, no profile picture, and the man is following 4 people, one of which is my brother. That just seems ridiculously suspicious to me. A secret account that he‚Äôs using to talk to children he met online?
My question is what can I do now? We talked to my brother about how people on the internet don‚Äôt always have good intentions even if you may think they are nice. It doesn‚Äôt seem like he wants to believe that. I told my mom about the situation and she seemed upset, but she will probably address it with him soon. I know that he would be upset that I told our mom, but I value his safety much more than worrying about him being angry with me. We don‚Äôt really have evidence that the guy is actually harmful, but everything I‚Äôve heard and seen is giving me big creepy vibes. How should we address this with him?

I left a VERY bad impression of myself, which made the teachers lose respect for me, because I was constantly asking for help and was antisocial at the same time. I may have also given a vibe of intellectual superiority because my questions were hard hitting.

At the graduation day the leader of the education mispronounced my name and said ""And how does one pronounce THAT name"". I don't know how bad it is for me, but my final bachelor project was on a master level - so I am more than enough intelligent  to pursue further education easily.

* Master of Science (MSc) in Softwaredesign
   * More money
   * More jobs
   * Education in same city as my apartment
   * New beginning of my reputation
* Master of Science (MSc) in Health Science

829,"Apologies in advance because it‚Äôs very long and extremely messy but any and all input is appreciated 

(B = deceased, BF = best friend LB = little brother) 

Unfortunately at the beginning of the year BF lost her oldest brother B to suicide sadly I never got the chance to meet B as he and LB lived about 12 hours away but I spend a lot of time with this family and have learned so much about B that I almost feel like I do ‚Äòknow‚Äô him but I also have learned quite a lot about Bs final moments and a few things stand out to me. While individually these details are quite minor every time I think about the situation with all these things together something just seems .... off? 

1. I have heard multiple comments about how unexpected the whole thing was (which obviously is very common in suicides) but the comments seem to be more directed at the actual method (hanging) everyone seems to agree that it is quite brutal for someone like B and they would have thought he would go in a ‚Äògentler‚Äô way such as overdosing on sleeping pills etc. I am unsure whether it was done properly (broken neck) or whether he just slowly struggled but either way sounds so out of character for B 

2. Bs phone was not anywhere in the house, a few of his old phones were found in cupboards etc completely untouched (he didn‚Äôt wipe them when he upgraded etc so all of his old stuff was still on them) but his most recent phone which was only a few months old just wasn‚Äôt there 

3. Sadly B was not discovered for 9 days and the house was locked up so securely that police had to force entry using a battering ram. But the strange part is they described the scene as locked up the way you would do it when you were leaving not so much as coming home and locking the door behind you. They didn‚Äôt give further details about what kind of differences they meant just that the house was securely locked up 

4. Connected to 3, All of the curtains were closed and the lights were off which doesn‚Äôt sound weird until you know that B was afraid of the dark (not in a dramatic childish way you‚Äôd see in a movie just like there were fairy lights or those little night lights you plug into power points through the house you were never in complete darkness) which I thought wasn‚Äôt very realistic for a 24 year old man at the beginning but after Bs death LB moved in with BF so I‚Äôve spent plenty of nights with LB around and he is exactly the same as they describe B there has been plenty of nights when LB has slept through the night with his main bedroom light on a completely bright room and BF tells story‚Äôs of B sneaking into her room after he was told to turn his lights off as a kid so he wouldn‚Äôt have to be alone in the dark 

5. The one I find the most strange of all Bs dinner was on the table half eaten (dinner so presumably after dark with no lights and the curtains closed??) it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me that he would cook a meal sit down to eat half of it and then decide to get up and commit suicide?  

I realise that individually these things could be explained (he got rid of his phone, he didn‚Äôt want to be seen from outside etc etc) but I feel like all of them together is should have been noticed by some one other then me. Due to the obvious cause of death (and I assume the condition of the body after nine days in the sweltering coastal heat) it was ruled a suicide open and shut case but am I the only one connecting these dots in a more sinister way?

And if it is just me who thinks it‚Äôs weird do I really have a place to tell this family as an ‚Äòoutsider looking in‚Äô this family is grieving a loss but they are also grieving a suicide, to flip the whole story with the fact that I think it was some one else‚Äôs hand who took B from them is that going to help them heal or make it much harder to comprehend? And let‚Äôs just say I am right and there is a much bigger picture what if they discover that B wasn‚Äôt just a randomly chosen victim and there is some kind of reasoning for it and I end up opening their eyes in a bad way tarnishing Bs memory forever (okay I know I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself here) but is it better just to let them recover from this tragedy and keep my opinion to myself or should I say my piece and just roll with whatever responses and reactions that happen?",21Jun2020,1

Earlier today I went on my first ever date and I was admittedly and expectedly very nervous. I‚Äôm a 20 year old girl and I‚Äôve always stayed away from guys because a) culturally/religiously ingrained in me to do so, and b) as I grew older, so many of the relationships around me (including my parents‚Äô) was toxic and unappealing. Last week one of my coworkers and I started talking (our workplace is just a bunch of temporary college student workers) and he asked to hang out today. We met up at a beautiful park and I think it overall went super well. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs typical first date talk (there probably isn‚Äôt any really but let me overthink for a second) but our conversations flowed and even when there were brief silence moments they weren‚Äôt really awkward. He taught me how to skip rocks, we talked about random things, he wants to take me out to get good sushi, etc. He also noticed I was wearing faint purple eyeliner and complimented it, which I know sounds silly, but it made me so happy. At one point we sat by the water and I said that I was having a great time and i think he understandably took that as a sign to go in for a kiss. this part makes me cringe... I clenched my eyes and turned away. LOL. It makes me cringe laugh and I feel SO terrible. I told him not today and that I still thought he was really sweet and he handled it well (not that he had any choice). I honestly think we carried on with our conversation really well and it wasn‚Äôt awkward for long. We agreed to grab food at the end of our walk but family called and I had to go back home so I bailed on that. I later texted him thanking him for a good time and that I owed him lunch/dinner. He told me he had fun and that he‚Äôd gladly take me up on my offer. 

Ideally we would first become friends, really good friends, and then maybe pursue something romantic. I‚Äôve known him for 1.5 weeks really and have actually been talking to him for 1 week. It‚Äôs just too soon. And I‚Äôm inexperienced and fear intimacy I think. My friend suggested I tell him that I‚Äôd rather take it slow and get to know each other first the next time I hang out with him. I think this is a good idea and would appreciate some additional feedback. I know this is all so silly in comparison to the problems in the world and I apologize for that. 

((Bonus: Im definitely waiting until marriage to have sex. I think I‚Äôll be fine with kissing and that sort of stuff but definitely no sex. When do I let him know this???

I was blind and followed their influence and now I‚Äôm always negative and impatient and curse all the time.

839,"I‚Äôve been wrongly accused of sexual assault. There is a crazy girl a year younger then me who I snap chatted for a couple months last year. I ghosted her because I had heard some crazy things about her. She constantly asked to hangout. At a high school basketball game, I‚Äôd be playing later that night, she wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone. She txted me, had her friend txt me and approached me multiple times to hangout.I told her to ‚Äúleave me alone you crazy bitch‚Äù. She didn‚Äôt like it and sucker punched me in the nose from behind not long after. Everyone started freaking out on her and then she said I sexually assaulted her. I tried to press charges but my school said it would be best if we could put it behind us. Anyway, she said I tried to intoxicate her by getter her stoned and then begged her to have sex, ‚ÄúI touched her boob‚Äù. 
First of all, I was a stoner for 3 years of high school. I know if someone wanted to take advantage of someone they wouldn‚Äôt use weed to do it. 
A year passed and it was behind us until I got carried away on Facebook the other day. I had a disagreement over racism with her friend and she tried to back up her friend. Things got carried away and I called her a lunatic and put her on blast. She posted something on her story saying what a piece of shit I am for sexually assaulting her and how rude I am. Her 5-6 friends are also putting it on their story. I have no idea really how many people have posted it, seen it. I have no voice because my parents think I should let it blow over. 
Her story has changed multiple times btw so I really want her to take it to the police. The story she gave the school Is very different from what she is telling people on social media. My reputation is at risk. It‚Äôs my livelihood and in a small town word gets around super quick. I‚Äôm trying to be strong but I‚Äôm defeated right now.

841,"I previously worked in a role where I assisted my boss in development work. He decided on the projects and would assign me tasks to do to help him. I worked pretty independently and he would give me a weeks worth of tasks and as long as they were completed on time and accurately, he wasn‚Äôt bothered how I went about them. 

There was no progression in the role and I honestly felt I got the most out of it that I was going to. As it was my first job since leaving university, I decided it was time to move on and try and progress my career. 

I found a new job that sounded like a dream, it was running the type of projects that I‚Äôd previously been assisting on. Same industry. Amazing pay. 

I absolutely HATE this job. I had one day with my new boss, where a project was assigned me to and was given minimal guidance. I feel so lost and overwhelmed. I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing and there is nobody for me to seek advice from. This project could take up to a year and they are also in the process of building a lab facility so I‚Äôm just having to make do with what they have available at the moment in terms of equipment and finding space to actually work in. I tried to explain to my new boss that I was a little overwhelmed and he said you can do this, make me proud. He wants me to own this project so he doesn‚Äôt want to tell me how to do it.

843,"6 months ago life was amazing for me, I had two rather large groups of friends, I had just got with a girl I really liked, things were great.

Over the course of those six months, the friends in one of my groups basically told me I had to choose between them and my girlfriend's friend group. My dumb ass went with the girlfriend's friends.

Fast forward to now, it's been a week since my girlfriend suddenly decided she wanted to break up. I literally have no friends now. I've always been used to having at least a few friends, so I don't really know what to do.

I just feel sad, angry and almost betrayed by my girlfriend, I understand it's normal for a girl to lose interest after a while, I just didn't think it would happen with us.",21Jun2020,1
844,"tl;dr: I tricked myself into believing that my girlfriend is an innocent victim, I know for a fact it's the exact opposite but I don't actually believe it.

I (25M) have been together with this girl (25F) for a really short period of time. It was the best time of my life, honestly. I thought she was the one and everything, she was just perfect. At some point, she broke things off. I mean, put them on ""pause"" (and she'll want to get back together, as she usually does).

In the last few months, I've realized that she's the exact opposite of the person that she said she is, that I believed she is. She is a bad person. She was a bad girlfriend. She was abusive and toxic, deceived me in every possible way, lied to me on numerous occasions - from small stuff to even huge events that supposedly happened in her life. Everything was a lie. I loved her, but she was with me because of interest. I never realized it and it took a two psychologists, all of my friends and family for me to realize it.

During our time together, she always played the victim. Always acted innocent, always started drama and guilt-tripped me in every single occasion. She was hungry for attention. Even worse, when she couldn't get it from anyone else, she'd be all mine. When someone else gave her the attention, she would stop answering me (phone, texts, meetings etc.) and put me on the sideburner until she lost that other attention, moment when she'd be back. She was NEVER the victim. It was always her fault and I have proof for every single thing she ever told me.

The issue is that I keep thinking about her. I still have some feelings for her, although we haven't been together for a while now. I know for a(nother) fact that she will want to get back together once she loses her current popularity status. Again, I keep thinking about her and feeling pity and guilt for what she supposedly went through, as well as going through. We work in the same office, same position, can't do anything about her and we have to communicate - \~10-12 hours a day. I know, it's not ideal.

I know that I have nothing to be sorry for, that I've always given her all of my time, attention and love, I've always treated her the very best and been my best for her and if she had the chance, with all the guilt-tripping, she would literally have nothing to complain about. I'm not perfect but I really tried. For some reason, I keep circling back to thinking about her. It's the one thing that keeps me from losing all feelings for her. How do I stop it? Cutting all communications, even if it was possible, it's not the solution. Give it time? Worked, in general, but this one thing keeps haunting me. I have no idea what to do. I'm not in love with her anymore, but I do have feelings, and they're based on guilt and pity, not attraction. Even with all the solid proof, I keep getting the 'what ifs'.",21Jun2020,1

848,"Dear individuals of Reddit, I ask you to grant me the villager of your humble assistance.  

 *Disclaimer: I don't want to seem pompous or pretentious and I most certainly don't want to offend the people in this world who have it worse than myself. I only wish to share a problem in my life that only the kind people of Reddit can assist me with.* 

*( My race is not relevant but I would like you to understand me more),* I am a young African lady born and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa. With five siblings, I'm the third oldest. Something i'm very grateful for is that I grew quite well off.  I am no stranger to affluence and opulence*.* Currently, i'm a first year university student in Cape Town studying graphic design. However, I discovered a dilemma: 

My father is spending beyond his means. I found out through my chatty Auntie that he's losing money and that he's being investigated for something related to his wealth. He hasn't said anything about it. I confronted him about this and he lashed out at me and told me i'm only an 18 year old girl that doesn't know anything . I gave him space and later confronted him again about it and he told me very nicely that i'm young and I don't understand business. 

 He won't talk to me about it and my siblings are in denial about it. I told my oldest sister, and she didn't believe me. I don't think any of them realize that our ample livings are about to be cut short. My older sisters are 28 and 22 and very dependent on my father. They've never had jobs or any other form of income, he pays for all they're things. My 22 year old sister just graduated university and isn't interested in finding work anytime soon. 

We are quite a spoiled group and it worries me that my father is failing to prepare us for what is coming *( My father in prison or at least left with little to no money)* . I need my siblings to see that life is going to be different but they're very bratty and don't want to listen. They are unaware that my father sold all our homes, we are left with the one we currently live in. *( This isn't to brag, i'm painting a picture of how he is scrounging for money)* 

 I would like to get a job so that I can start being more independent and also help my father, but I know his pride won't let me help him. He also won't let me find work *( he says that the only job a university student can get is at a restaurant or in retail, which i don't mind, but he thinks i'll embarrass the family)*.  I want to be independent but it seems like he's against this. I understand that he wants us to have the best possible lives but I feel selfish taking so much from him while he's obviously struggling. I'm disappointed that my older siblings don't want to take initiative *( one is almost 30 and wanting to have a baby with her stay-at-home husband. A baby and a needy husband will only make things harder for my father)* 

In essence, i'm insinuating that I want to become a ""crutch"" for my dad and family. I want him to see that i'm here for him and that I will get a job and pay for my own things if I need to.

But as for now,  **where can I get a job or income that my dad doesn't know about?** I was thinking Online? I'm good at graphic design and being crafty. Maybe I start an Etsy store or freelance design, but i'm not sure how to do these things and I have no support at home to pursue a career in anything. 

People of Reddit, what do you think? I'd appreciate any advice on my family situation, probable criminal father *( I already have 3 uncles in prison for fraud and money laundering, my family has this corrupt reputation)* and any advice on starting an online business or making some money. I know I wont be earning that much at the start but I want to get into the habit of earning and handling money. 

Thank you so much :)",21Jun2020,1

850,"It's been 10 years now I've been an adult on my own and the entire time I've been in between jobs, the longest lasting a year, renting cheap rooms, staying on couches. I have no drive, no ambition, I have things I dream of. But i'm never able to put anything into action. I'm probably considered anorexic. I smoke like a chimney and eat once a day. My teeth are on the brink of rotting out completely. other than cigarettes I dont use any drugs or drink. I just wallow. the only effort i ever put into anything is ensuring I can continue to sit alone in my room and wallow. If I dont wallow for enough time every day I start to feel even worse. 

While I was working at my last job I spent $275 for a 1 hour session once a week for 4 weeks seeing a counselor. I didn't get anything from it and he mostly just listened to me talk about my life. After the 4th session he didnt do his usual ""schedule ur next apt!"" text so I just thought ""eh maybe there really isnt anything wrong with me and hes politely telling me not to keep wasting my money"".


thats the furthest I've ever got trying to treat it. Right now I'm doordashing and making just enough to cover my rent and food and cigarettes. I tried to apply for Medicaid but it said I don't make enough money so I'm not eligible. 


I just feel trapped. I'm not sad. I rarely feel sad. I rarely feel ANYTHING. I'm just so empty and void of will. I probably feel guilt more than anything else. Guilt over all the time i've wasted, opportunities I've wasted, wasting my health, my smile will be ruined in less than a few years as the cavities approach my visible teeth. 

The only thing that takes my mind off the guilt is wallowing. Sit in my room and distract myself. So thats what I do. I just distract myself and do the bare minimum to make ends meet.",21Jun2020,1
851,"I am on mobile so apologies for weird formatting.

As I'm sure is the same for a lot of you, my country is under lockdown right now. My parents are both high risk so I haven't been to see them since lock down began.

However, my mum is a paranoid schizophrenic and is currently in the middle of an episode. I know she'll be okay but I also know she's scared and confused right now; she wants her children around her but I can't risk making her sick.

I speak on the phone to both of my parents at least once a day and I know she's getting worse atm. My dad is struggling to cope with it all and has just found out he's facing redundancy. 

Furthermore the family dog was just attacked and my dad's bike was stolen, so they're really having a run of bad luck at the moment and I want to support them.

Aside from the obvious problems of not being able to see them during lock down, I also live with mental health issues and the stress of trying to help my family is pushing me further towards a break down of my own. I feel terribly selfish for thinking this but I really can't help it.

What would you do? Would you break lockdown rules to support your family (baring in mind that they are high risk and if they catch covid they would in a very bad way) or would you stay at a distance and continue with the phone calls, even though mum currently doesn't understand why I'm not there and really wants to see me? 

This feels like a really impossible situation and any advice would be appreciated.",21Jun2020,1

So far, given everything going on right now, it is going fine, but I‚Äôm actually surprised at the amount of adjusting it is actually taking. I have met a few people, but I can tell it will take time to really settle in. I think there are three factors that weigh into this:

1. COVID and other issues happening in our country.
2. I live alone, and I have always lived with roommates.
3. I am (obviously) in a new city that happens to be much larger than where I am from.

Does anyone have advice/feedback in terms of ways to adjust to living in a new city? I know this is a broad question, but I guess I mean from a general mindset perspective. I find myself immediately thinking of negative things. For example, I hear my upstairs neighbor walking around and it can be quite loud.

I'm all alone and it's all my fault. I want to work on that now, I think It's finally time for me to change (at least I'm in that reasonable state of mind at this moment).

883,"Trigger warning: Rape



10 years ago, a close friend (at the time) was accused of rape. He and the victim were both drunk, and, at a party, he raped her after she and others had gone to sleep.

We (my other friends and I) believed that because the victim was in a relationship, she invented the story to avoid the accountability of cheating. This led to a rift in our friend group of those who believed her, and those who believed him (he vehemently denied it). Had this happened today, I would have believed the victim without question. But because I was a bratty teenager who valued 'bros over hoes', I stood beside the rapist - my friend.

In the years that followed, the two of us drifted apart, but whenever we did meet, he would regularly make jokes about the situation: ""Haha, remember that time I was accused of rape. That was so funny."". As time went on, I educated myself, and became far more liberal. These jokes began to leave a foul taste in my mouth, and eventually I would actively avoid visiting his place of work to avoid conversation entirely.

This week, another victim has come forward and detailed a similar situation of that 10 years ago. Immediately, I removed him from all social media, and spoke to friends about doing the same. I made posts sharing the anonymous victim statement, and ensured that anyone following me was aware of what was happening.

Now, what I have never told anyone is that the night of the initial incident, he had invited me round for a pre-drinks. Someone had bought him enough alcohol for about 10 people, despite there being only 5 or so of us, and only about 3 that drank. He told me that his intention was to get one of the other girls at the party drunk, so that they could make out. At the time, I did not notice this obviously predatory behaviour. I should also note that this girl was notably inactive sexually, and also did not regularly drink (she also left the party early after looking visibly uncomfortable at his advances).

I can't stop feeling like I could have done something to stop him before any of these situations. I could have said something to make others aware of his behaviour.

The guilt of it all is really getting to me, and I need to know if there's anything at all that I can do to alleviate it.

Thanks",21Jun2020,3

Would thing be a bad idea? Can I even be a Forensic Psychologist if I have a mental disorder? What's your input?",21Jun2020,2
892,"So to put this in perspective (and without giving my exact age) I‚Äôm a millennial. At a much younger age I had LOADS of conflicts with my parents. Most of which being disagreements that I look back on now and tend to think that I blew out of proportion. Cuz you know being an adolescent, sometimes you think more highly of your intellect than you should. But regardless, it resulted in my mentality being that I ‚ÄúHated my parents‚Äù because they never seemed to understand me and the struggles I went through. They compared my life to theirs on countless occasions which can seem rather unfair in some cases.

But to get to the point here, the last few weeks has been rather difficult for me. I still live at home, my job reduced my hours so I don‚Äôt make as much as I could be. Which means I can‚Äôt save up fast enough to be out on my own like I wanted to be this year. So the BLM movement started, I was in support of my brothers and sisters in the black community as well as my LGBTQ+ friends and family. I‚Äôm not huge on violence as I have a more pacifist like mentality. Like all in all, I jus want people to love and respect each other. So I‚Äôll bring up topics every now and again to my mom and she always manages to shoot them down in her own way. Shutting out the idea that the black community is suffering more than any other ethnicity by eventually claiming that ‚Äúthere were just as many white slaves as there were blacks...‚Äù which I find hard to believe myself but I wouldn‚Äôt know where to check this information so I simply resign my argument and finish the dishes. We‚Äôve had arguments ending a lot with her saying negative things about the people protesting Police Brutality in the States. Claiming that ‚Äúpeople jus need to do what their told and they wouldn‚Äôt die!‚Äù 

This continues off and on, and there were two occasions that stuck out the most to me. So I design shirts for my work and we had a client that wanted pro BLM clothing. I struggled a bit since the client wanted African American models wearing the tshirts or just a mock of the clothing. I learned that the websites we used didn‚Äôt have a lot of diversity between their models. I managed to find the garments required and sent the job off. Normally when I‚Äôm stressed or under pressure I go to my mom for guidance or jus to talk out loud and help my thought process. I mention the project and she instantly gets confused and jus says to ‚Äúchange the models skin tone‚Äù. I let her know that I‚Äôm not comfortable doing that as it jus seems wrong. She then goes on a rant about why shirts should be make for EVERYONE and how unfair the client is being. I try to explain that the graphics are tied to African and African American culture but she just ignores it.

The second incident was more recently, and rather today. Father‚Äôs Day of all days! We were driving back from going out to lunch when my brother mentioned something about his friend having ‚Äúreasons why he didn‚Äôt like ‚Äòthe blacks‚Äô‚Äù and saying he somewhat agreed that ‚Äúthey are lazy and steal‚Äù. It may have been wrong of me to not interject and try to defend my position on that statement. Especially when my mom chimes in to agree and give her own account of witnessing ‚ÄúLazy black people‚Äù. Which I mean I get it, I myself am lazy at times, I‚Äôve met PLENTY of people that are lazy. But being black DOESN‚ÄôT MAKE YOU LAZY or mean that you steal! So we got home and I jus wanted to hide myself away. I went on my computer to talk and play with friends until I came outside to smoke and where I sit typing away on my phone trying to piece together what I‚Äôve been collectively thinking about the passed weeks leading to now.. 

I get it, you know I am a firm believer that the phrase ‚ÄúBlood is thicker than water.‚Äù Isn‚Äôt always the best way to excuse family members from being pieces of garbage or to excuse behavior they have. But I am seriously struggling, I‚Äôm wavering in a thin line again of do I really dislike my family? Are they really worth even being around anymore? And more importantly what CAN I DO to change my situation.

Side note: I don‚Äôt mention my father solely because I know his opinions. He‚Äôs solid trump supporter, hates the protests going on, is very pro-police, and really doesn‚Äôt think that police are targeting minorities or even specifically black people. I never really felt like I even connected well with him as a child since he was always working and never wanted to play with me or my brothers and jus wanted to do his own thing.

So I ask your advice Reddit, what kind of advice can you give me for this situation I‚Äôm in?",21Jun2020,0
893,"Hey y‚Äôall

Have a bit of a small problem due soon, that‚Äôs bring up a larger one I‚Äôve been grappling with for a while. The immediate decision I‚Äôm having to make by tomorrow is where to live. I was set to study abroad, but COVID recalled everybody to the main campus, and now we‚Äôre scrambling to determine housing. My school‚Äôs got a pretty unique policy and culture here, so I‚Äôll touch back on this later after a bit of context on why I‚Äôm making a big deal of it.

Essentially, I‚Äôm a rising junior in university, and had a pretty miserable first two years‚Äîpart of that was due to sticking around a friend group that 1. I didn‚Äôt really have anything in common with, 2. I always felt was the bookier ‚Äúfallback friends‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to leave out of anxiety (and the fact that our dorm system really fosters social cliques) and 3. I created all kinds of problems and sources of stress regarding (e.g. trying to change people vs. walking away, picking fights, reading too much into social cues to make myself feel shitty). I‚Äôve certainly had lots of enjoyable moments with this group of 8 guys or so, and I don‚Äôt want to make it seem as if they‚Äôre terrible people or I don‚Äôt genuinely like some of them, but they‚Äôre far from the types of friends I imagined spending my college years with. I‚Äôve (mostly just) thought about meeting new people I could get along better with at several points, but never actually cut ties out of a crucial fear that I‚Äôd be throwing any chance at having ‚Äúlifelong buddies from college‚Äù were I to try and start any new relationships at a time when most people at this small school were already cemented into groups thanks to the school structure.

This is a fear I‚Äôm still on the fence about legitimacy wise. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an invalid concern, and I‚Äôm moreso just trying to think if having these guys as lifelong friends would be better than whatever scrapping of casual acquaintances I could make while walking out of the door. That‚Äôs the crux of the bigger issue.

Now it‚Äôs relevant because in choosing my living situation tomorrow, I‚Äôm pretty much choosing between settling back with old friends, taking a chance with new people, or somewhere in the middle if I lived in my old dorm. Normally my school requires all students to live on campus their first 3 years‚Äîstudents almost always stay in their same residence hall as they are single sex and at their best serve as makeshift frats, at their worst assigned friend groups. I was planning to make new friends while studying abroad this semester, and come back to campus for one more term in my dorm with the added benefits of new friends across other dorms, then moving into a house with the friend group I mentioned for the last year (we‚Äôre all itching to get off campus).

However now that we‚Äôve been recalled this year, the school‚Äôs giving us the option of moving off early, which I could theoretically do with my old friends (although we aren‚Äôt on the best of terms as I haven‚Äôt dialed in to any of our weekly zoom sessions since spring breaking in march, so it could also get awkward). I can also move back into any on campus hall housing including my former dorm with some casual friends, but since my guys would likely be off campus I‚Äôd be sort of making new friends even in my old hall, even though we all pretty much know everyone on some level. This option seems appealing, but I also feel like it would keep me holding baggage that‚Äôs inadvisable for an ideal fresh start. Of course I‚Äôd much prefer to live off campus, but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd get along with the house. I‚Äôd like better friends, but I‚Äôm not sure I can find them from a dart throw, and worry that if I picked a new dorm community I wouldn‚Äôt befriend anybody fast or well enough to move off senior year as planned‚Äîand then I‚Äôd be trapped in a dorm I didn‚Äôt know well with mostly younger students as the worst case scenario. There's also the worry of being the new kid who didn't even bring his own roommate, I'm sure it's explainable after getting to know people but it definitely compounds the pressure I'd feel putting myself out there again at a nonstandard time in college. I know I'm biased in all kinds of unreasonable ways, but ultimately I‚Äôm still torn on the choices and also don‚Äôt really know how any old friends or new are going to react to each.

I‚Äôm anxious about this decision because it presents a real make or break moment in regards to either keeping my good but rocky friends or trying for something fresh. Whereas before, study abroad gave me a safe and gradual way to try out new social opportunities and potentially move in a new direction back at the main campus, now I‚Äôve kind of got to double down one way or the other. I‚Äôm not sure where to place the value between having deeper friendships (which I historically have always cut and run from), having a fresh batch of opportunities, or somewhere in between. I know this is melodrama, but I sincerely do appreciate any help from you guys in discerning the best option here.

Many thanks for listening y‚Äôall, sorry for the long post.

tl;dr: COVID changing school's housing policy, choice to live in a comfortable or new environment (house off campus or different dorm) making me question friends and whether its more valuable to seek better relationships in the second half of school or to build deeper on the less than ideal ones I have already.",21Jun2020,1
894,"To quote what most girls say

On a related note, I also don‚Äôt understand why girls these days are way more picky and selective about whom they want as a boyfriend.

896,"So not sure how to start this but in February of this year me and my girlfriend of 5 years broke up. I packed my bags and drove from Texas to Arizona back home.

I wasn't able to find work but my mom was super understanding so I haven't had to pay her to move back in or anything right now until I get a job again which I start in about 2 weeks. The break from working was definitely good to process everything that had just happened to me.The thing is. I'm 23 and I feel very overwhelmed and lost. I spent 5 years in a relationship with the wrong person. Doing the wrong things and I feel like I've lost out on a lot of stuff and I'm just not sure what to do.


 We started dating in Highschool and after highschool I did 1 semester of college and felt like college was not for me. So I did not go back the next semester and instead got a full time job and we moved in together once we were both 18 and have been together since then. The type of jobs I did were customer service and most recent job was IT stuff which I don't hate but wouldn't say I like in a professional setting. I love tech. I build my own computers. Love buying tech and installing it and fidgeting but in a professional setting my love dwindles for it a bit. The biggest thing though is I'm not sure what to do next.


 I mostly didn't go back to school or do what I wanted because of our relationship but now I'm free to pursue what I truly what but I cant get myself to make a decision.

Job starts, and is going well, until I started noticing that the work men aren‚Äôt doing what is said on the contract.

He has been complaining for about a week but says he's sleeping fine and he has no trouble breathing when making physical effort like biking quickly or for extended periods of time. I can't imagine a big physical problem would present with no issues in this situation. He tends to be a hypochondriac and thinks he has the worst thing possible when the mildest symptom shows up. 90% of the time nothing is actually wrong...

He's convinced something is wrong with his lungs and his life is in danger and he fixates on it and seems to literally be giving himself an anxiety attack. I tried talking to him about it in the nicest way possible and he just gets angry at me and tells me to leave him alone with my anxiety bullshit...  I'm literally just sitting on the couch instead of in bed with him cause he's so on edge.
Even if this is maybe an asthma attack from an unknown allergy, he is making it worse for himself and i dont know what to do, how do i help him?

912,"Ok, so, I (M26) met this girl (F19) 2 months ago, just a workmate nothing out of this world, we started talking through the corporate chat due to boredom and tbh, even though I never told her this, those chats were a highlight for my day, I always looked forward to them, talking at lunchtime was also great. As people do when they amongst new acquaintances, she was a little reserved at first but then she began to unravel more and showing off more with time, turns out she is the funniest person I've met, her way of talking, the words she uses, her timing, everything. It didn't take me long to develop a kinda obvious crush on her, I'm sure she and others noticed.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's there deal, she is young, way younger than me and I kinda suspected from the jump she wasn't straight, not sure if she was gay, bi, gender fluid or what have you, but I suspected she was not straight. However, her showing mutual interest and playing along made me believe she was okay with getting with a guy. Two weeks ago our workplace went full quarantine and we got sent home, it was the perfect excuse to ask her for her ig and keep the chats going there until it was time to go back to work, long story short, we did have a couple of good chats, but 4 days ago she finally ghosted me, I saw it coming since there were moments where she went from fully invested into the convo to abruptly ending the convo and acting uninterested. I can tell she started feeling weird about it at some point.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kinda mad, kinda in my feelings, but nothing that won't go away in a week, the closure I'm looking for is not so much for me, I would like to let her know that I understand she did what she did because she didn't want to hurt me and that I'm okay with cutting off contact if that would make her comfortable. I did write her a message summoning up the whole thing, didn't send it because I know she will probably ignore it as she did with the last one I sent (being ignored by anyone boils my blood) I have never struggled with my sexual identity and I can only imagine how bad it is to go through something like that, I just want her to find herself and live her best life, one time I asked her if she ever contemplated doing stand-up comedy and praised her for her sense of humor, she probably thought I was trying to flirt, but I really meant it. What I care the most is for her to embrace who she is and to find something that makes her whole, I know what it is to be her age and how destructive you can become when you have no direction, I've been there and I would hate that to happen to her.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know how to, the simplest solution is to text her, but I have childhood traumas about my feelings being disregarded and I know how shitty I would feel if she ignores me after opening-up. We are going to see each other eventually, sooner or later, I'm a grown-ass man, I'm not afraid of confrontation but it will be just too awkward for her, so I don't really know what to do, any ideas?.

I got a job at sonic because I had nothing to do during the day since I‚Äôm on summer break and wanted to make some extra money. I live with my dad so it‚Äôs not like I have to pay bills or anything. This is my first job and I am struggling with the demands that are required of the job, I‚Äôm not fast enough to keep up with the orders and I‚Äôm still getting the hang of remembering where everything is in the store. 

I‚Äôm on closing shift and I haven‚Äôt closed by myself once. It‚Äôs challenging to respond to orders and then try to clean up at the same time. I‚Äôm unused to multitasking so I‚Äôm really slow in a job field that requires speed and accuracy. It doesn‚Äôt help that my shifts coincide with a manager whose mission is to make life a living hell. She tries to help but I feel that she thinks I‚Äôm dumb which I can act really slow when it comes to something I‚Äôm completely new at. 

It‚Äôs not entirely her fault but I think she‚Äôs given up on me succeeding in the position because she talks to carhops about how she‚Äôll train them on my position and I heard her talking to another manager about how I‚Äôll be fired because I was making so many mistakes. After that day, I wanted to quit because I couldn‚Äôt handle the stress of my mistakes, inability to catch onto simple tasks like refilling the ice cream machine, still not knowing where things are/where they go, and a general lack of speed. 

My friend convinced me to stay, she was the one who got me the job but it‚Äôs draining my soul. I know I will encounter stressful work environments like fast food in the future but that one manager who‚Äôll smile in your face while stabbing you in the back just adds the cherry on top of the bullshit.

Turns out there was someone who could tell me not to run away, but it wasn't for moral judgement. I hadn't done enough research and it would be very unlikely to succeed in running away, well at least specifically to Philadelphia, PA. One of my friends (god bless her soul) has been having problems with her parents too, and she is turning 16 in July, which where I live (Ontario, Canada) is the legal age to both withdraw from parental control and be a homeowner/rent a house. She asked me, knowing that my parents abuse me, something I don't share with many people, if I would consider splitting rent. Now she knows I am 14, and turning 15 this year although late in the year. 

(WARNING A LOT OF LEGAL SHIT YOU MAY NOT CARE ABOUT)

According to the CAS (children's aid society) I can run away from home at 14, but my parents ARE allowed to order me back home. Now there is a failsafe/clause that is included that states that they can only order me back home if they can prove that I live in a place where I can be abused physically, emotionally or psychologically (Funny enough that's already the case). They have to get a court order, and I am allowed to testify against them. Thank god for the laws being so lenient, whereas in my other plan, almost everything involved illegal acts (identity fraud, illegal immigration). 

I hope that this is a better plan and works out. I am still keeping a tentative date of sometime in early August to enact the plan, although I will still be doing stuff in the meanwhile. We have found a condo renting two beds in a nearby town where I will still be able to go to my current school for an extremely good price (\~500 CAD a month) and by selling my jewelry I can pay for the first few months/food/necessities while searching for a job. 

Thank you guys so much for helping realize/find out what a stupid decision it would be run 1000 km away, I really appreciate it.

919,"I hate being posted on social media. I always have. I hate it even more now, because many people judge those who hang out with others during the pandemic. 

I‚Äôm so scared of being judged and have only just become (only a little) comfortable with hanging out with people. I wear a mask and try to social distance (sometimes I‚Äôm not good at this but I try to enforce it the best I can a majority of the time.)

Here‚Äôs the thing, though. I‚Äôm younger. My friends and family all try to take pictures without consent. They mean no harm, and I seem like I‚Äôm getting pissy over nothing and am trying to find an issue, but it‚Äôs a real problem for me. 

I don‚Äôt want people thinking I‚Äôm selfish for hanging out  with people when they see me in pictures. 

All they see is a picture of me not wearing a mask and not socially distancing (everyone goes ‚ÄúGet in for the picture!‚Äù And even when you stand off to the side/wear a mask to show that you‚Äôre taking precautions, they tell you to take off the mask and force you to get in the picture, not considering your discomfort.) 

People just see the dumb (everyone thinks younger people are dumb) ‚Äúkid‚Äù not socially distancing and not  being considerate to others. They don‚Äôt see you needing a therapist to get over your fears of even going over people‚Äôs houses *with* precautions because of looking selfish.

Now here‚Äôs the issue. 
 
My parents said they‚Äôd respect my desire to not take pictures/ post me on social media. They actually have respected this.

However, my issue is the fact that I‚Äôm put on the spot during social gatherings. They tell me to get in for the picture. I don‚Äôt want to, but it‚Äôs rude to step out. 

I hate this. 

Everyone‚Äôs so intent on me getting in the picture that they don‚Äôt realize I don‚Äôt want to. I want to figure it out with the therapist first. Until I‚Äôm comfortable enough to get into picture, I don‚Äôt want to. 

How do I make this clear to everyone politely? Pictures are taken so fast. I just don‚Äôt to even get in the picture because at any time, they could forget my wishes and post it. It‚Äôs dramatic to compare it to blackmail, but that‚Äôs the closest I can get to describing it.

923,"Throwaway because my friends know my Reddit account.

I (23f) was talking to a guy we will call Jay. We were talking for about 3 months before we ended up sleeping together a few times last month. We still talk, but nearly as much and we were never officially a couple. I definitely had more feelings than him, which is fine. I‚Äôve moved past that.

Then I find out my best friend (21f) is Snapchatting him. I only found this out on accident when she was showing me something on her phone and I see ‚ÄúJay is typing....‚Äù pop up. She took the phone away kind of quickly.

So I asked her, in a non-confrontational way, what Jay was talking about. She explained they were just talking about fashion stuff, which makes sense because we are all in school for design. I kind of brush it off as me being insecure.

But every time I would glance at her phone, she would be texting him on Snapchat/Instagram. This has been going on for a week now. 

Honestly, it hurts a bit because she knows I had very strong feelings for him and she literally watched me cry when he said he didn‚Äôt want a relationship. But at the same time, they were friends since high school before I came around so I don‚Äôt want to come off like a bitch and tell her to stop talking to him.

I‚Äôm kind of lost as to what to do. Should I just suck it up and admit I‚Äôm being insecure and leave this alone? Do I confront her about it in general? It pains me every time I go on Snapchat and they‚Äôre active at the same time and I can see both of their scores going up.

924,"I need help yall, this is gonna be a wild ride so strap in.

About 2 months ago, i (15M) sustained an injury, one where i had about a month of healing. One of my buddies, who had sustained a similar injury, told me how much it was gonna suck. His gf(14F) messaged me saying that she was sorry for what happened and that it would get better. Im a pretty manly guy with my hobbies. She thought i was pretty hot.

Heres where it gets interesting. I learned that my buddy talked shit about me 24/7 behind my back, all the damn time. So i figured, all is fair, if his gf likes me, im not gonna deny her feelings for me, cause fuck him. (Bad mistake #1)

So our Convos between me and her got pretty sexual, in which she said she wanted to do the dirty, where i basically laughed it off, and asked if she was serious, she said yes. I was taken aback. Obviously, being 15 means hormones galore in my head, so i didnt deny her advances over texts. (BIG mistake #2)

A few days in, my ex buddy learned we were talking like that, he sent me messages, i never replied. (Big mistake #3) 

Our messages got more and more crazy, between me and her. We hadnt met in person but we both had feelings for each other. I never denied her so i fucked up pretty hard. Over the course of the 3 weeks we talked, she had gotten really mad at me, countless times, where each time i would console her and get her to calm down. She said nasty shit about me whenever she was pissed. She would eventually calm down and i would forgive her.

around week 2, we wanted to meet up, we joked about having sex, we knew we werent going to. The next day comes around, and she cancels, i didnt know why, until i was told a few days later that my ex buddy stepped in and said no.

Later week 2, we actually did meet up, and nothing really happened, we talked about life, said our goodbyes, hugged, and left. That was the extent of it.

Week 3, we talk more, and she says she wanted me to ""Do things to her"" we video call here and there. And one night we stay up late, and we share nudes. The following day we meet up, and towards the end she asks me to kiss her. I do, she kisses me, and we called it there. She asks if she can give me a handjob, i dont deny. She tells me she wants me to finger her. Again, big mistake, but i do. During this she consented, and so did I. At the end we make out and we both leave. Later that night we get into another argument. And we hang out a few more times, the last day, is the most important.

She talks to me before i get there, about getting high on cough syrup, i warn her, and tell her thats a bad idea, she does it anyway. During the day, she gets more and more doped up. Around noon, she sends me a text, saying ""I want to do the sex"". I text back, saying thats a bad idea, we shouldnt. Maybe somewhere in here she doesnt remember and thinks we did, but we never had sex. She sends me a message later saying,  ""You should leave"" which she in person says ""No stay"", later i ask ""Do you want me to go"" over text, she says, ""No, stay"" 

I left later that day, and we went our own ways.

Next week, im at work, and she starts spouting about who she chose, me or my buddy, i tell her fine, she says delete the pics of us, which im keeping for evidence. Then she tells me to stop trying to ruin her life. I cuss her out, tell her to fuck off since break was over. Then when i get home, she shares some of our chats, when we got pretty sexual, she threw me under the bus cause she got caught cheating. I didnt know till it was too late, that she told my ex buddy, her bf, that i tried to rape her, i never did.

So i call up the homie, tell him about the situation, he tells me its fucked it. I get to a part where i tell him he cussed him out, and hes part of a pretty big gang, so hes pissed off about it and wants to jump him.

Now im here, wondering what i do, i cant get enough people on my side of the story, so wtf do I do? Accept my fate as being falsely accused of rape? Take her to court? If i do, well im fucked, the messages are gonna put me in a horrible light, and shes a girl so shes got a leg up on me anyway.

Wtf so i do, seriously?",21Jun2020,2
926,"TW: Emotional abuse, mention of suicidal thoughts.

Tl;dr at the bottom.

From age 13-15, I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. I won't deny there was immature and toxic behavior from both of us, and I can identify that now that I'm older. But when we hit high school, it got so much worse. He was extremely manipulative and even after we broke up, he made life hell for me. He used to stand outside of school with his friends and they would wait for me to show up and they would yell at me, call me names, just berate me. I stopped going to school and when I got called in due to truancy, I told our principal that he was a big reason I didn't want to go anymore. I didn't feel safe at school. He made me feel completely worthless and I wanted to kill myself every moment of every day. 

I moved away and during that time, my best friend became best friends with my abuser. At the time, she didn't know what happened. They stopped being friends and I opened up to her about his abuse and his role in my life basically falling apart.

I moved back and a few months after, I ran into him again, and I thought I was at a place where I didn't want to hold anger towards him and I told him I forgave him for what he did. Fast forward a year, and he decided he didn't want to be friends with me and my other friends would tell me he would constantly talk shit about me.

My best friend also rekindled her friendship with my abuser and they're now basically joined at the hip. They even got ""best friend tattoos"". I have confronted her before about her being friends with my abuser upsets me and that I was definitely wrong about being at a place of forgiveness with him. She definitely carries a ""they didn't do it to me"" mentality so she just started lying to me or not telling me about every time they would hang out. Which of course by NO MEANS is she obligated to do that. But she tells my fiance no problem? I feel like she's trying to protect my feelings but that honestly makes it worse for me.

What upsets me the most is that she expected everyone to stop being friends with her abusive ex and gets upset if anyone even mentions him. But somehow my abuse doesn't mean anything to her. This has bothered me and I've reached a point where I don't want to continue our friendship for my own sake, but we live together and neither of us are able to leave any time soon.

As soon as I finished ranting H told M what I had said.

Now, 2 months later H had left me on read for a full day (I was excited to hang out with him cause he was coming back to town to visit) and I was feeling butt hurt so I messaged him a passive aggressive paragraph about ‚Äúnot opening messages if you don‚Äôt have time to at least say you‚Äôre busy‚Äù and he sent me a paragraph saying ‚Äúeveryone is still disturbed about the fight you and M had, and I don‚Äôt like that you brought me into the middle of it. And don‚Äôt talk behind my back you know M would tell me.‚Äù Now I was confused, was this about my feelings being hurt cause of the texts?

932,"(english is not my first language, so I apologise for any grammar mistakes) 

(Female, 20 years old)

I could really use some advice about a situation I'm facing at work. I work for a financial company, it's a start up, I've been working there for a year now.

And I work solving problems customers had during their financial transfers. So everyone I serve is really angry because something went wrong,, and that can be really stressfull sometimes. 

As the company started growing, we started to get more clients, and so the need to bring more people in to my team came up. So they promoted a girl who worked in customer service, who was a really good friend of mine at the time.

But as soon as we started working together, I realised that she is a really selfish person. She won't share any important information with me about work, to purposely leave me in the dark. She tries to take all my clients from me. She is always making mean comments about the things I do. Overall, not a good co-worker. 

This month I completed a year in the company (and so did she, we entered the company at the same month) and all this time working with angry customers finally caught up to me, and I find myself more and more tired and nervous, each day. And I'm also in college, so the stress from work is making hard for me to focus in my classes, and even to sleep.

Last week, an opportunity came up, they opened a position in another department of the company. It's a really promising job, with better pay, and related to the industry I'm studying in college, so it would be an amazing opportunity for me. 

So I applied to the job. And so did my co-worker.

I think I should mention that a few months ago, another position opened at the company, something I really wanted to work with. And that I've always told her, since day one, that I would like to work with. When the position opened up, she applied for it before I could. And I didn't want to create a more hostile environment between us, so I didn't apply. She didn't get the job in the end, so whatever. But I couldn't even try, in respect for her. 

Now, this position opened up, also in a department I've always showed interest in working, and she didn't even think twice before applying too. And I guess that's ok. It's just business, nothing personal I guess. 

I really want this job, it would be an amazing opportunity for me, so if you can give some tips on how to make a good interview, that would be great!

But if I don't get the job, I would also like some advice to how to behave with my co-worker, who will absolutely rub it in my face. 

And also, if I don't get the promotion, I will stay in the job that is really making me nervous and  giving my a lot of anxiety, to the point where I can't sleep at night, thinking about work. I would also appreciate advice on how to handle that. I can't quit, because I really need the money to maintain my home and to pay for college. And it's really hard to find a new job right now, in the middle of the pandemic.

That's it guys, thanks for reading this far.

934,"TLDR at bottom. 

My grandfather recently discovered and investment he forgot he had. He wanted to give 30k to my parents to pay off their mortgage, and 10k to me to go towards my house when I start looking this year. 

My mom told him no to my portion because I have two brothers he didnt even offer any money to and she wants it to be fairly split if any of us are getting anything. (Which I 100% see her point. The reason shes making me their own power of attorney is that she knows I'm a fair person.)

This whole conversation happened without my knowledge. I received a call from him this past week and he asked me if I could him a favor and not tell anyone about the money he was about to offer me and told me he only wanted it to go towards my house downpayment. He told me he was going to send me 15k. I had agreed to keep the secret and do what he wanted before he told me what it was. 

I'm conflicted since I am all about being fair and I agree with my mom, but I also will feel guilty if I go behind my grandfathers back as he never had to give me anything in the first place..

Backstory:
My brothers are terrible with their money and that is mostly his reasoning for not giving them anything. The oldest has already received some help when he bought his first house 10 years ago,  but the middle brother hasn't ever received anything. 

The advise I'm looking for is what do you people think would be the best decision morally? I understand this is a first world problem,  but it's been eating away at me. He hasn't sent me anything yet, but once he does I want to have a plan.

Do I split it between my brothers? Do I do what he wanted me to do with it? Do I keep this a secret? Help!

Throwaway as I dont want this to be tied to my other account. Again I understand this is such a stupid petty 'problem' but things like this really affect me negatively and I'm overly empathetic. 

TLDR Grandpa wants give me money, mom wants it split between brothers and I. I promised grandpa I'd do what he wanted me to as it was his money, but morally I am with my mom on splitting.",21Jun2020,1

Ok, so a lot of you guys recommended me to email my principal first so that I can be proactive about the situation, but the thing is, when I first found out I might be involved I left the group chat out of anxiety and fear and now i dont have any proof.

I know the girl who reported the guys in my class and i asked her if she could add me back but she said it'd be suspicious, so no. I havent told any of my other friends about this so I dont know how I would ask them abt this. The girl who reported the guys has reassured me many times that I won't get involved but she hasnt told the principal that Im not involved and whenever i ask her to email him that im not involved she refuses and tells me not to email him either. 

Its been a few days since then and no ones contacted me so far but Im still extremely anxious and ive been having trouble sleeping the past few days and im alert and wary 24/7 incase someone calls. All ive been having is nightmares that Ill be involved and my mom never forgiving me and never trusting me again (she already barely trusts me, not because Ive lied before (im usually known as a goody two shoes, never gets in trouble) but just because she has no faith in me for some reason)

i dont know what to do now and im extremely stressed. should i keep pressing my friend about contacting the principal? what if she gets annoyed of me? shes told me multiple times that she'll stick up for me incase anything happens but i feel like itll be too late by then since my mom will already be informed of the situation by then.

I recently made some big bucks around $1100 - $1200  and I always had a thing for the Apple laptops my old laptop HP broke around 9-11 months ago, I can afford the apple one now. But the problem and what's stopping me from getting them is that I'm feeling bad for the others(sisters) , They have been using an Old af one and I feel bad for getting the new one for myself while everyone uses the old one. 
Moreover more reasons stopping me are that my sister , (before i made the money) always would hope for me to get her a new phone one day. 
Which ofcourse,  I'm the eldest is my duty to provide for the younger ones. Now that I made this money , and thought about getting myself a new laptop. I just keep thinking over and over and I feel like a hypocrite getting myself something whilst the others don't get it. It's hard to explain the feeling. As well as my sister did want a phone too as she always looked up to me for getting her one. And when she got to know that I made some money , she was all "" My birthday's in August ""  ....If you know what I mean. 

I'm usually a giver, I feel happy giving people stuff watching people get happy and all brings happiness to me too. I don't show that though Lol , but this was a once in a lifetime oppurtunity for me as well. 

Getting the laptop I always wanted , and then feeling bad about it because 1.) The others don't have brand new and good laptop and 2.) My sister looked forward to a new phone. 

I'm just confused , speaking of a phone both of us have old ones iphone 5s lmao and the storage has given up too. Yes I feel the need to change phones myself, but I thought more of the laptop. 

I haven't made a single decision yet. It's been more than a few weeks now.
I thought maybe I could get her what she wanted and get myself what I want but that doesn't work out. 

I cannot think of a best case scenario or any alternatives where everyone is happy. 
Thus I am here seeking advice , for the first time lol. 

What Should I Do ?

Last year I had booked to see Les mis on stage with my uncle and his friend (we often go on theatre trips) and I don't have any memory of this happening. It's my favourite musical and it was really important for me to see it and I'd been anticipating it for a year or so. A few days ago I thought to myself  ""hm wait when am I seeing les mis?"". Then I remembered I was supposed to be seeing it on the 20th of December 2019, which, obviously had long gone. So I said to my Mum and Boyfriend ""did I actually go see les mis?"" since I didn't remember it ever being cancelled, to which they were like ""yeah duh"". Now I've seen things in theatre before and they've been unmemorable, but I at least remember that it happened, what the actors look like etc... I know I have a bad memory but it's honestly like there's a gap in my mind where that was supposed to be. I have the program from the show (we always buy a program) but I don't remember buying it; I looked at videos of it online to jog my memory but none of it rings a bell; I don't remember getting dressed or going to food before; It's like it never happened and I feel crazy.

I was wondering why this has happened, I don't have a great memory anyway but this is another level. The first guy I ever properly spoke to, which ended badly, had his birthday on the date I was supposed to see it, so when we booked it I was kind of upset by that, but I got over all that by the time the show (apparently) came around. But could that be related?

In short I basically forgot a whole very important day of my life ever happened and was wondering if there's an explanation??????

949,"This is an update to my original post where you can find here.  [https://redd.it/hcci8c](https://redd.it/hcci8c)

That post was taken down since I didn't realize internal conflicts were against the rules on that thread which is my fault. I hope everyone can find this update okay. 

So things have changed but here is a quick update on the first issue. The sibling to my past student whose mother lied about a nut allergy apparently also lied about her younger child's allergy. This is a huge breath of fresh air for me since I had no idea just how bad a corn allergy could be. Also thank you to those who had offered advice and comfort. There is no question in my mind that I did the right thing to question the sibling's allergy but a new can of worms has been opened. 

This is what has happened since. I had sent an e-mail to the school nurse explaining the situation. She's new and I had given her a little run down on the reasoning behind why I'd like the students record checked for a doctor's note. I'm still waiting for her reply but I don't really need it now. If you're a parent you may be familiar with the app Classroom Dojo. Since I got my classroom list I went through and sent invites to all the parents listed. 

Many of the parents messaged back and one of them just happened to be the Dad of my previous student. I decided to do what some suggested and asked about the severity of his son's corn allergy and what prevention measures I would need to take in class. At first, the dad thought it was a joke, like a playful jab at the previous situation. I let him know it wasn't a joke and his child's records indicated a corn allergy. He was not happy. Apparently, in the last year, he and his wife had divorced and he wants me to write a letter regarding the incident with his eldest and how his wife did not disclose the fact that she had also lied about their youngest allergy. He didn't outright tell me why he wants the letter but there are not many reasons why he would want it other than a few obvious. I don't know how I feel about this. 

First of all the school is not put in a good light here. There's a HIGH turnover rate for all positions here at the school and things like this have slipped through the cracks a lot in recent years. I don't want my writing this letter somehow to turn against me and the school. Secondly, the dad has a point. His ex had the chance to come forward before and let the school know about the youngest. Since she didn't there is a chance the same traumatic event could have happened again. 

This is just a mess. I've e-mailed HR since I'm hoping the school could provide a written statement about the incident instead of me. I just want to focus on keeping my classroom a safe environment for all my students. I don't want my classroom to become a warzone between feuding parents or bring home issues into what should be a safe place. Should I limit the direct contact I have with both parents and make them go through the office for any inquires? Maybe I should see if this student can be switched to another classroom?

Quick introduction to them if that helps?:

TF 1: She was a huge emotional/energy vampire for a long time. She knew I was struggling with mental health, and did everything in her power to trigger it more. She was also struggling too, but she would often use her mental illness to guilt trip me and others and get us to do favours for her. She would always flip flop between complimenting me, then insulting me, then complimenting me again. Like, for example, she knew how insecure I was about my body, and still felt the need to say things like, ‚Äúwow you have such great hair!! It‚Äôs a shame you have the body of a fat teen boy, but the hair really suits you:)‚Äù. She also knew I had an eating disorder at the time, and actively encouraged me to get worse. After a while, I realized how horribly she was treating me, and slowly distanced myself. 

TF 2: She was similar, in the sense that she would often take out her emotions/insecurities on me. She would yell a lot, tell me and friends to fuck off, and constantly makes fun of me (she says it‚Äôs a joke but takes it too far, and even after I tell her to stop, she tells me to suck it up/stop being so sensitive/etc). She‚Äôs also ‚Äújoked‚Äù several times about how I‚Äôm her least favourite friend, and how she doesn‚Äôt even like me, so that really helps:/

I have a few really good friends though who I can count on for anything. They‚Äôre the greatest friends I could possibly ever ask for. But given that they‚Äôre all still friends with TF 1&amp;2, it‚Äôs impossible for us to hang out in a group without inviting them. I‚Äôve tried to make plans in the past with just me and my good friends, but somehow, no matter what, TF 1&amp;2 always en up showing up. 

Also, if any of my good friends make plans with me, I know TF 1&amp;2 are going to be there. I don‚Äôt want to miss out, cause I love my good friends more than anything in the world, but it‚Äôs so hard to spend time with TFs.

At first I had a little more freedom than before but as time went on they got more restrictive and for every thing I did to ‚Äústep out of line‚Äù they‚Äôd threaten to kick me out. I currently feel my mental health deteriorating really fast and I usually either get into a huge argument with my parents every 2-3 weeks which result in me having many breakdowns or I feel depressed because I miss my boyfriend. He‚Äôs spoken to his family and they‚Äôve offered many times to house me until my boyfriend and I move into our apartment in the fall. We live a couple of hours away from each other but they said they wouldn‚Äôt mind making the drive to pick me up and have me live with them. I know leaving my family is not something they‚Äôll take lightly, they‚Äôll probably disown me and not allow my younger siblings (16F and 5M) to talk to me. I‚Äôm worried my siblings will hate me for leaving and that I won‚Äôt be able to watch my youngest brother grow up because I‚Äôll most likely be cut off from any form of communication with them. I know talking to my parents about how I feel won‚Äôt help because that usually results in them calling me ungrateful or invalidating my feelings and usually turns into a lecture rather than actually making much of a difference. On top of everything I‚Äôm currently taking summer classes and my family does not even attempt to make it easier for me by allowing me to concentrate on my exams or homework and it resulted in me failing my second exam for one of my classes. I can‚Äôt leave immediately because i currently have a job so I‚Äôd at least have to put in a 2 weeks notice before being able to leave. I feel trapped and I‚Äôm not sure what I should do. Should I risk everything to live with my boyfriend although I haven‚Äôt known him for more than a year in hopes that being in a more stable and loving environment will not ruin my mental health and also allow me to pass my classes? Or should I stay for the two months I have left before classes begin again so I don‚Äôt ruin my relationship with my family and lose my communication with my two younger siblings?",21Jun2020,1

970,"Stockholm Syndrome/Catfish!?

I just wanted to share this so I can process what‚Äôs happened. It‚Äôs a lot to read - so thank you for taking the time to read it. 

This might be TMI..

I met this guy through tinder a year ago. We started talking and decided to meet up. He tells me he‚Äôs always had this fantasy to fuck a stranger in the dark &amp; wanted to do that with me. I decided to meet him cause it seemed thrilling. I met him and it was amazing the first time for me. For him I couldn‚Äôt get him hard I couldn‚Äôt understand why and I kept getting frustrated at myself. We met the second time / I‚Äôm into the whole dom/sub lifestyle. Because he was my dom at that moment he said I wouldn‚Äôt get anything until I don‚Äôt satisfy him. I was okay with the whole chocking and grabbing part of it until his slaps actually hurt me. My ears would ring everytime he slapped me. There was a time where he had also punched me &amp; when I asked he said no I just grabbed you really hard. And when he was degrading me he kept saying I‚Äôm worthless and I don‚Äôt deserve sex. That was hard to here cause that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve told myself - that I‚Äôm worthless. I did tell him in between that his slaps hurt and he laughed and said I deserved it. At that point I didn‚Äôt react - I just froze. Towards the end I kept telling him to touch me or to get me off and he kept saying. I know I was whining a lot and I just got out of the bed and started wearing my clothes. I then went towards him and told him I was leaving - still very whiny and he grabbed me by my hair and put me on the bed and chocked me I could tell he was really angry/annoyed with me. He yelled and asked me to shut up or he‚Äôll hit me. He tried to calm himself down and then asked me to leave and that he‚Äôll make it up to me tomorrow. 

We texted after that and he was mean and kept blaming me for everything that happened and that he was so disappointed in me. At that point I was okay to never see him again - I anyway had no idea what he looked like. Until he texted me again and asked me to come see him so we could give this another go. I ended up going. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have - I had a thing of putting myself in bad situations. He was very confusing - when I would lay next to him we would talk about our lives, values, what we believed in and he would cuddle me. But on text I couldn‚Äôt recognize him. He would turn into someone else. 

After a few times we met I asked him when can I actually see his face since he had seen mine through the light coming from the window. I always had to have a blindfold on when he was in the room. To that he said why, aren‚Äôt you enjoying what we have. By that time I thought I was falling for him and wanted to tell him that I want to see your face cause I want more than just casual sex. 

He stopped talking to me or asking me to come meet him for a month..I went for the last time where he said I‚Äôll get to see him and that we need to talk. I went and he made me give him head and in between he would laugh and say you don‚Äôt even know what I look like - why would you miss me. He then asked me to wait for him in the lobby and I did. He then texts me and says he can‚Äôt come down and that he isn‚Äôt who he says he is. I‚Äôm sitting there just staring at my phone cause I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I felt so ashamed and sick. 

He ended up blocking me and till today idk what he looks like but up until recently if he had texted me again and asked me to meet him I know I would‚Äôve gone back. Even though he said he wanted to do things to me which I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with and I didn‚Äôt give my consent he said as long as you come Into the room that‚Äôs consent for me. 

I found out a few days ago that maybe I had Stockholm Syndrome with him &amp; I was never mad at him for doing all these things. I got mad at myself for allowing this to happen.

973,"Ok, so this might be a long one:

I am fortunate enough to be in a position where I can choose to work. However it‚Äôs still stressing me out and my mom is getting on my ass about it. So I work part-time at a restaurant job (specifically at Takeout), and I make a decent amount of money there (I get minimum wage, work about 4 days a week or 20-25 hours a week, but bring home around $20-$40 tips on average). However, I was recently given a full-time job by one of my friends. In this job, I work full-time, get $15 an hour, and pretty much chill out with my friends the entire time. 

Here‚Äôs the big issue: My mom believes that I should either work 2 jobs or quit the full-time job with my friends, as I would ‚Äúmake more money working in the restaurant business‚Äù. But to be honest, I‚Äôm getting sick and tired of just dealing with people at the restaurant (whether it‚Äôs my managers or just the customers) and my full-time job is really fun and relaxing. I‚Äôm 20 years old and I do want to set myself up for the future, but I don‚Äôt want to go mentally insane and I just feel like my mom necessarily understands that. Also I feel like I‚Äôm making the same amount of money at the full-time job than at the restaurant. All I want to ask for is a non-biased opinion from somebody that isn‚Äôt one of my friends or my mom and get an opinion from a third party. What should do?

974,"My roommate and I have lived together 10 months and I've reached my breaking point. She's an absolute slob, is constantly having loud sex with different people, smokes weed indoors constantly even though I've asked her to please stop. Never cleans up messes, eats my food and has stolen money from me before. I've called her out on all these things and she says I'm a freak for being so ""obsessive with her personal life choices""

We live in an 3bd house, just myself and her,  and our landlord is an older conservative man who's a retired teacher and his wife is a retired church choir director (I know this from casual conversation, they're actually lovely people) and they live a couple miles away so she's always on her best behavior when they come to  mow the lawn and collect our checks.

I've told him of the weed, unregistered overnight guests and the mess in an effort to get her evicted but he said unless he catches her in the act he's not going to evict her without evidence.

She has no actual ""day job"" she sells photos of herself on onlyfans and premium Snapchat for all of her income. I know this because a mutual friend informed me and he is subscribed to her. He told me I should inform my landlord ( who almost certainly wouldn't approve at all) that her income is from sex work and he would evict her, I should add this friend knows the landlord well and is good friends with his daughter but doesn't want to involve himself in the situation.

I immediately told him I couldn't do that, but I came home from a long day of work today and the house reeked of weed, unwashed dishes and a clogged toilet. And she's just in her room watching YouTube so loud I can hear everything right now as I'm typing this.

975,"My sister is toxic. Growing up my God mother who adopted me was the toxic one. Always saying her stomach hurt worse if yours did. Telling me I shouldnt cry when my friend died cause it‚Äôs selfish. Making contracts to clean the whole house if I wanted to go to the movies , because she would say she never gave me permission afterwards, and monitoring phone calls with my biological father who asked her to raise me for better schooling‚Äôs and environment. Saying there‚Äôs no reason we should talk on the phone more than once a day. Things my other sister who is adopted experienced as well. 

Fast forward she is deceased and it seems like the spirit has always been in her daughter and it‚Äôs evoking time. I have another sister and a brother and she is not speaking to us all for different reasons. She always says how she does so much and nobody does anything. She stays in contact with a family friend that disrespected me and my other siblings don‚Äôt speak to anymore. When I told her how this made me feel she said to leave her alone about this and it always bothers me. She never keeps her friends and always finds a problem that they did something wrong to her and it‚Äôs time to cut them off. Right now she isn‚Äôt speaking to me because her husband is a cop and she said I called him racist because I went to a protest. I never said one thing about him. She also told my sister she thinks I‚Äôm on drugs and my other sister told me. She isn‚Äôt talking to my brother because she hates his wife . She isn‚Äôt talking to my sister because she called her screaming and when my sister asked her not to scream over the phone she kept screaming so my sister hung up. She later apologized for hanging up but too late she is on the shit list. 

We all take turns being on her shit list and when she feels like it she talks to us again. She has a son and a daughter and I love them but she has blocked me so I cant see them or speak to them. Part of me wants to say sorry, for what Idk but I miss the kids. Another part of me feels peaceful when she isn‚Äôt bringing toxicity in my life. She constantly complains about anything and everything and only sees her feelings . She even called my 10 year old nephew (my other sisters son) a lazy pig and never apologized she just waited for it to blow over and used the excuse he‚Äôs lazy cause he plays video games. My nephew was so sad . My god father and my little sister live with her and her husband so it‚Äôs kind of like if you wanna see them you have to speak to her , it‚Äôs her house . Yet she complains about my God father and how we have to come clean his part of the house (when she speaks to us). I‚Äôm not sure what to do , i spent my whole childhood dealing with the way her mother treated me and now it‚Äôs like the baton has been passed and it‚Äôs continuing through adulthood.

978,"Hi, I'm an American 24M with a Bachelors in computer engineering from a prestigious university. I have spent the last 3 years as an embedded software engineer working for a company I interned with in college and I am increasingly disatisfied with the work and environment, so I think it is time to move on from it. But I don't know where to go or what to do. I have a lot of confusion in my life not just about career but about what is important to me and what goals I have. In particular I am having trouble setting goals.

Here's some more detail about my situation: As I said I have a B.S. in CE and I'm a proficient computer programmer. But I'm not sure if I want to do this for the rest of my life, it's just a hobby that I turned into a job. I could pursue an advanced degree but I'm not sure what it would be in or what would motivate me to get it. I have a couple of athletic hobbies I am really committed to and typically I develop friendships around those. Romantic relationships have never been important to me and I've never had one. I know most people get a lot of satisfaction from them but it's just not something I want. Instead I'd like to commit myself to something else meaningful, where there's a good sense of progress and having a positive impact. I care a lot about environmental issues and the unsustainability of my current company is one thing that bothers me. If I could have a career change and work in something related to alternative energy or conservation that would be great, even if I don't use my CE degree fully. I'm just not sure what steps I need to take to make it happen. I'm open to moving outside of my home country.

980,"I'll start by introducing myself, I'm a 24-year-old guy. I have a degree in computer science, and I'm currently working at a big company as a software developer; I play video games a lot, and I'm a minimalist.

&amp;#x200B;

I play online games with my cousin, and every time we do, I'm always the one making mistakes and getting called out for it. It lets me down that my cousin raises his voice because he clearly gets upset with my actions. I don't think I can play the game properly, but I still do because I don't want to be alone.

&amp;#x200B;

When we play with friends of mine, it gets even worse. I get picked on all the time: ""That happens to you because you work for Tech Company,"" ""Your game crashed because you have Intel,"" and all sorts of homophobic, childish and derogatory comments. 

&amp;#x200B;

These guys don't have a job, don't have any savings, invest anything or really, have any financial stability as I do. I have never mocked them, I've never called them poor or losers because I respect them, but I don't receive any respect from them. 

&amp;#x200B;

When we're playing, I often screw up what I'm saying, e.g., I want to say, ""The long bridge."" but I end up saying ""The bridge long,"" or saying ""red stairs"" when the stairs are clearly yellow; overall, strange speech impairments if you will.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to stand up for myself, but I lack the strength to do so. In general, in every verbal confrontation, I never say anything, not only because I don't have the guts to fight back, but because I don't know what to say. Since I'm utterly stupid, I can't think of anything quickly, and most of the time, I end up saying something crazy that makes me look even worse (like the ""speech. impairments"" I mentioned in the previous paragraph).

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm talking about playing games with my cousin, is because if I can't even stand up for myself with my friends, how will I stand up for myself in a confrontation with an actual threat? I have never done so, since elementary school, I never stood up for myself, and I had to deal with all of this alone with my supposed ""friends,"" but now, I'm exhausted, and my patience is running out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard that practicing martial arts is a way to boost confidence; however, with a height of 1.70 meters or 5'7'' inches, weighting 60 kilograms or 132 pounds (starting to gain weight extremely fast), I'm going to get destroyed pretty much by everyone. With my non-existent confidence, I think I'd be pleading my opponent for forgiveness, also consider that I'm pretty much sick of everything (mainly stomach issues).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm exhausted from being picked on, from being weak, from being sick all the time. I'm thinking of quitting gaming forever and start bettering myself. But I never do so. I'm on an endless loop of uncompleted plans and unfulfilled promises. It doesn't matter how much Jordan Peterson videos I watch, how many times I see a therapist, everything stays the same.",21Jun2020,1

983,"So to cut a very long story short, I've been speaking to a guy from my hometown on Facebook for a few years. Two years after our first conversation, we met a few times when I went back home for a visit. At the time I had bad PTSD from being r---d, and I hadn't told anyone about it. As a result, we didn't have sex. He couldn't understand why I wouldn't have sex with him and why I was acting so nervous, and we stopped speaking after he moved abroad shortly after. 

We didn't speak for two years.

Last year, he got in touch again. We began talking and I explained to him why I acted the way I did the last time. He made it clear that he had feelings for me. Shortly afterwards, he lost his job and had to move back home.

Then in March, he came to my city (which is 200 miles away from him) and he stayed with me for a few days. The first night, we ended up having sex. He made a few comments that basically alluded to the fact that he thought I was terrible at sex. I could also tell that he thought I was ugly, from the faces he was pulling and his general demeanour. 

For the following two days until he left, he sat as far away from me as possible, and made excuses that he was 'sick and needed to sleep' so he could spend the entire day in bed hiding away from me. He made passive aggressive comments about how shit my flat is, how I wasn't funny, and sat scrolling through instagram on his phone in silence when he did emerge. When he left, he didn't say goodbye to me properly and scurried out the door muttering 'cheers' without making eye contact.

After that, radio silence. I felt pretty rejected and hurt. It had taken a lot for me to trust someone like that again after the r--e. He had made it clear to me through his actions that he thought I wasn't worth his time.

Then yesterday, out of the blue, he randomly sent me a 15 second long video of him cumming. I read it, didn't reply. Five minutes later he sent a dick pic. I read it, didn't reply. He then said 'you like?', followed by another nude photo. He then sent 'I was imagining you riding me'. I didn't read those ones.

Is this a power thing? A boredom thing? Is he checking to see if I'll come running back to him? 

Why would he be sending me this if he thinks I'm so awful? He lives far away from me, so it's not sex that he's after. I'm just confused.",21Jun2020,1
985,"My mother is a narcissist and a mythomaniac. She is and always has been extremely abusive physically, mentally, and emotionally to everyone in our family, which is why all my step-siblings moved out and cut contact when I was a child (she literally chased her ex-husband around the house with a butcher knife in-front of them and when she was taken to court our grandmother had physically threatened them to stay silent. Just so you get a taste of how insane she really is) 

My father works away from home so I only see him a couple days a month, if that. My mom has total control over my bank account and doesn‚Äôt allow me to get a credit card for fear I might leave.

992,"I dont consent to others using this post. Im also new to reddit and am using a phone.

Im a (19F) who had an adorable DS earlier this year in mid Feb. The birth of my son was traumatic and im still not fully over what happened. His birth was a confusing mess that up untill i was in the delivery room i had no idea what was goimg on other than i had high blood pressure was too swollen to be exaimed to see how far along in the labour i was and that my son was born with forceps cause i hadnt eaten properly the whole 29 hours i was in labour and had only a 15 minute nap before pushing. I needed a 2 pint blood transfusion none of the nurses on the maternity ward knew how to help me so i was stuck in bed till thursday evening when one nurse finally gave me some ice to help with the swelling and was only allowed to leave that sunday after a week of being in hosptial because i wasn't going home alone and my mum forced them to because of how upset and stressed i was getting at not being able to look after my baby without help. I could only feed and hold him for short periods of time before he was taken off me because i couldnt put him down or change his bum alone. As a result of this im very protective of my baby. DS is 4 months old now and my partners family r getting annoyed with how little time they get with DS. I dont like most of my partners family. His mother always wants to give me 'advice' on how to raise DS and that i need to loosen up, his older brother is a slob who is careless when he holds DS and doesnt understand my concerns, his 1st sister was one of my best friends in school but she is addicted to cutting herself and is so depressing that i worry about leaving them alone and his youngest sister is so awkward at holding him and refuses to talk to my DS making him cry as he doesnt feel safe. 

During the pregnancy me and partner had an agreement that none of his family would baby sit as his mum works long hours, his brother works nights, his 1st sister works and is not mentally stable to look after DS and his younger sister is only 12 so is at school. We also agreed that if his sister kept cutting she wouldnt see DS unless she got help and tried to stop. She hasn't done either and BF seems to have forgotten our agreement or doesn't care anymore and i dont know what to do. He feels its unfair my family would see DS more but the reality is my parents dont work so are more available than his to be babysitters my mum also adores DS and follows the boundaires put in place and knows how much it means to me as i will have to go back full time.

What should i do?",21Jun2020,1

995,"Dear Reddit, I need your advice.

Summary:
I don't know how to approach a conversation with an older relative who's had a life limiting accident. 

Background: 
1) My (M 40) paternal uncle's (M 77) lost a lot of sight in one eye in an accident. He has fair vision in his other eye.

2) We're not close, but as a kid I would see him every summer. We always shared a love of reading. I haven't seen him in about 15 years. 

3) We're in lockdown and live 400 miles apart so I'll phone him. He lives alone, but his children live  nearby and visit.

Problem:
I feel awful for him, I would feel a lot of pain and fear, but I don't know how he's processing it. I don't want to patronise him or bring him down, or worse tell him how I'd feel, or how I expect him to feel... etc etc.

Additional:
1)To help him continue to read, I'd like to set him up with a kindle loaded with books he'd be interested in. 

2) He could manage the technology if my cousin(s) helped him get started. 

3) I'm nervous about offering because I'm not sure how much sight he has left, or whether he's likely to regain any. 

How do you think I should approach all this? What do I say that won't make it worse?",21Jun2020,3

997,"so me and this guy used to be best mates, then we were together for a short while but it didn‚Äôt work out, so we decided to be just friends again. we both moved on and he‚Äôs spoken to other girls since we split up, but now it feels like things are awkward and idk why.

he‚Äôs now with another girl, and he seemed really awkward about letting me know. i‚Äôve always told him from the end of our relationship that i want him to be happy, whoever it‚Äôs with. he let me know a few weeks ago that they were ‚Äútalking‚Äù, but announced their relationship a few days ago (after i directly asked how his dating life was going, both times). i know the girl he‚Äôs currently with, i‚Äôm not particularly close with her but i know that she‚Äôs a good person and they‚Äôre well suited for each other.

but it feels like since they started ‚Äútalking‚Äù, or since he begins ‚Äútalking‚Äù with any other girl, he distances from me massively, leaves me on read, or cant hold a conversation. (eg. i sent him a message last night because i needed someone to talk to because i was having an anxiety attack. he left me on read for 2 hours so i double texted, and he replied that he was busy talking to his girlfriend. i understand, but at least i used to get a little ‚Äúsorry cant talk rn‚Äù a few months ago) i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just a coincidence or if that‚Äôs just what some people do or what, and i don‚Äôt know how to bring this up in an appropriate way, or even if to bring it up at all.

i just miss having my best mate and talking with him more regularly, especially when we‚Äôre still isolating. idk if we‚Äôre still gonna be close by the time we meet up again and it genuinely upsets me because he‚Äôs like a brother at this point. i don‚Äôt want to lose him but i don‚Äôt want it to seem like i‚Äôm not supportive of his new relationship.

999,"I am a 36-year-old Canadian male looking for opinions on two situations:

1. I was automatically assigned a parking spot in my building's underground parking lot, last night. I was assigned the parking spot that is directly parallel to the automated garage door, and slightly to the right of it, right at the entrance, with no buffer between the parking spot and the door. To get into the spot, you have to make a sharp right, while going downhill. It is an awkward parking spot for an SUV. Today, feeling quite tired from working, I decided to go rest in a park. So, to get out of the previously-mentioned parking spot, I had to do multiple mini three point turns, to begin to create space between my vehicle and the door. For some odd reason, no matter how close I got to the garage door, it would not go up. Eventually, right before I was directly in front of the garage door and perpendicular to it, and maybe an inch away from it, it started going up abruptly, and part of the garage door caught the bottom of my vehicle's bumper, thereby scratching it. Also, the garage door was stuck in a partially-opened position as a result. After twenty minutes or so, the security guard was able to manually open the door, and a technician will be brought in to fix the door tomorrow, so that it will open automatically again. None of my neighbours or my building's security know what happened, but I am on camera. No one saw me. I believe that my rental car insurance will cover the scratched bumper, but should I report what happened to my building's management? Will I be charged for the garage door repair? I feel so much shame and guilt, and I simply wanted to go sit in a park.

2. I am relatively close to a group of friends that I began hanging out with in high school, and I first met some of the group memebers when I was in the fourth grade. Following my mother's kidnapping at gunpoint, the individual that I thought was my closest friend in the group offered no support, no words of encouragement, nothing. He didn't even ask me how I was doing. I called him out on it, and response was defensive and immature. I have wished death on him and his family many times since. I have gone over the reasons why he acted the way he did with my therapist, my SAA sponsor, and others, and he clearly lacks the emotional intelligence, resiliency, empathy, and self-awareness to support me and others during traumatic events. With that said, I will be inviting friends, including friends from the previously-mentioned friend group to my condo this coming Friday for a get together. Should I invite the previously-mentioned friend that I felt betrayed by? Does it make sense to invite him to a group setting, while keeping my distance from him otherwise, or should I continue my lack of communication with him?",21Jun2020,1

But now, I just need space from the friendship. I like him, but it doesn't feel the same when I talk to him. However he has a fear of abandonment, so I don't want to hurt him. He could also cause a lot of trouble for me if he decided to get back at me if I said anything directly to him about this. I just don't know what to do. I can't breathe when I talk to him, but he still messages me everyday. How do I slowly pull away without hurting him?",21Jun2020,0
1002,"I didn't really know where to post this.

When I was a teenager, I struggled a lot with anxiety and depression. My anxiety was so bad during this time that I barely left my house for almost 2 years. I couldn't go to see my close friends, I couldn't go to the store, I couldn't go anywhere without panicking. I even left school because I was so terrified of interacting with people.

Fast forward to now, I'm in college, I have friends, a job and a normal enough social life. I thought that chapter of my life was over and I'm fine now, I don't have any issues. That's what I'd like to think anyway. I constantly feel uneasy. I constantly feel like I've done something wrong or something bad will happen. I stress out so much over every tiny detail of my life that it drives me insane and I don't know why I do it. I can never be happy for more than five minutes without finding something else to worry about. Thinking about anything from my past, present or future all drives me so crazy with worry and stress to the point where i sometimes feel like I'm in physical pain. Even writing this post is making me really uncomfortable and worried about how I'm sounding right now.

I don't like admitting this stuff or talking about it because I've always been so proud of myself for 'turning my life around' but it turns out I  really haven't all that much.

How do I even try to ask for help when I seem absolutely fine and can go on with life just like everyone else? My struggle used to be a lot more obvious but now it's not, and I don't know if it's serious enough to speak out when I know other people need the support more than I do.",21Jun2020,1

1004,"Yesterday i meet a girl i loved for 2 year after a long lime.
We slept toggether about 2 weeks ago after a great night together. After that we only texted.
Yesterday in about 6 am i was returning from a party a she called me if i wanna see her. I was in mood soo we meet up in empty mall. She said me that i should not love her. I tried to talk her into giving me a chance.
But after that she went into what happened to her in a last year. Its a heavy one and i have no clue how to react.

Soo her mother has thrown her out of the house day after her 20 birthday. She has been abused in past and has a lot of mental trubles. She has been hospitalized 4 times after trying to commit suicide. And she is basicly homles living in some old guys flat.
She almost had a baby with hers sisters boyfriend. But got the abotion after the pressure from her whole family (this is mostlikely the reason she was thrown out the house). Soo she cant keep a job because of her depresion and doesnt have place to live at. As if this wasnt enough she started dooing hard drugs. Meth she has been doing meth for last year. Now she has official hit the rock bottom.

I feel really bad for her but am not in pozition that i could provide her with housing. I feel like if i want to keep my life and mental state in good condition i should just let her be. She never done anything for me only pushed me aside. But i feel like i should help before something really bad happens.
But i have no clue how.

1005,"Our family spent the weekend together, so on Saturday night I found myself drinking with my uncles girlfriend. The conversation started off normal, but then she slipped and said something about my uncle sending ‚Äúintimate pictures‚Äù to other women. 

I thought I misheard her, but she proceeded to elaborate.. for three hours. I heard a lot of details, and I‚Äôm sick. Briefly, some of the most astonishing claims she made about him: Blatantly swapping naked photos / videos with other women. A lot of women for a long time. His ex-fianc√© apparently left him when she saw his porn collection (which she then forwarded to his mother). Cheated on his ex-wife while she was in labour with their son. Claiming that this ‚Äúis a man‚Äôs ultimate fantasy, and that he intends to continue living that life.‚Äù The list goes on. 

I knew he had cheated on his wife / other girlfriends, but this relationship seemed different. She is adamant that she doesn‚Äôt want to give up on him‚Äî‚Äúhe just doesn‚Äôt know how to love‚Äù, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs been a bachelor for his whole life, he‚Äôs not used to monogamy‚Äù, ‚Äúhe does love me, he is just confused‚Äù. But my heart aches to see her so determined. 

Since his ex-wife and him split 20+ years ago, it seems glaringly obvious to me that he isn‚Äôt going to miraculously change. He has refused his girlfriends requests to seek couples counselling, and defends the women he is cheating with (‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk to my friends‚Äù). His girlfriend just doesn‚Äôt see it. 

I‚Äôm worried for her as this seems like psychological abuse, and she really is a wonderful person. Despite acknowledging that something needs to be done, she doesn‚Äôt know what to do next / when to do it. I fear that limbo might continue to drag on. She cried for most of our conversation; I can‚Äôt handle seeing her hurt for much longer. 

She drank much more than I did so when she woke up it seemed like she didn‚Äôt remember anything. I can‚Äôt tell whether that‚Äôs really true or not. Since I‚Äôve known my uncle much longer my immediate reaction is to give him the benefit of the doubt. But her stories had believable details, and I recognized small components of some (people / places). 

Her kids have always been wary of my uncle, so I doubt she has confided in anyone else. I feel a sense of responsibility to do something with this information‚Äìwhatever that might mean (supporting her from a distance vs helping her pack her bags).

What should I do? Have you experienced anything like this? Thank you!",21Jun2020,1
1006,"Hey there,

Edit: Just to be clear, I DO NOT go around telling people this stuff, my friend is one of the only people that knows the info below and he brings it up, not me. I understand that it may come across as arrogant because of the nature of the conversation that HE keeps bringing up every now and then!

So my friend and I are both 30 M and have known each other for around 15 years.. My friend keeps bringing up a conversation about not knowing anyone that's in the top 5-10% at ANYTHING.. I've asked him to clarify what he means numerous times so he is crystal clear, as he just keeps repeating himself over and over and every few months or so we have this conversation (for at least 3 or so years now..) and he always says he means being the top 10% at literally anything, like for example being in the top 10% performers at the work I do online (out of everyone in my field) or being top 10% of all players in popular ranked video game.

He brings out this conversation and repeats himself over and over, and puts an emphasis on not knowing ANYONE that can do these certain things at a certain level and even be in the top 10% (even listing things im in the top % at), which absolutely puzzles me, because he makes me feel that he is disregarding some of my own accomplishments with the way he continues this conversation every time and basically disregards the words im saying in this particulart conversation we have, but he doesn't disregard or doubt me as much in other conversations we have, but repeatedly on this subject.

I've basically been in the top 0.2% to 2% ranked in numerous popular competitive games with tens of millions of players (popular FPS games and strategy games for example) I've been in a gaming magazine and have always been heavily involved in the gaming scene.. and he INSISTS that he knows no one that would be for example, in the top 10% of ranked players globally at say Call of duty.. And I am scratching my head.. as 10% is totally achievable as i've been in the top of numerous ones he lists, never mind the top 10%! So I am super confused what his goal of this conversation is. He keeps pushing the conversation for long enough where I feel the need to speak up and say.. Well hey dude I am pretty good at that actually I am one of the top ranked players... Also when he started pointing out that he doesn't know anyone that is top 10% performers in their field of work.. then I had to speak up because ive put blood, sweat and tears into what I do to be able to perform well.

I asked him to clarify his point to try and get on the same page because these conversations can get long, and it feels awkward for me.. and he said ""For example, with what you do online (and he named what i do) I don't know anyone that is in the top 10% of what they do for a living. NO ONE. "" And he keeps emphasising it over and over... and I REALLY have to bite my tongue and feel awkward, but after hearing him bring up the conversation loads.. I just ended up going.. well dudeee, you do know that I myself am in the top 10% of what I do.. right? And I gave him some pretty solid examples of that. Ive told him plenty about what I do in the past. He immediately went from being in a good mood to being pissed off, and I was being nice, i was being positive during the conversation and insisting he could be in the top 10% at a bunch of things that he is not considering or that he could easily have talent to be in the top 5% at something.. I am encouraging him and was trying to insist that its not some impossible to reach thing and I am not special.

My friend is a smart guy, hes not dumb.. but he hurt my feelings last night when he brought up the conversation once again, and when I respond, every time we have this conversation, it's almost like he is completely disregarding the chance that I could ACTUALLY be say top of all ranked players at a game.. I mean he seems like hes borderline doubting I could be top 10% at a game which is weird and then I show him the actual stats and proof and he completely just brushes what i'm saying off. Like come on.. And then I know he will eventually start this conversation again, and it will REALLY piss me off next time if he insists he doesn't know someone thats good at the things we've discussed for many hours and lists them again.

Its weird. He knows I wouldn't even lie about stuff like this, I'm a pretty stand up person and I'd like to think I am always clear and honest about my shortcomings and I don't like to pretend otherwise.

Him doubting me is what hurts me, its bizarre to me.

So if this person was a good friend in other areas, but they have this weird disbelief that you could be the top 10% in the world at something, even if you already are.. do you think that a huge red flag for the relationship? In my eyes im starting to feel disappointed that hes making me feel this way. I can't say I've got a million achievements, but theirs some things ive proud for that ive truly worked hard to get, so for me I think it feels like a bigger issue than it may be for other people because Im sensitive about stuff like this, especially with the slog and struggle (and sacrifice) i had to actually get there.

Could this be something that ends a relationship for you? In my eyes, if my friend wanted the best for me, he would just be friendly and be like ""oh yeah, you are great at that game, top percent ranked player out of everyone.. nice"" but instead, he scrunches his face up and acts like I somehow don't qualify for any of his examples? Even if I qualify for multiple of them. I don't get it. He has given so many examples over the years so its crystal clear what he means but its bothering me quite a lot now.

I've been talking/seeing him all the time, but this is making me want to just go silent and not see him for weeks, which would be weird because we do certain activities with each other every week.

TLDR: My friend keeps bringing the same conversation up every now and then, and exclaims that he doesn't know anyone that is in the top 10% at ANYTHING, even listing things and examples that I am top 10% at, and then responds almost like I don't count or qualify.. even when I clarify the criteria and he agrees on the criteria and it feels cruddy.",21Jun2020,0

I [19M] have been unlucky in love to say the least. I‚Äôve never had a proper girlfriend or boyfriend and everyone who I‚Äôve asked out has rejected me. And tbh, I‚Äôm really ashamed of it

I feel kinda jealous of the couples around me, but normally I can just shrug it off. I haven‚Äôt had an easy life, and it‚Äôs taken it‚Äôs toll on me. For some reason people keep flocking to me for help with their shit, and my life feels like I keep having to solve other people‚Äôs problems while barely being able to deal with my own. I‚Äôm happy to help, but it feels like my life is just one shitshow after another, whenever I start to feel happy the universe decides to screw me over again.  

Whenever I start to get jealous of a couple, I just tell myself things like ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs fine, you‚Äôre not ready anyway, as if anyone would ever date you with your mental state being the way it is‚Äù and hating myself helps soften the blow.

But when I see someone who is just as damaged as I am in a happy relationship, it makes me so confused and angry. It makes all the things I say to myself to deal with it invalid. I have this online friend [17F] who I‚Äôve been helping with her mental health. She‚Äôs just as damaged as I am, and I‚Äôve been trying to stop her from making the same mistakes I made when I was younger. She doesn‚Äôt listen, and it‚Äôs really sad and exhausting watching someone I care about tear her own life apart like she is. However, despite all this, she has a boyfriend. 

I get so jealous and angry at her whenever she mentions her boyfriend at all. I don‚Äôt get why I have to suffer through all this shit, actually try to get better and still constantly get screwed over by my life, while she is just as damaged as I am, doesn‚Äôt have the decency to even try to get better and she gets be with someone when I don‚Äôt. It makes me so uncontrollably angry, to the point where I‚Äôm seeing black spots, my breathing feels painful and I feel like I‚Äôm nit been in my own body, and I just want to scream at the top of my lungs.

If I could have it my way I would go to school full time but then I‚Äôm looking at a lot of debt and I‚Äôve always been told that college is a waste of money. Especially since I‚Äôm not wanting to do other classes besides computer science. If anyone could spare some advise I‚Äôd really appreciate. Thank you üôè,21Jun2020,1
1017,"I‚Äôve been working on fixing myself for a while now, but I haven‚Äôt seemed to get anywhere. I care what people think so heavily that it gives me anxiety or anger. Example: I spent the day with my best friend rock climbing. I‚Äôm not very good, but I was so worried about other people staring at me or judging me that I was angry the whole time and felt awful. How do I move past this?",21Jun2020,3
1018,"As a bit of backstory, I (19M) have always struggled with my phone usage. It's a bit of a problem sometimes. In a lot of situations I use it almost as a defensive thing for social anxiety, but this case is unrelated to that. 

When I wake up in the mornings, I almost always check my phone immediately. I don't know why because I'm never expecting someone to have texted me, at most I expect an email or a notification from social media. My checking of my phone turns into staying on it for 2 hours and getting out of bed later than is acceptable to my parents (they're a bit strict, that's a different story entirely). 

I'd like to be able to cut down on the amount that I use my phone, especially when I wake up. Apart from putting my phone on the other side of the room, does anybody have any advice?

Thank you in advance",21Jun2020,1

1020,I (M19) have an internship at a hotel where I start my first shift at 7:30 in the morning. I feel really ill but I can‚Äôt understand whats making me so sick. Is it ok to call my workplace at 6:30 in the morning to inform them that I will be going to the doctor or would that potentially get me fired?,21Jun2020,1
1021,"I previously worked in a small-ish lab at a cancer center. I loved the work, my schedule, my coworkers, and my patients. I had great rapport with the physicians, nurses, and everyone else that worked there. However, my boss was completely awful. I quit solely bc of her and the way she treated people. In the 3.5 years since I left, 5 others have quit bc of her and 2 more just walked out on her last week, without even having jobs lined up.

Since I quit 3.5 years ago, I've been working in a big hospital lab. I quickly moved up in ranks from bench tech to coordinator to supervisor. I like many aspects of my newer job but it is the hardest and most stressful job I've ever had. We are managed by Quest Diagnostics and they are constantly asking us to do more with less, cutting staff year after year, with no end in sight. They have me over 2 departments and I'm having a hard time keeping up with the workload. It's not sustainable and I'm getting burnt out. I want my old boss's job!!! 

I can't imagine they would want to keep her considering her turnover rate and I now have the experience to take over her role if they did let her go. Is there any way to professionally reach out to the medical director or administrative director that she reports to and check in or maybe someone else within the organization? Like I said, I had great rapport with them, and they were disappointed to see me leave. I just want them to know that I would be super interested in her position and that I am now qualified but don't want to come off any certain way or that I'm assuming anything about my own skills and experience. 

Help!",21Jun2020,1
1022,"I‚Äôm 29F.  Doctors don‚Äôt think anything is physically wrong, but I just feel no enjoyment in life because of it.  I feel super aware of body sensations and hate most of them.  And I have an extremely low pain tolerance.  There are times I just want to shave my head because it feels like my hair is too heavy and my head is generating too much heat.  I absolutely hate sweating, and do everything I can to avoid it.  I constantly feel like I can never get comfortable because something is always hurting.  I try to exercise because I have to, but I hate it immensely.  I genuinely don‚Äôt understand how people can do this every day.  Not sure what to do anymore...has anyone else experienced this, and has anything helped?",21Jun2020,1
1024,"He had clipped his fingernails earlier and left them on a plate we had on our bedroom instead of throwing them away on the thrashcan... He can't stand up too much due to a health issue, so yeah, he did that lmao

Later, I prepped some dinner, came with the food into the room and served him on that same plate. Halfway his food, he looked at me horrified in realization.

We didn't find any nails on the plate, so I guess he ate them all.

I'm in between laughing and a bit worried, since I haven't found too much info on this on google. Could it be dangerous? I also don't know if this is the appropriate sub for this.


Thanks!",21Jun2020,1
1025,"My old roommate used to make this recipe but I have lost contact with him. It was rice with kielbasa sausage slices, potatoes and sometimes ground beef. It was also kind of wet and sticky. I would appreciate it if anyone has a similar recipe or know the name of the dish?",21Jun2020,1
1027,"I would appreciate advice in regards to being more laid back and a few techniques to help me stop overthinking everything. It's been a thing that isn't dramatically bad but bothers me quite a lot. I always try to avoid confrontation, but when even the smallest disagreement happens (even if it is resolved at the end) I am reliving the situation in my head for the rest of the month or more. Most of the time I interpret looks or staring from other people negatively, I feel judged. I'd like to be almost numb in a way to what other people think, or what I think they think of me. I want to not care and be more relaxed.",21Jun2020,1
1028,My gf is taking out her frustration from COVID 19 on me. She won‚Äôt hang out with me or even talk on the phone. She‚Äôs distanced herself and is extremely grumpy all the time. I know she still loves me and I still love her but I‚Äôm becoming very discouraged. I just need to know what to do or say I guess.,21Jun2020,1
1029,"Sorry if this isn‚Äôt a good sub to post this.

Here‚Äôs some backstory she won‚Äôt admit it for some reason, but I‚Äôm not her type. All of the other guys she liked were tall, muscular, and handsome. You know, stereotypical macho man kinda stuff. I don‚Äôt fit that AT ALL. I‚Äôm average height, skinny, she‚Äôs even described me as a ‚Äútwink‚Äù. All her guy friends are pretty much what I described as her type and to be honest I‚Äôm kind of embarrassed about it, that may be my low self esteem talking but whatever. I know she‚Äôd never cheat on me but it makes me feel like she has friends like that because I‚Äôm not like that. She calls me cute, but to her cute is more of an adjective to describe something someone does, not physical appearance and if I call ber beautiful, she‚Äôll sometimes respond with ‚Äúyou‚Äôre handsome‚Äù in an arguably forced sounding way. And she‚Äôs called me hot like once in the past few months. Obviously she‚Äôs aloud to have friends and types of guys she‚Äôs into, this is more about how do I stop feeling so self conscious because I hate this feeling. 

Thank you for reading.",21Jun2020,2
1031,"I know what a lot of you are going to say but I‚Äôll give some background. I‚Äôm 18 and currently living in France, because I left my home country at 15, it‚Äôs been an uphill battle, language and what not whereas in England I excelled in my studies and reached great grades!

1032,"I've been looking into getting contacts for doing cosplay and the ones i found are just color contacts with no prescription. I, however, have a strong prescription because if astigmatism in both eye and nearsightedness. Would they damage my eyes? I wouldn't be wearing them for very long and definitely not all day but I don't habe to have to get special ones bc that would be reaaallly expensive.

1033,"Recently my best friend started dating a girl, and I've had a bad feeling about the girl since day one. My gut told me from the start that she was creepy and weird. Soon I have to go to my best friend's house for her birthday party, and I am pretty much dreading it. I don't want to bring it up to my friend because they're both girls and I don't want to come off as discriminating. What do I do??",21Jun2020,4
1035,"My BF‚Äôs father and long term GF are coming to visit us for a weekend next month. Over our five year relationship, this women is the only person I‚Äôve ever heard my BF say he hates being around. My man is a very patient individual. 

His main complaint is that she is negative about every situation. She always can and will find the negativity in anything going on.

1037,"He is the most loving and supportive dad anyone could as for and he think the world of his family but not of himself. I recently discovered that my dad has been depressed for a while now. I hate that I didn‚Äôt notice the signs sooner but he always puts a smile on in front of us, however i came home early one day to accidentally hear him talking to my mum about it in there room. From what i heard it is to do with the fact he has gained weight over the pass two years and is not satisfied with his career. He also believes that he isn‚Äôt going to live long. My grandpa died when i was 3. He had been in his early 50s when he died. My dad is turning 50 next year and is scared that he will also pass soon. 

My dad is always the one that cheers me up when im down and i could use some advice on how to help him start seeing things in a positive light. 

Thanks xxx",21Jun2020,2
