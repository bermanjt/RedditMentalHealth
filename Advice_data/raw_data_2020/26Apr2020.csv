0,"I was at fault in a car accident -- didn't see the other person coming. I found out recently that they were in the hospital for 6 days and their medical bills might exceed my $500,000 insurance. It was an accident, the police officer I spoke to didn't even give me a ticket, but I just feel so guilty for causing harm to this stranger. I haven't driven since then. My car was totalled. I'm worried that when I get another car I'll be too scared to drive again.",26Apr2020,1
2,"Not sure how else to explain it except that I always feel like people don't really give a shit about me or are talking to people behind my back. I've always had this problem since I was 11, and I've been working on it every year since i was 15 (19 now). 

To elaborate with an example, i could be texting a friend and the flow is consistent. The responses are instant or regularly spaced, everything's good and it's perfectly fine. Then they just stop talking for a while and it throws me off. Okay, maybe I'm just tripping out and over analyzing. But the conversation never quite recovers and they're just... distant, from that point on. 

Or i could be watching a movie with a friend online (social distancing sucks) and texts back and forth while watching are consistent. Right as the movie ends, 10 minute gaps between their messages and mine. 

This isn't recent either, as said. It's been 8 years and I've been trying to work on it. I completely understand that people have their lives too and I'm not the center of the universe, I'd be a millionaire if i had a dime for every time i reminded myself that. But it's always just that itching feeling, little voice in my head that goes ""they're talking to someone more fun than you"" or something of the sorts. 

It just feels like the stupidest thing to me. I have plenty of friends, lots of people i can reach out to but never really get ""close"" to, because every time I do the little insecurities like this fuck me up. It's like I'm constantly shooting myself in the foot and I don't know how to stop, I've been trying for three and a half years now. 

Any advice would be helpful at this point.",26Apr2020,1
3,My best friend legit promised me should would always be my best friend and we’ve known each other since kids. Anyway everything literally was fine until she texted me “sorry we can’t be friends. I have other best friends now but we can still be friends just not good friends” I totally overreacted and just blocked her on everything. The only reason I was upset was because I really put a lot into the friendship and she never returned it then this happened. Should I apologize to her?,26Apr2020,1
4,"I'm not sure what i'm asking for here but i didn't know where else to go.
I used to hang out with a group of people in highschool,i always felt comfortable around them at first and even happy,we were close but at the same time had mutual respect..then idk what happened i suddenly found myself the butt of every other joke,i would laugh it off everytime..but then it felt like more and more people in the group would start ""trying"" me,sometimes it even got physical,like one of these so called friends threw his phone at my face full force once just because we had a little argument and i didn't retaliate because he was a friend i'm not gonna fight my friend right? 
Apparently that gave off the wrong signal and it started becoming borderline bullying. 
So i pulled away from that entire group,just suddenly disappeared.

Fast forward a few years,i've since graduated and going to college now,did a complete 180 and i'm hardly the same guy i was in highschool,very stand offish and don't take no s**t,got a lot of respect from everyone i know..but then my old friends reach out again in a group video call and i kidd you not,maybe 5 minutes into the call they start recalling ""funny stories"" from the past and i start feeling like the same kid they were making fun of all the time,and can't even bring myself to say anything or show aggression because deep down i'm telling myself ""i was an effin pussy they're right to say this and if i say anything in return they'll call me out on how much of a pussy i was"" 

It's always like this,i'm always trying to kill that kid from my past and in the process i end up doing some extremely daring and stupid things that won the reputation of being a crazy no eff giving dude..but all it takes is neeting someone from my past and that entire new self image i've built for myself crumbles down.",26Apr2020,1
5,"Hello everyone, currently living with another family until next but the conditions here are unbearable. I basically have the option of dropping all my hobbies except one pursue school until next year when I live on a dorm or move with another family member in another state. This is my 2nd semester of college and I have to decide to either tough it out or stay.

I know the pandemic is going on and it's difficult to find a job, I was planning on starting an online business. Due to my aunt's paranoia with the internet and people stealing her (useless) information. She might cut me off from internet access altogether, though I have school full time with a very demanding major.

The older relative is always very loud, blames me for everything, always brings up the past, has a cleaning OCD, forcing her kindness on people, and is pretty much suffocating. I really just want to move out of state to another relative or get an apartment later if that's even an option.

Well, thanks for reading and let me know what you think?",26Apr2020,1
6,"I’m failed a class I needed to pass in order to graduate high school. 
My entire life I’ve lived in an abusive household which had led me to get diagnosed with multitude of mental health problems since I was 12. Over time it has gotten worse.

Fast forward to freshman year and my anxiety had gotten so bad I couldn’t even step into the school building, I missed classes came in late and couldn’t express this to my teachers or any others staff, leading my grades to get worse. This continued until the middle of 10th grade when I was hospitalized for a serious suicide attempt (family life reasons). 

My counselor then switched me over to online classes in which I thrived. Although my grades were almost failing and poor the past two years I got good grades half of sophomore and all of junior year. For senior year I attempted to take AP Biology and AP Gov as well as French in actual school, while continuing English, Math, and an elective, online.  Despite having horrible grades the first 2 years of high school, I made a good case and my junior year grades helped me get into a decent college which my entire family believed I could never do because I was a “lazy slacker” and failed previously and my entire life was over because I “chose” not to work hard enough.  

My father has sworn to make my life “hell” even more so if I ever ended up going to community college, or stayed at home. College is my only option out of a hellhole, so I was very happy I got in. 

But nothing changed in senior year. The classes I had to take online i was thriving in but the classes in school became a source of anxiety. Everything came back again and this time I communicated well about it, yet I still missed classes and material.

I just learned I will be failing my AP Biology class for the year. This means I won’t be able to graduate on time and almost guaranteed that admission will be rescinded. 
It feels like my life is falling apart. I have no hope. College was the only escape, my parents are indian and won’t let me move out anyways, I don’t have the funds, and my therapist highly recommends seeing a psychiatrist for medication, which my parents deny over and over. I feel I will never get the proper help, being away from them would’ve helped my mental health if not medication but now I’m stuck. This is a ramble I’m sorry. What should I do?
I will be doing everything required to get my diploma, be it summer school etc., which makes me feel more so of a failure, but what do I about higher education. It was my only realistic escape.",26Apr2020,1

9,"So a bit of background. I’m a 24 year old living with my grandmother due to losing my job and all that jazz. Ever since I moved in with her my mother has been extremely toxic to me and threatening me. The main thing is that if I don’t take care of my gmom, she’ll kick me out and have me arrested. 

Now, my gmom took me in with no questions asked. She helps pay all the bills and even pays for extra as the house is in her name. I do everything I can for her and there’s nothing I won’t do for her. I may not like doing it let’s be honest but I’ll do it because I know without her, I’d be homeless. 

Now back to my b***h of a mother. Idk how to handle it. She just flipped a switch all of the sudden. Every times I say something she thinks is “not nice” or “rude” she goes off and threatens me.

11,"I have been with my husband for 11 years and got on with his friends pretty well for a good few years.
However, if I am being truly honest with myself, I just don’t like them. There are a couple of women in the group who just go out of their way to leave me out and make me feel like shit. One of them is totally vapid and self-obsessed, the other is a total snob. We used to be really close but I just don’t think we ever had much in common which has become more apparent in the last couple of years. I dread having to spend time with them, it always causes me stress and anxiety. I have tried to explain this to my husband and although he agrees with me a lot of the time, they are his friends and have been for a long time. He sometimes tells me he doesn’t want to see them any more either, but nothing changes and we still continue to make plans with them. 
We aren’t as well-off as them and I think they sometimes see us as inferior. This doesn’t really bother me but I just wonder why the hell I should give people like that the time of day! 
I don’t think me not hanging out with them any more is an option, because we always organise things as a group and it could cause all this to come out if I avoid them.

12,"Ok, so it all started in january 2019, I was 12, when I went to a scout camp where my friends told me to come out to my mom and that eventually she'd support me (I'm a cisgender girl and my sexuality is pansexual). Anyways, after the camp I came out and sha was all supportive and stuff, but as time passed by she got more and more bothered about me talking about gay stuff. Then I got in love with a girl, who now days is one of my very best friends. The thing is... She liked me back and it would be my first relationship, I was soooooo happy! But then... My mom started hating her after she knew we liked eachother.

I'll wait forever for you"" and as you migth expect she didn't. I'm not saying she's wrong for moving on but dude, I didn't moved on.

18,"I’m looking for some suggestions for  a friend of mine as I’m kind of out of ideas/suggestions for her at the moment. I don’t want to be overly specific with information or use real names because I believe persons involved in this situation use Reddit? 

My friend, let’s call her Sarah, is stuck in a bad marriage. Her husband, let’s call him Scott, is emotionally and mentally abusive towards Sarah and physically abusing their toddler. They also have a baby under 1 year but Scott has been alright with kid #2 (so far).  

Scott is insecure, emotionally unstable and generally miserable. He constantly criticizes Sarah and nit picks nearly everything she does throughout the day. Any time Sarah tries to stand up for herself he either blows up with rage or turns it around and gaslights her into thinking either she’s overreacting or it’s somehow her fault. He also regularly hits their toddler in the face, on the head or on the back etc hard enough to cause welts and bruises at times. He always tries to justify his actions stating he’s trying to teach them a lesson and it won’t sink in unless it causes pain. He see’s a therapist regularly but they only know his side of things and he flat out refuses to go to a marriage counselor.

Others close to them, including family members have spoken with Sarah about Scott’s abusive behavior toward her and their child. He wasn’t like this when they first met and it has slowly devolved into the current situation without her even really identifying the behavior as truly abusive until last year. She spoke with a therapist recently and they confirmed Sarah’s concerns about his treatment of them. She also had me contact a divorce attorney since she believed Scott was snooping on her phone. The lawyer assured her that she would be entitled to child support and also likely alimony if they divorced because her income alone wasn’t enough to pay for childcare etc. 

Now, here’s where it gets tricky. She was looking into getting her own place, saving money for legal fees and generally preparing to leave his ass. Then this COVID thing happened. She recently lost her job and health insurance and can’t look for work until things die down because she’s high risk. She also has family that could take her in but they live in another state and if she left with her children before the custody agreement was finalized it could be considered kidnapping. He’s also threatened to harm himself if she ever left him. She couldn’t afford to live in their current residence without his financial support even when she was working, and now he’s her sole source of income (which he loves to remind her of).

 My question is this; what options does she currently have left? Doesn’t she need a job/income to secure an apartment etc? Will a divorce attorney still advise someone in a situation like Sarah’s if she has no money to secure a retainer? It’s getting worse and worse on a daily basis and she feels trapped and powerless.",26Apr2020,1
19,"Hi,

Yesterday, my dad died. I woke up to some voicemails from my cousins, who he stayed with, saying that he had passed away. It was absolutely heart-breaking to hear and I've tried my best to accept it but I can't believe it. I am 18 and this is the first major death I have ever experienced and it is hitting me kind of hard. I know there has been much worse scenarios but since this is my first, I don't really know what to do. My parents are divorced so my graduation was supposed to be the first time I saw him a few years. Reading through our old texts makes me so sad and I am not ready to fly out and see him. We had a good relationship given I didn't see him often but it hurts me so much knowing I couldn't text him one last goodbye since we were in the middle of another conversation. At the very least, I am happy I could tell him where I am going to college but, I cannot imagine living the rest of my life without being able to text him. I try to get my mind off of it by watching TV or doing homework or playing videogames, but every time I get silence to myself I hear my cousin's voicemails about him passing. Does anyone have any helpful tips or anything to accept it. Thank you.",26Apr2020,1

I said ok to this and went about my evening. Flash forward to today and he's still here. I didn't expect him to be here this long, however I should have known something like this would happen, because she always has him over and never let me know beforehand. 

Do you all think it is fair if I text something like, ""Can you tell me how long he is going to be here, so that we can discuss readjusting everyone's rent?""

31,"3 weeks ago I was in an accident with my supervisor on the job. I burst my lips and my knee got injured during a nightshift. They brought me to the hospital but I didn't get a note for sick leave by the doctor and I didn't ask for one. Around 6 in the morning the company picked me up from the hospital and dropped me in town but the driver was supposed to drop me at my doorstep. He told me I'll have to make my way home because he's not going to drive 30mins to drop me at my house. With a swollen face, aching body and a busted knee I had to hike to reach at my home. No buses during quarantine so I had to pay a taxi $100 because I wasn't going to get a ride anytime soon. 

No one checked in on me during the time I was down except for a manager my company works for. It took 2 weeks for the swelling in my face to go down and I still couldn't make it for work because of transportation and the company refused to provide it up until later in my country's lockdown. I told my supervisors that I'll be back to work when the transportation is back up.

On Thursday I went back to work and found out that I'll have to report to the main office not by the supervisors but by someone who checks in too see how the work is going on site (the same person who wouldn't drop me at my house). He said that I'll need to report in Monday coming. No one informed me of this for those three weeks and I assumed that the supervisors would have already relayed the information to the main office. A couple of people know I was in an accident(the driver, the supervisors that was working the night I was injured and 2 or 3 managers). 

I didn't get my payslip(I worked two weeks before the pay period ended) or any money in my bank account that was supposed to be there today. I spoke to other workers and they got both already.

35,"So I work for the online shopping department at a major UK supermarket chain. On Friday we received the very sad news that one of our colleagues had passed away after contracting COVID-19 a few weeks earlier. This news really shook everyone up at work as she was a longstanding and very well loved member of our team.

We were informed that on Saturday morning (today) there would be a brief memorial in the staff area to commemorate her passing. Like all my other colleagues, I was very keen to attend so I could pay my respects.

To cut a long story short, I accidentally slept through my alarm this morning and as a result didn’t have time to eat breakfast before leaving for work. Instead, I opted to stop off at a takeaway at the train station near work (one of the few places still open since the lockdown began) where I ordered a large spicy bean burrito. It was delicious and filled me up nicely.

However, as I arrived at work I quickly felt my stomach become very upset and I felt like I urgently needed to use the bathroom. But after looking at my watch I realised I only had five minutes until the memorial for our late colleague was due to start. In order to ensure I didn’t miss it, I decided I would wait and use the bathroom afterwards. This, unfortunately, proved to be a fatal error.

We were all standing in a semicircle (being sure to keep the recommended distance of two metres apart) in the staff area around a very beautiful shrine with flowers, candles and photos that had been set up in tribute to our wonderful late colleague. The general manager of our store said a few words then asked us all to partake in a two minute silence. Everyone quietly bowed their heads.

As the room fell silent, I was quickly reminded of my upset stomach as I felt a sudden stabbing pain in my lower abdomen. Not wanting to be disrespectful, I decided to just try to ignore it and stay where I was standing. I then felt what I can only describe as an enormous buildup of gas in my colon, which I struggled desperately to contain.

Unfortunately, I was not successful. Approximately thirty seconds into the two minute silence, things took a turn for the worse as the silence was suddenly interrupted by a violent eruption of flatulence, which echoed throughout the room. Everyone turned to look at me in utter disgust, and one of my colleagues burst into tears.

I grabbed hold of my stomach and let out an agonised groan as another (this time very wet) fart exploded from my anus. Diarrhoea filled my underwear as my colleagues continued to watch in horror. I was absolutely mortified that this was happening at such an inappropriate occasion.

I fell to my knees in despair as I came to terms with the fact my reputation with my colleagues was being permanently ruined. I then fell over sideways and knocked over the table on which the flowers and photos had been placed, sending them all crashing to the ground as my previously mentioned colleague once again began hysterically crying.

At this point, the store manager instructed everyone to leave the room and return to their departments, and he called for first aid to come and see to me. Everyone else left while he waited with me for them to arrive. I was taken to the bathroom and helped to get cleaned up, then given some clean clothes to change into.

I was then told to go home for the rest of the day, where I have remained ever since. I am due to go back into work on Monday and I am absolutely dreading it. Is there anything I can do to salvage my reputation with my colleagues or should I just quit my job?

Many thanks in advance for any advice you may have. Stay safe everyone.",26Apr2020,1

TW: self harm / suicide

im kind of young, and I recently got out of my first relationship. It lasted exactly a year, and we Ended up breaking up.

i was considering suicide and was self harming often, and she just didn’t talk to me for around a month since she didn’t want to be involved. I was upset and asked for a break, and after telling me she was gonna break up with me anyway, we broke up.

shes now with the person I was suspecting her of cheating with, and my depression has gotten worse and I’ve been considering suicide even more now as she was really the only person I talked to. I don’t have many friends at all.

I know I’m being edgy as hell right now but it hurt because I truly did love her and I still do, and she didn’t care about me it seems.

&amp;#x200B;

i feel like I should have moved on by now, but I haven’t. I’d like to know why, and just if it’s normal. I don’t know if I’m being obsessive. Is this what I should expect from future relationships?",26Apr2020,1
37,"I mean I know that I “should” post the unphotoshopped one, but I like the photoshopped picture a whole lot, I’ve asked people if they can see the difference in the two photos and most have said no, including my mom and my siblings! But I can clearly see the differences and think they are pretty clear. 

The reason I prefer the photoshopped version is not because of how I changed my face, but the details in my makeup look different and I can’t figure out why the other version doesn’t have the same makeup since I didn’t re touch my makeup. I’ve tried editing the original version to get the same makeup look as in the photoshopped version but nothing is working and that’s why I want to post the photoshopped version.

What should I do?",26Apr2020,1

My two buddies have taken up drinking and consuming alcohol since quarantine. I might aswell add that theyve smoked weed too. Ive seen where those choices can end up. I was lucky enough to quit nicotine addiction. But my friends choices seem to have taken a turn. I dont want to abandon them, i try to tell them that its not a good idea and unfortunately ive already have “lost” a friend to those choices. He and I used to be best friends then he started doing drugs, hanging out with the wrong people and now we rarely talk.

Now he’s the type of person to play the popular game called Fortnite and watch Tiktoks all the time. So when he found out I had Reddit he started trash talking the hell out of me. He said things like how Reddit has the most toxic people ever and how they’re a bunch of no life virgins. He also said so many other things bad about Reddit. I don’t agree with him because when I go on this app I rarely see toxic people. It’s getting to the point where I can’t take it anymore. I once ignored his texts for a day and he texted me over 20 times, called me 10 times, and told his mom about it, which then had my parents involved.

He has a lot of friends that are girls. I don't like it and I try really hard every single day to accept it. Every time he mentions one or one joins his mostly male zoom calls I get insanely jealous, depressed, anxious, etc. It's like I'm bipolar with the emotions I feel when a situation like that comes along. I want to cry and tell him how I feel, but I honestly can't tell the difference anymore between outrageous and unnecessary jealousy, and what I should actually be upset about. The sadness lasts hours and sometimes days as well as comes back as soon as I think of it. 

I know I shouldn't be feeling this way and that I need to do something about it because it's driving me absolutely crazy. I spend every day anxious and sad because I don't know how to fix it and I certainly don't want to take it out on him and I try hard not to. It's hard to pretend I'm fine though when I literally am so uncontrollably upset about it. I don't want to be a jealous crazy person anymore.

42,"A month and a half ago I posted a meme on my college’s meme Facebook page. I had no idea that the meme contained racial connotation. I don’t want to repost it here because I can’t bring myself to even look at the image anymore. Well the next day an African American student posted this whole breakdown about how what I posted was incredibly racist and hurled all these insults at me claiming what a racist I am. But I swear on my LIFE I had no idea the meme was racist. I promise I’m not out here posting intentionally racist memes on my school’s public meme page. 

Well next thing I knew I had a mob attack me. I had people making posts about me. I had people calling me out by name. People emailing my department. People trying to get me expelled. My department head called me and freaked out. I explained how this whole ordeal was just a blind dumb mistake not a “targeted racial attack”. I wrote a lengthy public apology explaining myself and taking full responsibility and not hiding behind excuses. But at that point they didn’t want to hear it. The hate continued for 2 more days. I had to have a phone call with the president of the school and explain myself to him. Luckily both he and my department head understood. 

But here I am, a month and a half later, completely and utterly destroyed. All I hear is their voices in my head constantly. Their angry voices and posts. They take over every quiet moment I have. I’m so ashamed. I’m so disgusted with myself. I’m so full of rage and regret and humiliation. I’m so afraid what this will mean for my future. All those people now affiliate me with this. I’m shaking typing this. I don’t know what to do. I’ve had trouble eating and sleeping this entire month. This feeling is constant. It’s overwhelming. It’s always there lingering.

46, There will be times with my girlfriend where I feel somewhat infatuated with her or very affectionate and just the need to be with her. Like today for example this whole day I felt obsessed with her I felt a strong need to be with her and talk to her even after I talked to her then it kind of just went away all of a sudden the feeling. I didn't feel the intense need to be with her anymore or talk to her. I still like her but it just didn't feel as important anymore. I kept getting this thought what if she leaves me for someone else and it would depress the fuck out of me thinking that but when the feeling went away it didn't seem to bug me nearly as much anymore.

47," TLDR: &gt;!Woke up and realized a friend of mine was really manipulative, after walking away now all she does is cry about how she's the victim and I'm the bad guy!&lt;

This girl, I'll call her Mage, we became friends at the beginning of high schoolIt's been a year and a half and Mage came out as transfem halfway thru and I've been supporting her since

We would fight from time to times and it's a normal thing that happens so I didn't see red flags and one day while we were in a fight I checked out her reddit account.  
It's really not that nice I know but 1) it's public, 2) she told me what it was and 3) she has a tendency to talk about suicide and since it had been a few days since she last talked to me I needed to make sure she was alright

And then I saw that she had been talking shit about my couple for a VERY long time. She occasionally talked shit about my partner but I didn't really look into it too hard.  
But she was just, outright saying that my relationship was terrible and that it was hurting everyone around us????  
((Other things she was saying were about things I did that hurt her, and she really talked about them with pain, but never did she tell me those specific (and normal things) things like correctly gendering her hurt her

I confronted her about this and never did she say ""I'm sorry""  
She said that it was (mutual friend)'s fault, she said it was mine, she said it was my boyfriend's. She called herself a faker and an attention whore, she said that she was a terrible friend and overall acting like a big victim when she did this to herself.

I stopped talking to her but (mutual friend) didn't, and he's very worried about her not responding for long periods of time. So I checked for activity on her profile again and, she's talking in transfem subreddits about losing her only source of validation. Keep in mind she still has (mutual friend), she's constantly screaming at him and telling him that our relationship ending was his fault, but he's there. Keep in mind she said that me correctly gendering her was a problem.

But again, I think that maybe I shouldn't have violently stopped talking to her, maybe I should've dialed back our relationship to ""I have her discord"" period. Maybe I should've tried helping her but she didn't want to be helped I kept talking to her she never tried doing better I just.

48,"Hello Everyone, my name is BobbyJoe, 21 years old, I’m a current Freshman at a University studying BioChemistry. I am a PreMed student who is gunning to get into Medical School and even though I have done numerous things to make myself feel standout, I feel like there is something missing. I understand that Medical Schools are still looking holistically at an applicants records but they are also looking at their service history, such as volunteering, recommendations, etc. Holistically speaking, I am not worried about my transcripts. Below is a list of what I am currently involved in:
-Nursing home volunteering
-2 years of shadowing 
- Involved in personal research on anesthetic drug development (yes I am following FDA guidelines and their submissions)
-Volunteer at soup kitchens when I’m able to.
-Work a full time job with full time academics
- 3 current Letter of Recommendations

All of these I plan to continue while in my undergraduate years.

Holistically speaking, my grades as follows is:
-Average 17 Credit hour semesters
-3.8 GPA
-Advanced classes
-1 PhD recommendation
-2 M.S. recommendations

(I am currently studying for the MCAT (last year and a half) and the practice tests I’ve been taking have been saying that my practice score is in the range of 516-521)

So my question for advice to Medical Students, Doctors, anyone with experience in the Medical School admission field; What else am I missing to make myself a strong applicant to Medical Schools or should I continue what I’m doing if I already seem to be a strong applicant? I just have a bunch of anxiety In my ambitions and hopes to be accepted.

50,"I am writing this as I am rather distressed at this moment, and I've little to nowhere else to turn for advice.

A girl I know has recently started to get ""touched"" by her uncle. I fear things will escalate from there if nothing is done. Said girl is also a minor, but doesn't want to get her parents or cps/police involved. I am pretty much the only person she has trusted with this. The issue I'm having is that not only does she live far from me (we used to see eachother only twice a week), but due to the virus I am unable to take public transport to see her and try to help her myself.

I don't want things to turn bad as I myself know how quickly these things can turn bad. I have tried talking with her and getting her to understand, but she fears for the consequences. I am at a loss here, and each day that passes I can feel myself getting more and more internally sick at the mere thought of it.

I thought of calling the cops/cps regardless, however, due to there being no tangible proof whatsoever, and the fact I'm 90% sure she won't want to pursue the case or even admit it was happening, I am at a loss.

59,"TLDR: I'm not working out because corona has made me depressed and unable to go to the gym, but in turn my weight gain is making me more depressed.

So i've struggled with an eating disorder since like 5th grade. Like end of 2018 i got it under control, i was eating properly and enough, I had joined a gym with my best friend and we were getting trained there like twice a week. Skip to like fall of 2019, i'm happy with my body, i'm back to the weight I was beforehand, and the sessions are just becoming too pricey for me to handle. Me and my friend agree to stop subscribing to these training sessions since we initially got them because we had no idea what we were doing, but we still had some already paid for sessions that we attended here and there. 
I had kind of stopped going as often then and as school picked up (exam season) i stopped going besides like 1-2 times a month. 2020 comes and i'm basically not going at all, and i've gained like a little bit more weight but it's not enough to really upset me or lead my ED to return. Quarantine has hit and, as someone who's never really succeeded with just using home workouts, i'm noticing weight gain. I want to workout but my depression has been rampant since i've been locked in with my parents; I feel so discouraged when I see my weight gain, i feel self conscious when my parents make comments about my body, and I feel stupid and guilty when I see my friends doing workouts because I know I can do them I just can't bring myself to. Since i'm so driven in the mindset of not working out at home it's really driving me to starving myself in order to lose weight, even though I can rationalize that that's crazy. Basically my happiness is tied to my weight which is tied to my happiness, and much like other unhealthy habits that have sprung up since quarantine, my ED is becoming worrisome to me too.

61,"So I recently got hired at a Dominos as a delivery driver, and had some red flags right off the bat.

During training I was FORCED to sign off on the ""i volunteer to waive my breaks,"" and told that we'd be getting tracked even outside work. I wanted to ask what app they used for it but that question got ignored. I was sort of iffy about it all but figured I'd see what happened before I did anything else (bad move). Assistant manager trained us and was really very much on a power trip the entire time, asking if we were afraid yet and kept getting too close to everyone in their personal space bubbles. Kept making rude comments about my height and how unfeminine I was (I'm tall, they're like 4'11). I asked a lot of questions, apologized for asking such questions, to which they laughed at and then I made notes about everything they said. 

Assistant manager said we'd specifically recieve a text, NOT a call (she made this clear) from them or the other hiring person, by Thursday in the daytime and if we didn't then to text to ask what was going on the following business day.

I did not receive any texts. I got a phone call from an unknown number in the wrong region earlier in the day, ignored it, went to voicemail and it was all static. I deleted it, not thinking much of it. 

At well past working hours on Thursday night I got a text from that assistant manager asking that I be available the following morning. I - being wary of them already - stated that it was past working hours and that I had not heard from them prior so I planned to text them tomorrow. AM got mad and sent a really rude text outlining their ""process"" and saying they had our general manager call me but I didn't get a call. And additionally unluckily for AM I had notes outlining the original process and sent that with timestamps. Also stated that I wouldn't be available till a week later - because I didn't want to set a standard of them thinking I was okay with being scheduled the night before a shift. That has NEVER happened to any job I've ever had in retail or food, so I'm sure as hell not starting that now. 

AM proceeded to ignore me for 2 weeks. AM also tried to harass a coworker about me trying to get them to contact me for them the night they texted me. Coworker didn't budge. I found that unprofessional of AM to do.

I was informed by the coworker that my training check was ready for me. I was never informed this by anyone else. I waited another week before messaging the AM trying to get their attention that I'd drop in to get my check, and that it's bad for their business to try and hide that from me. I also asked if they ever planned on scheduling me. Ignored again.

Turns out the AM did harass the same coworker though, and I've yet to know exactly what. That's really not okay.

So I dropped in today, was very friendly off the bat, playing dumb. Coworker said AM would be gone after 12 so I went at 4pm. I was expecting to see the general manager and to just be friendly about everything. AM was there instead, waiting for me at a table it seemed. They barked at me to sit down and aggressively demanded me to say what I had to say for myself. I was shocked, and told them I was just there to collect a check, please. I also mentioned that it wasn't very professional of them to harass someone else who wasn't even involved, and that it's sad I had to find out about the check on my own instead of being informed directly. AM seemed shook that an employee had directly said that to them, and started going off at me about attitude or whatever. I hadn't displayed any, and was still very polite. But at that point I knew I had to be firm. So I mentioned to AM casually about my rights as an employee, and showed them a note about that. They asked if I was planning on quitting and I said ""No, never said anything about that have I?"" AM stared again and then quite literally stomped off to get my check. 

When AM came back they asked me to sign off that I got it and I did, and I also asked them if they ever planned on telling me I had a check or if they were hoping I'd just never get it. They said word for word ""oh sweetie, i was just waiting for you to tell me your availability!"" in a really rude snobby way. I reminded them that I had, and that it's really not my problem that the AM couldn't just scroll up to see that I had in texts. 

AM barked about attitude again and I said again that if they wanted to go at me for that then they need to re-examine how they treated people first, because it sets the standard for how others will behave. They asked again if I was quitting and I said no. Then they demanded i return my uniform and (because I've had a previous manager warn me about this as a tactic to say that employees quit by turning in uniforms) I refused and left. 

Felt pretty good about standing up for myself honestly, but then realized in the check that I was underpaid. Training was from 1:45pm to 5:30pm, and I only got paid for 2 hours. Would've been awkward to go back in, so I'm not sure what to do about that now. There was no clock in clock out thing, but my coworker does remember how long it took. I just really don't want to keep giving them a hard time by standing up for me you know? 

I wanted to file a report at least with the AM's boss, but then found out that their boss is also someone they're married to. And they run the franchise location together. ):

74,"So this last year has been a bit of pain. I’ve honestly never had an issue with anxiety, maybe a bit of social but who doesn’t? Anyway, last year my parents started their divorce, (I’m 26 and own a house with my brothers.) my mother moved in with me, father basically only talks to me to bad mouth my mother. 
I had a well paying job all the way up until early February, but I’ve been laid off since then and haven’t heard a word from the company. (Which I figured I would’ve heard from them by now..I work in a niche field in construction.) 
I wouldn’t be able to go into work anyway since my mother who lives with me caught COVID-19.(She is a at home nurse and caught it from a elderly couple she was taking care of.) I haven’t had any symptoms, and I wash my hands like crazy. And yes we are in contact with our local health officials. 

My bills were behind until I got my stimulus check which helped me get ahead, and unemployment has been an aid as well. 
I’m also in a long distance relationship and it’s been strained as of late..short version I’ve become a bit distrustful of her.. (at least it feels like it on my end. we are going on nearly 3 years.) 

Any advice on how to deal with anxiety, and being overly worried during this time will be appreciated..I’m a gamer too so I try to fill my empty time with that.

75,"TLDR at the bottom

my boyfriend and i have been staying with his coworker/friend for a few weeks now. we had some issues with his mom and had to leave her house. it started out fine, they don't make us pay rent because they want us to save for our own place and his coworker makes dinner every night for us, in exchange we help around the house and things like that. 

recently though, his friend and her husband have been getting annoyed with us because we like to spend time in the spare room they offered us. her husband works 5 days a week and she works 3 days a week and when they're at work, we usually don't see a point to being in their living room when we have a TV and our PS4 in the spare room. 

my boyfriend works 5-6 days a week and what little time he has, he likes to spend with me either playing video games or just talking with me. his friend and her husband are upset because we like to be in the spare room even though we do come out into the living room and spend time with them for hours at a time. they want us to only be in the room when we're sleeping or if neither of them is here.

if her husband is outside messing with his cars, we can be in the room, but if either of them is inside the house and in the living room we have to be out there. we spend plenty of time with them when they're here but we also like to spend time alone. she's home fairly often and he gets off work around 5 every weekday.

she came to us saying that her husband has an issue with us being in that room as often as we were and that they both feel ""used"" for a place to stay and food (she even said that he doesn't care if we sit in the living room just ""staring at the walls"" as long as we aren't in the room all day) when in reality we're nothing but grateful for how helpful they've been when we had nowhere else to go.

she keeps saying that i'm constantly up his ass and her and her husband think i'm not ""independent"" when in all honesty, i just like spending time with him because he's constantly gone and i'm unemployed at the moment. they keep making fun of me for being around him and following him when he goes into the room to sleep but i just love my boyfriend and spending time with him, it's making me feel like shit. she also said she felt upset the other night when i went to bed but my boyfriend stayed in the living room and i informed her that i was tired and not feeling well. 

my boyfriend and i both feel uncomfortable with their feelings on this because A: we do spend time with them but he also likes to relax after being at work for 8+ hours and B: we've offered them money to stay here and they didn't accept it because they want us to save up. we love and care for these people deeply and we're so thankful for them but we also don't want to be controlled.

i'm just not sure if my feelings on this are justified, i mean they are giving us a place to stay for free and feeding us and such but we're also still people with hobbies and we like spending time with each other because he works so much. am i being ungrateful by feeling this way or are they completely unreasonable? 

TLDR; my bf and i are staying at his friend's house for the time being and his friend and her husband treat us like house pets and want us around them constantly/won't let us stay in the spare room they offered us unless they're not in the house or we're sleeping.",26Apr2020,1
76,"Hey all, I need some advice.

Because of Corona, I decided to stay with my mother instead of my current 2 roommates who are best friends and coworkers of mine. We don't really get along, and as soon as the pandemic started they invited their boyfriends to stay with us without asking me first. Had I said no, or argued, it would have become a losing battle for me so I just said I needed space and went to my moms.  This was mid-march.

My move-out date for this apartment was April 31. I was told if I moved out early, they would cover my portion of the bills for the month. Even though they were not offering to cover my portion of rent for moving early, I thought why not get it over with, and moved out two weeks early. I was moving back to my moms anyways. 

Today I got a message asking for April bill money. I mentioned they said I didn't need to pay for bills if I moved out early, which I did. I also said I hadn't been there since mid-march, but their boyfriends had, so I was confused as to how that was even a fair argument. But none the less they continued to argue and said I was being ridiculous, that I chose to stay with mom and demanded to know if I'd be paying.

I mentioned multiple times I would be willing to pay, but asked what they thought was fair because they literally told me I didn't have to pay. I reiterated there was someone living at our apartment using the bills I was paying for while I was away. I even sent them a screenshot showing them saying I didn't have to pay, and asked them ""if this isn't what you meant, let's discuss what is fair?"" 

They told me to just forget about it and stopped replying to my messages.

Now I can't stop reflecting on what I did wrong or how I can resolve the situation. I am questioning if I am the person who fucked up in the argument. I keep beating myself up. This has always been how any minor issue has gone, I state my confusion or misunderstanding then get buried in a pile of texts by both of them at the same time.

I am really good at self-reflection and seeing where I went wrong, but I do it to the point where I admit my wrongs in and effort to meet in the middle then get taken advantage of/ stop having my own back.

&amp;#x200B;

This past 2019 summer I started to hang out with a kid we'll call H. I went to school with H for about 3 years but never talked to him before. This freshman year we became 'good friends' and began to hang out almost 2-3 times a week after school ended. I also had another actual very good friend lets call B, B was also friends with H and we all started to hang out with each other. The first event that is weird but I didn't notice it at first was that H got B into a fight with another kid B is a small kid who I could tell wanted nothing to do with fighting and H kept pushing him to do it. B got his ass beat as many kids were filming him. I still didn't see anything weird about him as fighting in my school is a common thing. Over the summer we would hang out almost every day and had good times until he would call me at around 8 or 9 to hangout and almost always end up in him asking me to a sleepover. It got to the point where I had my mom 'fake' text telling me I couldn't because I had something in the morning. This was when things got a little weird, we would always go to B's or H's house and never mine, H would show up at my house at night asking to hang out, It was weird because I've never gone to my house with him but I did have snap map on so that could be an explanation on how he got to my house, this continued only about once or two more times but I eventually had H and B over at my house so I began to be accustomed to how people know where I live. Fast forward to sophomore year I turned into a stoner and started hanging out with other kids but still keeping in touch with H. One day I get this text from B saying, ""H has been saying glurlf thinks he's cool because I hung out with the popular kids (who were really my smoking buddies) and that im going to become a hardcore drug addict."" I later confronted him about this and he began to lie, lie, lie, I trusted B's word and began to space myself from him,  and he would always ask why I hate him and what did he do wrong. He then admitted to actually saying those things and said can we just be friends again and I said no, I don't like people who talk behind my back and lie about it. He would then keep asking me why I hate him and add himself to private group chats somehow. I began blocking him on social media after warnings of him having to keep his 'distance' from me and maybe we could work it out. I still have him blocked to this day and he is now saying I've left him for the 'popular kids'. Am I a bad friends or am I in the right to stop communicating with him?",26Apr2020,1

Additional info ~ In my location where I live the lockdown still remains like most places and our neighbourhood/street is very close to one another in a way that we communicate and keep up with each other. I know for a fact that non of my neighbours around my area are key workers which makes this situation weirder. Anways like I said before I've heard a car on our street running and it's practically outside of my house but I'm confused because It only shows/comes at like 2:30am or 3:45am and just really late or rather really early in the morning. I got quite concerned about it and asked my fellow neighbours the following day through my window.

Here's the situation - recently I've made good friends with a person I've previously known for years, but had a ""mutually ignore each other"" relationship due to past events. We've been talking day and night for hours at a time, all was good. But recently, that friend started responding very slowly, and generally showing up online once a day at most, often still not responding. The responses, when they come, are as usual, they just come very slowly.

Now, before I fully sound like an asshole. I am a very anxious person when it comes to relationships with people. I've been betrayed, ghosted and what not countless times before. Often with this exact scenario, so I do have reasons to be an asshole about it. Yet, I don't want to. This person in particular, was very nice to me, and was first to initiate contact again when we accidentally met, even though I've been to blame for our cold relationship in the past.

I know she's going through difficult times right now. Which is why I try to be more active, write often and overall try to be engaged, to help her get through it. And she's one of those people who have a million people writing them at the same time, to a point of getting completely overwhelmed. Yet at the same time, most of those people are borderline annoying or even harmful. I don't want to be such a person.

I've always been scared to sing infront of people. I'm even nervous to sing by myself. I sing flat and have no experience what so ever other than belting to phantom of the Opera.
Hell even humming infront of someone was something big for me.


Just last year I built up enough confidence to start singing little by little, and I started watching videos and I payed more attention during band hoping it would help. It did alot but I still sing flat.

But what really crushed what little tablespoon of confidence I had was someone close to me tell me I would never be able to sing. ""Your in band and if you can't hear what's wrong you will never be able to do it. ""

This happened a few months ago and me and my over active mind was like "".. oh shit that must mean alot of people I've done this around think it's bad and never said anything. ""

So now I'm still trying to start, I'm going to learn how to do it out of spite. But I just cant seem to sound right. At first it sounds decent but then my self confidence crashes and Burns and I go full monotone and it's B A D.

My friends say I have a large range and will be able to do it and some of my family agrees but idk, it's not that comment that gets me it's the thought of everybody hating it and telling me to stop. Or to tell me it's annoying.


how do I overcome this? Any tips?",26Apr2020,1
97,"Recently I've taken on an extremely nihilistic, cynical, and super hateful approach to life. I cannot for the life of me forgive anyone for anything and I still have grudges that date back to high school. I've gone out of my way to get revenge on people who slighted me. I've also become a total recluse and have minimized social interaction as much as possible. Anytime someone belittles me or disrespects me in the slightest I am immediately hateful of that person and seek revenge. And it's not like I'm Mr. Nice Guy and I'm of good size so I don't think I'm an easy target. I don't even have friends and make sure to not befriend anyone so there's not anyone in my life who can use me. I'm just filled to the brim with hatred of other people and it's gotten to the point where I don't even leave my house due to the possibility of someone disrespecting me or ridiculing me.",26Apr2020,1

I'm almost 17 so the questions are inevitable. My parents would always ask me what I want to do in the future and I would always answer ""I don't know"". My father would always give me the talk that if don't get myself together soon he wouldn't mind me anymore once I turn 18 since I'm allowed to go on my own then but I just really can't figure myself out. I couldn't decide on what I want. I just want to live and I can't think of anything beyond that. 

I would get told that I should focus on my studies and honing of my skills first before anything but my lack of aspirations for a bright future gives me no motivation for my studies and others so I figure that if I give myself an answer now then hopefully it'll give me clarity.

My cousin is 20 and I’m 18. We both still live at home with our parents. She has no job, isn’t going to college and doesn’t pay any bills or rent. She’s an only child. I have a job and I’m not going to school but I pay for my car insurance and phone bill and $50 towards rent. She also doesn’t have many friends because she bullies people and has always had a bad attitude and was mean to people. 

What pissed me off is she posted on Instagram all her Apple devices. She has two iPhone SE (old and new), iPhone X, XS max and two XR’s, iPhone 8, and iPhone 6S plus. Her mother just bought her an iPhone 11 today (brand new straight from Apple she posted the receipt) and she’s bitching about it not being an iPhone 11 Pro. 

First of all, she doesn’t need an iPhone 11 period. She just got 3 new iPhones within the last year. (XS max, XR and the new SE) and now 11. She was also posting her three MacBooks, two pros and an air. Her 3 iPad minis, iPad Pro (1st and 2nd gen), iPad Air, and old iPad 2. And her 4 old iPod touches. No human needs all these Apple devices. Her parents use Samsung devices so they are all indeed hers.

It pisses me off how ungrateful she is because it’s not an IPhone 11 Pro. Just a regular iPhone 11. Your mother just bought you that for no reason, you don’t deserve it, yet your bitching. 

THEN she has the nerve to bitch about how her mom won’t buy her any of her favorite singers merch because it’s a waste of money (like the iphones arent????) she keeps making passive aggressive posts about wanting the merch and how she wants a pro. 

I sent her this: 

Listen, I’m 2 years younger than you and I actually work to get things I want. MOST people actually have to earn an income to get what they want. You are an entitled spoiled bitch who doesn’t deserve any of it. You sit on Instagram all day and bitch about how your mom didn’t get you the exact phone you want, when most people are lucky enough to be able to afford an iPhone 11. You have so many phones it’s ridiculous. Most people trade in their phones for upgrades, but not you. Mommy just buys you a new one off the bat. You need to get a job and stop mooching off your parents. MOST people our age go to school and work and pay for things for themselves. It’s called being an adult. You are an adult yet you have your parents do everything for you. You get whatever you want without lifting a finger. It’s disgusting. What would you do if your parents suddenly died? You won’t know how to support yourself or do anything. You can’t even keep a job for more than a few weeks without getting fired because your attitude is so bad. That’s pretty pathetic... you are 20 years old. Yeah it must be nice that you have all those Apple devices and your parents are fortunate enough to provide them for you. You should be grateful. But you’re not. You just brag and bitch. And as for *singers name* merch, if you really wanted it that bad, you would find a way to get the money, maybe get a job or sell some of your phones, but you won’t. Guess what? NOBODY feels bad for you.  We all think you are super ungrateful.",26Apr2020,1

I am the oldest child (F19) and have several siblings, the youngest being 10 years younger than me. My parents have had a pretty rough relationship during the last decade and finally separated when I was 18. The kids, my mom and I moved and rented a new house while my dad kept living in our old one. I go to college nearby and live with my mom partly for financial reasons and partly to help with the kids. 

Anyway, so with all the drama of the pandemic, my mother has decided that she wants to start over again with my dad- meaning she wants us all to move back in with him in our old home and try again as a family. This is causing a lot of tension in our home, because I don’t want this to happen. My dad is not a bad guy, however he struggles with mental illness and often lashes out at us and my mom. My dad lives about a 2 hour bus ride away from my school, which is another reason for my doubts about us moving back together. If and when the pandemic ends, it will be a lot harder for me to commute to class and work due to the bus system in his area. Moving back home with my father would result in a lot of the chaos we had before (fights, violence) and it would be a major inconvenience for my life. 

My boyfriend (23) and I have been together for over a year and he gets along great with my family. He has his own apartment, a stable job and lives close to my school. Between us two, the  rent would be manageable. i’d finally be able to gain some independence (not to mention it would be much more convenient for my commute). I am thinking about moving in with my BF, but my mother is adamant against it. She says that if I go I’ll be disappointing her and shaming our entire family. This hurts me cause I work so hard to be a good daughter - I got a full scholarship to school, I don’t party, I take care of my siblings, I’ve had a job since I was 14. I have an IUD. I feel so conflicted. I know I can legally make whatever decision I choose but I don’t want to go back to living in the chaos that was with my father. I don’t want to be shamed by mom to my younger siblings either. I see where she’s coming from but due to how I grew up I had to mature from an early age. I feel that if I moved with my BF it would give me stability and a chance to start living my own life. How should I handle this? 

TL;DR: Turbulent parents wanting to get back together, I want to move out with BF for my own convience, which my mom is vehemently opposed to.",26Apr2020,1
102,"I'll try to keep this short, but, yeah, the header is pretty self-explanatory. 

My dad passed away in July, and I met my ex in October and we started dating around mid January until now. I was really falling apart during October-December but I got back on my feet in January, began college and started dating this guy. I started to eat properly again, lost some weight because I wasn't emotionally eating anymore, was excelling in college. I started going back to therapy a few weeks ago via Zoom and got a new job too. Lots of big changes, and I felt like my ex and I were slowly growing apart and weren't able to see each other, obviously (lockdown). Today, I came across some things and discovered he was having an emotional affair. I was shocked, I confronted him through text message, he didn't bother calling whatsoever and just started to gaslight me and call me names. We then abruptly ended things mutually and blocked each other from everything, deleted numbers, all that. 

I cried a few times today, called a friend, texted more friends, took a nap, drank water, ate some more. I'm just pretty shocked, I know we were growing distant but I didn't expect something like this and I feel like I'm already at a vulnerable time in my life going back to therapy and now having to juggle work and school and I'm worried about falling apart or neglecting myself. Is there any extra precautions I can take so that this doesn't happen?

103,"So my neighbor shouted at me today that I'm a creep and I need to stay away from his property. The problem is that I walk my dog every day and she's a little weird. If his kids are playing in his yard she'll sit down in front of his house or on the other side of his fence and stare at them, I assume it's because they make a lot of noise. I try to haul her away but I get tired of doing it all the time (she's around a 100 pounds) and we only recently got a harness that she can't escape from, which she tries to do if I haul her to much. So sometimes I let her sit at the end of their driveway or the other side of their fence and try to not look at the kids to make it clear I'm not a creep there to stare at them, I also only let her sit there when I think the kids are out of sight (he has a large property you can't see their yard from the end of their driveway or most of their fence, maybe trying to stay out of sight was being creepy.) I decided to alter my route to stay away from his fence and cross the road when I come to his driveway but I'm not sure if I should apologize somehow. I don't feel like I can or should do it personally but maybe I should write a letter explaining things. All I managed to say when he was shouting at me was ""It's not me it's the dog"" and ""I'm sorry I'll stay away"" which make me sound like a stalker or something.

I just am tired of her telling lies and crying to her mom, and also having to censor everything I say at school while shes around. She also has a history of making rude comments at me whenever I come in with new clothes and just generally bringing me down.

3)Move far away to whales and start a new life on a farm where i know no one

112,"So, me and my gf have been together for just over 3 months now. She's more extroverted which is pretty much the opposite of me. She's the type of person that likes going to parties, concerts, festivals, the type of person to constantly post on her snapchat story and the type of person who misses everyone during this lockdown. However, my issue isn't much to do with the lockdown.

Whenever she goes to a party, or goes to a concert, or posts about going to a concert, or even just posts pretty much whatever to her story, I get this super anxious and kinda heart-wrenching feeling that I can't really explain. I know I'm not worried about her cheating on me or anything I'm not sure what causes this feeling. Obviously, due to the lockdown she's not been able to go to parties or concerts and this morning she posted about being annoyed about that. She messaged me before posting, but when I woke up I checked her story first and it kinda ruined my whole day to be honest. I didn't mention it to her because I don't want her to be self conscious about what she posts and I tried not letting her notice because it's not really her fault, there's something wrong with me. Even thinking about her being at a party getting drunk just know makes me feel anxious. 

I know it's a problem with me because even though my ex-girlfriend didn't go to parties and stuff like that, I still didn't like when she posted on her story. It's the same feeling. The worst part is that there are so many things that trigger the feeling, I'm anxious/upset for probably 50% of the time we talk (snapchat). This means that I can't participate in the conversation the way I want to and obviously it's just shit feeling like that so much. 

I hate this because I know that a normal person/boyfriend shouldn't feel like this especially if such things make their significant other happy. Am I emotionally not mature enough to have a girlfriend? This is not something I want to break up for because it's so petty and childish. Why am I upset when my girlfriend is happy? I don't wanna drift apart because of this because the other 50% of the time she makes me so happy and she makes me feel loved and cared for. She's such an amazing girlfriend and I hate that I can't fully appreciate her because of my stupidity. 

Any advice on how to make this feeling go away or how to approach this? I'd really appreciate some insight. Thank you!",26Apr2020,1

121,"Growing up my dad wasn’t around a lot, my parents got divorced when I was 4 and my mom had custody of my brother and I. We grew up sort of despising our dad because of how my mom would talk about him. Now that I’m older, looking back I have a lot of good memories with my dad. I now have a new respect for him because I can talk to him about a lot of things and he’s extremely understanding and we share the same sense of humor. I understand that he did his best with the money he had and I know he would give his last dollar to me and my brother.

Growing up living with my mom, it has always been about work, money, or her boyfriend at the time. I’m extremely thankful for everything that my mom has done for my brother and I, and she did a great job raising us. Before anyone comments about it, we were never poor. My mom makes a lot more money than the average single parent, she’s just always been very stingy. 

I really have no memories growing up with my mom. I do have memories about her boyfriends. One of them used to punish me and my brother by embarrassing us. My brother got in trouble one time and her boyfriend made him wear my Cinderella dress to the park, one time he made me out my underwear on my head and stand on a stool in the middle of the living room. Her most recent boyfriend (We’ll say John) was great at first. They were on and off for a few years and just a couple weeks ago broke up for good. The last time I went on a trip with my mom was with John and his family which was about 4-5 years ago. Last year she won a trip through her job to Italy and took him and didn’t think about me or my brother. My dad took my brother to California and I was really upset about it, so my mom said if she won her work trip to Hawaii this year, she would take me. She ended up making plans with John to go. 

I feel like I have no sort of connection with my mom. We hardly talk about anything and when we do, it’s small talk. I try to talk to her, but she’s always working. She doesn’t know any of my interests. She doesn’t have a lot of friends and she doesn’t try to make any. Whenever she’s dating someone, she always puts them above her kids. She’s struggled with depression and anxiety for a while and I believe it’s because she depends on happiness through her boyfriend at the time. Being around her makes me feel depressed and she’s the reason I believe I have BPD. I can’t be around her for more than 5 minutes without becoming extremely annoyed or angry. Because of this, I try spending as little time with her as possible. I know she can feel me not wanting to be around her and it makes me feel extremely guilty but I hate spending time around her because it makes me depressed. I always feel awkward when I’m around her because I feel like we hardly know each other.

I have given into ""letting"" her go to friends' houses, and hangout, with the understanding that she shower immediately when she gets home, and put all clothes worn in the wash.

- She is currently working from home.
- I am employed, but currently not working. I am getting a 50% salary paycheck from my employer, which is a business that is currently closed, due to the virus (I work for a sports event company)

Something as simple as taking a while to respond to a message I sent makes me so scared and sad because I start to believe that they think I am being annoying or clingy, and are ignoring me so that they don’t have to put up with me.
I find it hard to tell when I am doing this and usually when I do, I just dismiss it as being attention seeking (I guess there’s a chance that it is). I’m afraid to talk to these people about it because I’m scared of appearing attention seeking/clingy/annoying(etc), and I’m fairly certain that if I did and they comforted me, it’d only make me more certain that it’s all an act.

I think the worst part for me is how much I like these people and how much I want them to like me. They are so fun to be around and they’re so nice to me. When I become aware of the way I am interpreting their actions I feel so guilty. Sometimes my thoughts cause me to become really avoidant and cold (although I feel I’m relatively good at hiding it). Once or twice somebody has asked if they have done something to upset me or if I am ok. I don’t want to mention it to them because I’m embarrassed of how emotional it makes me and scared that it will change their opinion of me and make them feel like they’ll have to walk on eggshells around me. The few times I have talked to people (usually a close friend or family member who I’m close enough to be confident they’ll be honest with me), they have said the usual re-assuring things which rarely happen and if they do, it’s only for a short while.

I was wondering if anybody feels similar to this?
Also if anybody has some good strategies for recognising these kind of thoughts and feeling more confident in getting rid of them, I’d be really grateful to hear them.",26Apr2020,1
126,"My guy friend of almost 2 years I have feelings for him and liked him and I always thought we had a thing but I was proven wrong because recently I told him I liked him and he told me he only likes me as a friend cuz he isn’t looking for anything rn but then after that he still did some things like act jealous and stuff when I talk about other guys so it’s confusing and I don’t wanna give up because I’ve always had a thing for him and I really thought he was the one for me and still do. 


I also met this other guy who’s good looking and seems nice and I have a thing for and he seems like a good guy and I think I would try dating him but only thing is my heart is still on my guy friend because I don’t wanna give up just in case if something can happen in the future.

129,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I'm not interested in hearing about how I'm ""heartless"" or ""selfish"" because I don't want kids or like babies. I have tried to post this to places where people would understand my perspective but it keep being auto flagged and I'm not sure why. At this point I'm just really desperate to hear someones perspective.

I kind of got lucky and fell into this job since I knew someone who worked at the clinic. I used to like my job despite the whole culture surrounding it. I learnt a lot of things I wouldn't otherwise know, and learning the science behind fertility treatment was fascinating and I learnt how to do ultrasound which I found especially fascinating. I also have a boss who is very understanding of my health issues and I get paid pretty well with hours that are perfect for me and accommodate my hobbies and side business.

I feel like I am no longer learning and I am finding it increasingly difficult to deal with people who are obsessed with pregnancy and babies. I have tried my absolute best to understand this mindset. I have spent hours and hours online going through IVF support groups/blogs/etc, parenting groups/blogs/etc trying my very best to understand this need people feel to have a baby. I simply do not understand it, and the more I think about pregnancy and babies, the more sick I feel. I just hate everything about it. I hate new Mum culture, I hate how entitled some of these people come across as. I simply have no desire to have a baby and can't fathom why anyone would want one or feel as if they need one, and I legitimately just feel sick thinking about it, and even angry sometimes.

Since the state of the world has shifted significantly, we've had a lot of people getting seriously angry at us and showing their true entitled colours. It makes me so angry that people feel as if their ""need"" to have a baby is more important than our staffs safety. To make matters worse, I can't even escape the ""baby fever"" when I'm not with patients, as three of our staff is expecting, one of our staff just had a baby and now it is EVERYWHERE. I can not escape talking and cooing about babies for one second and I can't describe it, but it honestly just makes me feel sick to my stomach. I just do not understand the culture at all. I want to enjoy my youth and be young while I can, while everyone I work with is sucked into this ""wholesome"" culture of white picket fences and having babies. I just do not understand it. I get so jealous when I go to my partners work, and him and his workmates can laugh and swear and drink with each other and have fun. At my workplace, its ""cheeky"" to have a glass of wine and we only talk about peoples new couches and pot plants or whatever other mundane stuff, when we aren't talking about babies.

I just do not fit in, I don't want to fit in, and its starting to get to me. Its more than not fitting in, its feeling actually sick in this work environment. Its getting harder to pretend that I like babies or don't find the lifestyle my coworkers have to be a bit sad. I am not at work at the moment, but I am going back soon and I am dreading it. I don't know how much longer I can keep up the act, I think they're already seeing through it. I would be looking for a new job if anywhere was hiring at the moment, and I feel awful for feeling this way since I should probably be grateful not only to have a job still, but to have paid leave while we aren't operating.

I'm not sure that any of the skills I have learned here would even transfer to any other industry. I have considered somewhere like Family Planning, but apparently its super competitive to get a job there and they are rarely hiring. I don't know what to do. I don't know how much longer I can suck it up. I don't even think I'd get a good reference for somewhere else at this point since I'm pretty sure my boss can tell that I don't like babies or Mum culture etc and she's probably pretty offended about that now that she is pregnant.

I don't know if the good about my job outweighs the bad anymore. I don't know if I can hack feeling physically sick over all the baby fever. I feel guilty as I am obviously not the right person to care for these people as I don't understand their wishes and desires, even though I have truly tried my best to understand their mindset. I just have no idea where to go from here.",26Apr2020,1

I'm pretty damn good at writing these kinds of papers (every one I've turned in on time has always been 90 or better), but I'm tired of doing them to prove that I know how to do a research paper when I already know how to do it, and it's completely unmotivated me from doing any work whatsoever.

134,"First of all, as a disclaimer, the age difference is legal in my country.

My boyfriend (18M) and I (16F) have had a long and complicated history. We began as friends with benefits around a year ago and then he got back with an ex so we remained friends for awhile. We’ve been dating for six weeks. During that time we’ve realized how meaningful and deep our connection is and how compatible we really are with each other. I’ve always been in love with him. 

However, I did something while he was in his separate relationship that was possibly the worst judgement call ever. I slept with his friend (18M) who we’ll call Dan who has had a brief history of trying to pursue me in the past. Dan has also made up lies about me when I previously rejected his advances(saying I slept with people that I didn’t etc). Dan ended up making me uncomfortable, so I haven’t seen him in about four months and we only met up around twice or three times total. I also made Dan promise to keep this between us, but I don’t have a lot of trust in him. 

Last night my boyfriend asked me if I had slept with anyone he knew and I told him no. He made me promise, which I did, but now it’s beginning to take a toll on me because I know how much he has been hurt in past relationships and I have finally gained his trust, which is hard to do. 

Our relationship is still new and I have no idea if he still talks to Dan because Dan now goes to school in a different city and is stuck there because of quarantine. If I were to just keep quiet about it, there’s a chance my boyfriend could never find out, but it gives me a great deal of anxiety thinking he might.

So help me out reddit: Do I....

A. tell my boyfriend right now and lose the wonderful new relationship we have 

B. tell him sometime in the future when our bond has maybe strengthened enough that he would be more forgiving 

C. say nothing and make up a story if he finds out (ie Dan and I saw a movie together and he tried to make advances on me which I rejected, which is actually true just not the whole story)

Thankfully we found them and got them to a hospital and they have since made a full recovery and is in a much better mental space.

139,"Im a senior in college and I am part of a college skateboarding club/community. I was arrested a few months back for skating on my campus. There is a particular officer who constantly harasses me and my club. He has threatened to assult me on numerous occasions and he purposely leaves his body cam off when he's on patrol (bike cop) he arrested me for me refusing to ID myself when he claimed he saw me skating when he didnt. He put me in handcuffs and put a pepper spray in my face when i wasnt even resisting, i asked him why he was behaving so aggressively and he told me he was going to smash my face into the pavement if i didnt follow his orders. I filed a complaint and his dept got back to me and told me he is being reprimanded for his behavior. 

But then as his superior officer was talking to me on the phone instead of simply apologizing for this officer's behavior he basically told me if it was him he would of charged me with more crimes and that it was my fault for this officer behaving with that level of agression. I never heard such a dismissive thingbin my entire life.

Keep in mind i didnt curse at this officer or threaten him in anyway all i did was asking him why he was behaving so aggressively. Im currently going to therapy due to the trauma this officer caused me. This happened to me 3 months ago and i still relive the trauma from it everyday. I have reoccurring nightmares of this officer and i have be experiencing reoccurring panic attacks as well. 

What else can i do about this situation? I asked his superiors why they have continued to allow this officer to keep his body cam off and they started acting incredibly defensive when i kept asking that question.

147,"I had just been in a situation where this girl and I were “talking”, which means basically dating without the title. I was ready to make it official when we could go on our next date together, cause we had only been on one “real” date previously and wanted to do it in person. The first time we linked up I thought we both had a fun time and that was our first date, then after that it had always been her, myself, and her best friend and maybe another person. I don’t consider that a date, but after our first date we hung out like that a few times, and had only been snapchatting for a few weeks leading up to the point/event I’m going to tell you. There are too many subtle details to mention, but that’s the gist of the picture. 
(From talking time her friend I realized the reason she was always there was because the girl didn’t like driving to my city by herself, which I understand and don’t hold against her at all. Regardless, we never got that second real date)

She initiated the “talking stage” and was pretty flirtatious and it was reciprocated but after a while she started pulling back, so I thought I would pull back a little bit too to see if she would put in more effort, but she didn’t, which led me to ending us being together that way.

I cut things off with a girl where I felt she was losing interest, and this I was too, basically put all my emotional cards on the table, while she basically said, “yeah, I pretty much agree” to the reasons as to why we should stop “talking”.

This happened a couple weeks ago, and reflecting on that I regret showing all my emotional cards and wonder why I might not have been good enough.

I probably didn’t explain this the best way possible, but anyone who could lend me emotional, psychological, or any other type of advice is welcomed with open arms.

I went over today to hang out, as I sometimes do. We ended up smoking weed and drank alcohol as well (i hardly ever do this but just felt like joining in today)
Well a movie was playing and my brother and I were on the couch together. We both felt tired and I was giving him a head massage, normal behavior. 
But then he started to get touchy-feely. It escalated and he had me go in his bed with him. I was kind of dissociated and in denial, like ""this isn't weird, nothing is wrong"". But he ended up touching me- my stomach, butt, breast. He was also trying to move my hand to his crotch, and I was tired so I was okay eith him moving my hand but then I felt what I was touching and I am quite sure it was his genitals. I was kind of telling him to stop but trying to play it cool, like maybe he doesn't mean it, or maybe I'm just imagining it, or something. 
But after I directly told him ""stop that"" or something along those lines he did and apologized. He apologized later on too, and I think he genuinely felt guilty. I said whatever, its okay

154,"Help, I think I am completely loosing interest in women (I am a straight male late 20s)

After dating, having long term relationships and casual Tinder hookups, I have  made a conclusion that women do not improve my life in any meaningful  way. I realized that there is no reason I want to be with a girl except  to have sex.  
But what is sex anyway? You do cardio for 5 minutes just  to get 10 seconds of pleasure?!? I don't think it's worth it anymore,  there are better things to do.

I have felt more lonely while in  relationships than when I am single nowadays. I have seen all of my LTRs  turn into dead bedrooms as time goes by. I am not a bad person and I  have never (physically or emotionally) abused any girlfriend I had... or  any friend that I have/had. So it's not me.

It feels like my  expectations of women are proven to be wrong every time, and this time I  had enough. Is it really too much to expect girls not to get fat once  you get into relationship? Or expect them to talk nice with you and just  spend time together? If feels like they are so afraid to show their  cute and feminine side, as if I will start smashing them in the face  like a deadbeat drunk husband if they show any sign of weakness.  
The  worst is when eventually you start getting lectured on how to live your  life - goddamit girl, I have an apartment fully paid off, a fancy car and a job  that pays $75000 a year, no debts or loans and enough savings to survive  unemployed for several years - DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW A LITTLE BIT  ABOUT HOW TO LIVE MY FUCKING LIFE???  
Maybe it's my always relaxed and  non-stressed vibe that puts them off? Sometimes I sit in my balcony  drinking beer and smiling just because I am happy with the way  everything is. Or just go for a random 2 hour walk around the city - see  what's happening and maybe meet some old friends, have a chat.

No, I am not gay, I watched a few gay p0nr videos - just makes me uncomfortable and I can't watch more than a few minutes of it.

Then exams cane through

I am currently attending a fairly prestigious school where my father graduated. My entire life he has pushed me toward this school (not aggressively or anything malicious in nature he just really wanted me to go). In high school I knew I wouldn’t fit in as it was a military academy and i assumes our ethos’ wouldn’t line up in a fitting way. 

Anyways I told my father I would go if I got accepted, which I assumed I wouldn’t as I said before it is highly competitive. To my surprise I was accepted and have been there for the past two years. During that time a close family member of mine was kicked out during my freshman year. That combined with the pressures from being a varsity athlete and the trying academics pushed me into a depressed and anxious state of mind which I am still trying to climb out of. My grades dropped and I alienated the people around me. I started cutting again and went through several therapists. Eventually I came around again and stopped hurting myself and befriended a few people. 

I just don’t know whether I should push through this for a few more years and complete my obligatory service after graduation. At times I feel like I can’t trust myself and if I decide to leave I’ll just be putting more pressure on my family. 

If I stay I might be miserable but I’ll have a diploma from a solid school, a stable job, and good life experience that can be transferable to any path.

161,"Me and my partners have been looking for land/loans to create our dream of owning a self-sufficient homestead. Due to the Covid crisis I've been out of work, one is unemployed too, and the other is disabled but receives guaranteed income because of that, but not much. Our credit is near perfect and have never been late on any payments. We know the area we want to move to and have found many possible properties but no one is willing to give us a loan to buy the land. Their reasons being that the land needs a 'move in ready' home aka electricity and running water. Personally I don't care about those, have lived without them and are willing to again. Another reason is that I need to be currently employed (how the hell am I supposed to do that with the Covid crisis?). We don't get into things we can't handle and have done a lot of calculations and budgeting and we'd be able to handle monthly payment with minimal issues. I mean we're still paying rent.

163,"Hi all,

My mom tested positive for Coronavirus in California. She's been sick apparently for the last 5 days, and had difficulty breathing today. Luckily I am a short flight away and can basically leave within a day's notice. The problem is that she lives with my dad and younger brother, who haven't gotten tested yet, but potentially got infected. They haven't shown any symptoms, but I understand symptoms can show up after like a week.

I want to wait for my dad and brother to get tested first, and if they are negative, I will fly back.

My question is: Should I fly back home to support my family right now? If my dad and brother test positive, when should be an appropriate time to fly back?",26Apr2020,1

I just feel so bad I don’t understand really where this came from or what to do about it I’m great with kids and all my teachers would call me outspoken when it came to important presentations.

I already knew he was and it never bothered me but I couldn’t believe my ears, seems like he’s actively looking to cheat on me and I’m absolutely heart broken at this point. He said he doesn’t message anyone and that he only receives messages.

He royally pissed me off about ago, even though what he did wasn't even a big deal. I know I was blowing the scenario out of proportion. But he's crossed my mind a few times every day since then, and it's usually accompanied by anger.

Late last night, I received an email saying from a file-sharing service called “SendSpace” . The email said that I had successfully uploaded a file, and along with that was an absolutely massive list of email accounts that the download link had been sent to.

I was in shock when I read this. I am in no way affiliated with “SendSpace”, and can only assume that my email account was compromised and used to sign up for SendSpace for the purpose of spamming others.

One of the recipients of that email responded to me asking what I had sent them. I simply apologized and said that my email had been used to spam a large group of people.

171,"So we aren’t friends anymore I ended it like 5 weeks ago but texted him to catch up on things. And he’s been dry but responsive. I didn’t think there was anything really bad. But I knew something was off. We’ve been friends for 11 months I know the vibes he gives out and when it’s off. Anyways I texted him today and he was being somewhat chatty with me and not. The other day I todo him that if anything is wrong I’m here for him cuz I knew he wasn’t himself. And he just said “Aight see ya” like what??? Then today I told him the thought I kept having about him. I told him that I get sad when I think of him as a senior and leaving and it makes me want to hug him. And he said “Lmao bruh okay” the fact he pushed it away. I think that was his way of trying to distance himself and from being sentimental with me. For idk why. Because I’m cool with it. We’ve been friends for almost a year. 
And I was texting him joking that I bought him a $100 pair of ear buds. And he kept saying I didn’t. 
And then I said “I’m serious. I bought them for you bro” and he said back “Well i dont want them” 
I was taken aback. like wow that’s how he would really be?
And I said “Wow. Wow...I see how it is” and he said “Yep. I already have mine. And ik you didn’t buy them.” And I said “How do you know. I could I have it right next to me rn. Maybe I wanted to buy you a pair. 🤭”

177,"First I would like to state that I am fourteen years old and my dad is mid-fifties, and that this is the first time we've ever gotten physical.

(I'm writing this on a random account that I haven't used in months, I might eventually delete this account idk.)

So basically what happened was that I was going to get a shower at around 23:30-ish-pm, and opposite the bathroom door was the staircase and opposite that was the back-garden door, I noticed it was still open and that my mum and dad were still outside (they had been outside damn near 10 hours, despite quarintine) so I went downstairs to try and get them back in since it was late. They had both been drinking, as per, so it took some convincing to get Mum inside but she eventually went to bed. But Dear Old Dad was still sitting in one of the outside chairs.

So I asked him to go back in, he didn't, I tried again. He did not listen. This went back and forth before he started to threaten me, he does this but it never actually goes anywhere. I picked one of the candles and blew it out, wax got all over my face. I told my sister to grab one of the other candles (she's 11)  and to put it inside. My dad threatened something vague to me if she didn't put it down, she did put it down and then I picked it up again and went to put it inside despite him saying he was gonna beat me or some shit if I did, but he never actually does anything so I thought it wouldn't go anywhere.

I got inside and put the candle down on the sideboard and then as soon as I turn around I see him with a furious look on his face, I thought I was just gonna get chewed out but then he grabbed my throat and I kicked him into this corner shelf-surface-thing (I don't know what it's called) but he got up again and grabbed my arms but then I kicked him again and he said ""Are you trying to fight me?"" like he didn't just grab my fucking throat. I'm not entirely sure what happens next, it's all a blur,  but he threw me into the hallway cupboard door and I was on the floor and his hand was on my ankle but then I broke free, we have a wine-cooler thing in the hallway so I reached in and grabbed a small bottle of whatever and held it behind my head and I had my other arm stretched out in front of me to hold him off.

My sister started screaming and my dad just stood there, not moving, he then said ""Do it. Hit me with it."" or something, and I wasn't going to actually do it, I was just holding it so he would back down, then I started crying and my sister started crying. My dad went over to try and comfort my sister (????) but she shoved him off and she ran up to me and hugged me. I hugged her back and glared at my dad from over her shoulder, he was just standing there. When I gathered that he wasn't going to try anything further I dropped the bottle back into the cooler.

At that moment my Mum walked downstairs complaining about the racket and when she asked she only listened to my dad. And seemed to completely gloss over the fact that I said he grabbed my fucking throat. My dad tried to defend that ""I only grabbed the collar."" like that's any better. I remember my sister trying to defend me but my mum started screaming at me because she thought I was going to hit my dad over the head with a bottle. 

Then they went out into the garden again and me and my sister escaped to her room -where I was hiding for the next five-ish hours.

I had my shower eventually and then went back into my own room and tried to sleep and failed. I'm writing this after I gave up trying to sleep. I also remember throwing a candle at my dad and missing but I forgot to mention that earlier.

(I apologise for any grammar or spelling mistakes, I still haven't fully recovered from the adrenaline rush.)

Maybe the most fucked up thing about this is that I had to use my self defence techniques on the person who taught me them.

TL;DR got into a fist-fight with my dad over a candle and I don't know what to fucking do.

(Yes, I did ask help from friends, but they're all my age and so that went nowhere and quarintine is a thing so I couldn't just run and stay at a friends or something.)

Any advice is greatly appreciated!! :)",26Apr2020,1

He is severely depressed, and suicidal. His family is abusive, from what I've been told, and no matter how much I try to get the authorities involved, it never works out. He attends therapy (which doesn't help) and has taken medication (that also doesn't help.) I've had to talk him down from suicide multiple times.

He also acts incredibly inappropriate to the point it gets uncomfortable. Not towards me, but he talks a lot about pornography, no matter how much I express my discomfort and ask him to stop.

I need to get myself out of this relationship. It's too emotionally straining and taxing and things have been rough even before this. I do not have the capacity to deal with this.

I guess I just don’t know what’s best to do because I don’t want them to split and I don’t want to choose a side since I still live with them. Even if I wasn’t, I don’t want to pick a side. Any advice on this would be helpful.

202,"I made a post earlier about this. Here is that post.

 ""I very knew to reddit as this is my second post and I am on mobile So sorry for any grammar mistakes. This post isn't as serious as other posts here. I'm young. 13yr male. And I recently have gone through this breakup. the girl I was with and I still like each other but her father disapproves of me. She was grounded and her dad took her phone and went through our texts. We were talking sexually calling each other sexy,daddy/mama, etc. He said that I was taking advantage of his daughter and that really hurt. I've been with this girl for only 2 months but she was everything I've ever wanted in a girl. She is very funny, cute, sweet, kind heart,etc. She was everything I ever wanted she was way out of my league. She was in 8th grade before the quarantine and I was in 7th so we were already sad about how she would be in high school while I would still be in middle school. Her father recently texted me saying that I am no longer able to contact his daughter or he will contact the police for harassment. I know this is just to intimidate me but it still had me shook and I felt I would never get to talk to her again.""

I've decided I want to text her but I'm not sure if I should. I need to know if you think everything will be ok if I text her I don't think her dad will contact the police but if he does do you think I will get into any trouble. Me and the girl's feelings are mutual we both like each other and neither one of us were uncomfortable when we were having sexual conversations. I know harassment laws are different in different parts of the world so for reference I live in the united states. I feel like this is a dumb question but Do you think it would be harassment. I think its bull about the harassment but I want to be sure I won't get into trouble. Even if it isn't harassment then do you think I should text her.

204,"I [16F] have had what I think is nerve pain since I was in 7th grade. Now, I'm nearing the end of my sophomore year in high school, and here we are.

Back in 7th grade, when I told people about my pain, they all told me that it was growing pains, etc. Well, I noticed that 1.) I wasn't growing at all, and 2.) it wasn't going away.

My pain is everywhere. Most of the time (now anyways, not before), my pain is in my chest, centered on my ribs, in what I assume are the nerves of my arms, and currently in my right food. They are splitting pains that can last for about 1 second to 1 and a half minutes (unless is throbbing nerve pain. That's different). I get them all throughout my day, almost every day (if there's a day where I don't have pains, then it's rare), and they come and go. When I say that my pain now is not nearly the worst it's ever been, I mean.

Before, complete sides of my body were going numb. That only happened once, both sides on the same day (this was 2018). When this happened, it was like my body was split right down the middle. The left half of me split into fiery nerve pains first, then that part of me went completely numb. Right after my left side was no longer numb, the right side of me did the exact same thing. The pain lasted for maybe 2 minutes and the numbness around 15 before completely going away.

My dad is epileptic, but I have never had a seizure to my knowledge. Currently, like I said, my pains are mostly in my chest, ribs, right foot, and arms. My chest pains are sometimes right where I imagine my heart is.

My mom knows, but I've convinced her that it's nothing. Because of this, my pain tolerance is pretty high, and I can hide it. But it's really starting to wear on me. I'm tired all of the time, I never slept well to begin with, my diet isn't as good as it should be, etc. When I was in 8th grade, I told my primary doctor. She ran an EKG, but nothing showed up. I was embarrassed and didn't say anything about it again. When my family switched to a family practice doctor, I told her about my pain. She smiled, laughed, and said, ""I can't imagine why you'd be having these pains."" and left it at that. I don't really show others that I'm in pain, but I can always feel it. After my family practice doctor did this, I stepped talking about it once again.

Recently they've been getting worse, and I really want to know what the deal is. What do you think it is/what do you think I should do?",26Apr2020,1

Much like in my first relationship, I get so sad being alone. I feel like it’s even worse now, but that may just be because I don’t spend as much time with this guy as I did my ex.

I literally don’t know how to be alone. I don’t function. I just spend the whole time waiting to see him again. I feel sad when I’m alone and I can’t snap out of it.

I just want to have him all to myself every second of the day. I feel so cut because he’s going out tonight and I haven’t seen him for a couple days. I pretend I’m ok with it but it makes me really sad, maybe I should express that but then I feel I come off clingy so I just suffer in silence

214,"Hello, sorry I’m new to this sub. I’m sorry it’s a bit long I’m just so lost and really hurt right now.

I feel like I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place and need advice. I met my best friend in primary school, we’ve been friends for 13 years and are now in our 20s. We’ll call her Mina (not her real name). 

Mina’s usually pretty bad at replying to messages, typically taking about a week to reply. Mina also has a bit of a habit of ignoring all of her friends when she gets into a relationship - and no, not just because it’s new. She’s been in several different longish (6months - 2 year) relationships since high school and every time she straight up ignores messages and cancels on any plans. Until recently she’d been single for about a year and a half. 

During one of Mina’s single periods, I asked her to be my Maid of Honour and she accepted and told me to always come to her to talk about the wedding. I didn’t take her up on that often, and I’d always revert the conversation back to her to ensure I wasn’t being a bridezilla or even just generally selfish. 

Recently, Mina got into a relationship and already the cold shoulder has started. What used to be a week between replies is now at least a month and the conversation lasts for about 2-5 small talk messages before it just ends - no goodbye or close out, just no response. Shes not currently working due to the covid restrictions. She’s always active on Facebook, she looks at my snapchats and group messages but she doesn’t read or reply to our private messages. Since getting into the relationship, she’s also been a bit... meaner? Criticising my makeup openly at parties (before covid), semi-jokingly calling me a bridezilla. She came over to celebrate my birthday in what was supposed to be a girl’s night before covid restrictions happened. She brought her boyfriend, he spent the whole night picking at me for talking and making jokes at my expense and did a few other things I just didn’t think was appropriate or fair as a guest in someone’s house - I’d met him once in passing at this point. At one point I had to excuse myself to stop myself from crying. I mention the boyfriend because it felt like she was fine with letting him be cruel and then leaving well before the intended time because he wanted to. 

I understand that everyone’s busy and got their own lives, but this is a pattern and I’m just wondering if it’s time to cut my losses. I can’t talk to her about my wedding plans, heck, I can’t talk to her at all if she doesn’t reply.

So the advice I need is: At what point do you decide a friendship isn’t worth the history anymore? I’m also (and I know this probably sounds selfish) worried about the implications of cutting her out of my wedding party. I’d always wanted to be there, she’s my closest friend when she’s not in a relationship but I can’t expect her to be single for the rest of her life.",26Apr2020,1
215,"So I need advice,  I fell in love with a woman I know I shouldn't have.  We met online, and have never met in person.  She has 3 kids and lives with baby daddy, and we live 8 hours apart.  We had started out as just platonic friend online with no intentions on anything other. But both of us has been put through hell with our relationships, and we're there for each other. We ended up both falling for each other and planning on meeting face to face to see if what we have is true and pure love. We've been going back and forth trying to figure out if I would move there or her here with me. The big dilemma there has been that I have a great job here that I'm already a good bit into a retirement plan,  and her side is she has the 3 kids that baby daddy surely would not let her leave the state with. Now we've learned that she's pregnant by him again and is now questioning what she wants to do. She's in between staying with him for the baby and kids sake, or to ditch him and be with me. For reference, he's a lying, cheating, mentally abusive ass. He slept with her best friend and after she found out, he continued to do it and flaunted it. Bad thing is this issint the first time something like this has happened in our possible relationship. Now I don't mind raising her kids as my own,  but I am a bit upset that she allowed herself to get pregnant again when we were still trying to work out a future plan. 

 So my questions are: 
Am a dumbass for still wanting to be with her?
If she decides to get rid of him,  should I pack my stuff,  quit my job and go be with her? Or make her move to me? 
Should I just give up on her completely even though it'll crush both of us emotionally?

Like I’m literally always there for her. Then today she was fine at the beginning and then I sent her a love post on Instagram she’s like I don’t care. And then I messaged her a few times to see if she was okay she never answered. I replied to something on her snap later on saying “yay❤️” and she’s like omg can you leave me alone seriously you’re bothering me and stuff. I’m like k sorry. I don’t talk to her for a few hours until I got off work I sent her a snap saying I’m off hope you’re okay❤️ and she’s like fuck off and we argued a bit.

219,So about a month ago my brother got a girlfriend. I was pretty chill about it didn’t really care much as long as I’m not affected. My mum didn’t like it and all she can talk about to me is his girlfriend and how she thinks they aren’t ready and I don’t wanna hear others stress put on me since my mums problems are always put on me and no one else then I’m treated unfairly. Ever since they started dating he has been saying extremely rude things and trying to change how we run the house saying “knock on the door before you come in that’s the new rule in the house” I said fair enough we are pretty chill in our house with that stuff but I thought yeah I don’t mind that rule. I’m the only one that follows it he doesn’t knock on my door and when he didn’t I said aren’t u meant to knock then later on he knocked and just opened the door without me saying so. And now it’s just getting worse that was the smallest stuff. He is always picking fights with me calling me immature and shit. I was telling my mum how my friend has corona and how he got it and he turns around and says well don’t hang around him then simple solution. I said what do you mean I’m just telling mum about it who ever said I was hanging out with his that’s stupid. He said well your stupid enough to do it. So I said when and he was like when what and I said when did I ask. And whenever he starts something with me I say that then ignore him or keep saying it over and over to shut him down. But he has been getting even more mad back stabbing me and talking so much shit behind my back and to me. He bullied me when I got a disease a few years ago that made me permanently sick and that scarred me and when I said your a bully u bullied me about my disease and your still going on about how mature you are just stop leave me alone. He said i am full of shit and just lying to make him look bad. My mum was sitting next to him said nothing then when I said mum knows exactly what I’m talking about and she said fuck all but told me to stop arguing with him. She always pins the argument on me but when my brother isn’t there she says shit about him. I can’t do it anymore we have roughly 15 to 20 arguments a day with him insulting me every time and my mum not doing anything but put me on the spot. When I’m tried to tell her to help me as she knows he is the problem she says some random stuff and blows it off. I’ve been trying to avoid him since just talking to him starts world war 3 and my mum always says “why are you always so mad and upset everyday get out of your shitty moods already. So I’ve just been locked in my room on my computer everyday and she started having a go at me for that. I can’t stand it I really want to have my own space where I don’t need to talk to anyone and just relax but I’m only 15 what do I do?,26Apr2020,1

221,"This is going to be a confusing post so I am going to try not to make it too long. Okay so I am in college and, like everyone else, we are now doing our schooling online. Well in my accounting class we just had a test that started at 6:30 and ended at 9:00 PM (2 hours and 30 minutes total). Right when I opened my test my wifi started acting up and none of the questions were loading and eventually it kicked me out of the test completely. I instantly took pictures of my desktop to prove that it was technical issues and emailed my professor. 10 minutes later she sent me an email with her phone number in it and told me to call her. When I called her she asked if the questions were loading and I said no. She then told me to close out of the test completely and that she would fix my test so it would be open longer for whenever the questions would load. Well 20 minutes pass and the test is not fixed, I could still open the original test, however, the timer was still going down from when I first opened the test so I email her saying that. She emailed me back (7:47) and said that there was nothing she could do for me and that I should just take the test and she would grade my test accordingly.

So I started taking the test with only 1 hour and 13 minutes left on the timer and try to do as many questions as I could. There were two longer free response questions (one question had 4 parts and one question had 8 parts). I half worked not the longer problems and realized that it was taking me too long to do so I moved on to the multiple choice questions. Well time ran out and my test was automatically submitted. Out out of the 45 questions I completed 35 multiple choice questions and half completed the 2 free response questions. 

When I got my grade back she told me I got an 83 because she graded me on the 37 questions the test said I ""worked on"". An 83 is not a bad grade, don't get me wrong, but I just know if I had time to finish the multiple part longer questions I would've gotten a higher grade. I emailed her saying that I did not think the grading of my test was fair because I answered 37/45 questions in 1 hour and 13 minutes while the other students had 2 hours and 30 minutes to complete 45 questions. She never replied to my email so now I do not know what to do. I understand the longer questions were not complete, however, it wasn't due to my poor time management skills, it was because I got cheated on time. 

So my question is what do I do from here? Do I just accept the grade she unfairly gave me? Do I email her again? Or do I take it to the Dean? 

Sorry for the long post but I am completely confused on what to do now. Thanks in advance.",26Apr2020,1
222,"I grew up in a very toxic, abusive household. Growing up, I always heard my mom order my dad to stop calling or keeping in touch with his mom, dad and other relatives. She would fight with him and abuse him verbally and emotionally, would deny going to bed with him until he does so. As a child seeing this, I didn't have as much knowledge as I do now, so it seemed like a reasonable demand from my mother back then which my father failed to follow. Now when I'm 20, I see that it's unacceptable to expect your partner to stop talking to his immediate family members or keeping a check on his parents health. 

From a few years back, she has started severely abusing my father. Everyday I see him, he has some new wounds. He had a black eye one day and bleeding lips and mouth, the other. Everytime he says he'll go to the police, she says that nobody will believe him in this female-centric justice system and threatens to put false allegations on him in court. So, I asked my father to descretley click photos of his wounds and mail it to me. Unfortunately my mother has found out and has only made matters worse for him. 

I feel like I'm reaching my limit of patience towards this abuse and I don't know what to do to make the case stronger and prove that he's been abused.

I started watching the TV show Community and got completely hooked, to the point where I watched the entire show in 5 days. Then I got so upset with not watching it I immediately restarted the show and watched all the way through again. Then I did it a third time. Likewise, I found new music to listen about 3 weeks ago, one album specifically, and I literally only listen to that one album on repeat everyday. I’ve also started getting insanely into biking, and now I bike for almost 3 hours a day. The problem I’m finding is that I only really get enjoyment out of the things that I’m obsessing over. My friends have noticed that I’ve become more disconnected, and it’s because I have no interest in talking to them at all. But it’s strange because I love my friends, more than anything, but it seems as though I am just not as happy when I’m not listening to my music, biking, or watching Community.

After reflecting for a bit about this I realized that I’ve been like this for a long time now. I always find a few things at a time that I get completely captivated in and nothing else really interests me. I’d love to get some advice on how to break this cycle, I want to be productive and social and improving myself rather than finding something new to obsess over in 2 more months.

226,"So I’m going to start by saying that I have been drunk since 4pm, and it’s now almost 1am so there’s a very good chance that none of this means anything. 

I’ve been in a relationship for almost 4 years now with a man who’s older than me. I was just out of high school when we first got together, and while I was legal age I really am not sure I was mature enough at the time to fully understand what I was getting myself into. We took it slow, I guess, but within no more than a year I had moved in with him and given up so much of myself to be what he needed me to be. I wanted to be perfect for him and tried way too hard and somehow just lost myself. He’s never cared nearly as much and acts like he only really me around for sex and to show off the fact he has a younger girlfriend. 

In the last few months, I’ve had the absolute boy of my dreams trying to talk to me. I feel guilty but I honestly find this guy significantly more attractive than my current boyfriend, and while he’s still older than me he’s much closer to my age than my current boyfriend as well. He has a life that I truly would love to be involved in, unlike the life I live now, which is in the shadows of my current boyfriend who really doesn’t even have much to show for his age. He has hobbies and interests. Wants to socialize and go out, which is something my current boyfriend has no interest in. Would be easier to introduce to my friends. I don’t know. 

The relationship I’ve been in for the last few years has been extremely detrimental to my mental health. My boyfriend doesn’t seem to care much about me and treats me like I’m nothing but a job. I’ve considered leaving him for a while now, but have always talked myself out of it. Right now, as I have another guy (who happens to be everything I’d describe as perfect) in my DMs, I feel like I could *potentially* be ready to leave.

229,"One of my friends/roommates (I'll refer to as ""B"") missed the bus one morning and needed to get to work. I don't have a car, so she asked another friend/roommate (I'll refer to as ""C"") to borrow his. C usually doesn't mind lending either of us the car, so long as we put gas in it when we're done with it. So she wakes me up and asks me to drive her to work with C's car because she cannot park there without incurring heavy fees. She offered me $20 to do so. I agreed and drove her to work, then headed straight back. The whole round trip took about an hour and a half. Also, B never said anything about using the money she gave me for gas (KEEP THIS IN MIND).

Later, C was upset that there was no gas put in his car. He understood the deal B and I made that morning, but now believes I am the one responsible for paying for gas, since I was the one who drove it. I strongly disagree with that.

Arguments:

* I argued that I was only doing a job I was hired for, so I can't be responsible.
* He argues against that point, stating that I was still the one who borrowed the car, since I chose to drive it with intent. And based on how much gas was used, he wanted $20 worth it, and since I was paid $20, I should have covered it.
* I counterargued, explaining that I was only a tool used to carry out B's mission and am in no way involved in the unspoken agreement B and C made when he granted her access to his car. She's the one who needed it, therefore she's the one who should pay.
* He counters that by stating that I had full control of the car the whole time. Therefore, I'm responsible to replenishing its gas while I'm using, just like how I'd be responsible if I had wrecked it, not B.

We debated back and forth, but still have not come to an agreement. We discussed this with 2 other friends and both of them so far have agreed with C's points, so now it's 3 against 1 arguing that I have responsibility to pay for gas.

I really don't understand how that makes any sense. Why would I even take the job if I was just going to spend the same $20 I got? And furthermore, how is the deal I made with B even relevant? B never told me to use any portion of that money for gas. I'm fairly certain I'm right about this, but the fact that it's 3 against 1 makes me question my logic. I've known all of them for years and they aren't stupid or unreasonable people, but I don't think they're thinking about this the right way. Or maybe I'm the one not thinking clearly on this.

&amp;#x200B;

Which one of us is right? Who should pay for gas?

&amp;#x200B;

If B is right, please explain how my argument is flawed in detail. If I am right, please explain why and tell me how I can explain it to C and the others in a way they'll understand. This is driving me nuts.",26Apr2020,1
230,"Hello, 

So, basically I am graduating this year at age 18 with a degree in Classics after six years of studying part-time, and I'll be getting a 2:2. If this was truly what my academic ability was I would be satisfied and simply move on with my life, but I know that if I started my degree now I would most likely get a first or at least a 2:1, because I finally worked out how to actually study properly recently and it's like I finally understand where I've been going wrong all these years. I know it might seem weird to have done a degree as a teenager, and honestly, I have no idea why anyone let it happen. I wasn't a genius or anything, I did a few interviews over the phone and sent in an essay and got signed up for a long-distance open degree for free where I got basically no guidance for some reason.  I didn't go to school or do any GCSE's or A levels, so if I can't find a job on the merits of a 2:2 Classics degree (not exactly a hugely valuable asset) I'm basically fucked. I just keep imagining me now with a bunch of A\* results at A level about to go to an amazing uni with everything ahead of me and how much better it would be (I know that may not have happened but still). I chose Classics because 14-year-old me thought Greek/Roman myth was cool. It turns out I do enjoy the subject but looking back probably not the smartest subject to get a free degree in. It's also not just reading Ovid all day long as I imagined at that time. 

The reason I got a 2:2 is pretty damn obvious- teenagers aren't very good at doing degrees, and the combination of not knowing how to study, being too anxious to go to tutorials because of the age difference between me and the other mainly age 40+ students  (so I got no in-person teaching during my entire degree) and walking out of an exam because I got so freaked out. My Dad almost died of cancer last year and that resulted in me getting 1 mark off a fail on my final assignment for the first half of my third year, even though I applied for extenuating circumstances. I can't help but still beat myself up every day for not working harder and squandering this opportunity I was given. I haven't told anyone except my parents about the results I've been getting because it will instantly shatter the image they have of me as someone who is unusually intelligent when actually I'm a perfectly average person who couldn't handle the pressure. 

I constantly wanted to quit but I thought if I could get a first or a 2:1 then it would all be worth it and I would have proved myself, but now every person who looks at my resume will just assume that I flunked my degree for the rest of my life and I can't stand it. 

Should I try to find somewhere to do an MA? My original plan was to go into academics and maybe do a Ph.D. but that would be almost impossible due to my lack of a 2:1. If not, what can I even do with my life from this point except work in a cafe or something? A lot of the jobs I potentially would want to do require completely different qualifications to the one I will have, and I can't do a second degree in a different subject due to my lack of GCSEs and A levels (and I can't get a loan on a second degree). 

Overall I just feel like a failure and like I've already fucked my life up for good.",26Apr2020,1
231,My girlfriend and I's relationship has been rocky since before the whole quarantine and I feel just no affection for her.

I do take responsibility for my actions and I know they're wrong.

233,"Growing up, I’ve always been a jealous type of person, we’ve all been there. Whether it was a friend getting a newer toy or friends spending more time with others. But looking in hindsight, it was so childish and we quickly overcome that stage.

Fast forward to college graduation, I dealt with the paranoia of classmates in my degree finding a better job than me. Many went on to accept an offer with Google, Microsoft, and other Silicon Valley companies. Some even took offers overseas. While my classmates were finding great success, I was stuck with a mediocre offer from a developing company.

For some, I was genuinely happy for. I’ve worked with them and seen their work ethic. I wholeheartedly wish them success. Others... not so much. We’ve all been through the stage of disbelief or feel we’ve been cheated out of. Similar to like: how the hell did he get that?! Someone like him?!

I grew to understand jealousy revolves in our lives constantly and daily. Even the smallest things like how many people liked my post, how many people commented, how did this person get into this school, how did that guy pull that girl? Etc.. the list goes on.

Of course some of those topics don’t apply for certain people and I admire them because they can’t block it out or simply don’t care. However, for me, especially my reputation and image, I really do care about my job and income. I care and jealous that someone who had worse grades than me, did worse in college than me, but somehow got into a better company and makes a higher salary than me.

I’ve learned to never compare yourself to others. You’ll just be digging a hole. Who cares if your friend’s post on Instagram gets 70 more likes than your post? Who cares if the class clown becomes the CEO of a company and makes twice as much as you? I learned everyone is in a different position in this long marathon of life.

235,"Hey guys, I want some advice regarding a friend and our relationship. I’m 15, and live in Texas. He is 17, and lives in Michigan. We’ve been friends for just about 3 years. He has admitted that he is deeply in love with me, and is convinced that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me but I just don’t have the same feeling towards him, and want to tell him but don’t know how to without anything going really wrong. He deserves the truth, and I don’t know how to give it to him.

You see, he is suicidal. He’s tried to kill himself on multiple occasions, and as you can guess, a suicidal person and heartbreak do not mix at all. He’s also been sent to a mental facility several times, and every time he texts or calls me after he gets out he just seems more damaged. 

You may think he’s crazy, or that he’s psychotic. He’s not actually. He’s really sweet and gentle. He always knows how to brighten your day, and put a smile on your face. Overall, he’s a really great person. 

I’m scared that he will hurt himself more, or maybe even succeed in killing himself if I say the wrong thing.  He has prioritized me over everything in his life even though we aren’t dating, and I don’t want to hurt him anymore.

244,"Since my manager left over 6 months ago, I became the most senior receptionist at a medium sized vet hospital, and I began taking charge of things when I saw a need for it. I For 6 months, all of my efforts were ignored, until my boss offered the manager position to the newest person, Anna, who frankly had no idea how a lot of the stuff worked, but she was likable and good with people. She said she couldn't do most of the stuff I was already doing, and arranged for us to split the responsibility and raise, which was nice. We were supposed to do this for one month, and then get the raise (which seems a little odd, but I guess is fine.)

Then COVID hit, and half our best people left, and we were busier but made less because obviously the boarding revenue stopped, and all protocols changed, and everything was an absolute mess. Our jobs became more important than ever, but then we were told by the boss that because of COVID we couldn't get the raise. Although I felt a little unappreciated when after hearing that, everyone got a temporary raise, though not as much as the raise I was expecting. For a while I kept trying to do the job anyway, but it's gotten very difficult.

The extra stuff I do has gotten so much harder. Scheduling is near impossible, and the boss says I am not allowed to work from home and add the hours, so I have to do it while I'm working reception and I'm distracted every 30 seconds, and I am the only one who can correctly do many of the tasks of reception. Anna usually works half the hours I work, but has cut down even more, and is so checked out mentally because of family stuff, even if I leave notes asking her certain things she doesn't do the regular reception stuff. And none of the new people are capable of certain stuff, and with all my other responsibilities, I don't have time to do that much training. People are getting trained wrong, and training other newer people wrong. It's a mess.

The boss is also the head vet, and we really need her for stuff, and she's working insane hours, so I feel bad trying to give back responsibilities, as I'd have to try to teach her too which seems silly. But I feel it's unfair that I'm basically acting as manager, I'm sure my boss doesn't notice it, and I'm not getting paid any extra for it, and I have to try to squeeze it into when I'm supposed to being doing reception things.

Is it proper for me to just keep doing all this management stuff, and all the harder reception stuff, and just be glad I even have a job, even though then I feel like it'll just be taken for granted? How long, as at that rate, I'll probably never get the raise because since everything runs smoothly, my boss won't notice I'm doing it? Or do I give the stuff back to her? Or just do the stuff I'm specifically assigned and let the rest cause issues since it's technically not my responsibility? I feel I have no good options.",26Apr2020,1
246,"Background: I am a nurse but not currently practicing clinically and my partner is a paraplegic as of 2.5 years ago. He works in a motorcycle workshop/dealership in admin/management and was a motorcycle mechanic before his accident. 

Normally, he would travel 2 hours each way on the train to get to work in the city. I, and our housemate who is also a nurse, thought it was unsafe for my partner to continue going to work especially as his shop hasn’t implemented any additional precautions. They have hand sanitiser available however it’s difficult to maintain hand hygiene when you’re constantly touching your wheelchair tyres to move around. 

It’s been probably 3 weeks since he’s been at work and I know he’s really bored at home. I had hoped he would spend this time completing an online course he’s been enrolled in for a while, exercising, maybe some admin work from home, something somewhat productive. He spends most of his time sat in his chair watching YouTube videos then goes back to bed.

Day 11 of being home I was having a very hard time sleeping and for some reason I felt like I would wake up and my dog of 13 years would be dead. This was crazy for me to think because there were no signs of her being unhealthy, just really old. When I woke up in the morning I went downstairs and saw her laying down sleeping and my mom told me that our dog wasn't feeling well. I sat next to her, pet her, and 10 minutes later she stood up and kept stumbling around, and it looked like she was having a stroke or some sort. She then started peeing blood, and that's when I knew my eerie feeling was coming true. We called the vet and my dog was basically dying and bleeding in my arms. When we got to the vet they told us we couldn't come inside.

249,"Hey guys I need some help here. I apologize for the shitty formatting and grammar because I am on mobile, and I am typing this in one go. Here is some backstory so you all have an idea of how my father is like. He left my house when I was 17 (I am 19 now) and went to live with his fiancée. My father did not support me much when he lived with me, and my grandfather bought most of my essentials (food, clothes, etc.) My father was emotionally abusive to me and was physically abusive to my older siblings. But I digress, so here is the actual story. My dad left my brother and I with my older sister and her family who moved back in due to my grandmother in law kicking them out of her house. My grandfather owns the house I’ve lived in for all of my life, and just recently, my sister’s family is moving into their own home. I was on the phone with my dad and he told me he wants to sell the house because my brother and I won’t be able to pay for rent. He told me that I would need to find somewhere to live within a few months. I, ( a full-time community college student which I pay for my tuition and work part-time) would not be able to find living accommodations in my area. I told my father that I go to school full-time and work 30 hours/week to cover tuition costs, he said that it wasn’t his problem. All of my friends attend university and live on campus so that removes my options to move in with them if my dad decides to convince my grandfather to sell the house. I offered my grandfather to pay rent but I would be straining myself dry because I have therapy bills/hospitalization bills and medications to pay for. My grandfather is adamant on not selling the house but my father keeps persisting that he does. I am thinking about getting a second job to help out my grandfather with rent so we can support ourselves until I am financially stable to move out. My brother is living in the same house as my grandfather and I and he is looking for jobs to help on rent. I fear that if my dad manages to convince my grandfather to sell the house, then I would be homeless and unable to pursue my education. My father did not offer me or my brother to stay at his house, (he has a four bedroom house with his fiancée)  and I would be nervous to ask my grandfather to help me live on my own if he does sell the house and live with my father. I would not want to stop attending therapy because of financial constraints( I have MDD, GAD, and ADHD) due to the fact that I may relapse into another bad depressive episode and end back in the hospital. Any advice is appreciated, I am just scared for my future and my father has left me behind because since I work and I’m an adult, I am independent. He fails to recognize that I work more than I am supposed to for college and I have my own bills I have to pay, which my job only leaves me little to spare with any rent money.",26Apr2020,1
250,"So, some back ground/history of why I say I'm lost inside my own mind.

I'm 22, turning 23 later this year.
I was clinically diagnosed with anxiety at the age if 7 and with server depression at 11; which all stemmed from a traumatic experience as a child.
I constantly over think my own situation and abilities to the point to where all I genuinly want to do is sleep, but the only thing keeping me going is my desire to stream for friends so they have some sort of entertainment during this pandemic.

I know that sounds like a ""pity poor me"" story but, please, hear me out.

I get lost inside my own mind because I feel as if I'm constantly fighting a war I cant win, and it's against myself. I have a running dialogue in my head arguing with myself to the point of exhaustion due to the stress I put on myself and it drives me to just lay in bed and do nothing all day.

My friends say I could make it as a streamer and actually be good at it, but that isnt my intention with it. It sounds nice and all, and despite loving it and having a small following outside of my friends; I can see myself doing it...but I have to constantly tell myself that it isnt realistic for me and that it would be semi-fround upon by my family having such a ""low effort job.""

Despite everything I've done to help with my anxiety and depression. Ranging from meds, therapy and counseling, the only thing I cant escape is myself.

I know we are our biggest critics and are hard on ourselves for no apparent reason, but being so motivated to persue something but beating yourself to the point you lost that motivation cant be healthy.

Is there anything someone has done that has broken the cycle before? Is there an effective way to adjust your mentality and not have it come speeding back to bite you?",26Apr2020,1
251,"Hi,

I'm stuck in a frustrating situation. Let me preface this a bit:  


I live in a VERY SMALL two-dio styled apartment (almost like a dorm to be honest) designed for university students. My roommate is awfully messy, leaves spilled sauce to dry on the floors, food bits etc, never wipes down the kitchen top, and leaves dried urine on the toilet. In general, he's just a messy person. My prior roommate to this was the same, but I enabled the behaviour by continuously cleaning fortnightly as usual and doing it all on my own (vacuum, mop, bathroom shower, sink and toilet). So that roommate never helped me. I promised when the new roommate arrives (6 months into my lease, leaving me with 6 months of living with roommate #2) that I'd refuse to be the only one cleaning, and made this very clear with the new roommate that cleaning the shared area was a job we'd both have to do. He never actually agreed to it, and instead just kind of mumbled and avoided talking about it (red flag for me).

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 2 months of him living here, I've refused to clean until he offers to help and do half of it at the same time (he does floors and i do bathroom, vice versa, was my offer). So, this place has not been cleaned in 2 months and is a disgusting state. I HATE living in this absolute dump and am extremely tempted to cave in and just clean the whole place as the floors are just disgusting, and the bathroom is covered in mould (the shower and sink are awful). I've asked him multiple times if he will help me clean and re-offered the split sharing of the tasks, and he avoids saying yes or no and instead dodges the question. Two days ago, I'd had enough and asked him again but said to give me a straight answer. He brushed me off and said ""I can't do it today"" and slammed his bedroom door in my face and hid in his room. So at this point I thought fuck it, I called the landlord and said my roommate refuses to clean and this place is a disgusting mess. He said call the building management team (landlord is a representative for an apartment complex company) and they will try and resolve. After we discussed, they sent him a warning email which said the place needs to be cleaned or he will breach his agreement etc. I then asked him again if he will help me clean, and his response was ""tomorrow"" (this was yesterday).

252,"It’s been my mom, brother and I for a while, my dad is out of the country and I 23(F) don’t rlly talk to him much. But anyways it was the three of us one thanksgiving and my bf and I at the time decided we wanted to cook everyone a thanksgiving feast at my moms house. She had a unfounded disdain for him for really no good reason, besides vanity and the fact that he decided not to go to college. My bf at the time was a short king ok and maybe not attractive in some people’s eyes (definitely not in my moms) so she was always super mean and rude to him. And on thanksgiving day when we were cooking, she yelled at him for no reason, “get out of my house I don’t want you here.” Anyways this was a while ago and I’m not with him anymore but I find it absolutely horrible that she thought/thinks it’s okay to treat people like that based on physical qualities...it just makes me sad. She is very overbearing, constantly criticizing, like she’s said to me out of nowhere “oh you’re pretty but you have a bad personality.” I still live at home with her because I am finishing up a degree now. She provides me a great and comfortable life and helps out with college and I feel very grateful, however, it’s seems unfair that I have to put up with the constant criticism. When I stand up for myself when she berates me, I often feel guilty for telling her to stop or copping an attitude because she’s constantly making me feel like nothing I do is good enough, even though I am working hard to finish my degree and support myself by working as a tutor at the school. Anyways she constantly dating these wack men...usually pretty wealthy and also scummy. She’s told me about her most recent and how he was paying for some girls gym membership and that he was a major cheater in previous relationships like his kids mom only communicates with him by email. This man is a millionaire and definitely talks like one saying things like “we need poor people” ...”the Mexicans shouldn’t celebrate Mother’s Day because they are from Mexico” so I’m kinda standoffish towards him but not rude just honestly something just doesn’t sit well with me about the guy. So she expects me to kiss his ass pretty much just like she does, because he has a few clams. So once he shows up and it’s me and my bro and he says hi to my brother but doesn’t acknowledge me, they chat, I don’t care but I go talk to my mom and she’s like why didn’t you say hi to him...when he pretty much ignored me. I resent it because 1. He’s a douche and probably cheating on her, my least favorite guy she’s been with 2. respect doesn’t go both ways in terms of my mom and I, she’s a complete bitch to my partners yet expects me to kiss this d-bags ass. I just hate acting nice to people who don’t deserve it, I’m not gonna be outright rude to him but I really don’t look forward to spending time with him. Essentially I don’t know how to not come off as disrespectful when I’m standing up for myself or my beliefs.",26Apr2020,1

I had roommates, I moved out February (2020) when my lease ends this coming June.  
 Each roommate had a responsiblity. Mine was electric in my name and I was in charge of it. I never missed a payment and nothing was ever late.

This company has always been difficult. In December I was charged 3 times for a bill electronically. The company said it was my fault and there nothing they could do but contact my bank. Even though I only paid once.  My bank said to contact them. It was a mess. So the bank filed a fraud report and gave me the money back so my account was not negative $500. But a cerdit remained on my electric website. I was told to go w it. So I did 

Mid Febuary i called and canceled my electric and my roommates made a new account. I was told I was suppose to get my secuity deposit back on of March 2nd...but i was going to get it.  it never came. After weeks of calling everyone i was told to, it was being mailed, i will receive it, etc. 

Today I got my mail thinking i got it, but i got a letter from a debit collector. I owe the company $416 dollars apperently. I have no idea why, or i was never told this. I do not know what to do or how to handle this. I have all my statements of the money I've paid.

255,"Sorry for any poor formatting, I’m on mobile.

I’ve lived in this house for just over a year now, all has generally been pretty good with the exception of one of my neighbours.
This guy lives with his mother and some other siblings, doesn’t work and spends his whole days at home. I’ve also caught this guy going through our mailbox because supposedly he was looking for mail that was delivered to the wrong address (I’ve never found their mail in our mailbox) and have since put a padlock on the mailbox door.

When we first moved in everything was fine. My dog has always been fairly protective of his yard, incredibly sweet once you get to know him but other dogs and people coming up close to the fence (namely the mailman and delivery drivers) have always attracted a fair bit of barking.
This has never really been a big problem, and discussion with some of the other neighbours has led to them meeting him and getting past all the aggression and drama.
This guy, however just refuses to build any kind of bridge with my dog, the rest of his family is fine with him but it’s gotten to a point where he will go out of his way to agitate the dog: barking back, throwing punches at the air in front of him and now he’s started trying to pelt rocks through the metal wire fence that separates the properties.

My dog will now just bark at their house when nobody is home because he knows that he’s there.

I’m at my wits end, I’ve tried endlessly to get this guy to stop but he won’t even look me in the eye when I try to discuss it with him.

I’m considering setting up security cameras to try and deter him or catch him doing it so I can take it to the authorities but I’m not even sure if they can do anything?

tl;dr: neighbour has been throwing rocks at my dog in an effort to hurt/agitate him and won’t talk to me about it. What can I do?",26Apr2020,1
256,"Over the last three days I've been having a real hard time staying focused. Every day I've woken up and felt energized to do multiple things and I'll make a list in my head or in my notepad. After which I proceed to start on the first task, but in the middle of that task I become overwhelmed and suddenly find that I've moved into a different task without even really processing it.

For instances I wanted to make a infographic for a project I had in mind and I started it half way. Next thing I knew I was working on a grocery list and considering if I should eat now or later. It almost always feels like I've changed topics without noticing and it's quite frightening. 

I had this happen to me throughout college when I was attempting to balance multiple assignments. I never had an occurrence where I don't complete what I have organized in my head. It just becomes completed in almost a random order which can be days or weeks depends on the timeline.

It's frustrating to me and ends up overwhelming me the longer the task is put off or stalled. I'm looking for advice to organize my thoughts better and to stay focused on my task.

262,"Hello, first time posting in this thread. I have been dealing with a lot of stress related to how I view myself lately. I am 21 and I have struggled with bad body image my whole life especially with my weight. When I was younger (age about 12-17) I had an extremely hard time coping with my anxiety and depression and would eat a lot to feel better. Now I’m slightly older I have more confidence and have learned how to cope better, but it is not great. I lost just about 50 lb (175 ish down to 127 I am 5’5 so this is currently right in the middle of what is healthy but I was pretty overweight before) learned how to style myself more and what looks good on me, changed my hair, and have for sure improved. But it’s just not good enough. I’ve been bad about weighing myself at least 5 times a day and I’m extremely scared of gaining back what I worked hard to loose. I just look at myself in the mirror and just hate everything. I struggle and still see myself as a bigger person than I am. I feel like I look like Im still extremely overweight and didn’t lose anything. For those of you who have learned to love yourself more how did you do it? How do I stop being so hard on myself? Do other people feel the same way about disliking themselves this much or is it abnormal. Thank you for any advice with this :)",26Apr2020,1
263,"To start, my mom and aunt absolutely HATE each other for good reason (both have a lot problems that neither want to fix). It got much worse when I was around 1 1/2-2, because my aunt's husband left her for my mom. My mom and step dad swear up and down that they meant no harm to my aunt, but I can see how my aunt took this all very badly because wow that is a really shitty situation to be put in. On top of all of that, my step dad had a kid with my aunt. So I have a cousin who is also my step sister. She's only one year younger than me.

We were able to see each other a bit when we were younger. I didn't really understand the situation entirely when I was young, but I was just happy to have another girl my age to hang out with since I grew up with brothers. Then, we suddenly just weren't allowed to see each other really for a long time.

We reconnected a bit, but then a lot of shit went down at home. Turns out my eldest brother was working for my aunt's boyfriend at a company (yes I am aware of how much this sounds like a shitty b movie plot line) and everyone in my house knew except my mom. Things blew up, life was even more miserable at my house for a WHILE.

That was years ago and now I am in college in another state. In my Spanish class, we were doing a  unit on family and I never realized how sad and unhappy my family was until I had a room of 20+ people singing their praises about how close and connected their families are (and I know people can lie about that, not everything is as it seems from the outside, but it still made me realize how unhappy I was.) I don't have a lot of family members I trust and want to be around other than maybe my brothers, and even then, the oldest isn't the most trustworthy, but still nice to be around.

I want to try to reconnect with my cousin, but I'm not entirely sure how to go about it. I don't want either of our parents to be involved, I don't like my aunt because she's done some really messed up things that have directly affected me and caused complete chaos in my house, and my cousin doesn't like my mom and step dad for VERY obvious reasons (plus some, my parents are far from saints).

I'm hoping that by this time next year I will have a license and my own car so I can visit her without needing help from anyone (and that hopefully the pandemic has completely died down). But rn, I don't know how to start all of this. I've never really reached out to any family members because I just don't like most of my family, but I genuinely want to have some sort of relative I can be around.

Any advice is appreciated.",26Apr2020,1
264,"Before I begin, I know there are a lot of people who don't believe in ghosts or the supernatural in general so this post already seems crazy. Believe me, I'm a 100% skeptic too when it comes to ghosts and god and religion. All I can do is tell you what I experienced. 

My girlfriend of three years and her dad recently moved into a new house about two months ago. Everything seemed completely fine up until last night. My girlfriend has fallen asleep so I give her a kiss, say goodnight to her dad upstairs, and then head home. But as I'm walking downstairs, I VERY clearly hear someone walking around in the kitchen and opening drawers. I get down there and the lights are on which is weird as all three of the people in the house have been upstairs and their lights have motion detectors so turn off after a while when no one is in there. I quickly check to make sure there are no intruders but it was clear. I honestly get freaked out so I leave.

My problem is, I really wanna mention it to her but my girlfriend gets more freaked out about this stuff than I do. I don't want to be the person that tells her there may possibly be a ghost in the new house she just moved into. Should I tell her so she can be warned or is this something I should keep to myself?

Again, I know some people will think I'm crazy and that's completely understandable.",26Apr2020,1
265,"Hi so to make a long story short I was a rebellious child that for some reason chose to fake brushing my teeth up until I was 13.

I tend to shower him in affection often, especially at night when we talk for hours on end. He has said that I'm very poetic with my words and that I'm very good to him, and he always reciprocates whenever I initiate it. I do it *very* often, and I really can't help myself. I love him so, so, *so* much that I just have to tell him. My heart literally feels like it'll burst if I don't tell him that I love him.

273,"Context: I have messed up teeth that hurt constantly. I was on track to get work done but due to shady employer shenanigans I had to pause everything while I figured out insurance and how to possibly pay for dental work.

Then the coronavirus hit, and stay-at-home orders followed.

I'm in constant, terrible pain. I finally caved in to it after not being able to sleep for a couple of days, put on a mask and gloves, and went to my dentist. They told me I had a fever and they couldn't see me. (Now, bear in mind that I had dressed warmly in anticipation of it being cold inside--it wasn't--and my mask made my face hot, and if I have an infection in my tooth I'm gonna be warmer anyway, but!! I don't blame them for not taking chances.)

They told me to get tested for COVID, and to ask my doctor for a recommendation to get a test. I don't have a doctor bc I saved all my medical benefits for dental work. 

So they gave me some phone numbers and told me to try setting an appt with one of a few clinics.

Turns out clinics aren't accepting new patients, but one of the people I talked to said I might be able to get a recommendation for testing if I go to a walk-in clinic.

Which they are recommending to anyone with symptoms who don't currently have doctors.

So, assuming I don't already have it, my options are either a) go to the walk-in clinic where a bunch of people with symptoms also go and potentially bring it home to my kid and immunocompromised partner, or b) continue to be in steadily worsening pain and hope I don't die from an abcessed tooth infection.

Then there's the matter of if I do have it, I'm expected back to work on the 4th with an elderly coworker. It seems imperative that I should get tested to be rid of uncertainty, but I've been good about staying inside, shopping less than once a week, etc.

He then went on about how if I want to go to a regular school we might as well move back to our old home town, which he full heartedly knows I hate and never want to go back. He was using that as a threat and also was talking about how if I got off my phone I would get work. (I’ll admit I’m on it often but not that much) but it’s not only my dad that’s does things like this my mom often yelled at me whenever I’m down or sad as if me being sad is an issue for her. She’s never asked if I’m okay or anything when she gets at me about looking down or looking depressed all the time. And I’m sure that I’ve definitely developed depression and anxiety from this with frequent panic attacks along with mental breakdowns.

Even as a kid my dad would often yell at me all the way to elementary for just getting a B, like I was so scared in elementary that I would start crying mid class if I even seen a c on my report card because I knew I would get in trouble at home. But what doesn’t make sense is now that I’m older, while my dad still is at me about my grades even about low A’s now he never gets on to my little brother who gets terrible grades and when I bring it up he says that my brother is just a kid yet he proceed to yell at me as a child when I got low grades. 

And when I try talking to my dad about going to art school instead of being a doctor he just looks at me with a disapproving look but will just brush the idea off. Even times when I try to talk to them about my stress and struggles they often tell me I’m just a kid and I don’t have it hard. And What even scares me more is I think my dad is homophobic(he’s often shown signs) and I’m pansexual and I’m terrified he’ll kick me out the house or something because of it.

When I have to talk, I get so damn nervous that I sometimes takes me 30 seconds to reply to something and usually, I just kinda say it under my breath. I hate my voice too, I have a slight lisp and I'm worried that it makes me sound less intelligent.  

Because of these things, I'm pretty much a recluse. I want to become more extroverted, it's my current goal but right now, I need to focus on caring less about other's think. 

I'm hoping on making an appointment with a psychiatrist as soon as the lock down is lifted. I'm also considering medication but I'm worried about the side effects. 

Until than, any advice on what I can do?",26Apr2020,1
278,"Hi guys,

So when the lockdown was implemented here, I happened to be visiting my parents while my pets were away in another city at my flat with someone coming over to take care of them. But soon new people were not allowed in our housing society,which would leave the cats on their own (my flatmates don't involve much in this so they were not an option to consider).
Now a trio of my colleague/friends (2 guys and one's girlfriend) offered to take in the cats. The guys were too good and took the cats in their own home (never fostered cats or animals) and it was really great and sweet of them. 

The girl started posting cats' pics on Instagram and Facebook which was perfectly fine. Slowly, the post started coming off as showboating and for some reason did not feature the other guys (which I also have a problem with cz it diminishes their contribution in taking care of my pets). Now she's putting up placeholders, vidoes and fancy hashtags for the cat like she is a parent. Even I don't do cz pets are my family, not a source of social media clout. It's been over a month and I see this lockdown extending till June. 

I can't deal with her doing this everyday. It is causing me stress slowly and my indignance is building up too much. What do I do? How do I ask her to stop without starting a fight? (Cz I don't want to piss her bf off who is a good person) 

Tldr: 3 friends take in my cats during lockdown, one girl starts posing as a fake mommy kinda on social media, I'm not comfortable, How do I put it across? 

TIA",26Apr2020,1

Back story 
Im from a bigger city in orlando, but go to college in the middle of no where pa, a college town. 
I am very bipolar not completely medicated yet (another long story) I like to party and aduse some things, once in a while, but never for long. 
I met my friend (lets call her Sally) Sally, the start of her first year my 2nd. We quickly became very close. I just finnished my 3rd year of college. 

So with this virus happening, we meet once a week w our boyfriends to play board games. We would drink and have fun and it was great! 

But, 
The last time we had it, i was at tge start if feeling low. My first low in a long time. I didn't know i was gonna be this sad. I wasnt sure if they were coming, so i took some Xanax (I am prescribed) for my anxiety. They announced they where coming over. We started drinking. I got very drunk very fast. (I've only drank once on these meds, i had a beer and fell asleep, but i felt the xanax for days.) As the night went on, i hardly remember anything, but i know i got very sad. They left after a good night. 

My boyfriend and i live together. So i went to the bathroom and took all my pills at once. Maybe 10-15 left? (One 1mg each) my boyfriend saw this, called her, she freaked out and told him to take me to the hospital. So he did. I have very little memory. 

I was sooo ,under the influencely, pissed off i was there. I pulled my IV out a few times trying to leave. I was alone, scared and mad. I had no phone. I couldnt sleep. I felt like i woke up here. 

The next day 
I got put at 1pm, i cried to my bf and we have talked about it and are understanding. He thinks i shouldnt of gone, he only took me cz kyra scared him, but was scared. He said i never was gettibg sick, i showed no signd of ODing, he thinks i took maybe 5 more. Etc etc .
I fall asleep. Way up around 9pm, a week earlier she said she would revise my essay. She just then emailed it to me  12 hours befire it was due, knowing what condition i was in. I told her off for it, and told her how mad i was at her. Like putting the blame on her, she did not deserve that. But i do not remember the conversation. I looked back. I did not understand how she knew what i was saying. It was so cleae i was under the influence, still of xanax. 
We havent spoke since. 
Since then. Ive tried v hard to get in touch w her. Ive said sorry, i understand my actions. I know it must of hurt her. Im very sad. I have expressed all of this and more to her.

A week later, today 
Her bf. Messages my bf about wanting weed. Mine said nicly no, because he does not like being middle man, and his guy is out (not true). I do not smoke weed, so they go threw him. Sally later messages him saying that they want it by tomrrow or monday. He innocently saids. I miss you guys, my gf does. Shes v sorry. I dont want to get in the middle so rn, no. Hopefully soon 
Sally did not like that, she went off sayibg her point of view, which was wordly very meanly. He said he understands, but understands mine too. She then said some very hurtful things about me, saying i am manipulative and a huge lair, and she heard a rumor im buying more pills etc(not true). He just said no to weed, and that despite how upset i got, i would never say that about her, even if i was in the right. Which is true. She just replyed w wanting and update for weed.
Before today i was sorry, now I feel so betrayed by her. She always made a point in drama, to never have middle ppl, to always talk to the source. My other friend (different girl in friend group) thinks it was very mean and uncalled for, and she now owes me a sorry too. 
I dont know what to do

280,"I've seen this happen a couple of times and asked where she was looking at, and she didn't give me a full answer. She looks pretty committed in our relationship but I suspect a wandering eye on her. I just want to ask the signs of potential warnings she might stray or give in to infidelity if no precautions are taken. Seriously it gets on my nerves.   

There was this one time we were in the police station dealing with a law I crushed by overstaying in her country and she spoke to this young guy who worked there, quite the comedian or flirting type of guy and we were basically sitting there with 4 other officers and she was standing in front of his desk while he was sitting, anyway, they spoke for a good 20 minutes in Russian, and my wife was giggling , pulling her pants up, playing with her hair and stuff and no kidding I was felt betrayed. I even told her to come stand next to me but she boldly refused to do so and continued speaking with this jackass. Later I confronted her with this and asked what that was all about and she just said"" Oh we only spoke a little , he is funny but a stupid guy"" well my gut doesn't agree 

All in all there were a few cases I can see her looking at other man and I understand they can be attractive but you'd only see them because it's quite noticable which doesn't give you the right to look at them even longer or show signs of attraction or even worse LUST. 

And here are some facts whether you like it or not:

Looking at another with desire and lustful curiosity while in the confines of a mutually loving and supportive relationship can indeed erode the trust in our relationship and ultimately incite us to cheat on our partners I believe. 

 Knowing that our partners find others attractive is completely understandable. We are human and are blessed with the ability to recognize and appreciate beauty. However when our gaze becomes lust-driven and is littered with a longing quality, this is when simple appreciation becomes complicated adoration

Not only does it erode our satisfaction with our current relationship, it also makes our partners feel inadequate, unworthy and dangerously insufficient. It is the first sign of emotional abandonment and disengagement in a relationship and gradually erodes the trust we have in our partners ability to be faithful and loyal to us.

A relationship with a person who has a wandering eye is really no relationship at all. It is really just two people killing time trying to be less alone justifying love in an effort to avoid psychosocial failures.

Our culture has done extensive research on the costs of physical infidelity as well as emotional infidelity however we have rarely, if ever heard about the consequences of what I’d like to call “visual infidelity” and what that does to a relationship. We always tend to write it off as innocent curiosity and harmless fun. But looking at another with desire and lustful curiosity while in the confines of a mutually loving and supportive relationship can indeed erode the trust in our relationship and ultimately incite us to cheat on our partners.

It’s really heartbreaking and mildly confusing knowing that the one you want to be with wants to be with someone else. This is the message sent when your partner looks at another person with lust in their eyes.

I am of the belief that a wandering eye leads to a wandering heart and where the heart goes the body is sure to follow and to be honest I was spot on in my assessment. Those who I dated that possessed a wandering eye inevitably cheated on me. Now based on my tried and true lived-through relational traumas, a wandering eye is just an early sign of relational doom. The beginning of the end if you will. Where there is smoke, there is usually fire and I try my best now to abandon those emotional burning buildings before they go up in flames.

Oh and do I like to address when she looks at other men like that? No because that's her own decision and if I'd told her not to , I'd only be deceiving myself!",26Apr2020,1

I’ve struggled with disordered eating since 2016, I’ve never seeked professional help for it.
I’ve tried recovery last year but relapsed into old habits a few months after gaining weight.
I know it’s bad for me, it’s damaging my body but what’s worst is I have a Instagram account for looking at other sick peoples who post thinspo and tips and body checks.
I’ve probably had 20 accounts over the years, either deleting them myself or they’ve been reported and taken down.
There’s also people called ana coaches, someone who encourages this behaviour, praise you for losing weight and starving. After a couple of months of not having a coach, I feel the need to reach out and find one again but it’s so toxic and bad. Why am I seeking out these things that harm me?

284,So I brought up wanting to start a hobby to my SO and he understandably so said it’s expensive. Yes when first starting it’s expensive because of everything you need to buy at first. It seems like to me he doesn’t want me doing certain things unless we’re making money from it. It seems like all he cares about is money and it’s frustrating. I get it money is important but he’s so focused on money and wanting to become rich that it’s so irritating. I understand it’s expensive and I responded to him jokingly how my reptiles I wanted were going to be expensive as well and he said “ yeah but a snake can make us money”. I wanted to eventually breed snakes because I love snakes. To me that made me feel like he wasn’t interested in me pursuing this hobby of mine because to him I couldn’t make money from it because he’s so focused on money. The second I brought up how I could make money from it he switched and supported me and was willing to put in the money like I don’t get it! Am I being dramatic here? I get it in a certain way but also at the same time it’s frustrating. I just want to be supported without it always being about money. He also loves guns that’s his hobby he bought a AK and he’s not making any money from that hobby of his? Like??? He’s told me before his dream is to become so rich that he’s able to give out money to those in need and to help the homeless get out of their current situation.,26Apr2020,1

Anyway in school I always got picked on for being quiet and now I’m a 20 yr old adult and I still get shit for it but now instead of getting shit for it at school I get it at work. I don’t do anything to anyone I mind my business and do whatever I’m supposed to do. Idk why people have such an issue with people who are quiet like bro leave us quiet people alone. I tried being more extroverted but I didn’t feel comfortable I really like keeping to myself. I work with a few people who are straight up rude to me and I believe it’s because Im quiet because I don’t do anything else for them to be rude towards me like I said I do my work and mind my business. 

A coworker today announced to my workplace saying she doesn’t know why I work here because I’m lazy and I don’t do anything. This coworker is old enough to be my mom and she’s the number one coworker who has been very rude towards me I’ve never done anything to her I’ve never even had a conversation with her before she’s acting like she’s in high school. Personally if I felt someone was lazy i would never announce that to my workplace and it’s not because I’m quiet it’s because it’s just a straight up childish thing to do. I don’t even work the same position as her so idk why she’s so bothered by me. This ruined my day it’s pretty much impossible to get a job right now and I don’t want this woman spreading negative untrue comments about me to the workplace possibly costing me my job.

Also I did confront her about what she said and she didn’t say a word. I couldn’t really tell if she was mad angry or didn’t care it’s hard to read her because she has these tattooed eyebrows so idk how she felt about the confrontation but she was quiet the rest of the day so there’s that. Also I shaded her in the confrontation about her age she is old enough to be my mom but I made it sound like she was really old. I pretty much said she was 40 years older than me and she shouldn’t be acting so childish at her age so she might report me for that I have no idea. How should I deal with this coworker we are very low staff and I know we’re gonna continue working with each other unless one of us leaves.

So I'm not that beautiful as them. Even I know that.  I never has a problem with beauty before, im a very content person mostly and i do think rationally and maturely about lots of things. I dont really know whats happening with me right now.  
So we were talking the other night, he's in the military and I'm stuck here in my island. Hes really busy during the day which is understandable too. So as i said before we talking, i asked him who he thought was the most beautiful of all hes been in a relationship with till now. I was very adamant about being honest with me.

So, what are the things I could have done differently to try to get included?

My parents have always tried to hide it , well not hide it but they don't exactly go around telling people the same. So as a child I was led to believe that being adopted was something to be ashamed of and I always felt bad about it. 

I still remember the time in school probably the 6th grade my brother went and told his friend that I'm adopted and it spread all through out our grade and people would randomly come and ask me if it was true, it made me feel very bad about myself. Other than that I've never been able to speak openly about my feeling with my parents and I generally feel like I don't belong in this family. 

I see a lot of bias among'st me and my siblings (2 brothers) but i don't know if that is real or just something in my head because I know I'm adopted. I also feel very lost, like I don't know myself at all. I once gained the courage to tell my mom I wanted to have a DNA test done but she just shrugged it off. 

My family and I don't communicate very well, I usually keep my feelings and thoughts to myself , Its like they barely know me- the real me. It bothers me a lot and I feel like its to late for this to change cause I don't think ill be able to actually honestly open up to them. We do fight a lot too, my mom and I especially.

304,"tl;dr - I like this girl and she said she has a crush on someone else, but she wants to give up on this crush and believes it'll never work out. We have become unusually close really quickly and she shows signs she may be interested in me at the same time.   
So I met this girl about 5 months ago in community college. We had the same math class and basically never spoke until the last week of the fall semester where I was struggling in the class and decided to ask this girl for help. We'll call her ""Sara"". The reason that I asked Sara for help was because on the last week (finals weeks) I was studying the the math tutoring center that my school provides and it turns out that Sara was a math tutor. That day she wrote down her phone number on one of the tests I showed her and told me we could study together the next day. The next day, we met up together and ""studied"". We didn't really study, we ended up chatting about life and things we liked to do and I personally felt like I really connected with her.  We talked for about 2 and half hours until the place closed and studied again the next day right before class (I passed the final because of her). Up until this point, I had already fallen for her and this has never happened to me before. It takes me a long time before I really like a girl.   


So once the semester had ended, I felt that we had become acquaintances, not friends....yet. All I was left with was her phone number. I also knew that she used discord, from our conversation from studying. So I decided to shoot Sara a text basically thanking her for helping me and that she should add me on discord. I soon learned that she played League of Legends (I'm a big Viddy gamer). So we added each other on League, and played a few games over winter break.  We texted over the break(everything text convo was initiated by me) as well just really getting to know each other and by the end of the break, I could say that we were friends. She just clicked for me  


When spring semester came (the current semester), we found out we actually had another math class together. We also had another class with the same teacher but different times. So here is actually where I did something pretty shady and subtle. I'm not gonna go into detail, but I basically was able to switch into same class as Sara with a reasonable excuse and ""totally not suspiciously"". So now we had two classes together. These classes were right next to each other in times so we would walk together to the next class. During this semester we talked more and more, hanging out at school in person and then went home only to talk more online.  We went off campus to eat together and study together. At the beginning of the semester we both found out that we liked to play badminton. I signed up for a badminton class (which I had planned to drop) to fulfill one of my GE requirements. I mentioned this to her and told her that if she wanted, she could sign up and then drop with no penalty on the given date. So she joined the class with me and we played badminton together (3 classes together) for a few weeks until we both dropped. We even played badminton outside of school with some friends too. 

Fast forward a bit, I thought she liked me too. We were touchy, looked at each other differently, and tried to stay in each other's orbit. And at this point, we were talking everyday. And I mean, everyday. At this point we would text each other back starting the convo 50/50. We would talkon discord from around 11-12pm all the way to 4-6am in the morning. She said that she usually never stays up this late and she started asking me about my past relationships and about my personal life. At this point I thought. ""Ok, Sara likes me"". But then she threw me a massive curveball. She mentioned that she had liked this guy back in high school and that she still had feelings for him. The night we talked about this, she talked about this guy for 2 hours. She said that this guy also had feelings for her but at this time, they are living far apart from each other and the guy did not want to commit to something so long distance. I was heartbroken. However Sara said that she wants to give up on him and that she wants to run away. She said that this guy never texts her and that she always has to message him first and she was sick of it. She said that she wants a definite answer from this guy if he really likes her or not so that she can commit or not. So basically that's where I'm at right now, and its starting to hurt to talk to her everyday. I really want to tell her how I feel so I can move on, but I really want to maintain our current friendship because she is honestly the most amazing girl I've ever met, and I'm talking friendship wise. I just don't know if I can keep my cool possibly getting rejected from her and the playing it off like nothing and continuing being her friend. This story is getting really long and I skipped over a lot of details. So if you guys have questions for me, hit me up. Any advice would be appreciated.",26Apr2020,1

306,"(14M) I used to have a group of friends when I was 6 and early 7 but after that I moved 5 times and stopped making friends for fear of losing them again. and was just the quiet kid who focused a lot on school and staying up on my grades since I don’t have anything else in my life to do. But since last year when I was a freshman I became a little well know amongst my school I gave up on being social and I just push people away who try to make small talk because I’m at a school where I need to pick people I socialize with very carefully because vaping is very big problem in my school and I just don’t want to deal with people trying to pressure me into it. But this year I’ve been trying to work on my social because I learned that in reality I can’t just have online friends to make me feel better I need actual physical friends because it’s not good to have at least one anyways. I also do sports and as I said I am well known among a lot of people and I know some people too, but I don’t have any friend that I can hang out with or do anything everyone at my school is just aquatints.

So, a lifelong friend died by suicide a few years ago. He had moved away and we drifted apart a bit but still really loved each other. 

I traveled across the country to attend his wedding, and the pics taken there were the last we took together.

I’d really love to have the photos of us but feel really shitty asking his widow to search through her files and possibly be triggered. Also, her and I weren’t close.

I’ve tried to remain clear of it but then it comes at me and I get quite hot headed when I’m getting shouted/mocked for no reason. He threatens that he won’t pay for my university anymore (he more or less forced me to get into medicine), that I’m useless, have no job prospect and won’t amount to anything. I agree with the things he says I’m not the smartest and a lot of opportunities that have to me are due to him. Worst is we are from a third world country and live in another place, so there is no sort of support or anything from government for these type of situations.

316,"I want to know if I was out of line, but also how to approach this situation, because I'm running out of ideas.

For context, you have to be aware that my extended family consists of horrible people: most of these relatives are alcoholics who have done nothing with their lives, and they tear each other apart over any amount of money. There are even a few of them who have allegedly killed people, and one of them makes money by hunting and trafficking exotic and endangered species from the jungles of my parents’ home country.

You also have to be aware that my parent suffered years of horrific physical and psychological abuse from their family. In addition, my parent suffered ongoing sexual abuse by their own siblings, and their parents and relatives enabled it. Therefore, it was never reported to the authorities, and those monsters never faced any consequences for their crimes, and continue to walk among us to to this day. And in any case, criminal justice is essentially nonexistent in the country where my parents are from.

My parent has severe trauma, and although they’ve proven to possess remarkable resilience, it continues to affect them to this day, and I cannot even imagine what it must be like for them to have to endure and to live with all that pain and suffering. In addition, although I am very successful, and although I wouldn’t be where I am today if it weren’t for my parent’s love and sacrifices, growing up with a traumatized parent has affected me as well. Throughout my childhood and adolescence, my parent had bouts of hysteria and rage, as well as nervous breakdowns, and they've kept getting re-traumatized. As a result, I ended up developing issues of my own, such as depression and significant anxiety. Even to this day, it’s very difficult for me to take on the role of holding my parent together when they have a mental breakdown. It doesn’t help that they did not follow up with therapy, and that they discontinued taking a prescribed antidepressant even though my parent expressed it was making them feel better.

Now, one of the most difficult things for me  is having to see my parent suffer and to do everything I can to help them get through moments of distress; I listen to them, I talk to them, I comfort them, and I’m essentially the closest thing they have to a therapist. And yet, despite the damage their relatives have done and continue to do to them, my parent has kept going back to their hometown to visit them, and my parent has continued interacting with them and supporting them financially. What happens next is that my parent’s family then continues to mistreat them, they get hurt as a result, and then I have to deal with the aftermath and help my parent heal from the most recent emotional injuries inflicted by their family, and then the cycle repeats itself. I’ve become more bitter and angry over the years, and although all of my hatred is directed at my extended family, I’ve admittedly become more angry and vocal with my parent for doing this.

Last summer, my parent went to visit their family, and they confronted their family about the abuse and tried to get closure. To say it went horribly would be an understatement. Not only did their family outright deny the abuse, but they all ganged up against my parent and threatened them; they told my parent to never come back, and that if my parent opened their mouth again, they would file a lawsuit against them for defamation.

Back to the present,  I was having a conversation with my parents, and the subject of the ongoing global situation came up. My parent then tells me that they are helping their mother with their groceries and having them delivered to her, and I just snapped. I didn’t yell or insult my parent, but I used a sharp tone and said “Why isn’t X \[my parent’s histrionic, narcissistic sibling who’s a part of all of this\] doing that for your mother instead?”. My parent then left the room. My other parent then reprimanded me and told me to not say things like that to them.  I’m doing my very best to understand and to respect my parent’s choices on how to deal with their family and the abuse, but I can’t take it anymore. I can’t stand how they continue to control and hurt my parent, and I can’t just sit quietly and say nothing while my parent continues to do this to themselves.",26Apr2020,1

So I (F18) got accepted to college X, which is a pretty great but extremely expensive school (think like upwards of 70k/year. I got a bunch of scholarships, but it’s still fairly expensive. I’m giving this information because it’s one of the reasons why I don’t know what to do; the amount of time/money that’s been invested so far.

A few hours ago, I heard from current students that X has been (potentially, again, it’s the internet so idk) covering up sexual assaults and a bunch of other stuff, more of which they’re saying they’re posting in the upcoming days/weeks to “expose” the school.

This is leading me to wonder whether I should even go to this school. I’m not sure what to think. On one hand, I’ve heard fantastic things from current students and alum about this school and it’s programs. On the other, I don’t know what to think. My family has poured a ton of time into figuring out how to make this work financially, and I’m concerned about the level of trouble I could get in with them if I decided against going. It’s also pretty much the only “prestigious” school I’ve gotten into, and my family is pretty big on that.

I love this school and it seems like the perfect place for me. The campus, classes, and programs all seem awesome and I really think I’d love it there.

322,"I am a 20 year old at a community college in Southern California with plans to transfer to UC Berkeley to study Operations Research and Management Science (ORMS), but I was just offered a job working in strategy at an early stage start-up (series A valuation @ $50 million) that pays $75,000 - $80,000 a year + equity with the caveat that I need to dropout and devote my full attention to the company. Any comments or concerns?

Here are a few extra thoughts:

- Everything that got me this job was self-taught through books and online classes. 

- My ultimate goal is to own my business and have massive influence (political, social, economic). 

- I will likely take over my Dad’s construction company.

- My Dad/Family encourages me to drop out every other week and work construction.

- I will likely live like shit and reinvest all my earnings into investments strategy (my investments have returned +200% since the end of 2018) and more online classes (deep emphasis on business and python classes).

- If I go to school and graduate I’d like to work in Investment Banking (M&amp;A)/Private Equity/Management Consulting in hopes to be in the best possible position to successfully start my own business and take over my dad’s business (from an operations and network perspective).

- Studying ORMS is similar to studying strategy (highly technical strategy).

- I feel confident working @ this start-up will prep me to take over my Pop’s business (so does my Dad).",26Apr2020,1

So, I’m 19-years-old and I don’t think it’s normal at my age to not have a group of friends that you do stuff with. It’s weird and I’m not a fan of being like this anymore.

Yes, there are good and bad days, but the bad outweighs the good, making me feel that life has become stagnant over the course of these 4 years.

Looking at the good; I have a well-paid internship, got a car and soon I’ll start a part-time university degree soon.

However, when I got asked by my parents as to why I don’t have a friend group, I told them that I’m pretty lucky compared to others for my age, but I’m not lucky in relationships. For others, fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, it’s the complete opposite, which shouldn’t annoy me, but it does. It’s that “in-real-life” communication that I feel that I’m missing and have no place to start, so as a result, I spend a lot of time talking in discord chats that interest me, where I talk to people, but it’s not the same as talking to an actual person face-to-face.

I realized that throughout my life, I've always been a bit hypocritical towards what I'll tolerate from men vs what I'll tolerate from women. I don't necessarily go out of my way to belittle other women, but it's much easier for me to find a girl annoying than it is for me to find a boy annoying, as an example.

332,"I started dating my girlfriend several months ago. Everything went well at first.

I basically laid out some expectations at the very beginning of the relationship. I told her I didn’t really want a super serious relationship and I wasn’t going to continue the relationship past high school. I’m going away to college and I don’t think it’s a good idea to go to a college just so you can stay with your high school significant other. I also can’t handle long distance, I think it makes people lose out on a lot of valuable experiences, because that’s what my one long distance relationship did.

I also smoke weed/drink every once in a while. Probably like once or twice a month with my friends. I know it’s not good, but I also know that I’m not anywhere near being addicted to anything. I have strict guidelines for myself so that I’m minimizing my health risks. 

Both of those things make my girlfriend have extreme anxiety. She’s had extreme anxiety for a long time. And her parents are too awful to get her any help for it, because when she was a kid a psychiatrist put her on some meds that made her too hyper. Her parents have been told by doctors on various occasions that they should do something about her anxiety because she has a heart condition, and reducing anxiety would help reduce her risk of future problems. But they never listen and just insist that psychiatry and therapy are BS, and accuse her of being ungrateful. It even went so far that her mom called her a bitch one time. So there’s no way to minimize her anxiety.

She spends so much time thinking about how she’s going to lose me after high school and how much it’s going to hurt. And she spends a ton of time worrying that I’m going to become addicted to alcohol or weed or nicotine and that I’m going to turn into some different person. She knew that I did drugs before we were together. 

I’d say at least once a week either my substance use or the issue of breaking up after graduation are brought up. And it always ends awfully. She’s in tears and then I feel like shit. Honestly, it’s annoying that I’ll never be able to make her anxiety go away. I’m not going to be able to change her or help. I’m not changing the way I live or changing my opinion on staying after graduation. I feel like I have no way to keep this relationship alive, because I just feel like it’s more stress than being a good thing in each other’s lives.

Is there anything I can do to save this relationship or is it just time for me to end it?

Tl:dr

My girlfriend has extreme anxiety and her parents refuse to get her treatment. She constantly worries about my substance use and how I said that I won’t continue our relationship past high school.

He had cancer and we knew he wouldn't have much time, but it happened before he ever started morphine, and honestly no one in my family was expecting to happen so soon.Because of the COVID19, I, along with many others, never had the chance to say goodbye or see him one last time, which has been incredibly hard.

Then on the 24th, my fiance broke up with me. We've been together going on 4 years this June, and today I found out he's already planning to find someone else through tinder. We've had problems for a while, especially since he has dad anxiety and I've been struggling with bad depression and BPD, especially for the last 6 months or so, and I know this has been hard for him but in December I started therapy and, idk I honestly thought I was making improvements, and we agreed to work on our relationship.

I was planning to drive to visit my grandpa when the lockdown was over and my now ex and I were planning on moving in together towards the end of the year. I feel like my entire world is crushed and I feel like I'll never get over this. I haven't stopped crying and haven't slept since his passing, and I can't keep food down and my head is pounding and I'm dizzy constantly. This has taken such a huge toll on me emotionally and physically and I don't know how to cope. Any advice would be appreciated tremendously.",26Apr2020,1
336,"Before I start, I’d just like to state that this post involves sexual abuse, so please be wary of that.

I’m 15 years old I need to turn myself in for sex crimes I committed when I was younger. Basically, I sexually abused my sister when I was 12 and I knowingly watched illegal pornography from the time I was 11 to the time I was 14. I’m no longer interested in doing either because of the strong feelings of regret I feel towards my actions. I’m also on track of completely cutting all non-illegal pornography out of my life completely because it doesn’t help me in any sort of capacity whatsoever.

I want turn myself in for the sake of my sister- but I don’t know of a way to achieve that that minimizes the stress on everybody involved. I also don’t know what would be the best time to turn myself in.

If I turned myself in now, they would probably place me back into my house because of the pandemic. I don’t want to this to happen because I’m not going to be comfortable around my parents after this event nor will my sister be comfortable around me, given that she will now know what I did to her. Thus, I feel like I have to wait.

I haven’t figured out a way to confess, either. I’ve entertained 2 solutions, but I don’t know which one is better. My first solution would be to approach a SRO at my school and ask to be arrested. I obviously can’t do this now because of our current situation. My second solution is to tell my mother directly, but I don’t have courage to tell the person I have the greatest connection with that I hurt their child. I can’t open up to my father because he would fly into an anxious rage. 

Another thing I’m concerned about is the wellbeing of others in regards to my actions. Sometimes I feel like I should feel guilty about contributing to a community because other members don’t know who I truly am. So, I’ve temporarily stopped for now. I don’t know if other people want to know that I used to do terrible things.

I’d like to finish off by stating that sometimes I have some difficulties getting across a point. So, if you need me elaborate, I will.",26Apr2020,1
337,"Living has always been just directionless, nothing gives me long lasting joy, there's nothing I can think of in life that I would enjoy doing for the rest of my life. I've started to hate life and living a great deal, its purgatory in some senses.

I've lost motivation and drive to do anything really, anhedonia plagues me. I've seen that my sleep patterns are all over the place and I haven't had the appetite to eat anything anymore. It's like all energy has been sapped from me, I spend lots of my time in bed. 

I often feel hopeless in a sense that I feel that my life isn't worth it and that everything I do is meaningless, so basically intense feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and overall nihilistic self deprecating attitude.

I get angry at people a lot, not like physically, but the way I talk is hurtful and reflects how bad a person I am on the inside sometimes. I don't see a reason for the anger though, no matter how much I look deeper. It's like my mood changes on a whim for no particular reason.

Every day I realize how much I hate myself. I don't like what I see when I look at myself in the mirror. I can't help to think that no one cares about me or my wellbeing. Because I pushed everyone away.

I have issues with my eyes and my work requires staring at monitor thorough out the working day. I love computer games and programming but I can't longer do that after working hours as my headache gets unbearable (and I have it every day for a long time already; taking a prescribed medicine to soften it).

I exercise every morning and have a 30 mins indoor run/bike 5 days a week. This takes me out of the screen for some time and I'd say weekdays pass good enough. But when the weekend starts I do not know what to do as all my life I was starting at my laptop :/

Our parents are best friend so I am always around her and we are pretty close, and this was fine until a couple of years ago. Sarah was coming over with her mom to me and my family’s house, and I expected it to be the same as every other time I had been around her. This time however, something had changed. This time when I saw her, everything stopped. She was the same girl, but I saw something different. In an instant I went from seeing one of my best friends to instantly falling in love with her. I don’t know how and I don’t know why, but I couldn’t shake the fact that I had fallen for her. Every day from that point on was just thinking about her and trying to stop myself from ruining 14 years of friendship. After about a year and a half, I told her. I didn’t want to go through every day knowing that I was in love with her. I told her everything. She responded extremely well to her best friend admitting he loved her, but after she said that she wanted to think it over and in the morning she would tell me what she was feeling. The next morning she told me she wanted space. I was crushed, but I understood. We went around 3 months without talking to eachother and then out of the blue we were talking again. Everything was back to normal but I still had deep feelings for her. It’s been about a year since and I don’t know what to do. Help

340,"I'm 32 and I understand people are busy with their own lives etc... and don't expect a reply within a few hours. However, my problem is friends who purposely won't read my message or they read the message for days/weeks/months and these are friends who are very active with their phones and social media - always on Instagram, tinder, reply very quickly back to guys etc..

I feel its disrespectful and they don't appreciate me as I see how quickly they reply to others when I am in their presence but won't extend the same courtesy to me. Its gotten to the point where I get a bit anxious when texting certain friends as I know I won't get a reply for days on end and it makes me feel icky with the lack of respect. I sent one friend a question and she didn't reply for 6 weeks! and I could see she was on Whatsapp everyday. Also two days ago, I sent an important message to her, she read it and then didn't reply. Not even an acknowledgement. My other best friend wouldn't even open the message. I'm not a chronic texter/fb messanger, I only reach out to my friends maybe once every 2-3 weeks for a quick catch up - so I doubt its that they find me annoying. I've mentioned it to a friend before and she blew up at me so I've never mentioned it again.

I think its hurtful and disrespectful - sometimes in my life I've been in really lonely times and needed to reach out to a friend only to never hear from them. I want friends in my life who enjoy making contact with me. If someone messages me I always message back within 24 hours as I know they are awaiting my reply.

341,"Hey everybody, I'm not really sure what to do but I guess that's why I'm here. 

Back in January, I got together with someone in my college class and we dated for roughly three weeks, into about mid-February. He asked me out within a week of knowing me and asked me to be his boyfriend a few days after that. He quickly forced the relationship to be very serious and was talking about marriage within a week or two of dating. I broke it off myself after speaking to my therapist who was immediately concerned for my safety after hearing about the relationship (which I'll get into in a moment) and I haven't had to speak to or see him since COVID picked up speed.

There was never any physical abuse, but he would manipulate and guilt-trip me for little things constantly, love-bomb me when he needed something from me, and gaslight me. He threatened to hurt my friends who he thought could ""take me from him"" and told me he didn't trust me because he didn't know if I was ""weak enough to cheat on him."" He forced emotional labor out of me and took things from me that I can never get back and I wish I had never met him. 

Things are a lot better now. I feel safe and I'm more properly medicated than I have been in a long time (unrelated but a factor in just doing better. I've had mental health issues for a while and I've been on the upswing for a month or so now) but I'm hung up on that three-week long relationship. I keep telling myself that it didn't even last long enough to do that much damage and it was my fault in the first place for letting him drag me in, but at the same time I can't stop replaying things that happened and things that he'd said in my mind. And I'm incredibly guarded now and skeptical of my loved ones and outwardly I'm fine, but I can't stop dwelling on it. Arguably the worst part is that I'm now with someone who I've known for years that I care for deeply and fully trust, but I catch myself analyzing him and almost planning escapes if it turns bad, which consciously I truly don't believe I need to do. I also really just want to talk to him about how I've felt lately but I don't want him to think I don't love him due to ""not being over my ex.""

We send memes back and forth for a bit and she sends a pic of her friend as a meme, and as a joke, I send a meme to the friend from the meme. Said friend sees it and doesn't reply back, and a few hours later, another friend, who I have known for years, although we have a love/hate relationship, texts me the same meme I sent the girl and mocks me. Now the girl I first messaged doesn't seem to like me as much and other friends who know them just leave me on read.

Everything started out great but recently she has become very self absorbed and refuses to compromise on simple things. I have a cat and she has been talking about getting another one for a while. However, we both love plants and have lots of non-toxic plants around the house. 

Recently she has been buying a lot of plants, all are toxic to cats and she is aware of this. I have told her many times and she says she knows but “doesn’t think the cat will touch it”. My cat, who i have known since her literal birth, is the most curious cat in the world. She climbs everything. She gets into everything. 

At this point I feel like a helicopter mom and a nagging roommate, but she doesn’t care and has put toxic plants all over our house. Vines, jade plants, literally anything. 

I have explained basic cat behaviour to her. But at this point her response is, I’m on the lease and I can do what I want. 

I am all for plants but i think this is a safety hazard to my cat and to any pets she gets, and I have already suffered a traumatic death of my other cat. I am so worried and full of anxiety, I feel like I have to watch my cat at all times. I don’t know what to do!!",26Apr2020,1

We're Canadian. When growing up, CNN was always our channel of choice. For years I didn't even know stations have political biases and assumed that the news is the news. My Dad has always drank the liberal kool-aid and I was cool with that, most stuff we agree on anyway. He loved to make fun of Bush and take shots at him, I think he really latches onto the idea of these cartoon characters he imagined running the country, especially with Jon Stewart just killing it on the Daily Show during the Bush years.

Now comes Donald Trump, and there's something about this guy that is just triggering something in my Dad. He watches a lot of TV and most of the time I notice he just leaves it on CNN. It's starting to become difficult holding conversations with him lately, he randomly blurts out things that Trump did. Sometimes it feels like he's a teenager, just waiting to change the subject to whatever it is he wants to say.

It's been 3 years and counting of this and I'm honestly sick of it. I've started getting vocal about it, being clear, ""Stop talking about Trump"" or "" I don't want to talk about Trump"", but he will just use that as an excuse to bring up five more damn reasons why Trump is awful. 

The past few weeks I've become extremely concerned. He said he hopes somebody kills Trump, we were alone so I called him out, that that's a very serious thing to say to wish death on another person, especially a world leader. I've caught him saying it several times since, it's becoming more frequent. Last time he said somebody needs to kill Trump, and he said that in a social gathering, I told him that's  extreme to say and he embarrassed himself by getting worked up and listing reasons why Trump deserves to die. He almost sounds panicked too, like there's an urgency for somebody to kill him.

I don't like it, he's losing his filter. Sooner or later he's going to say that stuff to the wrong person. He would never harm somebody, but it's unacceptable to say anyway and he just doesn't seem to get it. I don't know what to do, I'm legitimately thinking about talking to my Mom about having CNN removed from their cable package. It's poisoning his mind and he needs to get away from it for a while.

To make myself clear: I have been in my relationship for a while. I wanna marry my SO and I am in complete love. 

About a year into my relationship I realized that I was demisexual, with a heavy preference for women. My SO is male and he is aware of this as we are extremely communicative. 

I chose not to explore it because I love my SO and as time has drawn on I become increasingly interested in trying things with women. I communicated that to my bf and he has given me the latitude to ""explore"" as we are calling it. 

When it comes to sex I need to profusely express that my bf and I can differentiate our relationship from sexual encounters. I was a SB (sugar baby) for some time and both of us were fine in regards to the relationship so I feel secure in exploring. 

I know im not interested in a particularly deep emotional connection with a woman but I do know I need *a* connection to feel that attraction. Any advice as to how I would go about this?

358,"Long story short, my boyfriend’s mom passed away two years ago, and in the wake of her death, my boyfriend’s stepdad asked us to move into their house (which was left in my bf’s name but is being mostly paid for by his stepdad and their inheritance money).

He’s an architect and he offered to completely renovate their basement to be an apartment for us, so we could have our own space. My boyfriend (of 5 years) and I moved out of the apartment we’d lived in for two years and into a temporary back bedroom, while his stepdad began the renovations. That was October of 2018.

For around/over six months, we slept on a mattress on the floor of the bedroom, surrounded by moving boxes. Finally, the renovations weren’t really moving very fast, so we dug our brand new bed frame out of storage, set it up, and made the tiny bedroom a little more homey.

Now, it’s April of 2020. I think the renovations are getting closer, but we still have a LONG way to go. It’s mostly just drywall. My bf (31m) and I (25f) are still crammed into our tiny bedroom. Most of our stuff has remained boxed up for almost two years. We spend all of our time in this tiny bedroom, despite it being a three bedroom house with a large, albeit unfinished basement). My FIL uses one room as his office, and he sleeps in the living room (which has been ravaged by his four dogs, who make tons of messes inside the house). There’s not a day that I don’t step in dog pee when I go into the living room. The third bedroom was my bf’s mom’s room, so it’s mostly a hallowed ground filled to the ceiling with storage and not used by anyone.

Now, I can’t even be angry. My FIL is doing all of this on his own dime, while he runs his more-than-full-time architecture business. We’re living rent free. And on top of that, he’s doing all of the renovations himself, despite being wheelchair bound (birth defect, he walks around on his knees). He’s prideful and refuses our help most of the time.

But at the same time, I’ve spent almost two years of my 20s stuffed into a tiny bedroom surrounded by junk and dog pee, unable to invite any friends over or sit on a couch or access half of my belongings. How the f**k am I supposed to confront this situation? I want to be grateful and respectful of the entire situation, especially since it only arose after my MIL passed away, but the situation feels like it’s getting dire.

It’s also a D1 school, and a bigger community, which offers a lot more internships and job opportunities. But I worry that if I leave all my friends at home, I’ll feel really lonely in the new city. I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression, and it stresses me out to leave my support system. But, the farther school just offers what I want as far as my future, and I’d like to live in that city someday regardless. 

When I look at it objectively, the new city seems like a no brainer, and I’m sure I’d meet plenty of great people there. But I honestly just don’t know what to do, and I have to make a decision soon with deadlines. Anybody have advice on moving to a new city, leaving friends, or anything related? I’d appreciate it a ton you guys seriously :)",26Apr2020,1

367,"I am 18 and I’m physically healthy. For almost two years now, I’ve been getting progressively worse at not spending time with my family (I occasionally hang with them still) and losing motivation to do things I usually like. Just recently, I’ve started to notice that I would blank out a lot when I type something on my phone or computer, when I play video games, or when I read a book. 

Sometimes I would start feeling really down and I would go to my room suddenly and just lay there and do nothing and then eventually fall asleep out of lack of motivation to do anything. My mom will come into my room and ask if I’m doing okay, I lie to her and say “I’m fine” or “I’m good” when I feel almost worthless.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m extremely open with my mom about almost everything: stories about how I was stupid as a kid, some news happening with my friends, how my day went, etc. But when it comes to mental health, I just don’t have the strength to bring it up. The main reason why I’m not so open about it to her is because I’m afraid to shatter her heart when she finds out her son feels absolutely down almost every other day, yet alone have her blame herself for the rest of her life when she did absolutely nothing wrong as a parent.

Power-cycled my phone and tried calling again, same result. Messages also remained undelivered.

I assumed I was blocked, so I tested it out. I heard that masking your number by dialing \*67 before a recipient's number can bypass the block.

I first tested that method out with a different person's number who I knew for sure had blocked me; the unmasked call was immediately sent to voicemail, masked call got a number of rings before sent to voicemail.

370,"Greetings from Birmingham

Long story short, few days ago I had a text, which contained something nobody should read, copied on my phone( dont ask why) So, I was chatting that night with two of my friends on a platform which deletes the chats after messages are viewed. The next day I was suddenly hit by an anxiety attack and started worrying whether I had unconsciously copy pasted the text, which would give away the secret, and sent it to them without knowing. I asked them a few times whether I had sent them a text or link as if a spam virus had done it and they replied maybe 4 times that they had received no such message but i just cant believe them. The little common sense I have left tells me that if I had sent the text to them they should have either replied or I should have remembered. However, this anxiety prevents me from thinking clearly and sensibly. I am trying to act cool around them but if this had happened, I would no longer be able to look them in the eyes.

371,"I need advice on kicking his girlfriend out because my mom can’t do it 

Ages:

My brother, W, is 19 
I am his sister and I’m 18
His girlfriend (J) is 20. 
His girlfriend has 2 kids: 
(V) is 3 years old and ( S ) is about 2 years old and my brother is not their father. 
Our dad (L)
Our mom (D)
Oldest brother is 25 (X)
Little brother is 14 (E)

Background: 

We are Hispanic and his girlfriend and kids are black and my dad, L, is racist, and hates anybody with a dark skin tone. My mom( D) lets my brother walk all over her and my brother takes advantage of her. And W is a spoiled unappreciated piece of shit garbage son. Our mom bought him 2 cars and she puts both cars under her insurance. The first car got wrecked in a car accident which wasn’t W’s fault and this next car is a blue challenger dodger. Our mom pays bills for W and buys W whatever he needs but W doesn’t appreciate our mom. He curses her out whenever he wants and doesn’t listen to the advice she gives him. This blue car W has, has lead him to speeding and now he has to go to jail at a certain month this year which is close. Our mom doesn’t even care if she lets him step all over her. I stood up for her many times and W curses me out and takes his anger all out on me by physically abusing me. I told our mom how W takes advantage of her but our mom doesn’t like hearing the truth because she already knows and just lets W walk all over her.

Here is how it started:

W told my mom that J needs a place to stay because her mom is selling the house and J will have no where to stay and Our mom says no and talks to my dad about it and he says he doesn’t want any black person staying at this apartment. Our oldest brother had his white girlfriend (M) visit our apartment for a few weeks and then months and she was a nice guest to have and he brought her here without even telling our parents and our parents just let it happen and didn’t question it. W brought this up to our mom and she said good point but can’t J and her kids live with family members? W said they don’t live in the area, they live in a different state and that J Is only gonna be here for a couple of days because she found an apartment and is just waiting for the people to let her know if she gets the apartment and our mom said ok if it’s just for a little bit and that’s when J got her kids S and V and started living with us. We live in an apartment so the space is really small. My little brother and I sleep in the living room on couches. My mom has her own room and so does W. Our dad doesn’t live with us, he lives in a house with his girlfriend and his girlfriend has 2 daughters, one is a teenager and the other is in her twenties. My dad pays rent for the apartment. 

Everything was normal UNTIL 

her and my brother W started arguing. It was just arguments at first and she would be yelling and W would tell her to lower her voice because that’s how she talked when she got mad. W always has his door closed and my mom knocks on the door and asks what’s going on.

2 months pass by and J told me that she broke up with W and I said you’re liying haha and looks at me dead serious saying She did ... she tells me it’s because since her dad use to be in the military and now is a pastor, he talked to W and didn’t like him and W got mad because J’s dad was telling him shit he didn’t like. W left the apartment and came back later with liquor. I give her advice and next day comes by and she is calm and W treats her like a “friend” ..

Fast forward they get back together 3 days later",26Apr2020,1
372,"Hello,

So I have a friend who used to be my coworker.

I have several problems with him, though, which makes me not want to be his friend. Firstly, he’s new in town, which means I’m basically his only friend. As a result, he would call me every day, sometimes multiple times a day, to just fucking chat. The introvert in me hates that, and eventually grew to dread it. Furthermore, he seems to have a passive aggressive attitude. I can give several examples, but it’s not important for the advice I need from you.

Basically, he borrowed my comics a while back. These comics are very important to me, as I’ve had them since childhood and they are hard to obtain. A lot of time passed after I loaned them to him. I kinda started ghosting him a little because he would blow up my phone so much, and didn’t respect my fucking privacy. I would still talk to him
And hang out with him, but it became less and less frequent (to this point, where I don’t really talk to him at all)

One time when we were still talking, I came over to hang out and at some point asked for them back, albeit in a passive way. I just wanted them back in my possession, as he wasn’t reading/using them and they are mine. He literally kinda said nah straight up! Asked something along
The lines of whether I truly neeeded them back. I was so shocked! My personality is non confrontational, and I was so shocked to say fuck yes they are mine and I wanted them back. I think he realized that these fucking comics give a reason to continue our friendship. Like he is basically holding my comics hostage, for if I have them back, there is absolutely no reason for me to speak to him again and he knows it.

I know this sounds childish, but I really want my comics back. The introvert in me is dreading to ask him...for if I ask, he might make a whole fucking hangout out of it. I don’t want to hang out with him, I ideally want to just drive over there, pick up my comics, and drive back home without having to talk much to him or his family.

I have an excuse, as my mom has been asking for them back (they were originally bought by her and are hers). I am thinking of calling him to get them back with this excuse, but can anyone give me some advice on how to approach a potentially passive aggressive person to get back my property? Essentially, I want to navigate this in an inteigent way where I’m not “tricked” by him into him keeping my shit for longer or me being invited inside his house and him making a whole fucking days worth of interaction out of this. Trust me, I fear what this guy can do. Lol I know that sounds ridiculous, but holy fuck I’m stressing out about this. I’m hoping I can use the quarantine situation to my advantage, saying I don’t want to make contact because of the virus and maybe he can just leave it outside his house and I’ll grab it...

Any advice would be appreciated...",26Apr2020,1

I play with him, feed him, his water is always full, etc. I love him. I pet him sometimes but most the time he will bite me.

382,"Background: Our parents divorced when we were young. We have lived in the Philippines all our lives with our dad and weekends with our mom. She went to the US when I was 15  and me and my sister agreed to move there to go to college.

After moving there, we started noticing some toxic traits that we've noticed now that we live with her full time. Despite us being adults (I'm 20, my sister is 19), she still treats us like children. Our curfew is 9, we still have to ask permission to go out, and if we do she insists that she be the one to pick us up. She always asks us to do things or to go with her when doing errands as if we're not doing anything (we had heavy school work) even though a lot of those things she could do by herself. She easily loses her temper over the smallest things and acts like nothing happened. She is diffucult to talk to because she never looks at her own actions and always uses the ""I work hard"" or ""I'm your mother"" excuse. She has made it clear that it doesn't matter if we're adults, she has every right to treat us like this because we ""don't know anything"" and that she still needs to ""guide"" us so we have to follow her. To make matters worse, she chose to immigtate her old parents to live with us, which was not part of the deal when we talked about moving here. My grandparents are carbon copies of my mother and the reason why she's the way she is. Now we have two more mouths to feed, including my mom's boyfriend, when she's already struggling financially to cover our schooling.

Now with the pandemic, we're forced to stay home a lot which is causing more stress. My mom is a nurse and has been very stressful to be around since she lets small things get the best of her when she's stressed. Due to the pandemic, all her attitude is ""justified"" so we can't argue with her.

I have been dealing with this silently by talking to my school therapist but it's starting to take a toll on my sister. She has been the most vocal and rebellious with my mom about her attitude but she has almost always been shut down by her. So far my sister has chosen to deal with this by sneaking out to have casual sex.

I always get stressed when she tells me she's going to sneak out because I have to help her by opening the door for her to leave without the RING door bell alerting.  I also have trouble sleeping because I am anxiously waiting for her to call so I can open the door for her to come back.

My sister got caught once for sneaking out to hang out with her best friend and she tried to call out our mother's behavior again but she dismissed them.

I tried telling her to hold it off until our father's business takes off so he can buys a house and we can move out (which can take years, especially with the coronavirus) or at least until the pandemic is over (so our mom doesn't have a ""reason"" anymore) but she refuses.

I firmly belive that she is acting the way she is as a coping mechanism because of the environment our mother created (she's like that to her boyfriend too, and sometimes to her parents).

I don't know what to do. I'm scared of getting caught again.",26Apr2020,1

I feel an overwhelming sense of guilt over the situation and think partly that I'm not deserving of our relationship due to my own issues, including my disassociation.

390,"Hello, (16) F here and I really need some advice at the moment. Some background is kinda needed I think:

1.) Me and my otter have been together for a year and a half since last Friday.

2.) my partner has been dealing with a lot of mental health issues as of recent (this year recent) and I’ve tried my best to be there for them, as they were with me when I was struggling with my anxiety. (I even encouraged them to talk to their folks about their problems and walk with them when they went to see our school counselor) I wasn’t the best in any regard, but I just wanted to try since I cared about them very much.

So here is my dilemma, used to my partner would text on a frequent basis then slowly as time passed by it sorta declined which I didn’t mind at first! It kinda stunk but they just are not the best at communicating and keeping in touch with people. They have other stuff to do!...But then this started to worry me, it made me feel like they didn’t care. And so I would confront them about it and then other minimal things would just have me worried. Things that shouldn’t have had me worried at all! Like they have a crush on a fictional character? SCARED Their dreams have some form of symbolism that is in the negative sense? TERRIFIED,,,,you can see where I’m going. I got anxious for no reasons other than assuming, and I would always talk to them about it. (Keep that in mind) 

Then later on through July-Dec of last year all sorts of events started happening in their lives, good and bad. And we started to lose touch rather quickly and not be able to go on dates, which again was fine to me. They were dealing with all sorts of stuff and I wouldn’t help if I kept nagging about dates. So I tried to be as understanding as I could. Then this year, they just completely flattened on texting. They would try to text, but rarely could. They had to help their mother with her siblings, school work, ect. And then their mental health started to decline severely, and I tried my best to help and talk to them. Then maybe in February-March  they would only text weekly. Only send a text about what is going on with them and what cool fandom stuff they found then leave for a week and do it again. That’s when it started to hurt a lot. I told them whenever we would say goodbye at school “try to text me if you can! Love you!” I didn’t wanna pressure them in anyway, not have I ever wanted to. I always ask before I would do something “risky” (like hold hands cause I get blushy, pecks on the check/ hand, and stuff like that) and I always respected if they said no. 

Then the week before we got out of school (cause of the whole virus situation) everything was fine. They day before they were feeling terrible. And I felt terrible I couldn’t help, so I tried to make them a small note telling them I loved them and I’ll be here. (I tried to make small “I love you” notes when I can) But I have it to them at a bad time cause by the time I have it to them they were feeling better, and I believe I rekindled why they were so upset,,,I don’t exactly know but I had a feeling. Then they walked to their bus while I did the same.

Now they completely stopped texting me. It hurts like hell and I feel upset. It started to kinda impact my everyday life and is making me unmotivated, I talked to my sister’s Bf about it and he gave me some advice “send them one more message, and if they don’t respond in a week drop em’” which was harsh, but I did send one final message about 3 weeks ago basically saying, “hey honey I think we need to talk about some things and are you ok? Love you” (not exactly it, but that’s what it summed up to be) and then nothing. I’ve talked to some friends about it (my best friend (girl), and my 2 best guy friends) but most have said “it doesn’t take long to send a sort text saying I’m busy” or just a “dang”. 

Everyday I would go back to the message and see if they looked at it (I sent the message on Instagram) and when I was going to the doctor about my foot I decided to look while my grandmother was driving. And lo and behold they opened it, but they didn’t respond....and honestly idk what to do.

One one hand I feel like I can’t be upset, angry, or anything like that since they are dealing with themselves. Mental health is a hard thing to handle with, and i don’t even know how they are doing,,But on the other hand I’m truly and honestly in pain. I’m hurt and I am just upset. They never just left me on read like this. They would always respond later saying “sorry! I was busy!” But not even that. Just a complete read? I don’t even know if they still love me or not,,

I also feel as if it was my fault. Like somehow I was abusive or didn’t treat them right. And it was abusive how I kept asking those questions and maybe pressing them? I feel like I deserve this and I was an awful girlfriend, but when I told my therapist this she said that I wasn’t abusive,,,I even confronted my partner multiple times saying “you don’t have to stay if you don’t want to!” or “If you ever wish to leave you can!” But then that makes me feel like I made them to scared to leave? Like if they did leave they would set something off in me, which 100% is false. I just want them to be happy, and if that involves me or not then so be it. Of course I would be sad but I never want someone to forcibly stay with me just because they feel the need to for my sake and not their own. 

So this is the question of the hour. Should I try to reach out to them again? Just maybe a simple “hey honey we need to talk when you can, love you”? Is it ok I’m upset or is it better for me to try to understand better and give them the benefit of the doubt? I don’t know what to do, but if you all don’t either that’s ok! I don’t want to pressure you all! 

Take care everyone!",26Apr2020,1

392,"Hello. So I’m (19M) in a community college trying to get all my basic classes out of the way and because I didn’t really have any direction after high school. Now I have been told on a regular basis by my family, friends and a couple teachers, that I would be a great teacher. I never really minded these things because I never did well at anything in school except history. Now both of my parents are teachers, I have several aunt and uncles that are teachers and a cousin, so I’m familiar with the workload and things and educational system. So during the 2016 election I got very into politics and I still try to stay up to date and informed. Then one day my girlfriend, several other friends and I were hanging out and I kind of explained basic politics and the positions of government officials and things like that (not pushing my beliefs on anyone). They all said I should teach government and American history. I really sat and thought about it and decided that I would Pursue being a teacher because I enjoy learning about those topics in my free time and thinking about it. I really enjoyed school and specifically the college environment. So my track as of right now is to be a teacher and teach some high school and during summers take more classes to become a professor. 
Now when I came home and told my parents that I planned on being a teacher, they told me to give everything a second thought and that It may not be for me. So I asked some of my friends and several of them agreed with my parents even though before they said I would be great at it. This has been over the course of this semester and I just don’t know what to do about this situation. I apologize for all the grammar/spelling mistakes that I may have made.",26Apr2020,1
393,"  

I feel I should add a general **trigger warning** for suicidal ideation, depression and manipulation of loved ones. Sorry it got so long. If you want to skip the story leading up to where I’m now, you could start with the sixth paragraph. Also, if you think this is the wrong subreddit to ask, please tell me where I should ask instead.

Once you read this, you will know that I’m a horrible person. Yes, I know. You can tell me that but it might drown out others who are able to help, so I’m still asking you not to. I know I don’t deserve help, I don’t feel like anyone should show any compassion at all. But there’s other people who are about to get hurt because of my stupid decisions, people whose only fault is to be connected emotionally to me, so I’m still asking for help. Please, if there is anything immediate you can advise me to do, please help me. I know I should get psychological help and I am going to, I am on a list, but that will take time I don’t have for immediate decisions right now.

For the last 11 years, I wanted to die. I was really scared of telling anyone, even a therapist, because surely I must have a reason for that? I didn’t and I still don’t.  I had a great childhood, my family is and my friends were great. It’s just that most days, every action, every interaction feels like the single hardest thing in the world. Get-together with friends? Quite honestly, doing my country’s equivalent of A-level left me less exhausted. After a talk on the phone, I felt like I had just run a marathon. I do feel joy in some things, but it’s like a tiny spark compared to the surrounding blackness of exhaustion.

Anyway, I just did what I knew others wanted me to do. It was the way of the least resistance and the least painful life. I started to study a subject I still find very interesting, started a job where I the only interaction with others was to explain them something about said subject and found a SO whom I love as much as somebody like me can. Same problem as with my family – SO is a great person who personifies most things good. I’m not good enough for any of them, so I try to suck it up and become a better person.

My SO and my mother both work very hard. I didn’t want to add more stress. And every time I decided I would talk to them, something happened that needed more immediate focus. Worst of all, my father’s stroke. Even though he’s recovered to a big degree, it was such a shock to all of us. My problems exist only in my head, so I felt it wasn’t my place to burden anyone else with them in this time.

But last year, I had enough. I wanted to die and no longer force myself to go through the motions. First, I let go of my friends. This was frighteningly easy to do. Then, I stopped doing anything for university, specifically my thesis. I’ll be dead soon anyway, so why bother? However, I did something horrible in connection to this: I told everyone I was working on my thesis which would be due very soon now. Got them off my back.

But here I am, still sitting here! During this last year I did nothing but try to keep the appearance up and gathering my courage. Neither SO nor my immediate family were phased by my grumpy appearance to make them like me less. Their love was always the same. And last week, I relented. I can’t do it to them. So, I decided to just continue this misery to make them happy. I already contacted my country’s suicide hotline. It doesn’t help a lot, since I shifted from wanting to to wanting not to want to, but it’s better than nothing while I wait for a spot to get psychological help.

Anyway, my life is in shambles barely held together by lies. My job performance will likely recover and I could stretch my savings for half a year if it doesn't. My friends stopped caring a long time ago and I will get over that someday since it’s my own doing. But how do I tell my parents, my SO? I’ve been lying to them for over a year. There *is* no thesis and I’m not even finished with my lectures. How, how, how do I tell them? Both SO and my mom are stretched incredibly thin because they have to work more now with the virus going around. My father seems fine, but anything upsetting upsets him so much his health takes a huge toll. I don’t know how to tell them and I'm so scared of causing him physical harm by telling him.

I dug this hole like an expert and I dug it so deep I can’t see out of it and now I have a new reason not to go on. It would be so much easier at this point. I just don’t know what to do. Yes, I know this is all my fault. I’m still begging you for help. Please, if you don’t want to help me which I totally understand, can you please help those wonderful people about to get hurt by me?",26Apr2020,1
394,"My brother (M15) and his friends basically took advantage of a girl at a party that was at my family's house, which makes it all the worse. My brother had thrown a party without my parents knowing, and the event occurred.

My entire community knew about it. I'm happy that these things are being accounted for, rather than being swept under the rug, allowing for it to happen again. I've been taken advantage of by a guy before. I was in a four-year relationship that was emotionally, verbally, and sexually abusive. I know what it's like to go through something like this. It's horrible. I have immense anger towards my brother for his actions, especially because I know what it's like to be on the other end and because of the amount of evil someone must have to do such a thing. I never would've expected it.

I also want to mention that this event happened three years ago, but it still affects me today. I feel somewhat guilty talking about how this event negatively affected me when it affected the victim much worse, but I've just been dealing with these feelings for a long time and I want advice for how to deal with it.

It was really traumatic for me to come to the realization that my brother would do something like this. I always saw my brother as a good person, so it hurt a lot. I also felt like I didn't know what to say to him after this incident, especially since he began to avoid my entire family. 

I also can't deny the affect this has had on my parents, especially my mom. Everyone in my community has shamed my mom for this, and she has lost a lot of her friends. A lot of her close friends just ghosted her without saying a word. I don't necessarily blame people for doing this, but it wasn't my mom's fault. At the same time, my mom has fallen victim to men trying to take advantage of her too, and she always used to tell me stories and advice on how to avoid it. I don't think she ever realized that her own son would be the perpetrator. 

Lastly, I can't help but feel that others around me are judging me for my brother's actions. I am a  timid girl, and people's opinions affect me a lot for some reason. Sometimes, I feel like people, who used to be really open and friendly to me before, are distant towards me now because of the incident. I feel that people think I am a bad person for my brother's actions, when that isn't the case.

Again, I am not trying to play the victim in this situation, and I want to reiterate that because I know how it feels to be the girl. However, it has been three years and I still am not over these feelings. All advice is greatly appreciated, thank you",26Apr2020,1

397,"So, this is messy and a bit long. 
I’ve (23,F) never really been self confident, I’ve always been a bit on the chubby side, never really felt pretty. Bullied in school, perfectionist parents, etc. so, my self esteem has always been incredibly low. 

I was in a relationship of 4 years which turned about to be physically and emotionally abusive almost 2 years ago, I feared for my life and left him. It still effects me today. I still talk to my ex and tell him I forgive him for how he acted, in fact we’ve slept together a few times since as well. I always feel on edge and terrible afterwards, and he’s still obviously obsessed with me. It seems I’m not able to fully let him go. 

Meanwhile, I met someone new, and we’ve been in the talking stage over a year, because, I stated I don’t want a relationship yet. Anyway, they live kinda far away, so we usually just call and play games together. They’ve been really supportive about my situation and recovery. But I’ve been lying to them about the stuff with my ex. Now, I think they’re weary of my negative mindset and mental health (I constantly have downs, I don’t take my meds, I feel suicidal) and they’re pulling away. I’m getting frustrated with it, I wanted someone to talk to everyday, and someone to seem interested in me, but they haven’t been doing that. It feels like I put more effort in than them. I only feel guilty because I’m burdening them; I feel so comfortable it all comes pouring out. So, I have decided to take a break from them as well - to give us both space. I read something that really resonated with me recently about toxic people how they can drain someone yet keep them in. I feel like that person. 

I need advice, am I a bad person? What can I do to grow and be better. 
I love the guy I’m talking to, but I have this gut-feeling we won’t work. And I still care for my ex, I can’t seem to let it all go? Any advice on what to do?

399,"My(28F) SO's(35m) friends all live in the same village as we do, I don't have many friends but the ones I do have live further away.
When this all started they decided to seperate the friendgroup into pods of 5, so that we can still see each other. (We agreed everyone has 5 people they can see)

Yesterday ""our pod"" came over for dinner and boardgames, I cooked, got everyone drinks etc. 
I missed the first game because I was cleaning the kitchen but I didn't mind.

Recently I stopped drinking and I use cannabis to help me relax and sleep. (This is all in agreement with my doctor, it's a whole different story and not really relevant to this one) 
The last time they were here they insisting on trying, while they already had alcohol. I shared with them, and provided them with water and sugar when they needed it. 

Yesterday when I finally sat down, I decided to roll one instead of using my vape. Everytime I lit it up they all said to each other ""It smells like weed in here"" and they start laughing. When I asked about it one of them said ""we're just not used to it so we make jokes, it's nothing personal"". 

I still don't understand it and I feel like they are mocking me. 
Which kinda pisses me off because I open my home to them and take care of them and the joke makes me feel disrespected in my own home. 

My SO believes they still see it as ""a naughty thing to do"" and therefor it's interesting to them.

We're all adults, they just all grew up alot more sheltered then I did, this is something that we see in our relationship too. 

Am I overthinking this?

I started picking up on this recently just because I wanted to start meeting new people and make friends but Whenever I try to talk with them I always feel just super awkward about how I’m talking to them (if that makes sense) normal conversations don’t flow the same way that they used to, Before when I used to meet new people I was very friendly I was able to carry a conversation if I needed to and I never was really caught up in what should I say right now, But now it’s super hard to keep up a conversation with somebody I have no idea how to continue a conversation with somebody and it ends up sounding either dry on my end or just kind of awkward... does anybody have any advice on how to, I guess, be able to feel natural talking to someone I don’t know?",26Apr2020,1
402,"Hi Reddit,

Sanity check needed. I live in an apartment with a very secluded door. I live with roommates in a relatively safe neighborhood so we have never been in the habit of locking the door before this. 

Since switching to telework, I’ve noticed that around 1-3pm a man will come and jiggle the (unlocked) door handle. This has happened three times that I have noticed, and the first two times I was expecting a package and thought that it may have been the mailman. The third time that this happened with no package I saw a man walking away from the door but only saw the back of his head. 

Today, my roommate forgot to lock the door and heard someone jiggling the door handle around 11am. Needless to say, we are militant about locking the door now.

But my question is, what’s going on? If the door was unlocked all four times, wouldn’t a potential burglar have just walked in?",26Apr2020,1

404,"I've seen this happen a couple of times and asked where she was looking at, and she didn't give me a full answer. She looks pretty committed in our relationship but I suspect a wandering eye on her. I just want to ask the signs of potential warnings she might stray or give in to infidelity if no precautions are taken. Seriously it gets on my nerves.   

There was this one time we were in the police station dealing with a law I crushed by overstaying in her country and she spoke to this young guy who worked there, quite the comedian or flirting type of guy and we were basically sitting there with 4 other officers and she was standing in front of his desk while he was sitting, anyway, they spoke for a good 20 minutes in Russian, and my wife was giggling , pulling her pants up, playing with her hair and stuff and no kidding I was felt betrayed. I even told her to come stand next to me but she boldly refused to do so and continued speaking with this jackass. Later I confronted her with this and asked what that was all about and she just said"" Oh we only spoke a little , he is funny but a stupid guy"" well my gut doesn't agree 

All in all there were a few cases I can see her looking at other man and I understand they can be attractive but you'd only see them because it's quite noticable which doesn't give you the right to look at them even longer or show signs of attraction or even worse LUST. 

And here are some facts whether you like it or not:

Looking at another with desire and lustful curiosity while in the confines of a mutually loving and supportive relationship can indeed erode the trust in our relationship and ultimately incite us to cheat on our partners I believe. 

 Knowing that our partners find others attractive is completely understandable. We are human and are blessed with the ability to recognize and appreciate beauty. However when our gaze becomes lust-driven and is littered with a longing quality, this is when simple appreciation becomes complicated adoration

Not only does it erode our satisfaction with our current relationship, it also makes our partners feel inadequate, unworthy and dangerously insufficient. It is the first sign of emotional abandonment and disengagement in a relationship and gradually erodes the trust we have in our partners ability to be faithful and loyal to us.

A relationship with a person who has a wandering eye is really no relationship at all. It is really just two people killing time trying to be less alone justifying love in an effort to avoid psychosocial failures.

Our culture has done extensive research on the costs of physical infidelity as well as emotional infidelity however we have rarely, if ever heard about the consequences of what I’d like to call “visual infidelity” and what that does to a relationship. We always tend to write it off as innocent curiosity and harmless fun. But looking at another with desire and lustful curiosity while in the confines of a mutually loving and supportive relationship can indeed erode the trust in our relationship and ultimately incite us to cheat on our partners.

It’s really heartbreaking and mildly confusing knowing that the one you want to be with wants to be with someone else. This is the message sent when your partner looks at another person with lust in their eyes.

I am of the belief that a wandering eye leads to a wandering heart and where the heart goes the body is sure to follow and to be honest I was spot on in my assessment. Those who I dated that possessed a wandering eye inevitably cheated on me. Now based on my tried and true lived-through relational traumas, a wandering eye is just an early sign of relational doom. The beginning of the end if you will. Where there is smoke, there is usually fire and I try my best now to abandon those emotional burning buildings before they go up in flames.

Oh and do I like to address when she looks at other men like that? No because that's her own decision and if I'd told her not to , I'd only be deceiving myself!

Edit: not to mention my interactions with your partner changed. I understand there is a language barrier but that doesn't validate the fact she doesn't talk much with me but does so with friends and family and other people. I simply asked this a few times and she says"" it's not necessary to talk always, sometimes feeling it is enough"" and I said ""Well I want to talk and I don't find it enough"" to which she replied ""if you want you can, but not really necessary to always talk"" she is just  not communicating as deeply. Examining the shifts the relationship really worries me. I feel like I'm a fish on the hook and being played with. She can sometimes not hear me out , or not appreciate what I say, pretend like she didn't hear it, or being concentrated on something else irrelevant so much she doesn't hear what I'm saying. These things have significantly increased over the last time and we are only together for 4 months and maybe married for 1 month or so. 

I've seen her history on her phone, on many platforms, web browsers history had been deleted since the day we met and this one time I asked about where the transactions came from on her banking app which displayed guys' names she would say ""I forgot, how would I know, but also I went out with my friend and her husband and he paid me back later"" 

Some stuff disturb me like how she talked with her then-classmate when he called to celebrate her birthday, simply got her number when she went to Moscow to her best friend where he also happened to be they exchanged numbers, the way he talked to her, just so loose and giggly. Speaking of which, when she went to Moscow she overnighted at her friends' place who also happened to have a boyfriend and I've seen videos on her phone where they're all 4 , 3 girls and 1 guy having fun at the party with drinks and stuff, and later when they come together these 3 girls shaking their ass in front of the cam

. The things is I didn't suspect anything , even though this is highly against my standards and respect zone, her behavior now makes me skeptical of what could have happened before me and she might be lying about her past relationships and the fact she had only sexual intercourse once before me.

I've caught her switch accusations towards me, and changing words, or even lying about her past and she denied this it felt like she was gaslighting me no kidding. Still she tries somehow to give me affection and hugs me and stuff but in some occasions I feel like this is not legit. 

I didn't notice it at first, she is 4 months into pregnancy, not really with a ""carnal"" lust but I pick up signals that is close to that direction. I might have overexegerrated my words a little bit. But like I said , it feels like the more space I give to her the looser she gets. I'm trapped basically

Edit: It feels like your thoughts and opinions are locked on mute seriously, sometimes you're seldom ""allowed"" to communicate your feelings, needs, and perspectives. And, in the rare instance that you’re given a mic, their voice seeks to overpower yours. Your spouse may belittle, dismiss or scoff at any fair attempt to express yourself. When I try to set boundaries, they're ignored.
 When you attempt to seek clarity, or perhaps, confront a possible indiscretion, they either distract you or gaslight you, responding with a tight-lipped refusal to address your concerns. She doesn’t want to take ownership (in situations where she objectively should) and will avoid doing so again and again. And, when they seem to take ownership, it’s manipulative and over-the-top, with no change in behavior to support it...

And then for the part when she turns my mind into a soup she goes into attempt striking me with harsh punishment or ridicule, sometimes following it up with Oscar-worthy apologies, showers of praise, and thick layers of tearful self-deprecation. I feel like you’re often walking on eggshells, never knowing when something you do or say might rattle their emotional cage.

At times it feels like qcts of affection and love are seldom exchanged freely—not without an expectation of something in return. Instead, the relationship feels transactional. Very frustrating and feeling left out...

 Basically feels like ego-driven love sometimes whereas I express my authentic love even though we have had our ""quarrals"" she can't get her hidden emotions from under the rug?

Intimacy becoming slowly obsolete, she might abstain from it, when I try to initiate she pushes my hands away, I know that a couple of weeks ago we used to have intercourse 2-3 times a day, now only once per 2 days and I am not even sure whether she ""likes"" it or not. 

Additionally she is hyper-critical, my expectations are getting deflated the instant I turned the corner for my big reveal and they are not met with no compliments sometimes, I get that I bought the wrong pizza or panini whatever, but why are you pulling that face again to me? 

Every minute you are different grow the fuck up or tell me what you really feel you know?

 Different upbringing ,cultural background , slightly different core values but come on... Compare my efforts, sacrifice and energy I gave into this relationship I don't find her actions and behavior rational.

Regardless, every time I get hope, she turns it around and sticks the long end of the p in my arse...

From the looks, it is healthy, whenever she posts the pictures on Instagram to share it with her friends bla bla bla. 

I even went as far as doing a DNA test for the baby because seriously maybe she is a narcissistic liar and she tries to benefit from my EU citizenship? Or am I paranoid, not trying to guilt trip anyone here. 

Honestly I'm tired of writing everything down...

I still try to revive it, especially when there is a baby coming up. Otherwise I can't put up with bullshit like this...",26Apr2020,1

Normally I’m part of our maintenance crew and do things like get carts, clean bathrooms and messes, take out trash and recycling, make sure everything is kind of picked up and orderly. This new department though is strictly for sanitizing the whole store. Basically what they have you doing is going around the store and cleaning things down. Essentially you walk around the store with a cloth/paper towels and disinfectant and wipe stuff down. You cycle through clean certain areas over and over gain. Someone else will do another area. I don’t know quite yet if I’m going to be this yet for certain, but it’s a possibly as I had to do it for a bit today. It is incredibly boring and I don’t know how to make the time pass for 5-6 hours doing that. I’m a high school student who prefers to try and use their brain, but with tasks like this it makes it unbearable. Sorry that might sound dramatic, but I’m just trying to make a point here.",26Apr2020,1

414,"this is just a little something that has bothered me more and more as time goes on. As a kid, I was always seen as the poster child for basketball in my family. Everyone knew I was good and I would practice almost everyday with dreams of just dominating day in and day out. I even ended up being a team captain my senior year when I went to a school with over 650 kids and a good reputation in ball. All that changed my first week of the season.

I ended up doing terrible as even though I would do good in practice, Coach would never put me in for games in order to make time for his favorites. I would openly challenged them and outplay them but I never got the spot my sophomore or junior year . Now my first senior game and I’m sucking? Geez how fun. I ended up getting benched for one of the younger guys and later that week I sustained horrible nerve damage in my left arm that would leave me basically handicapped for 6 months. It still bothers me now and then, but to know that I let all of my peers and loved ones down was a complete bummer. 

I lost all my confidence in turn and now I don’t even know what to do. I don’t know who I am. I feel like I never got a chance to prove my worth, and now everyday it’s in the back of my mind of “what if.” I totally let down my parents even though they never showed up to any of my games. I was always just trying to be the best I could be and I thought it would be good enough; in turn I ended up with nothing and now I’m rejected by almost everyone I know because of what a fuck up I am. All the kids blame me it feels like and they just distanced themselves. I feel like a reject. 

Every week having to go to sports medicine to try and recover what was left of my season and not even getting the green light to at-least sit the bench without warmups never happened. I never was respected or loved the same and I felt alone. 

People will poke fun at me too because I couldn’t even move my arm in the beginning for the first month and when it was out of my arm sleeve it would just fucking flip around like a noodle. But the numbing was traumatizing and the nerves would tingle with pain. I fucking hated every second of it. I let down everyone and I’m not worth shit. I’m a failure. I fucking failed even though I put years and years of dedication and no matter what anyone told me I kept going for nothing. It was all for nothing. I’m a nobody now at my highschool and I don’t even want to talk to anyone because I don’t feel like there is anyone that I CAN talk to about this. I feel like it would only make things worse. I wasted my fucking life and my time on some fucking game. I just want some help and advice... :(",26Apr2020,1
415,"Hello everyone. This might read slightly like an /r/offmychest post and thats because it slightly is, but I also just need help/advice.

Content Warning: Mentions of Racism

So a bit of backstory first. I am a gay white latino man, I grew up in a mostly white city in my country in Latin America, and will be graduating from college in the U.S in around a year. I come from a super catholic and homogenous place, and unfortunately with that came growing up in a society filled with homophobia, colorism, racism, etc. I never really learned about the origins of racism, where it began or even its history in the United States, seeing as I grew up in a different country, and didn’t learn a lot about race politics, gender theory, or anything like that until around the end of high school.

Many of my friends back home (white) used the N-word very non-chalantly, and I unfortunately caught onto that. One time, in an English class I met my teacher [the one who introduced me to a lot of these new topics that I now know about ] and he showed us videos about the Charlottesville protests that were happening around 2016. Me and my friends thought that the KKK members were being ridiculous, so we proceeded to mock them a lot as a joke and impersonate them, saying things in that nasally midwestern white voice like “fuck the n****rs” or “I want my confederate statue up, wah wah!!”

I know...... completely out of line for me to be saying those sentences, or even that word (yes, unfortunately hard R), but we didn’t really know the gravity of the word, and that even if its an impersonation of a racist person, it doesn’t take away the power of the word. After that year in high school, I began learning a lot more and realized how fucked up it was that I used to word so casually, one that didn’t belong to me and had years and years of history and context rooted in internalized oppression and white supremacy, things that I have never, and never will stand for. Since then I have never, ever used that word again, or any form of it. The worst part is, me and my friends used to film those impersonations and I know that somewhere out there there is some video of me saying these terrible things, which not only possess the ability to hurt the black community with incredible hateful and racist words, but that also show an ignorant and uneducated version of myself which I am not proud of. I don’t think a day goes by when I don’t think about this and how stupid, cringey and ignorant it was of me to say those things, and how hurtful those statements are.

To get to my point, I guess I’m looking for advice. Would the best thing for me be to apologize in the present for my past actions, and apologize to any members of the black community (many of my close friends in college are black...). I’m scared that for some reason the video will get out and people will see something that is a) racist and offensive, b)obviously not representative of what I think today, and c) something that can be taken completely out of context.

I don’t know what to do.... I feel terrible everyday and its eating me up inside and I don’t know how to apologize for something like this.",26Apr2020,1
416,"Sooo my friends are trying to convince me it’s essential for the “college experience”, but I’m very set on saving money. It’s $10,000 a year for dorms, but I live like 15 mins away so why not live with my parents for free? I’d like to have more friends but I’m not really interested in partying and all that. The college experience never really interested me, but now my friends are scaring me because I have to decide now. Are dorms really the best for introverts? How would I even make any new friends if I was gonna get a dorm with my already friends? Is it really all that great for an introvert anyways? I would love any advice :)",26Apr2020,1
417,"I am 17 years old and I wanted to use the money to buy something I’ve wanted to get. My job was affected by Covid-19 and is I decided to stop working until the pandemic is over. I filed for unemployment a few weeks ago and I recently got my unemployment benefits plus the $600 surplus. 

My parents called me in to talk today and they said that I would have to give them $500 of the surplus check to help contribute to the household expenses. This caused a big disagreement because I believe that the money I got from my unemployment is mine alone. 

I understand that our whole family is affected by covid-19 and my siblings and I eat more food than usual. Since we go food shopping about once a week, they spend about $350 on groceries which is fair for a family of five in the California Bay Area. Since we are upper middle class, my parents have more than enough money to spot the extra food. They believe that it is also partly their money since they pay more California tax than I do. I proposed a solution which seemed fair, I would be willing to only give them $250 out of the $600 a week which is reasonable since it covers the majority of the food cost. 

It’s not that I am ungrateful for what I have, it’s just that I feel they are taking advantage of me because I now have money that I received from the government. 

My question is: Is it fair that they should take money from my account since I am part of the household or is it unfair because it’s unemployment money I got by myself?",26Apr2020,1
418,"Due to circumstance beyond my control, I moved an hour away from my friends and school my senior year of HS. My school let me do online classes in order to graduate there, but I also had time to start working full time. 

As the year went on, I began to get more and more lonely. So I started playing more and more on my PC. It was my social interaction, I didn't really have the time or money to go interact with anyone in my home town. So I played video games with them. 

And since corona, it has become my main activity, the only thing keeping me from dying of boredom and social isolation. But once this quarantine ends, I know I'll continue to play for hours and hours. 

But I'll be going to college soon, and honestly I'd rather not be playing video games. I know I won't have time unless I distract from the other things I want to do, like getting good marks, or working out, or playing guitar, or hanging out with friends. The only reason I really play video games is to socialize. 

So in order to prevent myself from becoming a self-isolating recluse, and to make sure I have time for what I want to do, I was thinking of selling my graphics card, although I still want to bring my computer. 

Is this a good idea?",26Apr2020,1

426,"Hello reddit! so as of a couple hours ago (around 3 am), i basically got a “saddle injury” from jumping in the pool with someone. I was drunk and feeling a bit silly, but regardless, it happened. 



I pretended like it’s okay and it didn’t hurt.



 went upstairs alone and dealt with it. it hurt and i cried a bunch!

it’s my boyfriends 22nd birthday and i didn’t want to make a scene so i did the best i could with it. he came to check on me and i was full blown panicking by how bad the blood is. i had maybe 4 different people look at my crotch and it sucked- but ultimately determined (one kid who was looking at my hooha is a pre med student) i wouldn’t need stitches unless it was still bleeding by tomorrow.



anyways, the injury is fine, but i can’t stop panicking. i’m shaking constantly. feel awful.  haven’t seen my boyfriend in a couple hours either. i’m worried about everything else going on (school stress, final papers, my friend took one of my online, though not proctored) and this soreness in my crotch which i am thoroughly embarrassed of. my crotch is so swollen i have literally never seen anything look uglier. 

so to sum it down, we’re staying at his friends house with 4 people who have been quarantined here. first people i’ve seen in months- and i bust my vagina and have the worst panic attacks i’ve ever had in my 22 years on the earth- and i want to go home. it’s 6 am, it’s my boyfriend birthday, but i want to just go home. how wrong would it be for me to try and leave later in the day rather than monday? 

i feel awful all together. i didn’t want to come because we’ve been self isolating, but he really wanted to be with his close friends. now i am sad and just want to go. life is hard with a bleeding vagina and anxiety.

434,"I'm 17 years old (female), the oldest sibling out of 3, that is not even close to financial independence and I have a problem with my mum. And the same goes for my sibling and my dad to some degree.
I'm not active much but I try to help with chores. The problem arises when I forget or I don't realize that the dishwasher is full, or that the washing machine has finished washing and well, she screams a lot. She says that she isn't screaming that she is just speaking loudly.
She frequently calls us lazy asses (but is more pejorative in our language). She wants us to help around the flat and garden but we are not sure what to do really, because we're afraid that we do something wrong and she screams at us.
We cannot talk to her properly because she turns even a simple joke to a lecture. And when we state a normal argument she sees it as talking back. She knows the best because she is older than us and thus has greater value, after all, she is our mother. She usually ends the talk with: ""Nobody is going to listen to some teenagers that haven't done anything in their lives!""
When I ask her to help me with something administrative related she just tells me to Google it up. I'm afraid to ask for advice (this actually led to not so significant accidents) and asking twice the same thing after some time leads to another lecture.
In the morning she usually gets up earlier than us and she is angry that we are still sleeping. When hurry to have breakfast, because she is screaming that she is tidying up the table, she gets angry that we haven't managed to change from our PJs and when we are changing she screams at us why are we not eating jet, that she isn't our slave to serve us breakfast and when we take something for breakfast she is upset that we are not eating what was on the table. 
When it comes handy to her, she doesn't believe me on the fact that I lied when l was six.
To be honest we couldn't even apologize to her in the past because she would just say that if we haven't made that mistake, we wouldn't have to apologize. (It  hurt a lot.)
Also, this is a bit shallow, I'm not pretty. I'm chubby, with messy hair and a bit of acne (I hate make up so it's quite visible). Mum calls me obese a lot (she isn't the slimmest person either). It shouldn't bother me that much, but I have a feeling that if a were more pretty I would have more value in her eyes. 
The most recent problem arose a few days back when I sprained my ankle. She was angry with me because I can't move a lot and I can't go to the garden (why she loves the plants so much? They don't do anything, so why she loves them so much and when we sit down to rest for a while she is furious). She was also angry with my dad, because ""he sprained my ankle"" because he took us for a small jaunt to castle ruins and I fell and ""if you went to the garden instead nothing would happen"". She was also angry because dad took me to the emergency, since he was stressed about it being something more serious than a sprained ankle (few times we didn't go to the emergency immediately and it turned out that one time I broke the metatarsal bone of my little toe and the other time I shattered parts of few vertebrae).

I find it important to say that I don't blame her for these things. Her mum is basically the same as she is if not even more extreme so I want not to be angry at her. It just pains me even more when I see my sibling and dad being screamed at without an apparent reason and no explanation. And she isn't like this all day long (it's just becoming more frequent).

Hi all, (TLDR; at the bottom)

As the title suggests, for the past month or so I have been feeling quite unmotivated and possibly depressed, as a result of this, my efforts with university have dropped, and therefore, my grades have also slightly dropped. If I continue in this state, I am certain that they will drop even further, and this course will amount to nothing.

I'm only 23, and haven't experienced anything too crazy in life, just lately I don't see a point with anything. I'm not getting joy out of anything that I typically would thus far.

As I said previously, my grades are starting to drop. I am sure that I am able to complete my studies with good marks, however I no longer feel attached to the career I was beginning to pursue. This happened previously with the last career I pursued, so at this point I feel like I'm just being extremely picky and wasting time. Although, I think that I am being picky for a reason - I have heard time and time again that you should choose a career that you're happy with. Although so far I have thought that the careers I am pursuing sound great and enjoyable, but as I start to study and understand them more, they become quite boring and mundane. To add onto this, I have always heard that one should try to keep debt to a minimum, preferably none if possible, which is why I am considering withdrawing from my studies, so I don't have a lump of debt, and a half-assed degree that wouldn't get me anywhere. 

So far my plan is to push through with my studies with at least decent marks, and to let the ocean take me.

**Side note:** I am not sure of what I want my next career pursuit to be, but I am leaning towards something creative and artistic. Although I don't have any artistic or creative talents and I am very weary of the financial state that being in the artistic/creative field brings along with it. Or as stupid and super cringe as it is, right now I would rather be sailing the world on a boat and simply meeting people, whilst living off the environment with basic necessities.

Sorry for the rambling. I'm just trying to give everyone a sound understanding. 

Thank you all in advance, it is very appreciated. Stay safe, take care, and have an amazing life. I am wishing you all the best.

**TLDR;** I'm super lost, don't know what to do/pursue in life, nor do I feel like there is even a reason to try. Does anybody have advice on something like this?",26Apr2020,1
438,"Before I start, we are both the same gender(females) so nothing weird here. She first taught me in grade 10. We got really close and on the last day of classes she asked me to find things to do together in the summer. We stayed in touch and went to the movies once. In grade 11 I wasn’t in her class but I visited her in break every once in a while &amp; we went out a couple of times. In the summer, she went radio silence unless I texted.
In grade 12, I was back in her class. It was awkward for me because I thought of her more as friend. On her birthday that year, I arranged a surprise party for her with the class and got her a small gift with a note telling how how I loved her despite us growing apart. She responded by promising me never to grow apart, that she will always be there and that she loved me like her own kids, very close friends &amp; sister. We had lunch afterwards and she said she’d like that we do this more often. She would always check on me by texting or calling. 

However, by mid-year I was the only one initiating conversations and it really hurt me. I expressed how I felt to her (maybe not in the best way possible) through a long message, she said she felt lost &amp; confused and was really sorry I felt the way. And that she does truly love me and care about it. She said that love and hurt don’t go together and it seemed that she genuinely felt sorry. I waited for her to say or do anything for the following 2 weeks but nothing... she continued to treat me like a stranger at school. 

I was really hurt and couldn’t take it so I sent her another message telling her I wished we talked things out but i won’t disturb her if that’s what she wants. She told me we could meet up in an hour to talk. We met and she said she never got into such a ‘fight’ ever before and that she won’t take any more accusations. We cleared some misunderstandings on both sides. And she told me that I expected too much from her and that it’s best not to expect anything from anyone to avoid misunderstandings. She told me to ask her anything at the time and she won’t take any of my inquiries again. I asked her if she was okay with us being that close and she said I was impossible and that of course and relationships just happen. But I still felt distant and unfortunately hurt. So I tried to lower my expectations cause I feel like I’m just another student to her and she means more to me than I do to her.

Covid19 came and I didn’t think we would talk but surprisingly she texted to check on me and has been nicer to me. However, I don’t want to get attached to her and get hurt again cause it still hurts tbh and I don’t think I can take it anymore. Also, a week ago she was having a problem with my class and asked me to help and I was there for her and she she thanked me for it and said she loved me and referred to me as her daughter and it really hurt. I don’t want to get attached to her and I’m not completely over her either. So, what do you think.. Is it possible that she still cares about our friendship? How do I stop hurting over this.. Should I keep distance? If so, how because it’s really hard for me",26Apr2020,1
439,"I know that studying shouldn't be your biggest problem during this horrible pandemic. 

However, I had specific plans for the future, for example studying abroad and doing internships in other countries. These plans were set to stone, they were 100% coming up soon.

It actually requires me to do all my exams until January 2021. It would have been difficult during normal circumstances but very doable. 

During this pandemic, I am super unproductive. I used to study 8-9 hours straight every day (I am studying law). I would do that in the libraries where I could focus best. Now I am stuck at home and I have a very active and large family. Unfortunately, I am stuck at home now and I don't even have my own room. I am sharing it with 2 brothers. So the circumstances for studying are...really terrible. I am the only one who is stuck with studying, writing a thesis, and doing homework. Everyone else is just making the best of this pandemic. My brothers are finished with their studies, so they are just having fun. And I can't tell them to just shut up or leave the room. They didn't choose this either so I won't torture them like that. I know, I know, some people have it worse. I know. 

I can't even study for 1 hour straight. My exam is coming up in 17 days and this exam is HUGE. I don't feel nearly as prepared as I should be at this point. And if that wasn't enough, I am going back to the office in 7 days, so work will consume lots and lots of hours that I could invest in studying. I have already failed one exam lately and failing that exam got my mood down extremely. I just feel so bad.",26Apr2020,1
440,"Late last night I was quite tired and was talking with my friends on Snapchat when I got added by a random stranger, I accepted because I was curious and it quickly turned out that it was a bit of some sort which was sending messages, asking if I was 18 and stuff (I'm 19) and then saying she wanted to have sex, I was very weary and sent 1 word answers and was generally just stringing the conversation along, then the girl sent a close up snap of her privates, which shocked me. I carried on talking still sending nothing really because I was sure it was some sort of scam, playing along a bit and sending winky faces. She then sent a picture of her face and she looked really young, at the beginning she had told me she was 18 so at this point I questioned her and she said she just looks young and had plastic surgery. Now this reeked of bullshit but I was to tired to give a shit so I just answered ""oh ok I doubt you need it"" , she carried on with some suggestive messages and I responded in an enabling sort of manner, going ""haha me to""  before just going to sleep.

I woke up to her having in added me, which was no big deal, but with a fresh mind I looked through the messages and realized that she could have been scamming me, I searched variations of her snap name on Instagram and think I found a similar account which is definitely under age. I freaked out blocked her and deleted all my messages, I don't want to have anything to do with it and I feel sick in the stomach how could I have been so blind. 

In short: a under age girl added me on Snapchat and sent me a nude and lied about her age after I questioned her about it, I didn't send anything back and didn't really do much but passively sit in the conversation but I feel a horrible guilt because I enabled this conversation by letting it reach this point, I thought I was just stringing on a scammer or something but I was wrong.

441,"My best friend and I are studying in different colleges for bachelor degree. He has been my best friend for quite a while and we have helped each other quite a bit and have always tried to return each others favour.

Backstory:

Last year, my longtime gf broke up with me. And as I was quite close to her, it led to quite a rough period in my life. I started to feel very lonely and would end up crying and not doing anything for days. I needed someone to talk to and wasn't comfortable sharing it others. He consoled me during this phase and tried to talk to me on phone whenever possible. This happened for about a week to 10 days after which I was able to take control of my life.

Just after this, I figured out that he had a pending python project from college which was due in a week's time. And he hadn't started it at that point. He along with his project mates didn't have the basic understanding of python at that point. I spent the next 5-6 days working days and night on his project and somehow was able to finish it. I told him that it was the last time and I will always guide him but not complete his entire project.

Current Scenario:

Fast forward to current scenario:

He again wants me to do his project (web development) again. I have been trying to guide him to complete his project since the second week of March. I told him to learn python and other related technologies in the next 2 weeks and then go ahead with the project even if he had finished learning. Because I feel you can always learn will doing especially programming and you can never learn everything. I have been reminding him every week twice to work on the project and keeping in touch with what's going on. He delayed starting the project and to help him I designed (on abstract level, not code) how different parts of project would interact. Last week, he had barely started and I  reminded him that he needs to work on this without waste time. And he assured me that he would do it. But last week he spent on watching Game of thrones from start to finish. And now, he doesn't want my help rather he wants me to complete his project from scratch. At the same time, I am doing internship at a company and I am busy during the day and there is no guarantee that if I work on his project for the remaining time that I will be able to complete it. I feel like I am being used and he hasn't tried hard enough.

What should I do in this situation?
Thanks, in advance, for the help.",26Apr2020,1

443,"i’m 16f and live with my dad (D), his girlfriend of 7’ish months ((DGF).. who he openly plans to marry), and my 13yo half-sister. because of family issues, S and i very recently just moved back in with D. first time living with DGF but S and i are very, very close to her as our mother is not in the picture at all. 

our house is currently being remodeled by all of us together so it’s our first “family project” and we all had pretty high hopes. S and i got our rooms done but the remaining space of the house is yet to be touched really so it’s cluttered. D has suffered a lot of mental health issues + recovering drug addict but i love him nonetheless, DGF does too and i KNOW it. D and DGF argue very often; D’s just very insecure when it comes to ANYONE. he accuses DGF of cheating when texting her ex husband only about seeing her kid, accuses me of not caring about him and siding with her (he does this when i tell him to not bring me into their arguments to take sides), believes she is manipulating S and i so makes her record almost any one-on-one conversation, has threatened suicide to her and even me being there sometimes.. and much, much more.

it’s 5:33am right now and i haven’t slept yet because D and DGF have been arguing. our house is small so i can feel it shake with almost every move of theirs and, when they argue, D tends to knock things over. i’ve had a bad experience with boys in my life so my anxiety can’t help but make me think he hurts her. my anxiety can’t help but make me think he’ll hurt himself or maybe even hurt me because i’m the one to stand up when he yells at S for no reason, yells at me, or drags me in between their arguments. he openly compares DGF’s non-willingness to bring me in the argument to my mom leaving our family because she “wants nothing to do with me,” which i very obviously disagree with.

my worst fear is D hurting S. i care about her a lot and, again, because of family issues, we’ve had to live with other family together at some point so we’re all we have. i see it as we’re in it together. i think it’s aggravating when D thinks he’s a suitable parent for her because, if it were my choice, i would prefer at least only i live here during these conditions. she’s been put through a lot at only age 13. 

i’m not sure what i’m asking for advice on, i just have no idea how to cope. i’m too afraid to approach this because i live in a pretty rural area.. every above the age 25 has been raised through the rough so this is “normal” and i know it. but i don’t want to be raised through this and, if DGF and D are still together then, i don’t want to leave S to deal with this alone because i know i’m going to leave as soon as i hit 18, whether it be with my older sister (19yo that i know opens her home to me + S) or on my own.

444,"My coworker is married and apparently he has a baby on the way. I've only ever talked to him in the staff room during break and some times on the floor since we're in departments beside each other. 

The first time I noticed something was up, was around Valentine's day when he asked me if I had a date which I didn't think much of atm. Anyway that same week he made some dirty jokes and I started to keep my distance from him.

Around that time, another coworker mentioned ""someone likes you in that department"" and honestly I didn't believe it because I've heard rumors about guys from management liking me aswell so I just ignored it since I only go there for my job and not drama.

Now a few days ago we were working together and out of no where he asked for my number and since my mind was focused on my work, I just gave it without thinking anything of it. Yes, I know that was really stupid of me. I immediately regretted but what could I have done...

Now today he messaged me saying ""hi,"" I was kinda shocked but also kinda expected that. However I did not want to respond because of my gut feeling. My friends also said not to respond and just block him so that's what I did. 

Did I do the right thing? I just don't want him messaging me since he's married and I don't even think of him as anything other than a coworker. Plus there's no reason for him to message me since we're not even in the same department. So I believe  my gut feeling.",26Apr2020,1
445,"First I love my mom, and she is a genuinely kind and caring person. Unfortunately she is  very naive and susceptible to false information. Since she divorced my dad 15 years ago she became more and more susceptible to fake news and the kind of conspiracy theories that are completely false.

To give you a better understanding. It started when she still was married to my dad. When she got diagnosed with chronic rheumatism. She was advised to take cortisone shots. She did not want to do that and against the advice of the doctor and my dad, she started to not do the shots and started to trust a miracle healer. This plus the fact that my dad is a big asshole let to the divorce and her getting in a relationship with a guy that is nice and kind to her but is not the brightest light bulb in the shop.  

5 Years later, she had to do the cortisol shots because the miracle healer did not work for her. But even though she was proven wrong, she got more and more naive. It seems like she is not able between information that is true and backed by research and information that is false. This is reinforced by a heavy case of computer illiteracy

For example: One day she walked into my room and grabbed me by the arm and told me I have to come to her computer, she showed me a comment under a YouTube video where someone posted something like ""Pyramids where in fact ancient nuclear power plants"". And from the look on her face I could tell she 100% believed it. I had to explain to her what a comment section is and why she should not trust such things at all. 

I also noticed, that she really dislikes being proven wrong. Perhaps because the old story with of my dad. Me and my brother both are big science nerds, we both are in a master program and have a good education. Still, she does act like we are little children and does not believe us when we tell her that the information  she has is wrong.

This reached its peak yesterday, as my brother had an argument over the phone with her. They talked about the corona outbreak and this led to the talk about vaccination. She told him in all seriousness that vaccinations contain mercury and are designed to harm people, that the corona outbreak was made by the government to get rid of old people etc. My brother did his best to convince her and used  logical reasoning to change her mind, but to no avail. 

After the argument with my brother she called me, to tell me how ""bad"" my brother just behaved for questioning her. I asked what the subject was and immediately started defend my brother. Still, she did not believe me to.

So, after this argument, my brother and me where both very shocked and concerned about her. We both knew she was gullible but this is going to0 far. What if she falls for pyramid scam, a cult or in fact really does not do her vaccinations? I see a lot of potential harm coming too her is this continues. 

I do not get why she trusts the people that tell her these things more than us. We both have bachelors degrees and are working to become scientists she must accept that we in some cases we are more credible than her friend who works as a mechanic. 

Logical reasoning does not work on her, do you have an idea how I could help her? I really love her, and I am scared for her, she is such a kind and strong women, I do not want her to be like that. I was thinking to give her a kind of  ""workshop"" about how to think critical or something, but I  think that this will not change a thing.",26Apr2020,1

Around three hours ago our house caught on fire, after it was put out we were told the attic collapsed on our rooms and the smoke and water damage left pretty much everything. They still have to go in and see if there’s anything under the rubble but it looks grim. 

I’m still in school and work part time and so does my brother. Him and I lost all our personal belongings and gifts from our deceased grandmother. Not to mention our computers that held all of our photos of our family and friends. Any back up we had was destroyed. 

I’m not sure how to move on from this. It’s only been a few hours and currently I feel numb but I know it’s going to hurt for awhile. I don’t know how I’m going to rebuild everything I lost. Currently we are staying with at our fathers home and our mother is staying else where with our kitty.

449,"My girlfriend and I moved into a sub-basement in a small townhouse complex about 6 months ago.  We noticed very early on that the family of 4 that lives above us makes a lot of noise, they stomp around and it sounds like they're constantly moving furniture or something. The two adults don't go to sleep until 2 or 3 in the morning so we usually can't sleep until then because of all the noise they make stomping around. 

When we moved in we thought we would get used to the noise and just learn to tune it out, but it doesn't look like that is happening. Asking them to be stop doesn't work either, I'll knock on their door and tell them we are trying to sleep and withing 20 minute they're stomping around again. 

They prevent me from sleeping or wake me up at least 3-4 times a week. I'm at my tipping point, currently crying and writing this at 4:48am because neighbor woke me up with a very early morning cooking session (That's what it sounds like at least). 

What can I do to improve our situation? I haven't contacted landlord yet because I honestly don't know what they'll be able to do about it.

Usually when I feel anger, I bottle it even more and rarely express it towards people around, but I have had a few instances since I take the medication where I expressed my anger quite seemingly.

451,"I took a job in February and have been furloughed for a month and some due to COVID-19.  I recently received a call-back to return to work, and since then I've been uncomfortable with the thought of returning.  Part of it is having immunocompromised family that could be put at risk.  The far larger part I can't deny anymore.  I hate my job.  I hate the complete lack of direction, organization, or even goals beyond ""it gets done eventually.""  I hate the long commute, the 8 hours with 1 hour unpaid lunch, the lack of natural light in my office, the horrible sick time and vacation time policy (for what I'm told is industry standard anyhow), the almost nonexistent management and potential for promotion.  I hate that the work is completely without challenge or feeling like I'm improving my skills.  I hate the subject of the work being that it's completely uninteresting to me on every level.


For a bit of background, I am a recent college grad with a BS in CS, and applied for around 5-10 jobs before this one offered a position in software engineering.  Reviews on glassdoor had warnings about the lack of organization or movement up the ladder but I figured I would ignore it, work the job for a year or two, and build experience for a new one.  But I don't know if I can make it that long and the slow burn of realizing I could be stuck doing things like this for twice as long as I've been alive or more has been...demoralizing at the very least.  I love programming and problem solving but at this job I've been nothing more than a UI developer redesigning open source software to fit the needs of the end user.  All the heavy lifting is done by the hardware and libraries provided by the vendor and when I was working, most of my time was spent trying to find anything I could do to appear busy as there was precious little to be done in the first place.  I had taken an unpaid internship for 9 weeks as part of the curriculum to get my degree and that work felt miles more rewarding than what I do now.


Am I being unreasonable and entitled for thinking this way?  Is it normal to wake up to do something you don't enjoy to build a better life for yourself later on?  Is it too soon into a new job to feel this way?  I have thought of quitting and beginning my job search anew (and have already applied a few places though I doubt much will be happening these next few weeks) as the student loan freeze and interest removal until October has removed my financial burden for work.


I've been unable to sleep thinking about this and I could use any advice from anyone who's felt this way or seen someone feeling this way... thanks in advance.",26Apr2020,1
452,"I 23F grew up like an only child. My siblings were all over eighteen when I was born. My parents divorced when I was young and my mom moved to the US. 

She remarried when I was ten. My step dad, J. Has made my life hell from the moment he married my mom. 

For years I was only put to clean. I’d finish homework and go to the living room to have him yell at me to clean after him and my mom. So i would. Eventually my brothers wife called it out one day while visiting that they treated me like a maid. 

He’d try to sneak in my room. Was constantly drunk and very verbally abusive. 

When high school came, we moved to a different city. Which took me away from family members. When we did visit, aunts would whisper that when I left the room J would talk horribly about me. 

My mom was always aware but she never did anything. He’d gone as far as:

Throwing the kitchen trash bag on top of my bed (because i put some trash in it.)

Throwing dirt while i was washing in the washing machine. (Because he wanted to use it) he also limited what times I could use it.

Throwing mop water in my room floor or swelling the hall and throwing the trash in my floor. 

He broke my door after I began locking my room. 

Drilled holes on the wall and tried to watch me change. 

He threw away my graduation picture the second it was received. 

I couldn’t eat their food. They would only cook for themselves. If I bought food they would throw it away. 

The list goes on. I do have resentment against my mom and all the family members that were aware of this growing up. I did reach out to a teacher and she didn’t report it to CPS. 

I’ll be graduating college soon. I currently live with my boyfriend. I have been in therapy since my freshman year of college, I plan to have a career helping children like I once was. 

But there is always the how. How can i celebrate life’s moments with my family while picking who can and can’t go. 

I’m on okay terms with my siblings. My mom and I don’t have the best relationship but once I moved out, she became very apologetic and sensitive about me visiting and calling. I come from a large family with over 25 aunts and uncles from my parents siblings. I can possibly pick like three that I love and we’re supportive to me. 

How can I include my mother but no step father, my aunt x but not aunt a, b, and c. Cousin A but no b and so on. From such a large family you’d think there would be more brains but nope.

453,"This is a long one. 

My mother never remarried after my dad passed at a very young age. She never held down a job when I was growing up, received some social security benefits and that’s how we lived. She’s the type of person that doesn’t like to discuss finances or her personal situations and shoves them under the rug until they boil over. She was forced to sell our home when I was in high school because the social security checks stopped and she didn’t want to question it (Years later I pester the SS office and receive back checks all because she didn’t fill out a form). Once she sold our home, she moved out of state to buy another one well out of her means. Profit from the sale of the house ran out, couldn’t pay bills so she sold that house and moved to a townhouse, lived off the profit of that home and it ran out. See a pattern? Well, she didn’t make any profit from the house. This was all over a span of the four years I was in college. 

Fast forward many years and she’s been following me everywhere I go. She took over an old apartment lease for a few years, then I co-signed for her for the next one and finally my husband and I built a house with an apartment for her. This was our living situation for the past five years. My husband is a saint, he has done so much for her through the years. 

When our daughter was born, it was great to have her there until when we asked her to stop smoking and she wouldn’t. She started criticizing both of us about how we parent and constantly picks fights with me about how I raise my child, the food we feed her, saying things like we’re going to hurt her and even criticized the fact that I breastfed her (what?!). My mother says mean things to me and always has my entire life and I’ve said very mean things back to her - our relationship is not respectful, it’s overbearing on both ends and I’m just as controlling as she is (hello, reality). 

So we recently sold the house we were all living in to support a huge career move for me to another state. We gave my mom the option to stay there since her siblings are in the same city. She said no, she wants to come. We secure a bigger place to accommodate, but the new city is far more expensive and now we are under one roof. The smoking never stopped, criticizing continued, I realized just how much she drinks at night and forgets everything. She texts me things like she hates it there and we are crazy and paranoid because we don’t like her smoking. I catch her smoking in the finished office out back (totally against our rental agreement). We fight everyday and there’s a breaking point a few months ago. She threatens to leave, I call her bluff and buy her a plane ticket back and tell her to find her own place. She was there for THREE FUCKING MONTHS and secured nothing. I knew it. I told her we were finding a smaller place for less rent since she’s moving out. We’ll pay for everything to ship back, she just has to pack it. Pandemic hits, she’s back and apparently didn’t believe me that we were moving. Empty POD was on the driveway for her and all the packing materials in the house, I gave her two weeks to pack. I told her she can’t stay with us because I’m not exposing my daughter right now. 

The past two weeks have been fight after fight. She guilts me that she can’t come see my daughter, that I’m kicking her out. I try to find her an apartment but she finds every excuse not to do it. So I gave up. She has a plane ticket paid for, her car is secured for shipping and a two week hotel stay at her destination to quarantine before going to stay with family. WHAT ELSE AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?!

455,"*I don't know if this is the best place to post this, but I'm kinda hoping that someone who has struggled with eating disorder will see this since you might be able to understand my girlfriend a little better. Also, I'll avoid writing out numbers and so...* 

We've been together for 1,5 year, and our relationship is mostly great and I feel very loved by her. The problem is that lately after she found out my weight, she has made a few insensitive comments.

Whenever she did comment on my body or weight insensitively I called her out and said that she hurt me. We managed to fix it (or so I thought) through talking and had a convo that I thought was respectful and great. ""That was it"", I thought. I also need to add a detail: One reason why I forgave her pretty quickly is her life situation. She has a pretty serious eating disorder that got way worse during quarantine, and her mom constantly makes cruel comments on her weight and body. So I thought maybe this behavior was ""normalized"" to her and she didn't realize the severity of it.

But today she said something that was just.... so damn hurtful to me. She said that she thinks she might have gained a little weight and then said: ""I don't wanna weigh as much as you. I don't wanna look like you. Just no"". This happened over text. I'm a little ""bigger"" than her, but not a lot. 

I'm so hurt and angry by this. I don't know if I' overreacting, but it's so hurtful. When I look at her body I think about how much I love and admire it. But apparently, she looks at my body and thinks ""ew, I don't wanna look like that""? She has said that she's attracted to me but this makes me doubt that.

Another strange thing is that before she knew my weight, she had actually said things like ""I wish I could look like you"" and ""I don't understand how you used to think you were fat"". So what changed? I gained a tiny bit of weight, but it's so little it's barely noticeable. 

I love her so much. Like, so much. I can't even imagine my life and future without her. But this hurt me so bad. I think it's so terrible and disrespectful...

I guess I want some advice about how I should react, because I honestly have no idea how bad this is and if I'm overreacting or not. Keep in mind that she has an eating disorder and literally sees herself as obese and she's not even close to that. 

**Added:** I was so hurt and just asked her straight up if she thinks my body is gross. She ignored me question but I insisted, and eventually I got an (kinda unclear) answer:"" I don't know. Keep in mind that I'm sick, I weigh x kg and I think I'm disgusting"".

Before I get too far in about myself, no I am not moving to Vegas for the partying and gambling. 

I’m a 22 year old from Grand Rapids, Michigan. I’ve lived here my whole life, actually on the same side of town. While I’ve moved to different houses/apartments it’s been generally within 15 minutes. And of course, like every Midwest person can tell you...my whole family lives here and everyone I’ve ever met is still there. It sounds great if you don’t want to Move across the country by yourself to start a new and exciting adventure. But if you do it’s quite a hard decision to make...

There isn’t anything “wrong” with my city. It’s actually growing extremely fast and becoming expensive to live here. The average cost of a studio apartment is about 800-900/month. But I’ve found my way around that with some good roommates/friends. 

The idea to move to Vegas hit me while I was vacationing there. Now, while I was there to have fun, I gambled a GRAND TOTAL OF....about 45$. You see, in Vegas there is so much to see and experience just by walking around. And you also have to remember that about half the people you will encounter are having the “time of their lives” so it’s safe to say you will get smiles and great conversation everywhere you go no matter what time of day it is. 

The parks are so beautiful and well kept. There are no pot holes in the roads, let me say that again for the midwest. THERE ARE NO POTHOLES in Las Vegas. I couldn’t spot a single rush mark on an car I’m a whole week while I was visiting. And everything just seems to be more clean. 

But enough about the looks, the city is constantly thriving and full of jobs. Myself working in culinary I can get a job pretty easily there I’m certain of that. Plus I have enough saved for about 6 months of expenses so I have 

I’m scared that I’ll get a phone call that my mother (who has AFIB heart disease) is in the hospital and I’m too far away to say goodbye one last time. It’s just been me and her since I was a baby. She didn’t have any help with me for a long time until I was older. My siblings come from my dad (half blood) so she has no other children and we keep in contact every single day as she also suffers from severe anxiety and depression.  She now has a husband who helps her and loves her and I’m so grateful for it everyday. I haven’t told her or anybody about my Wanting to move. 
It would mean No more birthday parties for my mom or sisters or nieces and nephews. my grandma, who now lives on her own after my grandfather passing. She stays in town now after selling their house 2nd home in Florida so she can be closer to all of us here in Michigan. So you can see why I feel so terrible about wanting to move away after she made the decision to permanently stay. 

The part of me that tells me I should go wants adventure and something new that I can’t get in this bubble of comfort and familiarity. All my old best friends have either had kids and became so busy we don’t even talk or unfortunately died or went down a wrong path. I haven’t gotten lucky with being able to say I still keep in contact with old best friends or even have any now. Well I can say I have 1 good friend that I’m living with but that’s another story, he has his own situation is usually busy dealing with it.

458,"I know this is a trivial issue really, especially given the current climate, but it's got to me more than I expected.

Background: bought a house last year. Saved up through 2019 to buy a new kitchen which the house desperately needed.

Had it installed in February 2020.

I'm usually very careful with my belongings but in this case I use a little disinfectant on the worktop to remove some left over glue from the installation and it has now left a stain in the laminate.

It's my own fault sure, and the stain is only about an inch circled, but I see it every time I go in there and I hate having spent all that money, on something that is meant to last 20+ years and within 2 months I've marked it...

As far as I know the staining is permanent as well.",26Apr2020,1

The only person that’s not his family that knows about it is his girlfriend who somehow knew about it before he did. He didn’t tell us about it because he didn’t want to be a burden upon us.

461,"I’m an avid baker who runs a baking page on social media (Facebook) as a source of income. Every single month I come up with creative ideas to offer and for every single holiday as well. Then I post my menu/offerings on my page.

A friend of mine who also bake, has copied me about four or five times now. They have completely taken my ideas and made them as their own. Not only that, they wrote, worded, phrased their “menu” exactly like mine with the exact same items offered. Minimal differences throughout and I am not the only one who noticed the extreme similarities. 

While this may seem childish, it’s something that I find to be rude and offensive. Obviously I didn’t invent baking. The baking world is huge and everyone shares their ideas with one another. People can bake whatever they want, whenever they want, but to have a so-called “friend” straight up take my exact ideas and how I write them word word who lives in the same area with the same client base, is downright shady to me. 

I’ve grown to think that they believe I won’t notice or that I won’t confront them. It’s just so blatantly obvious and this feels like the last straw. 

So, how would you handle this situation? I’m not good with confrontation because I am a people pleaser who doesn’t like drama, but I’m so pissed off at the same time.",26Apr2020,1

Hello!!😃😃
I'm Randy (23)and I made a backup account because I am putting myself out here and just genuinely asking what it is what I do and it repulses other women sometimes, so not all, but the majority of cute ones romantically.
I have had some super cute woman as friends and they are always a fan of how I can talk about philosophy and do intelligent stuff with them.
Cool though because that is a thing that moves you forward in life, but I also want to start cuddling with someone now now.

Think I am either too serious, strict or boring or dramatic according to the 'loose girls' because I don't like to to go to a nightclub etc. 
Also Im just very honest about my autistic moodswings, but I never intentionally bother people with shit.
However I am in no way ashamed of my personality towards everyone and I know I don't need to be fixed because self work comes naturally to me anyways and I admit it when I see flaws.
I won't change for anybody but I just need you nice women to help me put some pieces of the puzzle together please on what it is that seems to be repelling some woman. 
I just wonder about this since years so, aye it's about time i'd ask😃

I just hate myself and feel like such a bad person. I wish I could change my entire personality or just be born as a different person because I hate everything about myself. I remember once I asked my friends for a few of my positive and negative traits for a test I needed to do and the negative one was ""moody"" because when I am upset I tend to withdraw and go quiet but that they don't think im narcissistic?. I am going to maybe ask them to completely honestly tell me if they think I act narcissistic or am a bad friend.

I made new friends alone and was really excited to change it up from highschool. In highschool, my best friend, well call him T, was really clingy. If i invited him over on a friday, he would typically spend friday, saturday and sunday at my house and, at first, I didn’t necessarily mind, but it eventually got pretty annoying so I quit inviting him over. (He never invited me to do anything btw, he if ever asked me to hang out and I said yes he would ask me what time can I come over) Long story short, there was a time period where I stopped making an effort to hangout with him because I felt like the relationship became toxic and we spent way too much time together.

469,"I'm \[17M\] an only child and I live with my two biological parents \[49M\]\[51F\].

My father used to have anger issues in the past, it was mostly verbal. (He also a high blood pressure). However, my mother told me that on their first year of marriage, around 27 years ago, he slapped her on her cheek, and it was extremely uncalled for. She cried. My mother doesn't have the strongest personality so she doesn't say anything. He did apologize later on, though.

The anger issues diminished over the years. During my childhood, he used to get mad and shout for the dumbest reasons. But I'd say for the past 5 years or so he rarely raised his voice at me. He would still do it to my mom from time to time during arguments, though.

However, today he did something that made my mother want to cry again. My father likes to watch TV in the living room, he lays down on the couch but whenever he's done it would be messy and he doesn't clean up after himself. Pillows all over the place, a blanket on the couch, curtains closed in broad daylight, he also moves this table near the couch to put the remote controllers and his phones, usually, there's also food nearby, sometimes tissues and empty food packets. My mother usually tidies up the place after him but he'd often ask her what's the need of doing so when there aren't any guests coming over. Here's how today's conversation went after he found the living room tidied up.

Dad: Why do you always tidy up after me? We're in quarantine and no guests are coming over.

Mom: I'm not tidying up because of guests, I'm doing it because -

Dad: (raising his voice) DON'T USE THE WORD ""TIDYING"" IT MAKES ME SEEM DIRTY WHICH I'M NOT. 

Mom: You're the one that said tidying up first, why can't I say it?

Dad: \[some unintelligible voice raising\] Thank your God that I respect you.

Mom: What do you mean? Are you saying you shouldn't respect me?

Dad: Yes. Who even respects you women?

My mother then went to the kitchen to distract herself as she wanted to cry.

It's also worth noting that my dad restricts my mother in terms of leaving the house. She has to get his permission before leaving the house, he needs to know where and why she's going. Sometimes he doesn't let her leave for very unconvincing reasons, while he leaves and comes as he may. Sometimes he gets annoyed when she leaves without telling him, and other times he doesn't mind.

That night happened long ago and we're still arguing, I keep saying I'm still the same old kid they know and love yet they won't treat me like I'm just a kid with a  different perspective,

They'd treat like I've been possessed by a demon and they think that gradually opening me up to everything Filipino and Catholic would turn me back, one night I got tired and told her these words (I have a partial eidetic memory and I'm a very forgetful person in the same time, I don't believe myself either).

474,"Since I’ve become sexually active (my mom is aware that I am, I’m on birth control and all of that) I’ve started sneaking out more- and It’s really been bothering me. 


I feel like things would be so much easier if I could just let my mom know where I’m going or who I’m going with. It would at least make me feel safer and I wouldn’t have to go through so much of a hassle to do it. 


Lately I’ve been sneaking out late into the night/ early into the day and I honestly haven’t been the most subtle with it- I’m pretty sure my mom has a feeling since she uncharacteristically cop knocked on my door and yelled my name at 2am just to say “hello” despite the fact that shed never done anything like that before- ever. She could’ve easily just said hello and I would’ve definitely heard her, her room is right across from mine and the walls aren’t the thickest. 


When she found out I was sexually active (found condoms &amp; BC in my room when we were watching TV together) she did mention that she wanted me to at least let her know when I was going somewhere or where I was going- but I still kind of feel iffy. I’m worried that if I do tell her that she’d stop me entirely or start monitoring my movements more.  This time particularly I really don’t want to tell her who I’m having sex with (if you’re curious as to why, just DM me)


**Me and the person I’ve been having sex with have been quarantining and taking safety precautions- we haven’t been intimate with anyone but each other- so pls don’t give me the lecture**


But? Really, how do I bring this up to my mom? I have plans to go to his place tonight and spend the night but I feel like my moms suspicious already. If she were to bang on my door like a cop again and yell and I’m not there I’d definitely get in trouble.

She is in a key position, so if her job is not done right then it has quite a significant effect on other operations as well. I tried to talk to her on numerous occasions, but unfortunately it didn’t change anything. Back in December, way before COVID-19 was a thing in my part of the world, I made a decision to let go of her in July, when her contract expires. 

However, then the virus hit and as we all know, the global economy is about to get tanked. Right now I feel extremely torn because I know that if I let go of this person then probably she will have a very hard time finding another job, and I really don’t want to destroy her life (she is a very qualified person with a strong CV, so under normal circumstances she could be employed elsewhere quite easily). On the other hand, I’m not satisfied with her work, and if I keep her in her position I cannot hire someone who could do it right. My company has a very strict internal policy that regulates the number of employees and we are at full quota, therefore the only way to hire somebody is to fire somebody before. I cannot really reshuffle people either, as her job is quite specific and nobody else has the necessary skills and qualifications.

She said she was scared for his life, and scared to send him to rehab because he is immuno-compromised (so is she, she has COPD, and they live together). I tell her give me a little while to work something out and get my thoughts together and I’ll call back. I call back, no answer. Finally she calls me back and I can hear it in her voice, she’s drunk, too. I asked her if she had been drinking and she flat out denied it, saying she had just woke up from a nap. I know what my mom sounds like when she just woke up, and it’s not like that. 

I have to call her this morning to check on my brother, but I’m not happy. My mom doesn’t leave the house, she doesn’t drive. She has to be drinking alcohol my brother bought. It’s fine if she did it so he’d have less, but with the store right around the corner he’ll get more if he wants it. Also, shouldn’t she be avoiding alcohol since she’s scared my brother might have to go to rehab, or worse... die?

Idk... my relationship with my mom and brother is peppered with garbage. When I was 23 I also lived with them, I got pregnant and got into a verbal argument with my drunk brother. He pushed me down on hardwood floors and was sitting on me, punching me in the stomach while my mom (who was also drunk) was kicking me in the head. I later lost the baby, and we eventually made up, but things have never been the same. I have a really hard time forgiving them for what they did, and it makes treating them fairly when they’re drunk a really hard thing to accomplish. This is important, though. My brother has three kids and I don’t want them to lose their dad because he couldn’t get help during quarantine. I won’t turn my back. How do I deal with my mom?

Even though COVID-19 is a problem, our netball club is still taking fees to play this winter. Memberships and uniforms are $450 AUD for winter games only, making it very expensive for some people. A lot of Aussies are out of work for the forseeable future. Coronavirus has caused the greatest loss of employment for Australians since the Great Depression.

I wrote to the president of the netball club one day ago explaining that I know some people in the club may be struggling to pay for their fees. I volunteered to anonymously pay for any outstanding fees for any two players who otherwise couldn't afford to play. I told the president that I didn't need to know their names - just how much they owe. I would hate for anyone to miss out on the upcoming season due to their financial circumstances

When we first moved in, it wasnt that bad. In fact, we used to play together quite a bit. It started to get to a point where if we were going to meet somewhere he'd be late because he was playing video games. When I got off the bus after work, I asked for him to pick me up because theres a 10 minute walk in the dark, and our area is quite dangerous at night.

I dont mind that hes enjoying himself and having fun, but it's the fact that he does it for hours. When I want to show him something on my laptop or phone he always makes me wait. 

We talk about playing games together but it never ends up happening because hes always playing games with friends on discord. He stays up for hours, until 4am often and then goes to bed and sleeps very late into the next day, and expects me to do the same I stay up very late for him to try and match his schedule just to get some extra time, but some nights I'll just say I'm going to sleep. Whenever this happens, he says ""one more game"", but there never just is one game. 

I really dont like getting upset at him, and I've tried talking to him and he says he feels bad and that he will make more of an effort, but every time he always goes back to his games. 

I'd just like to spend quality time together, I wouldn't mind if he played with me or even just a bit less so we could do stuff together. We used to cook together all the time but now he asks me to do it so he can play. 

I really dont know what to do anymore, I feel second to his PC, I miss our relationship. It's like I'm just watching him live out his life.

488,"So in 2014 I was wicked depressed and needed a project. I settled on creating a Facebook group to try to teach myself how to save money. Literally it was just supposed to be me and my friends helping each other out with new ideas and tips. Well over the years it grew to a little over 4k people. Which is awesome.

I know that right now with everything going on a lot of people need the same advice that I started with. (don't spend what you don't have, use coupons whenever possible). I want to try to grow the group to help as many people as I can. (plus is a community page so everyone contributes to new ideas that they use so we're all helping each other). I just have no idea what I'm doing.

Anyone have any advice? I don't make any money from this page. And truthfully it costs me money but I love doing it. I just want to be able to help someone who was in my position when I started,but I have no idea what I'm doing.",26Apr2020,1

He says he understands why that would make me feel insecure at times, but tells me not to worry.

Personally, I’ve cheated too in the past but I’ve learned from my mistakes and would never cheat again, that is why I want to give him the benefit of the doubt because it does seem like he has learned from the experience.

He was going to another school prior to the coronavirus pandemic so I don’t know him well at all but he also does online school now like me and will be graduating this year too. 

I gave my mom an ultimatum, her bf or me. I told her I’d cut off contact if she chose to stay with him and I have, but she continues to call and text me every day crying and begging me to come back. It’s so nasty to me that she’s almost 40 years older than him and he’s MY AGE. 

I miss having a relationship with my mom but I refuse to tolerate her strange and gross romance with a teenager like me, even if it’s technically legal.

493,"I’ve known my friend for 20+ years and I don’t really know his wife very well. They’ve been together for several years but only got married in August 2019. 

I recently by happenstance came across a post with some pictures of a living room that gave it away that the username that listed said images was her because it was their exact living room. I was in there recently and recognised the exact layout and furnishings/pictures on the wall etc. 

Once I knew it definitely was her I couldn’t resist looking at her post history. l had a look and was concerned to find posts from Dec 2019 saying she’d been stockpiling meds intentionally to overdose on. So obviously I immediately felt like I needed to let my friend know that his wife was planning on killing herself not that long ago, that she might still have those meds stockpiled...

However scrolling a bit further down her post history I find posts about how only a few months after their wedding last summer she says that he’d been sexually harassing her and trying to make her perform sex acts that upset her. That he’s refusing to respect her wishes and is even passive aggressively punishing her for not giving him what he wants. 

So obviously now while I admit that I’m a bit shocked at the fact that he has been abusing her this way so I’m wary of calling him to warn him of his wife’s suicidal posts because He’ll naturally want to read them for himself and by linking him through to them there’s a VERY high chance that he’ll do exactly what I did - scroll down her post history to snoop and see her other posts about their sex life and his bad behaviour. 

I don’t want to risk starting any arguments or make their lives worse during a lockdown period where they have small children in the house. 

I’m really more concerned about the fact that she had posted an explicit plan on how she was going to kill herself. 

Should I reach out to my friend’s wife first and ask if she’s ok? She’s still alive but I am concerned. Obviously this would mean admitting that I snooped on her post history. 

Or contact my friend and let him know about her posts? I feel like this would just be seen as shit-stirring. If his wife is depressed and/or occasionally suicidal I’m sure he is well aware. 

He mentioned to me recently that she’s on Reddit all the time and even specifically made reference to one of her posts getting 2k+ upvotes last week - so perhaps he’s already seen her post history?

This works very well when I'm alone or with someone with the same attitude, but when I team with procastinators, it drives me insane. I always think ""this would have been over a week ago if I just did it on my own, but no, you had to send someone to HELP me"". It's kind of unfair from me, since those people don't actually go over the deadline-so I can't really complain to higher ups-but they do make the process a lot more annoying for me.

499,"(content warning for mentions of depression)

for context - I turned 16 a few months ago. I have ADHD, an anxiety disorder, and depression/bipolar disorder (we aren't sure which, but I experience fairly severe depressive episodes). I have successfully been taking public transport alone since I was 9 as my parents stopped taking me to and from school, and I have a part time job, so I'm very independent and they only take me places that I can't get to via public transport

I got my learner's permit on my birthday and have driven a few times, but I absolutely hate doing it. Nearly every time I've driven I've ended up crying, parked right in the middle of the road, but my parents won't have it and make me keep going. They insist that it's important for me to get my licence so I can have independence and get places more efficiently, especially as I'm close to becoming an adult and moving out, always making me feel bad for not wanting to practice and forcing me to go out and drive so I can learn. They also are making me learn manual (despite our family having both a manual and automatic car) and I can barely focus on one thing at a time, so I have to take almost all my attention off the road just to change gears and it does not feel safe. 

(I'm also worried about driving during a depressive episode, out of fear that I'll do something dangerous and irrational.)

The problem is, I do agree with them that it's probably an important thing to do, but they won't take me seriously when I tell them I'm overwhelmed and want to stop while I'm practising, so I'm not sure how to tell them that I don't want to keep driving altogether. I also feel like I'd be a bit of an asshole as they paid for my learner's permit, and I'd have to keep relying on them until my friends got their licences (but if I got my licence I'd have to buy my own car and pay for my own fuel). Their reasoning as to why I should get my licence is very fair and I know they have my best interests at heart and I would make them really upset at me if I told them, but I am afraid for the safety of myself + others driving around me. Plenty of people have told me it'll get better with practice but I don't know if it will for me

should I keep learning or should I ask to stop/how would I ask??",26Apr2020,1
500,"I don’t have much support from my own family, and there is this lady who has basically been in and out of my life as an adopted grandmother to my kids. She’s off and on due to some mental instability, but she has a hugely generous and kind heart. I love her, and she’s done a lot for us. 

BUT...


I have two babies under the age of 2 and in total I have 5 kids. We have been self isolating as I do not want to take any unnecessary risks. The term “better safe than sorry” comes to mind whenever I make decisions, so even though my best friend has been going to stores and people’s houses to visit, she still hasn’t held my 4 wk old baby bc I’m not taking chances. 

So I’m asking advice on HOW to handle this, not on whether or not to GO.

My sweet grandmother-friend believes she already had the virus so she must be immune (none of this confirmed medically), and wants me and my children to come over today for a lunch, play time, watching tv, and helping her get ready for the crew she has coming to remodel a room in her house this week! In normal life I would absolutely go to help her out, and to spend time with her, and show her we love her. Like I said, she’s been very generous in gifts to us, and I’ve known her my whole life. But we are not out of the woods with COVID19 and I don’t think we will be “safe” enough for my newborn to go socializing for a long time still! Even without COVID19, my baby isn’t even 6 wks yet and I don’t want to take her out, or have many people over. So the decision is made, I’m not going, but HOW do I tell her this with respect and love when it’s something she flat out does not understand or agree with?... (contrary to my own opinions, she is a huge trump supporter and is of the opinion this whole virus thing is exaggerated and not true). So clearly this will make her feel like I’m using covid and an excuse since my fears CANT be real. If it were someone else I wouldn’t care so much about their feelings. But this lady matters to me. I don’t want her to feel bad. (Her family isn’t here either)",26Apr2020,1

She was always their for me we are best friends bc we click very well we can’t get bored of each other. Then only recently after my downfall I fell in love with her.

I took some time to heal and we started talking again going back to normal. I still do have feelings ofc but I don’t love her

I asked her why she couldn’t fall for me again. She said she just doesn’t feel it right now bc it probably feel the same.

My other job, I can’t stand. It’s further away, I get basically no shifts and, thanks to taxes, dreadful pay. I’m also ALWAYS rostered on days I LITERALLY cannot work.

Every single time I tell my mum how I hate my job and I want to quit, she tells me that I’m lucky to have two jobs (which I am, I won’t lie), and my job isn’t that bad (which it kinda isn’t, but I tend to majorly stress out in pressuring situations, or when I’m on a time limit).
I also have a friend’s mum who I’ve known for at least 10 years who works at the same two places I work (and largely favours the job I hate). She would NEVER let me hear the end of it if I quit.

I have a brother, who is ten years older than me(24), who has been behaving very toxic towards me since I was about 16 years old. He doesn't respect my boundaries, private property, basically nothing. 

He often puts me down for my depression, anxiety and PTSD,caused by years of bullying and a sexual assault, saying I should just ""get over it"" and move on. He mocks me for staying away from alcohol and parties, comparing me to a ""60 year old lady"" and he tries to force me to be more social by pushing people onto me because in his mind, I'll snap out of it if I'm just social enough. He's also mocked me for being bisexual, saying that I'm just confused and when he found out I had a boyfriend, he said ""Oh I guess you're straight now lol"" 

He doesn't respect my personal property either. While I lived at home, he's rearranged my bedroom several times and one time took the couch that was in my bedroom without my knowledge, burned it and replaced it with a new one because appearantly, it bothered him that my ""ugly green couch"" even existed. He also took the tv I inherited from my grandmother, my phone charger to sell it with a phone he was selling(he refused to replace it so I had to replace it myself) 

He's gotten even worse after I moved out. I, being an absolute idiot, asked him if he could help me move a desk into my new office space and once he had done that, he barges into my livingroom and starts moving lamps, lights and rearranges my bookshelves, flips out on me for leaving a glass in the sink(seriously, why do some people lose their collective sh*t over something so minor as a glass in the sink?) and berates me for not keeping my apartment tidy enough and begins to plan rearranging,remodeling and repainting MY apartment.. meanwhile I'm sitting there so defeated because I'm not a confrontational person. 

He's now messaging me links to bookshelves and tv stands, paints, wallpapers, things that I can't afford at this time as I'm saving to have my bathroom upgraded. When I tell him that I literally can't afford it, he suggests to me that I can pay him back later, which I know he's going to use against me when given the chance.

I've tried cutting him off before but then I'm forced to associate with him again because he threatens to kill himself because of my ""heartless behaviour"". I've talked to my mother(who is also toxic but in a different way), expressed how he's destroying my mental health but she won't help me make him stop. I'm so tired mentally and emotionally. I dread visiting my parents when I know he is there and I avoid going if I can. 

What do I do? I need to get away but without being worried sick he's going to kill himself.",26Apr2020,1

To put it simply I can’t help but compare the ways ppl see my and my best friend. I think I’m jealous of the way she makes relationships so quickly or the way ppl gravitate towards her more. For a bit more info, she’s a Sagittarius and I’m a Taurus and our signs pretty much define us to a T. Even though ik who I am, what I stand for, and how I move makes me me...in some ways I can’t help but wanna be her. I just feel like pretty much every aspect of her life is way better than mine. And of course not everything because I know what she’s been through and what she’s going through but I don’t know what to do to not feel this way. She’s a really fun &amp; social person, loves going out and doing new things. I’m not always like that but I can be but that’s where I get confused. What is it that I do differently that I am unable to get the same experiences? Make the same friends or even more friends at all. Most of the friends now, are through her.

537,"My family (my boyfriend, me, and my dad) convinced my mother (45 y/o), last night, to go to the ER for her strong hallucinations and delusions. She called me saying her back was burning and that she had been shot 4 times, in sets of 3 (although she was physically not hurt when I seen her). She kept saying this. I had no choice but to take her to the ER after that call. She was a danger to herself and my special needs brother. She had been scaring him lately. 

When she went in, voluntarily, she was still talking about her delusions. She was honest with the doctor there about wanting to die. They transferred her to another hospital. My father thinks she was Baker Acted by the doctor at the first hospital. We can barely find anything out because of COVID-19. I can't even see her face. They gave me her room number and the main number, which means I can't directly contact her. I feel like they've got her in a scary room and aren't being nice or helpful. I just keep seeing more and more awful stuff about psychiatric holds and I don't even know what's true. She called my father twice this morning, at first sounding like she was plotting with my him to get out but the phone was cut off both times. My father can't tell if they intercepted her calls or if she hung up on him. The third phone call, some time later, she told him that it was his fault and that she hated him (or maybe us, for taking her to the ER, I'm not sure). 

You guys, I'm panicking really bad. I don't know what they're doing to her, if they're treating her like trash, if she has access to ANYTHING familiar (they wouldn't let her have her phone or even a robe that smells like me), I'm so scared this is going to permanantly mess her up and that this only served to mess her life up more.

I know she gave us no choice but we all feel like human garbage after her phone calls to us and we are all scared something more awful is happening because the doctors and nurses know we can't be in there to see how they treat her because of COVID. 

Please, somebody help me. I can't sleep.

538,"Hey guys. 

So, long story short. I’m a big introvert, my friend - the polar opposite. They have a lot of friends, I don’t. Recently, I am becoming more and more annoyed at my bff, because my friend, I feel is speaking to me only as a last resort. We used to FaceTime for a few hours per day, every day. Now, we do, but for half the time we used to, and when we do my friend is constantly chatting with their online gaming friends while speaking to me, resulting in not hearing half the things I say, and ending the call as soon as their online friends want play a game together (even if I have sth important to say). Is it bad that I want, when they spend time with me, albeit via FaceTime (cant see each other due to covid19), that they have their attention only on me and not on their other friends (online or not)?

 Also, we used to speak about so much things, but now, they only speak about their game (which I play too, but much more moderately). I stay up very late, so we can chat when I know their online friends are not available, I jump at every opportunity when they want to call (even if it means not finishing my homework on time, or not eating, ignoring my parents, being asleep, etc) because I love them and I don’t know when they are going to make time for me again. But even then, if they call and I don’t call back within a minute or two (cuz maybe I was in the bathroom or sth) they ghost me for an hour or so until they finish their game, or just get bored I guess. 

Sometimes I feel like if I disappeared, my friend wouldn’t care at all and it makes me very sad because I love them so much.

Maybe it’s a me problem - not sure, so I am asking you, fellow strangers - what to do.

541,"When I was a kid I dreamed of making movies but I felt it was impossible for me to make anything out of it because I grew up in a poor family and the only place I had seen an actual camera was through the TV screen. 
I used to spend time reading about my favorite actors, directors and screenwriters- I used to watch a lot of movies and still do. When I chose my major in college I went with English and Communication Sciences for two reasons: 1. My family couldn’t afford Film School 2. An English major costs a lot less where I live.

I am 26 now and I have a job that is comfortable enough- which allows me to put something aside so that I can help my parents (I don’t live with them but because my dad has a mental issue and is incapable to work I help them financially with as much as I can). 

But lately I have been having this “insane” thought- that because I can afford it now, I should go to Film School and build skills and network. That’s when I take a step back and start questioning myself. 

Now, going to film school I wouldn’t need to leave my job because they would let me do flexible hours but it would mean that I can’t save money and that I can’t help my family financially as much as I usually do- which makes me feel guilty.

Of course, going to film school doesn’t guarantee success but it’s a start that might prove life changing—-and as the song says “I you never try, you’ll never know”. But then, I am afraid that what I feel, despite being something I have always wanted, might just be an impulse.

543,"I was suddenly transferred in the middle of 3rd grade from a Montessori to my local elementary + middle school (basically parents run out of money for that school). It was sudden, a very different environment, and I never blend in. In the meanwhile my abusive family turned to the worst (alcoholic borderline mother + violent narcissist father) and I had not only no-one to turn to at home but also I was in ""no mood"" to be happy and socialise freely like kids do. 

It doesn't help that I didn't attend the religious classes they all did, I wasn't even baptised, and my parents were not married (back then and there, it was jaw-dropping). And I was socially clueless, a blank slate. I went away at 16, moving to a big city.  By that time the damage was done, I didn't even try to socialise, so I attracted a few mockery and taunting from a few classmates and was obviously isolated, but it was only 3 years. However the heavy abuse happened in that small city, where I felt I was a hot commodity for bullies. And everyone else ignored me. When I said the final goodbye to my classmates at 16, no one answered back ""goodbye"".

Much later in life I ended up in a toxic scholarly environment, tried to endure it to reverse my past and make it, but when I walked away the same situation happened: they immediately forgot that I even existed, surprisingly respected my choice to quit that path, and were chill with my calling it quit. It hurt tremendously. Not even worth it.

I am so lonely that I really ""want"" to run into those bullies online, even after 20 years. I begrudge toxic people for letting me go. It's messed up.

She’s overall supportive and a good friend but here’s the problem: I have anxiety disorder and politics/news are massive triggers for me, they’re something I try to avoid when possible. Layla has repeatedly sent me sent me news articles or told me about different world events through text at random.

She knows about my disorder and has been supportive of me through my anxiety attacks and she knows exactly what my triggers are and continues to send me these news articles completely unprompted. I have had anxiety attacks every single time. Each time she does this, I do not respond because I’m scared to and, usually the next day, she’ll text me about something completely unrelated, so I don’t understand what she’s gaining from doing this as she doesn’t try to discuss it with me.

A couple nights ago, I was in my bedroom, on my phone when I received a message from her, saying: “Throwawayday1986, I’m sorry.” This immediately weirded me out because she never uses good grammar when texting me and the only times she does is when she tells me about something news-related. Layla then sent me an image along with the text: “But you have to see this”. I had a intense anxiety attack right then and there which left me shaking and incredibly freaked out. I didn’t dare look at the image she sent me, imagining all the different things it could be about.

The image had shown up in my photo album and I accidentally found it the next day and thankfully it turned out to just be a meme about abortion. I realised just how much she sends me these news articles along with her other habit of sending vague texts with serious undertones which also cause me anxiety attacks.
 
The next day I had around 10 or so texts from Layla and I got scared, I didn’t look at them and in my panic, I deleted WhatsApp - where she usually texts me and had sent me all of this - I’m freaked out about the idea of her doing this again.

I really love meeting new people, and just hanging out. I'm really open and accepting, I like listening to people. 
I recently moved pretty far from home, so naturally I start making new friends right away. 
If I had to rate my looks I'd give myself a solid 7. I'm aware there many prettier girls than me, I don't come from a family of money or success. (Although I'm doing pretty well on my own) 
For some reason, almost everytime I talk to a guy they end up really liking me, or wanting to date me. And I don't usually feel this way back, in the last 5years the feeling was only mutual maybe 3times. 
I want friends, not FWB and not a boyfriend, because I usually dont like them back.  And Fwb will only lead them on more.. I just want to be friends. 
This isn't about 1 specific person, this is a problem I run into with almost every guy i meet. And i still don't know how to keep them as a friend without them being hurt, because how do i go about this? Tell them they're not attractive enough? Or tell them what I dont like about them?

I often find it's an overreaction, but the only bravery I can muster is newfound and it's likely because I'm not scared of being injured. That barely helps.

I'm just scared of situations... I used to be able to watch these videos or experience these things fine, but a person has opened up my emotions and my care for many things including myself. They have, undoubtedly, made me happy and hopeful. This has also made me more prone to fear and anxiety as they opened up my emotional connections, however.

Because of this,  I know that when I will try to do something for myself, I will end up panicking and overanalyzing every situation. Example: I have not been able to drive as of late because of the coronavirus home order, but I know that the moment I get behind the wheel, everything from someone being in my backseat to a targeted hit over my head will appear in my mind, and I will not be able to function at 100% while driving, which would endanger myself. No danger, except what if there was?

Talking myself through these fears hasn't helped. It's like, when you were a kid, there was a monster in your closet until your parents checked it. Everything was safe... until you thought the monster was back the very next night. I can check 1,800 times, but there will always be a monster over my shoulder.

I have no access to professional help for a variety of reasons. I really cannot live in this state of confusion and paranoia, as I've been extremely unsettled by every little thing, even the apartment walls settling. I would add a joke to this post, but I really can't seem to find one under the importance of this.

Earlier today, I couldn't stop looking to my window despite the fact that nothing was there. The reason? There was a shadowy figure in the window in an ARG. Literally no harm in sight in that moment... but my brain still says 'what if there was'.

I know that there is likely no way to enjoy this form of entertainment to the level I have been without endangering my mental stability or my safety at this point. I don't know how to back out of how deep I've gotten, however.

559,"It has been a rough 2 months in quorantine and it has me thinking a lot. When I was 16 I met this guy let's call him Kevin. We have known each other in elementary school but we never really talked up to the point when we ""officially"" met. I knew that I liked him but I thought my friend did too so I backed off. Me and Kevin soon became best friends. He was always there for me and I was there for him. He helped me through my first heartbreak and always told me that I need a guy like him, just not really him. I knew I loved him but I never did anything about it. Fast forward to when he was a senior in high school and I was a junior. While he prepared to go to another country to go to college I fell in love for real with another guy. And that is when the fights with Kevin started. The whole summer before he left we spoke only to fight and eventually I didn't hear from him until a year later when I visited my aunt in the same place where he lives now. We saw each other and he told me to come and live with him there so we can go to college together. unfortunately when I got home we had a fight again. All those fights I think were because I was with another guy and we never got a chance even though I knew I loved him. And that was two years ago. Now I still can't stop thinking about him. He meant a lot to me. Teen years were hard for me because my mother died when I was 12 and somehow hanging out with him life seemed bearable. I don't know if it's stupid to think about this because it has been such a long time and I've been wanting to reach out to him because I really miss him but I don't know how will he react or if I mean to him as much as he means to me. What do you think I should do? I have a feeling we never told each other how we feel and now it's too late he's probably moved on.

Then all of a sudden, he changed his sleeping schedule to what he said was more normal, since we would stay up until 8-9 in the AM. I wasn't used to that since I had drastically changed timezones recently, but after a week of not speaking to him much, I changed with him. Since then, he's since reverted back to the his old sleep schedule. It's been over a month of sparse messages from him and we don't spend any time at all together.

564,"TL;DR: Grown men have been messaging my little niece (in Guatemala) via instagram, tiktok, and other platforms and they claim they have nude photos of her (not sure if this is true). I don’t know what to do or how to handle this as her parents have no idea and would not be very understanding if they actually found out she took them. What would you do if this was your 10 year old niece/sister/daughter?




I have known she has social media pages with her mom’s name but using her own photos (as many kids her age do), but I never paid much attention because I assumed her parents were monitoring these pages.

After reading an article about pedophiles/online predators and their insane abuse of children online (blackmailing children after making them send naked photos, etc) I decided that I would take a look at my niece’s Instagram followers and comments just to make sure everything was kosher. Well, to my horrible surprise I found about SIX grown ass men (ranging from 20-50 y.o.) leaving comments such as “hey beautiful” “Hey baby! Answer my messages” “why don’t you answer my messages? If you don’t answer I will be uploading the photos NOW” “I sent the photos” etc. 

I freaked the f out, called my brother (not her dad) to tell him what happened, and we both contacted the men and basically questioned them about what the fuck was going on. One of them spoke to me and said that she was a ‘whore’, that she had sent him nude photos without him ever asking, and he sent me a screenshot of a so called conversation they had where she basically is begging for him to ‘make love’ to her while he responds meekly and kindly with “oh but I don’t even know you, you live so far away”. I’m guessing these screenshots were fabricated...at least I’m praying they were.

The pedophile blocked me, so I contacted my niece to tell her what happened and asked her to tell me everything that had been going on. She told me that the man I spoke to was a (much older) friend of a schoolmate of hers that had contacted her previously telling her he had photos of her. I asked her to give me all her login information so I could monitor it and to also make her profiles private immediately.

Now, I don’t know what to do apart from controlling or deleting all her social media. My niece and family live in Guatemala and she knows who this man is. If I tell her parents or other family members something very bad could happen to the actual dude (which I would love, but who knows if this is really even him?! I’m wary of vigilante justice) and also will blame her for even responding to him(we are a very conservative patriarchal society).

I was planning on making a fake profile and following the men on their platforms, then tarnish their image by personally messaging their family and friends. Does this sound like something I should do? What else do people in similar situations (can’t go to the police) do to make these assholes stop doing this to little kids?? I’m sure she was not the first or last.

A good friend of us (13 m) has abused his little cousin (7 m) and his sister (9) and we don’t know how to react and/or what to do. He’s been bullied in his old school and when he came into our school, he didn’t find friends easily. But, after a year, we and our friends started to talk to him. We started to know him a bit better and found out that he can actually be nice and also pretty funny. He’s also very talented at the piano. We’ve invited him to some birthday parties and he became one of our close friends. But, in me and my friend’s eyes, he’s always been a bit hyperactive and he often wanted our attention. And when we didn’t give him much attention, he said that we didn’t care about him (I think that’s because he was bullied in his old school). But all in all he was a good friend. But then he told us this story. He started by telling us that his father confiscated his phone because his cousin saw him watch porn. But as it turned out, the cousin didn’t see him watch pornos. It’s my friend who showed him the videos and asked him to do what they saw to him. He abused him. Later, his parents found it out and the were extremely disappointed. They told him that he should never ever do this again. But, a few months later, he did it again even though his cousin said that he didn’t want it. My friend was lucky because the parents of his cousin didn’t go to the police. If they would have gone to the police, my friend’s parents would have lost custody (EU laws). For then, this was all he told us but later he added that he also asked his sister to have oral sex with him (She didn’t know what this was so he “showed” her). 

He also often has some sort of “rage attacks” where he totally loses control of him self and starts insulting us and he’s done some other pretty dumb stuff.

Now, me and my buddy, we need your help/advice. We don’t know how to react to this. Do we have to do something? Should we ignore it? Should we tell him something?

585,"So, like it says up top, I have an 8 year old pug that's very, very fat. The problem is, I live at home with my parents, and my mom is the cause for penelope( my pug) to be so big. 
 I work at an animal shelter, and have been told by the vet that I need to take some steps to help penelope lose some weight. Last time I weighed her, she was 33 pounds. An average pug weighs between like 15 and 20ish pounds. With the extra time I have on my hands not working, I've been taking her on walks every day, and I dont feed her snacks or anything. I have sat down with my mom on more than one occasion, and explained to her that I really want to do my best to help Penelope lose weight, but cant do it alone and that I need her help. My mom said she understood and would do her best to reduce the amount of food she puts in her bowl, and would cut down on caving and slipping penelope table scraps/ snacks.  
 Every time, it goes back to how it was before I talked with my mom. Penelope doesnt eat dog food. My mom feeds her leftovers of chicken, steak, vegetables, and other random human food. She even cooks ribs for her so she has bones to chew on. My mom has said different things like "" shes not even fat! Shes just meant to be big!"" And also "" theres not even that much meat on a rib!""... 
  This situation has me beyond frustrated. 33 pounds is a ridiculous size for a pug to be. My mom is in denial about what shes doing, and even though I've told her and relayed what my vet told me, she still overfeeds penelope and I dont know what to do. 
 So....what can I do to convince my mom that either what shes doing is wrong, or that she cant keep feeding her so much.? 
 I've tried to take the nice approach, and try to convince my mom I needed her to team up with me, but it's always short lived, and goes back to how it was before I sat down and talked with her. The other day, my mom gave her THREE RIBS!!! Back to back to back. It's too much, and its guna end up to some health problems for my dog if I cant put a stop to it now, and make the necessary changes before it's too late. 
Technically, Penelope is my dog. But in another sense, shes sort of the family dog. I know my mom doesnt mean to cause harm. She just loves penelope so much, that she thinks what shes doing is out of love, but it's going to end up hurting her in the long run. Maybe someone reading this has a useful suggestion.

587,"So, sometimes out of frustration or anger with someone, I might call them a profanity like 'b\*tch, wh\*re, c\*nt, r\*tard, etc.' 

It's not only me but many family members and close friends of mine do so as well to one another. In fact, I do it less than most people I know.

However, I'm aware these words are derogatory, but when I and others use them, we don't do so critically, we don't say it because the word actually represents the person, we do it because it's a negative word and no other deeper reason why.

Speaking for myself, it allows me to vent frustration and I believe it's less damaging than personal attacks that feed into a person's unrest, stress, trauma, etc. Also, I believe it's less harmful than a shouting match that can get people's blood boiling and greatly raises the risks of a violent situation which can ruin lives.

So, a profanity as an insult I believe is objectively less harmful than the latter two, and should be fairly greeted with profanity in response or simply ignored. 

Now my sister on the other hand, takes it to a whole other level when called a 'bitch'. Even in playful jest. She's 26 and this is a whole new occurrence in our lives—were these words turn her aggressive as she points her finger in your face and says 'How Dare You!' in the most serious tone, then proceeds to yell in your face to escalate the situation into something worse.

She lives in London now but is over at mine and my parents home in our small town in this time of quarantine. It just makes me sad how she wants to censor the house with threats of aggression and I try to reason with her to not be so sensitive and hostile around us, but she just gets angry and resorts to 'Don't get involved in mine and dads arguments', 'stop taking sides', 'you're annoying', 'you don't make any points, you're just disrespectful'. 

She thinks I'm defending the language, but really I'm trying to reason with her to not escalate the situation over something minuscule.

We're all adults, we know not to use to language out in public and professional settings, I just don't understand why she takes it to heart so much when none of these words hold substantial meaning to us when we use them. God forbid she lived in Australia, I swear profanity is a big part of there vocabulary down there, even in public.

Well, this is my grievance. I don't think advice will do much, my sister's great at avoiding constructive conversations, she'll resort to every fallacy in the book If you try and the outcome is always her ending up angry.

It's likely I'll have to censor myself over using the word 'bitch' in my home around her then we'll all have to play 'happy family', only forced positivity! In reality, we all tiptoe around my sister that's ready to turn hostile over a word and create one small thing to a huge drama. What's ironic, is she's known to use personal attacks and shouting when mad at someone, but oh, 'how dare you use a profanity!'....ridiculous.

Does anyone else here behave similarly to my sister? If so, would you be able to reason with me why I might be in the wrong in this scenario?",26Apr2020,1

We tried again but ended in December. Then I went through a very hard time during first few months of 2020. She was always their for me we are best friends bc we click very well we can’t get bored of each other. Then only recently after my downfall I fell in love with her. I tried so hard to get her back bc she wanted it to her head was their but not her heart. I gave her flowers at her door, virtual dates just improvising during lockdown. Unfortunately she just couldn’t get anywhere so she cut my efforts short. We’re both super affectionate friendship and all sorts but it was crushing and I felt very lost. I took some time to heal and we started talking again going back to normal. I still do have feelings ofc but I don’t love her

I asked her why she couldn’t fall for me again. She said she just doesn’t feel it right now bc it probably feel the same. During our first relationship it wasn’t v romantic and I made a lot of mistakes but I’ve learned from them now. And I feel like it’s her subconscious perception of me if that makes sense. Like a mental block? So I made a plan spanning months to change that without her knowing. Which is to basically treat her very well each week taking her out to the cinema, dates, whatever lovely things to try change her view of me. To show I mean change and to show she can’t get better then me.

I really would like to know if this is stupid, wrong or anything really. I don’t want to stop fighting for this girl. She even says to me she feels we could get married in the future. She rlly feels the mental and physical connection just not the love. Yet",26Apr2020,1
590,"The type of person I’m talking about is the “know it all” personalities who seem to have a compulsive need to oppose or correct every single thing you and other people say. And if you even try to argue with them they will spend a good 20 minutes or even hours going back and forth with you just so they can get their way and be right. It’s infuriating and it’s not the only time I’ve come into contact with these assholes. Usually I’d just walk away and not hang out with them anymore. But that’s not exactly possible anymore since my college roommate is one of them. 

I k ow what you’re gonna say. “Just ask for a room change”, right? Well first off all the other rooms are filled and I’m only a freshman so I can’t live in one of the other buildings since they’re just for upperclassmen. Also I don’t want to make things awkward or tense between me and him since moving out of nowhere would be a dead giveaway that I don’t want to be near him. How can I more effectively put up with his honestly insufferable personality besides just walking away and avoiding him?",26Apr2020,1
592,"Things ended poorly with someone who had feelings for me but I did not reciprocate. He doesn't have a car so he missed PO meetings and pee tests and was sent to jail. He's now in the center where he can leave for work and scheduled visits. He has his phone and posts on his Snapchat stories, threatening me. But he's not using my name. He will even post to his story responding to my story. If I screen shot his story, he posts to his story mocking me screen shotting so there is no mistake it's directed at me. This also escalated to him telling someone else in the center where I work and they got a job there and harassed me. 

Both persons were originally arrested for aggregated assault and domestic violence. What can I do since they aren't being sent to me or have my name? He pretty much is just wanting my attention but he crossed the line sending someone to my job to harass me. Do I show his PO the screen shots? Is he even doing anything wrong that will get him in trouble? Is he violating his probation by doing this? I went as far as posting I was moving on my snap chat then he put on his ""you can't hide from me... Etc"" followed by ""green lighting"" me. Will they take me seriously for a restraining order with the virus stuff going on? Would they even send him back for petty threats compared to the issues of more inmates getting sick? I don't feel safe but he hasn't technically directed it at me.

593,"live with my girlfriend. Our dog and her 2 cats. I always have loved cats but never owned one or lived with one before this. 
I love how cute they are. But the amount of annoying qualities is insane. Waking up to poop under chairs, fighting amongst themselves for food, ripping up underneath of couch, attacking the dog, howling late at night, scratching bedroom door to get in in the middle of the night. Not to mention finding pee stains on random surfaces throughout the house. 
I once had to get one of the cats out from my closet. He attacked me and now when I come downstairs from bed he always hisses at me. I walk from the couch to get a glass of water, there he is, glaring at me and hissing. Not to mention that when he attacked my hand he left a permanent scar!
I am beginning to dislike cats and I never thought I'd be like that! Please help reddit.",26Apr2020,1
594,"I feel that the reason why im sensitive or always overthinking things is because of my past life experiences, and in particular, interacting and forming relationships with people. 

When people point out that I’m sensitive or that I’m overthinking things too much, I dont know why, but it makes me feel insecure. It makes me feel like i want to change myself and be more confident and not care so much about what other people think about me. 

But I feel like I really can’t help it. After years and years of friendship problems, and constant cycles of losing friends, its made me view myself very negatively, and also made it very hard for me to make new friends. 

In school, during my late primary schools years, my best friend since the first year of school, “left” me and started being closer friends with another girl in my class (because in primary school, everyone would have a best friend that they always stuck with). I was quite young and took this situation very badly, as this had never happened to me before. After that, I did try to find a new friend, and I did. But the same thing happened. It was weird, I always found a friend but they always happened to end up leaving me for another friend. This left me with countless lunch breaks floating in between different people, never quite being close friends with them. 

This empty feeling that I had continued throughout the start of high school. I still wasn’t quite used to being “ditched” by friends and considered this my fresh start. But the cycle of friendships still happened. Everyone would have their “pair”. The one they would always choose to work on projects with, or sit next to on the bus, or just share anything with. The bestfriend, basically. So i thought i had finally found my best friend, but after a few months, she went and starting becoming closer with someone else. It made me remember primary school to be honest... and I didnt like that at all. 

Not to play the victim card here, but it would always be the friend, who left me to go become “besties” with someone else. Everytime. So this is when the worries started building up. After being hurt countless times during my school life its very hard for me to keep somewhat relaxed during relationships. I’m in constant worry, and I overthink too much like, “Do they like me?” “Am I too annoying?” “Should I be myself?” I can’t help but stress about these things even when I’m around my close friends, or when im making friends or talking with people in general, irl or online. 

I don’t show these thoughts or feelings and at school I try to be as sociable as I can, but I find it hard talking to new people and I choose to not become too close with people for fear that I will just keep experiencing the same things. It just makes me feel so empty and lonely and I’m in constant worry, so I dont know what to do about this.",26Apr2020,1
595,"I'm writing this as it's been 5 weeks since lockdown began, and I need some emotional support because I'm going insane. 

My parents always belittle me and exaggerate every word I say, so if I say ""I don't like the way you're talking to me,"" they'll go out of their way to use it as alibi in the future and say ""You called me an abusive liar"". I only called my parents abusive once and I will never again because the second I did, my mom slapped me across the face and said ""That'll happen if you call me abusive again""... I don't know what to think because some part of me thinks that they're not really like this, which makes no sense because they've always been like this. If I talk back, I get my laptop taken away, even if I have to work on school. They did this last week and sent my teachers an email calling me irresponsible and naughty, which I hated because I was trying to be nice to them, but now they probably hate me. I'm overweight and my parents constantly pressure me to work out saying ""You'll become obese and stupid"" and I try to but they say I never do, which is a lie. They always compare me to the neighbours and say ""Why can't you be more like X or Y's kids..."" My parents think I'm working on school right now, but I'm secretly typing this because I can't stand my situation.. The only way I can go out is to exercise, and everything is closed, so I'm stuck inside my house while my parents call me worthless and I'm on the verge of tears right now...

So she eats with her family they all eat together it’s a rule in their house hold and her mother would force her to eat easily 1000 calories in one sitting and would get offended when my friend would not eat it and beat angry at her.

597,"A friend of mine who I went to high school with (we are both in our very early 20s) is currently in college and experiencing some troubles with strong depression, and a lack of direction. He has said that he feels like his mental health is declining and he is coasting without any real plans for the future, and that he doesn't know what he wants to do with his life, feels worthless, etc.

He also has a lot of trouble committing to life tasks, academic and otherwise, and spends most of his time inside playing video games or browsing the internet, usually while getting high. Not judging, since my lifestyle is pretty similar, but being 100% honest, I don't think living this way is really helping either of us.

The specific way he talks about his problems reminds me of myself during depressive episodes and dark periods of my life, having struggled with mental illnesses. I have strongly recommended that he sees a therapist many times as I was helped greatly by it, but it seems like he blows me off.

He's compared his life to ""living on easy mode"" before despite saying pretty often that he feels sad, worthless, like his mental health is in decline, like he has no plans, etc. and it gives me the impression that he is not taking his problems seriously.

Is there anything concrete and substantive that I could give him as a piece of advice/do for him as support to try to help?",26Apr2020,1

599,"This'll be a long one, please excuse any grammatical mistakes. English is not my first language.

So, just a bit of context. They run a meme account on Instagram, and they suddenly started posting lots of depression/suicide memes on their close friends story. Their normal story is still filled with innocent memes you'd expect to see on a meme account.

^(for those that don't use IG, only people the user chose can see a close friends story, while a normal story can be viewed by anyone)

I'm not sure how or if I should even reach out to them. We don't really know each other IRL but we communicate over Instagram often. Furthermore, I don't have a lot of experience dealing with depression so I don't want to hurt them on accident.

On the other hand, I have a feeling I might just be overthinking this and they're not depressed but simply find the memes funny. The reason why they're not posting them on their public story might be exactly because they don't want people like me thinking they're depressed and DMing them.

601,"A few years ago, I met a woman while in college. We had a lot that brought us together: we were both military veterans going to school as older, non traditional students; many many MANY of the same interests and tastes in culture; and a shared general outlook in how we wanted to live life.

We never became an official couple. Not sure how to describe what we had. It was certainly romantic and were not seeing other people. But we weren't in a rush to get married, so declaring ourselves a couple never really seemed prudent. And neither of us has aspirations for children, so we weren't feeling pressured to start a family or anything. 

I will call her a ""bird that cannot be caged"": she just travels to the beat of her drum. Just how she is and one of the many things I loved about her. 

Being 31, almost 32 (she is the same age), and having tugged along a few years....I wanted to finalize what we were. Not necessarily get married, but.....become an official, long term/permanent couple. She rejected me, and ended what we had. She said we were too ""culturally different.""

I just feel in the wilderness now. Heartbroken, certainly. I know part of this is on me, having known her nature and stayed this course with her a while. But I just get this sense of lonliness/despair at the fact that I am 31 and really don't know where to go. I feel I am so old for this singles game. All of my friends are married, most having now started families. And the way out of this wilderness just feels very daunting.",26Apr2020,1

605,"Hey Everyone, 

This might be a little long to read, but to those of you that stick around I would really appreciate any advice. 

My parents started fostering kids when my sister was 5 and I was 3, after a deeply traumatic situation.  Between then and my 17th birthday over 50 kids had been in and out of our home. ""Erica"" first came to us when she was 18 months old, as her mom's drug use became increasingly worse. 

Fast forward and Erica is just recently 16, and we have been in the process of adopting her permanently into our family for nearly 5 years. My sister is married and lives in our home town, and I am living in a city approx 2 hours away. My home town is a speck on a map, and seems to suck in losers. (My parents and sister on the other hand love it for the nature that surrounds them) 

The last time I visited home Erica was her normal teenage self; she could hardly bear my parents (and sister's) presence, but had always looked up to me. (I  left home at 18 to live in Australia on a whim for 2 years, but I promise I'm a good influence) I guess she thought I was the most "" cool"" in the family, and she always was chatty and happy when we hung out. The only thing to come from this trip was her telling me she was exploring her sexual orientation a little bit, which I of course supported and what not. 

Today, I am finally not sure what to do anymore, and it breaks my heart. And so I ask for any advice whatsoever regarding the following:
(I'm going to do a short timeline of the past months)

Feb: my grandmother passes away, and two days later my mom calls me letting me know Erica has run away from home and that she had been smoking weed in her bedroom with the windows closed while my parents were home. (Weed is legal where we live, and I am not at all against it.... For people of the correct age.)

I call her after 3 days of not coming home and me not sleeping; and talked to her for around 40 mins. I have never sworn in front of her, but I was so emotional I let her know how she was affecting those who actually love her, and honestly just told her everything id been practicing saying instead of sleeping.

March: 

Mom finds texts on Erica's phone talking about how fun it was mixing weed, shrooms and tequila. 
Erica admits she went to her mom's home when she ran away, and that she never wants to live like her mom.
Erica has to go to the police for help when she admits she is being blackmailed by someone she sent nudes to. I spend another hour talking to her about this as I had someone hack my webcam and attempt to exploit me when I was young too. another random man had sent me her nudes on instagram. 

April:
Today my mom called.
Over the weekend Erica took Xanax, self harmed (minor), and punched my dad (who is 60 and has one arm).
Today, my mom stopped Erica on her way into the house and searched her backpack, which was full of drugs she said she was ""holding for someone"", there was also a burnt spoon and a rubber band. She admitted to taking MDMA as well as other drugs. All whilst she's on a daily medication for severe ADHD.
We also found out she has been selling naked images/videos of herself online to fund her drug habit. 
And then she shoved my mom pretty hard and punched my dad once again. 

I agreed with my family it was time to call the police, so my mom called them and was told the following:
1. Don't press child pornography charges because it will be on her permanent record
2. They can't do anything about the drugs as she has since apparently hidden them.
3. Assault charge is all that can be done and that really is nothing in my opinion.

My mom is a kindergarten teacher, with a disabled husband who does nothing but try to love those around her, and my heart is breaking for my family. 

I am concerned for their safety, and being in quarantine with her galavanting around town makes me fear for their health as well. 

If you made it this far, thank you. It helps to try and put things down on paper (screen?), as my head is pretty overwhelmed.

606,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post I’m just not quite sure what to do.
The missus and I, and our 5 month old daughter had just taken our daily walk in the sun following our lockdown rules(UK)
As I was packing the pram away into the car while the missus held our baby girl an older woman came walking across our car park making a bee line towards them. I heard her cooing at the daughter and assumed she’d stop well short and was just interested in our little one. She didn’t. 
The next I heard was a panicked ‘No, get away’ and as I turned the missus was turning away from the woman who had her arms outstretched and was reaching for my baby. Instinct, whether right or wrong took over and I moved towards them to get in the way. I pushed out at the old woman as she wasn’t listening and I didn’t, in my mind, have time to assess what was about to happen. 
She took quite a dramatic fall into the car park and laid still on the floor for what seemed like an age. She eventually picked herself up and stumbled off round the corner not to be seen again. 
I checked on the missus who was quite shaken up and got her inside.

He talks only about his job and mostly complain about people,his bosses. I understand that he may be stressed,but something like this is happening for a long time (few years or more).

I feel stressed around him,everything we will do has to be planned.When we talk,he turns everything into a lesson or some advice (you got beaten? you have to look around you and watch out)

like i know that im a teenager (18) and i dont understand what real life problems are(this is what he says to me) but shit,i feel like he was my boss no father.i need some casual talk not analyzing everything that happens in the world,i know we are diffrent kinds of people,but the thing is.

i think i am more extravert and he is more introvert and analitycal maybe this is the point,he like to talk more about scientific things and i like to talk more about relationships, and just people.

When i come to him i just see he doesn't really care i mean yea he may say something like ""ok thats interesting"" but he comes back to his computer and work or watching stock exchange.

Also,my older brother is very similar to him,or at least he know how to have some connection with him .And they talk together about everything they like which is boring for me.

Then there's this guy, which I'll be calling A in this post, who has been a friend of mine for seven years now. We met in 2013 (I was 13). He's a sweetheart. He's one of the most withdrawn and introverted people I've ever known, and I'm not saying he's not social; he certainly is. The point is, you never know what he's thinking, he always keeps his stuff to himself so he doesn't bother the rest about his personal issues, he's got a shell to protect him. He's so selfless and kind. We've never had any arguments at all, he has never emotionally hurt me in any way and has always taken care of me. The thing is, he lives 1,000km away. We're just internet friends. We lost contact from 2015 to 2019 though we started chatting again around November. When I met him in 2013 I would think to myself that I wanted someone like him, or him himself, to love me. When we re-met in 2019 that thought hadn't changed still. I hadn't met my boyfriend yet and although I didn't have feelings for A, I somehow wished that I'd found someone like him. Now I know that that sounds like friendzone but let me explain. As I said before, he's too withdrawn with what he's feeling and after months talking to him I came to the conclusion that he didn't fancy me, I was 100% sure; this is why I wouldn't dream about him loving me. Either way I only wanted him as a friend by then so why would I want him to love me anyway? However, since the day we met again I've been talking to him a lot, almost everyday. We have a lot of confidence and we can totally trust each other, although as I said before, he wouldn't tell me any deep thoughts he had unless I’d found out myself that he wasn't doing right. I've spent months trying to get through his shell.

Current situation: I'm staying in my hometown, my boyfriend is in his (where I live now) and we're in quarantine so we have no chance of seeing each other until this covid thing ends and I can make my way to the city I live. No need to say that A is still 1,000 km away from me. My boyfriend and I would voicechat by Discord often but we haven't done that for around a week and we haven't texted that much since. Instead, I've been talking to A a lot and as soon as the thought of the fact that I might be getting into him reached my mind, I rejected it cause it made me feel like the worst girlfriend ever.

Two days ago I broke A's shell. I asked him to be direct and to tell me his thoughts about me. He confessed that he's been in love with me for 5 months and that he didn't want to tell me in order to keep me from hurting, since I wouldn't be able to bear so much distance. He said he'd never knew what it was to be in love until he met me, that I was a new person who he wanted to find out new things about. He said that when we met again I was like a blank canvas, a new person, and now that he's known me further I am the painting he loves watching the most. He thanked me for breaking his shell, for helping him realize he isn't a burden to the people who love him. He said that as long as I am happy, he is happy too. He said no one had seen his inner self that deep until he met me.

I cried. I couldn't believe someone so kind, so pure would love me that way. I honestly don't really know whether I’m into him or not, but I just don’t wanna stop talking to him for a second. I want him to talk to me all day and I can't stop thinking about him.

I'm not dumping my bf. Firstly, I love him so much and I can assure you that if the three of us lived in the same city, I still wouldn't leave him. I love him and I want to be with him. Also, I would NEVER cheat on him. Secondly, A lives too far away. Maybe if things had been different we could've had given us a chance before I had ever met my boyfriend, but now it's too late for A and me and I feel like sh\*t. Not because I want to date him instead of my bf, but because I feel like I’m silently hurting him. He won’t tell but I can’t help but think that he's hurting.

I know that things will get better when I come back to the city I live and be with my boyfriend again. But until that happens I can’t help but feeling terrible about this. I feel like I'm betraying the person I love.

TL;DR: I think I’m into someone who is not the guy I'm dating and altho I love him and won't leave him I feel terrible.",26Apr2020,1

619,"Ok, so i had a bit of a situation when i was 17 (20 now) in which i acted like a proper bitch. Me and my mate were out late at night when this car stopped in the middle of road, and two guys got out. One of the blokes was a hench boxer guy, and the other was his son who also trains (turns out my partner knows who they were). They both got out their car moving crazy aggressive accusing us of smashing their window in, and one got their phone out to start filming us. Naturally I turned away from the camera, to which the hench guy responded by grabbing my arm and forcing the camera in my face. When I told him to get off he kept yanking me about and kept threatening that he was going to beat me and my mate up. As soon as he said that I started shouting out for help, and being the middle of the night I opted to call my mother and proceeded to shout down the phone for help. Such a bitch move. My mate during all this didn't do much, and didn't attempt to cool down the situation. After this event ive felt nothing but like a failure. I feel like i couldn't defend myself if it came to it, and i feel like id be a let down to my future wife/kids knowing that i acted like that. Im ashamed of what happened that night, and nkw i think back on it i should have calmed down and tried to speak with them. The night has scarred me and it's something that i think about most days. 

So my question is, did i make a bitch ass move or was it maybe the right move to potentially save my ass considering i could have no way at all have taken on the guy and his son, and being that my mate wasn't exactly doing much to help the situation.

And the advice im looking for is, how do i not be a bitch, and how do i move on from the past event?",26Apr2020,1

624,"I'm gonna try to keep it short and I'm on mobile so sorry for any mistakes, but the title sums it up. 
 
I've been in a toxic, abusive, manipulative relationship since I was 17. I am now 20 years old and have finally drilled into my brain that this wont change and there's no point in getting help because A. He doesn't think he needs it and B. When I did mention it he wanted me to pay for all of it. 

Now we all know wtf is going on with the quarantine and the loss of jobs, however I am an essential worker &amp; I work at a gas station, my boyfriend is a barber so...not essential. I've been going to work making the money to buy food and things we need, as well as paying for lyfts or ubers when there's times I can't use the bus because of wait time or whatever. 

I think I'm also the only one getting a relief check since I'm the only one eligible since I've done my taxes since 2018 and I'm not a student. Hes never done his taxes but hes taking an awful long time to apply for any aid for anything since he's not working and hasn't in about a month. I think he's just trying to use my hard earned money when he hasn't made anything, and has been treating me like shit only for me to throw all of his actions to his face and he gets mad at me for it. 

Bottom line: I'm stuck. I don't have any family where I live(they are about an hour away) and I definitely don't have any friends out here that would help me, I'm making my money and saving as much as I can while still trying to buy the things we need but I'm barely working as is because of cut hours so hazard pay gone to shit. I DO NOT have my own key to this apartment that I am also paying for, I guess I'm not allowed to have one, and I don't have my own car or form of transportation so wtf do I do. I want to leave as stealthily as possible but it's looking more and more like I'm going to have to face him and all of this when I do leave. Can anyone link me any resources?

626,"Basically, I've been talking to a girl for these last 4 days, speaking from morning until dawn. I always threw hints at her and flattered her but I didn't see any kind of return, or she even changed the subject. I was very kind with her, I listened to all she said and she even called me a 'weirdo' just because I remembered things she told me, but I was just listening to her, which I told her maybe no one ever listened to her so that I remember all those things might be weird for her, anyway, we had many tastes in common and we even had our own nicknames and jokes, she even gave me access to her instagram account exclusively for well-known people and she showed me her  musically's from when she was little.  
 But yesterday she told me that she was not talking to anyone, to which I asked ""So what am I?"" and she kept repeating ""I'm not talking to anyone"" over and over again. So I got angry and she noticed and started using the same phrases I used with me, kind of mocking me. So I proceeded to confront her and ask what was I, 'cause she said I was a nobody and she answered ""What? I love talking with you and you're super cool"" 

I lost all hopes with this girl which I thought was the one, I told a friend of mine and he told me that maybe if I kept on talking she might take me in consideration, but after the discussion we had it would be weird to be nice and keep going, so I would appreciate any advice",26Apr2020,1

I can’t fathom staying in here forever. I’m tired of it, in fact. This quarantine has been helping tremendously in some parts, as in helping me keep focus on my career choices and learning remote languages. But I can’t keep doing this.

Everybody on reddit is saying to just stay inside forever and wait and wait until a vaccine comes out. Everybody is telling people who want to go outside that they’re opportunistic and or stupid.

How long do they realistically want us to stay inside? I can’t do this anymore. I can’t just be shut in forever! No one can! Not even them! And now I’m feeling super selfish and evil because of it!

632,"TLDR: Have you ever realized that everything in your life has been leading to a moment, and been scared that it arrived? Do you have advice?

I don't think I've ever experienced that until now. Depression took over my life, then daily weed use. (I'm not saying it's a bad thing, only that it was bad for me). I barely graduated highschool, dropped out of college, and stayed working full time at a fast food chain. Was hooked on adderall, but managed to kick it after a year. 2 years and several perspective-changing drug trips later, I decided to go back to school. All I knew was what to get a degree for. None of that felt like a big change. I can tell you where certain chapters ended and began, but nothing has ever felt like this.

It feels like everything in my life has been leading to this point. I quit weed and nicotine two weeks ago when I realized they were causing my more severe depressive symptoms. I've since realized, I'm the same person I've always been, even before my depression started at age 7. I feel ilke it took the last 8 years for me to find myself again. I'm 25 today and still living with my da, my brother and mother passed years ago. In a month, I graduate college. Then, I start my life. I'm excited, but I'm so scared. I'm scared to move out of this state. I'm scared I'll be alone. I'm scared of pursing my dreams, because I know the odds are poor and I can't fake optimism to myself. I'm scared that maybe I'm hoping this move will bring change, when really it is myself that needs change.

The thing is, I don't think there's anything left to work on. I mean, I have issues, but I'm not ignorant of them and I actively try to improve myself. I'm comfortable telling people I care about them now, I'm comfortable with myself. I don't know if I have much of an identity outside of ""stoner"" and ""fuckboy"", but those are two labels I never wanted so I'm happy to be moving away from them. All my friends have moved on and started their lives. It's my turn, and it's so intimidating. I haven't found a place, I haven't found a job, I haven't made efforts to make it happen because it's intimidating.

This is my first post and I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for any mistakes.

A bit of background:

I've always had a lot of hair, even as a kid. It's really curly, really thick, really hard to take care of, but I really take pride in it. I'm white, but my hair is the only proof that my family is ethnically Arab, you know? It's really been something important to me.

HOWEVER. I've always wanted to cut it all off. Not because I don't like it, but because I've always wanted the chance to regrow it healthier and undo all the hair damage. I agreed with my parents that I could shave it off in college, with my friend (let's call her Anna).

Yesterday, though, I kinda just cut it all off. Like ALL OFF. Quarantine has been treating me really badly and it doesn't help that I'm celebrating Ramadan. For the past few days I've been swinging from mania to apathy and have resorted to cutting. I've cut before, but never this often and this deep.

So yesterday, I got in a fight with my parents. I fell into that familiar feeling of losing control. But instead of cutting or crying I just locked myself in the bathroom, Facetimed Anna, and cut off all my hair.

As of now my parents don't know. I've been wearing hoods and hiding my hair. Even Anna doesn't know; she thinks I was just trimming a bit of the ends. She even told me she would be mad to see me bald when I joked about cutting off too much.

But I'm scared. I've never had hair this short. Only a few people know by now. I don't know how to take care of short hair. And I feel bad for lying to Anna and breaking our promise.

However I know the owners have a little “pull” and will push to re-open ASAP. 
I work in a gentleman’s club as a masseuse. Which means I go around to each customer and ask, would you like a massage. Then I give a back massage for one song, some ask to continue into a second song, etc. we are required to use purell after every customer. We get large groups, we get a lot of businessmen that travel and regulars and locals etc. It’s a high risk business, touching people, close contact, etc. 
I have my esthetician license and have always wanted to use it and get into that field because I really love it.

Although there may be a total change where no one is going to strip clubs, because so many have lost jobs etc. but , who knows. 
I can’t decide if going back when they re open is worth it. I also have been safe (thank god) so far, but I know a lot of people that had this virus, and some that have died or had to be in ICU, so I do take this very serious. My health is most important to me, but realistically I also have bills. I can’t imagine them having us wear gloves and a mask at work. That’s not “sexy”.

646,"I’ve had consistent stress and trauma throughout 2020. A break up, 2 kinds of precancer, surgery for one kind, harassment and emotional abuse from the ex, financial stress due to medical bills, suicide of someone I cared for... I’m sure there’s more that’s escaping me, but the point is 2020 has been a barrage of wtf. 

I was doing pretty well until April and I suppose I still am considering everything. There had been a break in harassment and I was able to convert to telework to stay safe. I felt like I had finally been able to right my ship and was on track to make up for lost productivity over the past couple months at work while also focusing on self care.

Then out of no where the harassment popped up again. It stopped after a couple days, but my whole rhythm was thrown off. I’ve noticed I’m experiencing bursts of high anxiety throughout the work day that rolls into depression. I’m way behind and am desperately trying to make up work in my off, but by my weekends I’m mentally shot from the anxiety of the week. Basically I’m in a vicious cycle of panic and depression which has shot my ability to focus.

It’s also lead to insomnia. I’m now in a pattern where I can’t sleep, or can’t focus on my work until late at night. I’m up until about 5 am and exhausted the next day, which further kills my productivity.  Then I sleep like the dead for the next two days. I get two solid nights of sleep and the third night the insomnia returns and the cycle repeats itself.

I have a therapist, but I’m waiting to see them until my previous claims go through and I get some reimbursement. The events of the last 6 months have resulted in over $2000 of therapy bills all out of pocket so far. 

I’m exhausted and just want to get back on track. Any pointers?",26Apr2020,1

I took the decision a few weeks back to move in with my partner on the advice of the health minister who basically said 'either get on with it and video chat, or move in with each other' for couples living apart.

Initially we said I'll just continue to pay rent at my house until the lockdown is over, but it does not appear to be going away anytime soon so now I'm in a situation where I need to quickly move things out and sort the house, as each month I don't it's costing me close to a thousand in rent and bills.

So my question is what's the best way to do this without being too much of a dick with essential travel rules? It's an hours drive so my initial plan was pay for storage, go back and do a trip every 2 weeks, pack as much as I can and stick it in storage then sort once this all ends.",26Apr2020,1
650,"CONTEXT: 
1. My dad is a boomer from India and I’m a third culture kid and a millennial. I was raised in South East Asia. Our different upbringings and age gap means to my dad that the way I speak is not okay and I should not have much to say as I’m a woman. 
2. He often uses provocative negative adjectives (rubbish, junk, fake, stupid, selfish..etc) to describe his disapproval of things and people. I am always uncomfortable. 
3. The smallest things set him off. 
4. I’m 27 and living with my parents because a few years back my mum was unwell and I stayed and then I had a accident and that also made me stay on with the folks. I want to pay rent and utilities but they won’t accept. 
5, With Corona, things seem uncomfortable to move. 


6. My dad since I was a child has told me he owns me because of the money he has paid for my education. I haven’t caught a break yet but I’m keeping on and intend to contribute more to my parents financially. He doesn’t want to accept even rent right now. He just wants to feel entitled that he paid for me a child. 

In fact today he told me that all the money he spent on me, he wished he had spent on charity instead because the return is terrible on me. 

Years ago this would broke me. It didn’t but it really stings. 


HIS TERMS: 
He just wants me to stay at his place only to take this kind of provocative language and also teach him technology and fix things around the house or I get out of his house. 

WHAT HE WONT ACCEPT : 
But I can’t pay for my consumption in the house. He won’t take my money but he wants to lord over me that he wasted all his money on me whenever I tell him
“I’m uncomfortable with this provocative language u use” 

MY DILEMMA: 
I don’t know if I want to move out during this weird time in the world right now and I want to be close to my mother to make sure she’s okay. I don’t know what to do because my dads a narcissist and he tells himself he’s a victim in the story. I’m really trying my best with him and whilst he personalises, I don’t personalise. I just tell him simply I’m uncomfortable when I am. And he kept retorting if I’m so uncomfortable, I should leave. He knows this is a dangerous time to be moving out. And to be honest I can’t afford this until 2021. 


ADVICE NEEDED: 
How do I emotionally disinvest from the situation? He can be so mean. I don’t understand why a parent who made their own decision to spend on their child’s highschool keep lording it over them and saying they wished they didn’t spend a dime? 

Maybe I shouldnot wonder why.

I had a rough start when I began a few months ago, I had minimal training and had little direction on what to do.

655,"I need to finish my college dissertation in order to get my Master's degree. I started it last summer, at the same time when my scholarship ended and I was considering getting a job. Halfway through my dissertation work, I accepted a job offer, not so much because it interested me as much as I would have felt like an idiot if I refused it, because I had to get a job eventually and it seemed like that was as good as it was going to realistically get. I am currently working there, I don't mind it, but my dissertation has grinded to a halt. Even though working there objectively shouldn't be draining, since I  am basically still the new guy on the team and there is a limited amount of stuff they can reliably let me do (and since we are smartworking), I clock out from work and I cannot bring myself to do anything productive when it comes to the dissertation. I have grown to hate that dissertation. I already blew the first deadline, and most of the people I went to college with are now graduated. I also feel bad for the supervisor, because since there is no progress I never mail her, and I feel ashamed when I do. There are lots of other cool things that I want to do, like writing a book and making a small videogame, that I cannot do because I would feel guilty for allotting mental resources to something that isn't a priority, but I am not doing the dissertation anyway, so I end up doing mostly nothing during my free time and feeling guilty about it. 

I have tried talking about this to my peers, but they don't get it. A lot of them are more behind than me when it comes to college, and most of the ones that already graduated do not have a job, and the ones that did graduate and have a job are being paid less than I am. So everybody just tells me that it doesn't matter if I am procrastinating, because I am already working, which is besides the point.

I don't really know what kind of advice I am expecting to receive, since at the end of the day it's something that I have to do and there is no way around it, maybe I just wanted to get this off my chest. Or maybe it's just an excuse to do something other than the dissertation.",26Apr2020,1

Such as cow, worthless, stupid, etc. My dad also purposely tries annoying me to get a reaction out of me. And when I’m upset, instead of letting me cool down, he just barges in my room, and keeps harassing me. He claims that something’s wrong with me. He says that I will never be loved  or cared about by anyone else. At least as much as they do.

 I don’t respect them because of the way they’ve treated me my entire life. My home life isn’t the worst, but it’s emotionally stressful. They cut off my entire family when I was young for their own selfish reasons. They speak so poorly about them, it’s disgusting. And any time something is going on, they always put me in the middle of it. And I just try saying nothing. Growing up, I barely got any affection. No hugs, or anything like that. Or support. I cannot trust them with anything.

662,"Now, before anyone says “just move” let me explain why that’s not an option.

- We own our home, and are expecting. We just spent a ton of time and money into a nursery, and remodeling.

- The global situation

- We’re a close neighborhood, meaning all of my other neighbors are now friends and we like the community we’ve built over the past 6 years living here.

So, about the worst neighbors ever: (they just moved in a few months ago)

They’re either ex, or still currently active gangbangers. I know some of them have done a lot of time (because he screams it out loud all constantly)

They park their cars on their front lawn, and turn the volume knob ALL. THE. WAY. UP... to the point where then license plate vibrating against the trunk is louder than the music itself. And it’s not the most “family friendly” music either. It’s like.. angry rap? And I get it, play your music time to time, have a nice day outside, but this is an every day thing.

They don’t seem to have jobs, so they’re home all day long (I am too, I work from home) and all they do is yell. And I mean YELL. “Fuck you bitch! I’ll cut you!” ect.

They’re currently in a war with our other neighbors (who are this sweet senior couple)

The police come at least once a week, and last week SWAT came. We’re talking 15-20 police cars and helicopters everywhere, arresting these people. I think 10 of them live in this 3 bedroom.

They recently bought a pig. The pig screams too.

They have a kid who enjoys running outside with his clothes off, tipping over all the trash cans and punching trees.

One of them has a daily ritual of sitting on the curb out front and smoking his bong for a few hours. Yes, in broad daylight. In front of kids.

I can go on forever, but I’m sure you get it. They’re terrible people.

So realistically, what can I do?

I can’t find their landlords information (I know they rent) and I’ve asked local PD to do more cruise by’s around the block, but I haven’t seen one since I asked.

Moving is definitely the total last resort, but maybe some of you had some similar experiences with a positive outcome. Any and all advice, stories, ect much appreciated!

Recently, I have transferred to a new school with my best friend of a few years. I've always had a small social group, and coming from a school with a small population all of my life I found only a few, but good people that I resonate with. One of them is the people I transferred with to a new school with a considerably bigger student population than the last one.

For the first few weeks, I tended to stick to my long-time amigo since I wasn't really the 'go out and make friends' type. Albeit, we were in different classes. She made a few friends in her class quite quickly, so I kind of hung around her and her friends for a while, even though I didn't get a few inside jokes and conversations here and there. I tried my best to fit in and be happy for her.

As the months passed, I found people in my own class that I became really close with, while my best friend on the other hand, had slowly lost the people she talked to every day. We grew apart bit by bit because we had different schedules and subjects, etc. I tried my best to keep in touch with her even though it was getting harder but sometimes she would grow cold on me and imply sometimes that I've left her for other people. My new group of friends are nice, and I try to include my best friend in our group whenever I can, but it's clear that she's not super compatible with the new people I surround myself with. I found myself in the same situation from the start of the school year, but reversed.

I feel guilty, because my best friend has stuck by me through the years and has really helped me grow as a person, and she's said the same to me. Recently she expressed to me how she's been feeling alone, and overall from the way I've seen her talk for the past few months she just seemed so tired and lonely. I do try and hang out with her whenever I can but it's come to the point where she just pushes me away sometimes. With schoolwork, and everything else, as well, I feel like there's no time for me to make for her.

Today, we've been stuck in quarantine since early March, and I haven't seen her since. We haven't talked online for about a month, which is extremely long considering how we used to constantly message each other all day back then. My new group of friends is great, but every time I do something with them, without my best friend, I just feel like I'm betraying her. I've just been agonizing about this for months and I completely don't know what to do.",26Apr2020,1

So here’s a backstory
During the summer of 2017, I moved to a completely different city where I didn’t know anybody. I was 13 at the time and was going to be in the 8th grade. I’ve made a group of friends that would sometimes talk to to today. (Btw the close friends that I mentioned went my old school)
Then high school started. I met a few people but they were just acquaintances and nothing to special and I spent the majority of the year by myself. Then halfway into my sophomore (Either October or November of 2019 but I don’t exactly remember when) is when I had my first true panic attack. (I was a judge at a middle school science fair).

I have pretty good grades, but he always downplays it and tells me that ""Chinese kids do more work at 6 years old"" and tells me I am a loser. Recently we had a LARGE fallout to the point where he took a knife threateningly and said ""I'll show you how to kill yourself the right way!"". He talked to my mom and told her not to help me, not to let me receive my Driver's License (He threatened to divorce her, and she is not from America and relies on him), not be allowed to pursue a part-time job, and he said he was going to kick me out of the house at 18 (And due to the fact he doesn't allow me to have a phone, I basically have no intimate friends or partners to stay with) before I can receive my HS diploma, which worries me because you need one for the military, and I planned to use that to later head to college.

I've had a tight group of friends for about 10 years or so, we have mainly been 3-4 people. We have hung out regurarly and have had contact almost daily.

Over the past 2 years more and more people have joined our group of friends, the group now consist of about 9-10 people. Over time i have been starting to feel more and more left out by the while group. Barely getting invites and/or any response when i occasionaly write in the group chat. Other members get responded to almost instantly.

684,"I’ve never posted before and the only reason I am is because I’m at war with myself in my head. 

I’m sure others can relate when I say that I’m not necessarily comfortable and confident in my body. Add a porn addicted fiancé to the mix and I definitely feel a lack of self esteem. 

The back story is this (and I’m sorry if it gets long) I’ve caught my fiancé hiding watching porn numerous times. I’ve been cheated on before and had exes compare my lady parts to other girls before and so porn is just a no fly zone for me. It makes me feel self hatred and that I’m not good enough with the way I look and the way I am in bed. 

Twice now my fiancé and I have spoken about it. Twice we have sought counseling over it (one time together and one time just him). I thought we were over this. Last night I rolled over around 4:30 am and he quickly put the phone down and turned off the volume. I pretended to still be asleep because It was almost exactly what had happened the last time I walked in on him watching porn (with my sister and godson in the house no less). He was quick to delete his browser history and start playing a game on his phone. I went back to sleep (because who had the energy to deal with bullshit at 4:30 am?)

My dilemma now: he is at work, on overtime. I haven’t spoken about it with him. I’m increasingly getting frustrated and beating myself up over this. Do I let it go? Or do I talk to him about it? Oh - I should probably add that we were planning on getting married this Saturday.",26Apr2020,1

686,"My fiancee (f22) and our roommate (f22) got into an argument over a shut door. They have both been friends for over a decade and have never gotten into a physical altercation with eachother until recently. 

My fiancee shut our roommates door because she was playing music; my fiancee's reasoning behind it was to give our roommate some privacy (so she says, but I think its because she was annoyed by the music). Our roommate runs out and (rumored) rudely tells my fiancee not to shut her door again. To put it short; telling started, then a physical fight began that I had to stop.

I've been looking at this altercation neutrally; it's no question that the quarantine has made us a bit on edge. In our roommates eyes, the closing of the door started the argument. In my fiancee's eyes, our roommates lashing out after the door shut started the argument. 

I'm not taking sides on the argument but when trying to explain what I thought about this situation to my fiancee (in our roommates eyes my fiancee started the argument but in my fiancee's eyes it was the roommate), all of a sudden I'm the bad guy because I tell my fiancee she should apologize for shutting the door. I'm not saying our roommate shouldn't apologize; she definitely should. Both need to own up for their actions.

688,"I was hired at a company at the start of 2019 as their in house engineer. They renovated commercial buildings to suit the needs of the client who was purchasing the properties. I would design every aspect of the interior and verify it was up to code before giving the go head for them to start construction.

When I was hired I was told that I would be given a 3,500$ raise after 6 months. 6 months pass and my review goes great, during the review I bring up the raise I was told I would receive, to which I was told that “6 months is not a long enough time period to earn a raise”. 

I insist on this raise and tell them I’m going to walk out the door if they don’t stick to the agreement made when I was hired. They finally agree and give me the raise. 

Fast forward to December 2019. All of a sudden they firing everyone in the technical department and due to the lack of people my workload increases and I have to do jobs I wasn’t hired to do (supervise welders, labourers, manage shipments, order materials). 

After a few weeks of this they hire a kid fresh out of college and place him working with me to alleviate my workload. They ask me to train him so that he can draft smaller projects while I work on the larger ones. Most of the work he does is just cut and paste.

Stuff starts to slow down and March of 2020 rolls around, time for my year review. The moment I walked into the boardroom I knew stuff was about to hit the fan. Both owners of the company are there (this is odd because they never involve themselves with this stuff) and the heads of HR. 

I sit down and the review starts with them talking about how great I’ve done and how the improvements to the way they are doing things have been saving them money (I created inventory trackers that were updated when material was taken because they were losing thousands a year in wasted or lost material). 

During the review they move onto discussing my salary, and how work is slowing down so they want me to take a salary cut of....drum roll....3,500$. I strictly say no and that I will leave immediately if they do this. They respond with the fact that the new guy that I’ve been training for 3 months can do my job just as well and is getting paid a 3rd of what I am (he can’t do my job he’s not a certified structural engineer). At this point I’m fed up and I get up and leave. 

Fast forward to Friday last week and I get contacted by a lawyer saying that the company wants me to give them my personal laptop and cellphone because they might contain intellectual property belonging to the company. I say I will give them the phone and laptop if they wish but only if they give me retail value of the items so that I can replace them. They’ve now refused and are expecting me to give them my personal objects that I’ve purchased with my own money. 

TLDR; My old work screwed me around and replaced me with an underpaid fresh graduate that’s not certified to do my job and now wants me to give them my personal electronics.

I am adopted from Russia, and within the last year I connected with my birth family again after not talking to them for a long time. I am becoming very close with my brother. 

He is married and has two kids. He sent me the following email translated by google. 

""I work, Mary sits at home with children
 Our people have already ceased to be afraid, almost all go without masks, probably tired, our state does not help us in any way, they force us to stay at home and not go out, but it does not give us money, so almost all go to work despite the fact that the president forbade  .
 I think that soon we will have a riot, otherwise we will not be able to overcome all this.  Barbarism has begun, people are stealing in order to somehow survive.  It’s hard and scary to look at all this.  But nothing, as long as I have a stable job my family is safe""

I’ve dropped out of my university on my third year in VN since earlier this year ( mostly because i never did have enough competence nor passion for this particular major) i must admit prolonging such issue is truly bad but i do believe everything happened for a reason. After having time for myself and figuring out what i really want to pursue for the rest of my life, i’ve finally found and picked the major that suits my ability and ideal to help people -which is psychology. 
My plan was to study abroad ( cause VietNam teaching in PSYC is relatively outdated and poor compare to US or Canada) as soon as possible ( take a gap year during dropout would affect heavily on my registration for visa process)  and possibly finish grads school over there too (so approximately 6+ years) then come back home and fulfill my dream carrer in VietNam
However, during those contemplating time, i’ve also came up with an business idea from one of my lifetime hobby that have so much potential in VietNam regards to market niche, values, competitiveness etc... ( i did not waste my time in university lol )To me, this start-up opportunity is very appealing and hard to pass by, basically a secret pot of gold at the end of the road to be exact. If this was GTA , this would probably be my biggest side mission ever haha
And it really got me thinking, whether i should stay in VietNam and complete my BA degree while turning this business project into reality or to pursue becoming therapist that i know for fact is gonna be my future job. 
I know where i’m heading but i can’t do both at the same time

702,"This is a old post with some revisions that I originally sent to another thread. Reposting it because I truly need advice on this. Badly.

I am the youngest of three. At the time my mom got married, I was 8. Months after my mom got married, her husband attempted to have sexual advances with me. I remember three advances. Even though I didn’t know exactly what was going on, I knew something wasn’t right, so I either made an excuse or push/kicked him. Ever since then, throughout elementary school, middle school and now high school, that incident would always be at the back of my head, but I never had the strength to tell anybody. I was too embarrassed. I kept feeling like either I’d make a situation worse than it actually was or simply that no one would care. Especially at the time when it happened, I didn’t want to ruin my moms marriage since it the wedding was so recent. So I’d kept that secret, unfortunately. A few years ago, in middle school I decided to tell my sister about what happened, as it was getting increasingly obvious that I despised him. After that, nothing really changed. Now, I’m 17. In December, one thing led to another, and I ended up telling the rest of my family about what happened years ago, mother and brother. Both were shocked and my mom, being religious, started to come in my room every night to pray. Honestly, it was the first time I actually felt like my family truly cared about my feelings. I am used to them brushing things off and not really taking my problems seriously. I thought that my mom would confront him, or at least treat him differently after I told her. But, instead she worried about how this news would ruin his reputation and how my accusation would ruin his life. She seemed genuinely conflicted, but after a while, by the end of the month, everything went back to the way it was, like what I told them never even happened. In fact, they all treat him regularly, talking to him like he’s not a terrible person, treating him the exact same as before. Honestly, this makes me feel so little, so insignificant. And now, more than ever, we’re all stuck in the house 24/7 and I can’t take it anymore. I just want him to stop existing. I’ve started to doubt my memory, feeling like the incidents it didn’t even happen. And since I’m the only one acting relatively distant from him, I feel like I’m blowing up the situation. I feel absolutely and completely lost. What should I do.

Of course, when you join extracurriculars, you have to stay after school  for practice, workshops, etc. But my parents hated that, which I don't understand. I just always thought parents want their kids to do these things, to do more than just go to school. I did these extracurriculars for two years and everyday I faced them yelling at me, scolding me, telling me negative things because I was involved, but I put up with it until I got to college. 

Fast forward to college, I finally move out for the sake of my mental health and well being because my parents and the environment at home was too toxic for me to bear any longer.

708," Hi,

So practically I'm currently in some sort of cross road.

Some background info, about 4 years ago I had joined a job and this is were I had met her. She was the one training me, and we hit it off well, joking here and there, laugh etc, however she was in a relationship and I respected that and stood back. Fast forward a few months, whilst working there, I had developed a huge crush for her. Few more months pass by and I decide to stop working with that company since the management was horrible.

We still had remained in contact chatting occasionally through social media, and one day I found out she had broken up with her previous bf. After about a month or two I found this out, I was contemplating in asking her out whilst we were out with our mutual friends, however I got piss drunk plus I didn't have the balls to do so ... so I resorted to asking her out awkwardly over text the next morning. As you can guess, she said she no. She wasn't interested in dating in a while, this was a little awkward at first but we still chatted here and there, although I was the one to initialize most chats.

A few months pass by and I find out that, one of our mutual guy friends (which knew my intentions with her actually started dating her), that put me in a bad spot. Anyway I messed my course up due to this, changed course and also decided to start my own little business whilst studying full time.

Over the past 3 years this business grew and grew, year after year and still going strong, whilst I am still studying full time. Just to give you an idea, the past few months I have been making on average 5 figures monthly whilst studying full time. And as you can expect, I tend to buy expensive toys which are also good investments, which I share on my social media.

Anyway out of nowhere I thought of her, searched her up and decided to follow her. We hadn't chatted on any form of social media since 2018, we occasionally met on campus and exchanged a couple of words and that was it. After doing some digging, I am 90% convinced she split up with the previous (my 'ex' friend'). She liked one of the photos I recently uploaded and after realizing this I saw her story and replied to and decided to messaged her. Last night we chatted for a few hours straight and still are. She gave me a few compliments to how successful I am now.

Basically from what I said above, I changed a lot since I last asked her out, both in terms of physical appearance, maturity and income, however I don't want to end up in the same situation I was last time since I still have that crush vibe for her.

What would you do if you were in my spot?",26Apr2020,1

712,"I met this man ten years my senior when I was a teenager, and we spent a lot of time together talking and working. We had this wonderful chemistry that everyone recognized and commented on. Children would tell us what a cute couple we made. His friends would tease him about me and call me jailbait. His mother informed me one evening that he called her the day he met me to tell her what an amazing girl he had met, and that he’d been talking about me ever since. When I turned eighteen, I finally asked him on a date. He said that he personally felt he was too old for me and that he “COULDN’T say ‘yes’” because of the age difference, apologizing profusely. I was still in high school at the time, and he was unaware that my parents supported my decision, so I can understand his hesitation. I found out that he had been dating a psychopath and not making it public yet. He told me that he was dating her, but he SPECIFIED that it was the age difference between us that troubled him, demonstrating no dedication to loyalty. Really shady. 

He doesn’t know she has psychopathic tendencies because she’s so good at manipulating people. Before they were dating, she was already jealous of and obsessed with me and made no attempt to conceal that. She threatened to kill me. She told me she prayed for me to die every night. She mimicked everything I did and recreated all of my photos in creepy detail, even one from when I was twelve. She got drunk, groped me against my will, and confessed her love for me one night. I’ve seen her steal a toy from a child unrelated to her and KEEP it. She FOUGHT THIS CHILD for her toy. 

Anyway, fast forward a few years, and I’m a nonprofit CEO and university teacher studying for my master’s. Despite my several attempts at feigning interest in all sorts of men that I SHOULD consider sexy, I haven’t been attracted to anyone since him. Their relationship persisted as of March, but is obviously bad, perhaps due to her living so far away. Each of them rarely mentions the other online. There are almost no pictures of them together. I don’t think she was even with him to celebrate his birthday, despite her being out of work and neither of them belonging to the at-risk population. I understand that happy couples don’t feel the need to boast about their romance online, but this is a whole other level when other people regularly appear in their photos, but rarely each other. No, I’m not stalking him online. A relative feels the need to tell me this stuff despite me begging her not to because I don’t want to hear about them. 

Honestly, YES, I acknowledge that I could probably marry rich or at least snag someone conventionally attractive or successful, but I want HIM. There’s a plethora of reasons for me to believe he had feelings for me as a teenager.

Now me and the girl, lets say her name is cayla... have some sexual tension. we were somewhat friends prior to me moving in. It is obvious that she has a crush on me and has made it very apparent she wants to be intimate. Now i dont have a problem with this, the problem i have is with any feelings she my have or develop torwads me, and also living with someone and being intimate...

Obviously i could talk to her about it and ask her if she would be down for a fwb or casual hook up situation. i could also wait untill she is about to move out. im attracted to her, but not emotional. truth be told i want to hookup with her, but fear things will get complicated, and i dont want to lose having a place to live. shes a pretty chill girl like i feel we could just have fun and nothing will happen but i mean obivously her fam will prolly find out and this that or the other..

714,"Over the past few years, I changed from being able to communicate with people like a normal person to having lots of anxiety now over just saying hi to someone. Just the thought of saying hi to someone I don't know or something stresses me out so much, which it didn't before. I wish I could go back to how I was before. I'm scared of going to shopping malls and the worst thing about it is that everyone thinks I'm being rude or something when I would do anything to change this. Worst of all, my dad said 'snobby people don't say hi to people' as if he was directing it towards me. In no way do I believe I am better than anyone, and I actually think i'm worse than everyone. It just annoys me so much how people say this stuff. I know from an outsider, I might look rude when I run away and don't want to say hi because I'm scared of people judging me or something. I don't expect people to know I have anxiety but sometimes I wish I could be someone else. I don't know what to do. How can I stop running away from these situations?",26Apr2020,1

I have some, let's say, psychological troubles. Nothing extreme, but still fairly bad (depressive tendencies for example); she has some of these troubles as well. I'm into art, music, philosophy, literature, etc; she's into that as well.

She really is the first girl I've met whom I consider to be really *interesting*. That's why I dig her.

Still, as I said, I'm psychologically unstable. And I doubt she's the right one for me precisely because she is psychologically unstable as well.

I keep dreaming of meeting that girl (like they are so many) who have this positive outlook on life. I deeply believe I need a girl like that to have a truly healthy relationship and doubt that it would be possible with a *psychologically unstable girl*. I'm convinced her problems will come along at some point and that they will destroy our relationship in some way.

717,"Guys should I feel guilty for this ???

So I’m on my 2nd year of uni but my parents think I’m on my 3rd! However they know what year I graduate since they know I had a gap year!

The just don’t really know about my repeat year! 
I ended up telling them my course goes for an extra year! 
I just told a half truth to them that I had to retake some units and that my course goes on for an extra year due to certain majors!! So that made up for the “repeat year”
And they already knew I took a gap year. 

Telling them the actual truth would cause allot of stress in the family since I have ethnic parents!! And I’ll feel more pressure! Also My fees are Government funded! They just help out here and there when needed or little bit of pocket money here and there but most of the time I do my own extra funds!!  
We also get government benefits for 3 years  which is signed by our parents during high school and they put a bit into to it however I told the truth about that and delayed my payments until I finish this year off because I don’t want any situations with that so for now I’ve been working and paying any major fees I need! And I dont want to lie when it comes to government stuff especially when my parents have put a bit into! I rather just get that when I’m supposed than lie !! 
My parents just don’t know I’ll be getting that part money next year instead and nor do I want to tell them as I don’t want them to spend extra for me! 
But I’ve been well financially! 

And ofcourse if I do face any troubles now which effect my studies I will definitely tell them and fess up since I don’t want this to Turn into a bigger problem! But for now I seem to be getting my grades on point ! 

So basically they know when I graduate!! Like by then even if it shows up in my graduation certificate I don’t think they will care by then! Or I’ll just let them know and won’t really be fussed since I already graduated!! 

So idk I feel guilty cause they do support me allot and trust me. I will admit during the repeat year I had major anxiety to attend uni so I did spend time just mucking around and stress drinking, getting high but I’ve changed that ! And I’ve set my priorities straight ! I’m also seeing a professional and a counsellor at my uni 

So to cut it short 
They know when I graduate 
I half told the truth 
The gov fund i will get a bit later but it’s safe. I just didn’t wanna grab it earlier and lie to the gov on that stuff. My parents think I got it. However I’m not broke just to make it clear. Just feel guilty that they think that and telling them now they will know the reason why about me repeating! 

Back to the graduation they will eventually find out but when I graduate however they won’t be mad by then as I’ve already graduated!

And again any troubles I face this time! I will fess up and be honest and make it up how ever! 
But I am doing really good and well for now ! I’m actually doing better studying without pressure and stress. If I can continue to work my way up this way I’ll feel good I managed to make it! But it’s just the guilt for now",26Apr2020,1

721,"I (28F) moved in with my (random) roommates (26F and 21F) 4 months ago. I quickly realized that they live quite messy lives and leave messes around the house. That part I have gotten kind of used to because I am very clean and really don’t mind cleaning. However, any advice there would be greatly appreciated as well. Anyway, the main thing is they’re loud. One roommate is very, let’s say, theatrical when she’s talking and many times I’ve heard her yelling on the phone (with her bedroom door wide open. Like not even cracked at all) in the late hours of the night when I’m needing to get some sleep. I’ll do everything I can (have my standing fan on to drown out the noise, close my door as much as possible (I have two cats who roam the house at night so it can’t be fully closed), cover my ears with pillow), but I can still hear her. I’ve had to text her twice to please keep it down or shut her door so I can’t hear her. The first time I asked she was in the kitchen and slammed shut my hallway door (that was cracked, again bc my cats roam the house at night). The second time I asked she was in her room and slammed shut her door (I really mean slammed when I say slammed). This was at 1am. Then at 2am I hear my hallway door SLAM shut, which wakes me up. There was also another day when my two roommates were out in the common area listening to music loudly and singing even louder. I was in my room working (because I’m having to work from home during COVID-19), had my door shut and my noise canceling headphones on and could still hear them. I texted them and they got quieter after 10-15 mins. 
Every time I’ve had to get onto them about noise it is because it’s affecting work and/or sleep. I certainly feel like I get a bit of attitude back when I ask for quiet, but I think it’s just common curtesy when you’re living with random roommates to be as mindful as possible. Any advice is appreciated!",26Apr2020,1

724,"Ok buckle up cuz this might be a long one...this is my first post ever on reddit, so I don’t know if I’m doing this entirely right. I’m a (almost) 19 year old female, living with my mom, stepdad, and twin brother. My brother and I both go to community college where we’re full time students and we also both have a part time job. We also have an older brother who goes to college about 2 hours away. 

My parents are planning on moving from California (where we live now) to Florida within the next year or two, as soon as my stepdad retires. They’ve been talking about Florida for a couple of years now but I never thought they were serious. Now they’ve visited Florida multiple times, as vacations and to scope out different realtors, areas, houses, etc.

I’m undiagnosed but I believe that I have depression and anxiety. That’s another thing that has put strain on my mom and I’s relationship (and I think a big reason why I’m struggling with them, and possibly me, moving to Florida): over the years, I’ve tried to ask for help and tell her that I’m struggling with my mental health but she just writes it off as me being dramatic and over sensitive. She says things like “I’m not sure why you think you’re the only person who gets a little bit nervous or sad sometimes” and I often can’t respond because I’ll be so hurt. 

The thing is, I’ve never imagined living anywhere but california. I’ve also lived my whole entire life in this same house and same neighborhood. Every time my parents moving to Florida gets brought up, I end up crying and getting into a huge fight/argument with my mom. She wants me to move with them, and I don’t know what I want. I’ll often try to tell her that it just scares me because I don’t know what I want for my future, I haven’t even decided on a major in college. I also tell her that I wouldn’t have anyone in Florida, that everything I’ve ever known will be gone and that I’ll have to start completely new (a new job, school, friends). She usually responds by saying that they’re leaving all of their friends and family too, that they’ll have to leave their jobs and start new too. But I just feel like it’s different for me. She has my stepdad, they want to go to Florida, it’s their decision, they won’t have to get new jobs or go to a new school, however I would. She’ll tells me I’m selfish for not being happy for them and for only thinking about myself which is again hurtful. 

Our conversations always end with her making me feel bad and nothing being resolved. I’ll even make a point to constantly verbalize that I’m excited for them, but that it’s just an internal thing with me that I’m struggling with, but no matter what it never ends on a happy note.

I’ve talked about just staying here in California and looking for an apartment, but I realistically can’t afford one (even with a roommate or two) considering I only have time and energy for a part time job. That leaves me with limited options: having to move with them to Florida, living with family members I have here, or busting my ass/possibly taking time off of school (which isn’t really an option) to make more money. 

My aunt and her two daughters, my cousins, just moved into a brand new house here with 2 extra rooms. They’ve jokingly (but really not so jokingly) offered for me to move in with them once my parents move, but my mom hates the idea of that. My mom hasn’t had the most amazing relationship with her sister, my aunt, although they do get along and love each other. My mom keeps saying “if you were to live with aunt or grandma, I would just feel as if I’ve done something wrong as a parent. I don’t want you to live with them”. So that really makes my only option to move with them to Florida.

At the end of the day I love my mom and stepdad and I’m sure that moving to Florida wouldn’t even be that bad. I just have so much anxiety around it that I can’t even think about driving there cross country, getting a new job, going to a new school, making new friends. I feel so conflicted and hurt and I don’t even know what I want when it comes to literally anything in life, so it makes it hard when my mom wants me to know exactly what I want and be on board with moving to Florida.

I’m sorry that this is so long and jumbled. I’m not even sure what the point of this whole essay was, I guess just to ask for some advice on what to do?",26Apr2020,1
725,"Hey Reddit. 

Seeing as we’ve had a lot of time to self-reflect recently, I noticed that I have a bit of problem obsessing over certain people. Note, I would like to preface this by saying that I DO NOT act on these feelings because I know they are irrational. 

At the moment, I’m rather concerned with communication with a specific woman.  I find myself checking if she’s communicating with other people throughout the day and not with me (mainly initiating) which I KNOW is insane because obviously I’m not the most sacred person on earth for her. 

I know several of you will suggest that this has to do with me being a highly insecure individual, and this is a funny thing, because I don’t consider myself to be really insecure:( I think it is that I’m rather obsessive nature… I don’t want to feel this way because, obviously she isn’t doing anything she’s not “allowed” to do, And by no means are we in any exclusive relationship.

We flirt on a regular basis, and In general things are very positive between us. I don’t like feeling “uneasy” if I don’t hear from her for a period of time, and obviously checking to see if she’s talking to other people is an unhealthy obsessive behavior. 

I want to stop this.

726,"I [F14] have been friends with a girl named, ""Anne"" [F14] for about a year. She always had depression and her mom was abusive.

Ever since we went into quarantine she has gotten depressed again from staying home all day with her mom. Her mom was mean to her and she would tell me about it when we were texting. I started to get worried again. Today she told me that she will give her mom a list of reasons why she hates her for Mother's Day. I tried to convince her to change her mind, but I couldn't.

728,"This is a lot of venting/ explaining my mom and her need to act like a child both finically and mentally. TL;D is below 



My mom, to say the least, is not a like able person. She is okay when you first meet her, she has this facade that she is the nicest person ever. But once you get to know her she’s extremely draining. She has a constant need to expect everything to be her way. Which I feel is a common behavior for moms. But what makes her even worse is she acts like she’s ten. She will get on Facebook and make aggressively mean comments about whoever is involved in situation. 

I have two separate facebooks one for family and one for friends. I now avoid logging into my family Facebook because every time I do I get second hand embarrassment from her posts so bad I start to feel anxious. She will literally tag people in posts attacking them over stupid things, almost always because she commented on someone post speaking on things that she shouldn’t feel entitled to speak on. Even in person, she has this high-school-bully complex to her. 

Her need to be the mean popular girl in all social settings have caused her to lose every job shes has. I’ve lived with her in my grandpas house for two years. She’s had over 6 jobs in the last two years. All because she was mean to someone or she felt entitled to yell at people because they don’t work exactly how she wants them to. 


I think my grandpa is getting very impatient with her. She’s lived with him longer than I have.  He let her live with him under the pretense that she would be there just until she could get on her feet. Whenever I talked to her about moving out she’d say that she shouldn’t have to move out because her dad was absent when she was a kids and he owes her. 

Now my grandpa is extremely nice. He’s been trying his best to be patient and I don’t think he ultimately minds we are here for the most part. He does whatever he can to make our lives easy. Like when she first moved in with him, he bought another car with the purpose of her being able to drive it. Except now she can’t because turns out she was lying about having a valid license. She ended up getting pulled over in said car and now he won’t let her drive the car until she reinstates her license. So for the last year and a half my grandpa has been driving her to and from work whenever she can’t car pool. 

She works a job making decent money, and pays no bills besides hers and my phone bill. (Even those bills she doesn’t always make, but she always has 200$+ of weed every pay period!) My grandpa refuses to take money from her and tells her she doesn’t have to pay bills for the house. She’s had a year and a half to pay off all the tickets she’s accumulated to get her license back. She’s paid none. She told me she will never have a license back because it’s too much money and stupid to pay for her tickets. But when my grandpa asks about it she has a whole fake spiel about how she needs to hire the lawyer and go to court for the last ticket and that she’s paid for the rest. 

My mom has never been able to make bills my entire life. In fact she was the kind of mom that I would come home and she would have sold a bunch of my things so she could buy marijuana. She’s not a drug addict for hard drugs. But my entire life she prioritized weed over bills or she would see tv’s, air conditioners, neglect bills and so on. So it often feels like she is. 


What I need advice on is how to pick up my life. I’ve turned 18 a few months ago. I was finally scheduled to take a GED class right before the pandemic that’s obviously was cancelled. (+ The reason I didn’t graduate high school was because I was enrolled into online school and we got into an argument. Her way of punishing me was taking JUST my lap top. I was kicked out of school for my absence. Which I tried explaining to her this would happen she would ignore me. Whenever I spoke about me re-enrolling into school she would avoid the topic all together.) 


Anyways, so when the pandemic is over I am going to go for my GED finally. I was also thinking of going to consoling because I have severe anxiety which is stagnating my motivation. I’m not sure if that’s a good idea or not. I just need advice on ways I can not depend on her at all. She isn’t dependable and I’m afraid my grandpa is going to be ready to kick us out soon.  I have nothing organized for myself. She can’t even get bills in her name anymore from her owing so much from when I was younger. She expects me to put them all in my name. I don’t trust her enough to do that. I cannot put my future or my credit in her hands knowing how she can’t keep a job longer than a few months. Any advice? I’m only 18 and trying to figure out my life. I don’t know where to start. She isn’t a good person to ask so here I am reddit. 


TL;DR 
I’m F18 and trying to sort out my life. I’m currently semi-dependent on my mom. We live with my grandpa and I’m afraid he’s going to kick us out soon. My mom isn’t finically responsible and she can’t keep a job because she has a high school bully complex to her personality that gets her fired. If my grandpa kicks us out I’m going to be fully dependent on her. She has terrible credit and owes so much money from past bills that if we move out everything will be in my name. I don’t trust her at all for this. 

- I was scheduled for a GED class before the pandemic that was obviously cancelled. I will be going to one when everything is back to normal. 
- I was also considering the possibility of going to consoling because I have severe anxiety that causes me to have stagnant motivation. But I’m not sure if this is a good idea. 

(After I get my GED I do plan to enroll into college)

However, we watch all my shows together, so If I watch one, she's behind or she has to watch it separately. While that's ok maybe, If it's possible, I REALLY want to watch every episode with her together, not alone and not a second time so she catches up. For me, watching an episode twice is not that enjoyable. I would do it for her, but I feel it's a waste of time and I want to experience each episode with her together and share the joy of seeing something the first time together.

So here I am, having literally no show to watch by myself anymore, and therefore divert to reddit posts and some youtubers, where I actually have some channels I watch alone and not together with her.

Is there a solution that we can both enjoy? Or should I change my own rules and taste somehow? How do others solve this problem, if they have or had something like that?",26Apr2020,1
736,"I’m at a point in my life where I feel like I’m at a crossroad. I feel like I’m about to make a life changing decision and I’m seeking advice. I’m 24 years old still living at home. I graduated college with a degree in Marketing. I went the majority of my college years with no real major in mind. I eventually settled on Marketing my senior year after taking one marketing class I enjoyed. 

After I graduated I was still working at my delivery job , which I had been working at throughout my whole time at college. Like I said I wasn’t completely set on Marketing so I was in no rush to find a job once I graduated. I was happy with my current job delivering food. I got to work with my girlfriend, who I met at work. I enjoyed working with all of the staff, and the owner was very nice too. 

This didn’t sit well with my mom. She wanted me to get a Marketing job now that I graduated. She was constantly on top of me making sure I sent out applications, sent emails, and looked into job fairs. 

I understood her worries and started to apply myself. I took about a year until I finally got a call back for a job. My mom and dad were so excited for me. My mom told all of her family I finally got a job. 

Two days into my job I realized I was working for a pyramid scheme. The job was nothing like it’s description, it was basically selling “makeup bags” to people. It was horrible, not only was it something I had no interest in doing, it was 7am-7pm Monday-Saturday and it was a very far commute from my house. 

On my 3rd day of work there was a huge amount of traffic on the bridge I took to get there. This led to me being 2 hours late on my third day. Which was supposed to be my first day “in the field” selling makeup bags. I realized on my drive there that this was a blessing in disguise. It gave me the courage to quit as soon as I got to work. The manager called me to see where I was, he let me know he was disappointed that I was this late on my third day, he said to meet him in his office for a talk when I got to work. 

When I got there I did it. I quit. It was one of the most liberating feelings I’ve ever had. I was so happy because for the first time in my life I didn’t just “go with the flow”. I finally stood up for my happiness. I wasn’t going to be miserable doing a job because I just started.

However this meant I was now back delivering food. My mom was very unhappy with this, but she understood that this job wasn’t what was advertised. So I was back to looking for jobs on indeed. 

6 months went by and I heard nothing. My mom was starting to get back on my case, complaining that I wasn’t proactive enough in looking for a job. Things got pretty bad when I lied about going to a job fair, when I actually went to the gym instead, and my mom caught me by tracking my location. 

After this happened the idea of joining the Air Force came into my head. It made sense, I can get away to experience living in another state or country. I get to work a physical job where I’m required to stay in shape, which is something I value. And I get to meet new people. However, this would mean time away from my girlfriend and family. I wasn’t ready for that. 

By the spring time my mom had suggested trying to become a teacher, which was something she’s done for the past 20 years. I was fortunate enough to get a job pretty quickly working at a a school. I got a teachers Assistant role. I was gonna go for it and become a teacher. I wasn’t 100% on it, but it felt like it made sense. 

I had to apply for grad school and take the GRE. I got in, and took my first two classes while starting to work in a school for the new year. The grad classes were very boring and I didn’t have any interest in the material being taught to me. 

I really enjoy working with Highschool students. I find that I can easily relate to them due to us being close in age. I work at a charter school so they can be as old as 21. But I still wasn’t happy. I felt like most of the work being assigned to them was bullshit busy work. And my job was to go around the class and make sure they were doing the work. I had to enforce rules I thought were bullshit. So most of the time I just do the work for the students to help them out. I know that sounds like I’m doing the opposite, but the work they are assigned is very meaningless in my opinion . 

So I finished my first 2 grad classes with good grades. Then I took my next 2 classes. The next 2 classes were online, so they required much more time, reading through the material. The work was much more boring to me and I had no intentions on doing any of it. I dropped one class immediately. After a week of taking only one online class I realized this wasn’t for me. I dropped the second class as well. 

While this was all going on I was becoming more and more unhappy at work. They days were dragging. I realized that I’m not going to go through with being a teacher. It’s not something I’m passionate about. So the idea of joining the Air Force came back to me. 

I’m still working as a teachers assistant today, but from home due to quarantine. Having to login to video chat for 5 hours a day has confirmed my belief that this job isn’t for me. It’s miserably boring. So I told my mom I’m not going back to grad school. I feel that it’s a waste of money and time. I already spent 4 years at college and that really didn’t help me get a job so why should I go back? She was understanding and asked what I’m going to do now. 

So I told her the idea of joining the Air Force again. She loved it and thought it was a very good idea for me to do. So I reached out to a recruiter and I’m starting the process of enlisting. I’ve thought about pursuing a career in music production like making beats, or writing for a tv show. Music and comedy are the things I really enjoy in life, and I recently found an interest in writing. But I don’t know how I would be able to make a living doing one of those things. I’m not really a “go getter” type of person. This is the only thing holding me back from being 100% sure on the Air Force. I know that those are my passions in life, but I don’t have any plan or way to make a career out of them.

I’ve thought for a while about what to do and I’m most likely going to join the Air Force. I plan on doing it for the required 4 years and seeing how I feel after. I will try and get a job in the Air Force that has a high civilian marketability so I’m not stuck for 20 years in the military. I am very afraid that this will change me as a person. I’m also afraid how this will affect my relationship. I’ve looked into how long it takes to be able to live off base and it seems there will be a year before my girlfriend would be able to move in. We’ve been together for almost 3 years now and we have a great relationship. I’ll miss my siblings. We all still live together, and I’m the oldest. We are all very close. I’ll definitely miss my family and friends, and I know that comes with the job. I’m wondering how this is going to affect me. I’ve never really spent more than a week or two away from home. I’ve also lived in the same neighborhood for 16 years now. 

However I want to meet new people. People different than me. I want to live in another state or possibly country and experience a different way of life. I feel like this could be very beneficial to me. I’m a very indecisive person so if anyone has any input on my current dilemma I’d appreciate any opinions. Thank you for reading this.

Am I making the right decision or a huge mistake?",26Apr2020,1
737,"Hello reddit!

So I’m currently living with a friend who I have known for a couple of years now and we get on great, let’s call her A. 
When I met A, she was battling with what looked like the preliminary stages of depression/anxiety, something I have experienced myself, so I felt a weird compulsion to help her as best I could in the way that I wished someone could’ve helped me. We had a lot of calm and open conversations about her experience with therapy/counselling (which turned out to be none), so I recommended her numbers and contacts for local counselling and CBT treatment based on my own experience. Then when she was too anxious to make the call or go to the doctors, I would walk with her or sit with her and basically be her hype man so that she had the courage to seek the help she needed. 
Cut to now, she’s continuing with both counselling bc and CBT, and tells me she’s doing much better and seems to be happier, obviously I’m thrilled. 
Don’t get me wrong, it makes me so unbelievably happy that she’s better and that I was able to aid that process, I feel like I’ve done right by my past self. I don’t do it for thanks or praise or the rest of it, but she’s never acknowledged that I’ve taken out a lot of my time to help her. There’s never been a thank you or appreciation and almost feels like she thinks that that’s just kinda what people should do, which of course it is, but as someone who didn’t have someone like that, i can’t help but feel a bit bitter. 
Now we’re in quarrantine together and it’s going pretty well, we don’t really fight and we have a great time together.... bc I’m the person who suggests we do stuff. 
Pretty much every activity we’ve been doing (that we have both enjoyed) have been my idea, like cooking together, doing exercise, having movie nights. So I decided a couple days ago I would stop asking her to do things, to see if I was just in my head, but sure enough, we haven’t spoken in days. 
I just want to know if I sound like I’m too involved in her life or if she’s not really as much my friend as I thought or if this can all be justified in a way I’m not seeing. 
Any take would be appreciated, and I hope everyone is staying safe &lt;3",26Apr2020,1
738,"hi everyone,
i’ve been super ill lately w the flu and have been having weird af fever dreams. they feel SO real. for instance, 2 nights ago i had a realistic dream that i was scrolling thru stories on snap and my friend posted pics of him taking a bunch of drugs. i remember waking up crying bc i thought it was real. i texted him and he said he’ll never do any drugs so it should give me peace of mind knowing that he’s okay. last night i had a dream that my brother went to his work (a restaurant) and came home w/ food for us around 3 AM??? (weird bc his work closes at 11 pm, but w/e i didn’t question it) i literally vividly remember seeing him get out of his friends car carrying a pizza box and a few bags of other foods. i literally remember eating a couple fries as well. when i saw him this morning, i told him thanks for the fries and he asked what the actual fuck i was talking abt. how do i deal w/ these fever dreams?! i literally cannot differentiate them w/ real life and it’s hard for me to sleep bc of it. i have weird dreams like this that feel real when i’m stoned, but i’ve been completely sober. i’m freaked out to go back to sleep. i hope i’m not making a huge deal abt this, but it really freaks me out that i can’t separate dreams from reality. advice?",26Apr2020,1

740,"So, I am a 15F whose parents are divorced and split last year. Funnily enough, my parents are neighbors. Although you’d think that meant they got along, they don’t. At all. It’s on both sides, and both have made small efforts,rejected by the other. There was some infidelity in the marriage, and my father now has a new spouse. (I have never and do not plan to meet anytime soon.) He goes out of town (he drives) to a state just north of us to visit her. He’s gone for two to three weeks, but now more three weeks with corona. 

So today my mom drove my brother over to my dads house to get some things he needed, as well as ice since our fridge is broken. They come back and have everything in his kitchen. Literally almost everything. In comparison to your kitchen, it’s probably not much, but his house is being renovated currently so it’s pretty much just a ton of snacks and some frozen pizzas, chicken, etc., as well as drinks, soups, and things like that. Then I see a mask in my moms hand, and I ask where she got that and she said my brother found it in the garage and said she could use it. Now maybe normally I wouldn’t be as mad, but my mom recently banned me from going to my dads house while he’s not there alone, even for two minutes to grab a toothbrush. While doing so, she told me: “(dads) house is NOT my house, this (her house) is your house.” Which turned into a nasty argument. Plus, my mom is always complaining about money, but she buys everything for me on the joint card. My dad does not use the joint card, I think he’s maybe used it twice. 

A more minor example is the other day, I was at my dads and my mom came over and called him and told him to send me downstairs so I went down and she gave me a paper, then told me to get my dad. I asked why and she wouldn’t tell me, then I got him, he came downstairs and she asked him a bunch of questions about what to do with her frozen food, since her fridge is broken. My dad was a little annoyed, because he was in the middle of cooking and these were basic questions she could’ve googled, like what temperature is unsafe for certain ingredients. This was a pretty minor event, but still.

Anyway, it makes me so so frustrated because she is constantly talking shit to me about my dad (which she knows i hate), but then she and my brother (who also doesn’t really like my dad) just takes things he buys. I’m not sure if I’m in the wrong here, because this could totally just be some newly divorced child issues, but I’m not sure.

I used to see a therapist, but this was the same therapist who was my parents couples counselor, and my moms therapist before that, so he’s very biased. My mom is against me seeing another but my dad says it’s fine. 

I just don’t know how to deal with this. Any advice is appreciated.",26Apr2020,1
742,I was recently diagnosed with narcolepsy. Almost every night I have crazy vivid dreams that I can almost always remember. I was thinking about starting a blog or an instagram page and sharing my dreams. But I don’t know if that’s a stupid idea.,26Apr2020,1
743,"My dad had an insanely short temper. If I say something small, or if I do something that he doesn’t like, he goes off and starts breaking shit, sometimes pushing me, and yelling “you always do shit like this! You think your better then me? As if I’m nothing?” An example of this would be one day when he came into my room. My friends were sending cursed pictures of twitch streamers, and one had a beard. My dad, understandably, asked “who is that? Is that someone your playing with??” And I laughed, because I thought it was cute that my dad was worried. “Dad, its just a twitch streamer ahah! Do you know what a twitch streamer is?” I was trying to be friendly and strike up a conversation about this, but I guess he took it as a insult. So then he got pissed, started breaking shit, yelling, tried to hit me etc etc. Other times its because I act annoyed with things my parents say, and while I do admit I should not get annoyed, a slightest bit of irritation in my voice will lead to my father losing it. Its driving me nuts, and making me super depressed. How do I stop this from happening?",26Apr2020,1
744,"I met this friend during september last year and we hit off pretty well. She always asks me questions about homework and I always answer her back. But its like happening everyday and as someone who doesnt like to be contacted everyday during school days usually, its hard. I just want to be alone and be absorbed in my own hobbies. But then she's my friend so I've always answered her questions with detail. Its quaratine now so we have online classes and the questions happen more often I think. Im getting really irritated and angry at her keep asking different questions on many homeworks we have to the point where I would finish what Im doing first then reply back to her. Before I always stopped what I was doing then reply, but a few days back I got too annoyed so I ignored her text for a bit then when I finished what I was doing, I replied back. 

Its not that she's faking it, because I know that she probably doesnt get the material because she's not fluent in english. But I also dont want her to rely on me each time she doesnt understand something. I told her many times to be independent and figure things out yourself with google and stuff like that. (This is because we might not be in the same class next year.) But I guess it didnt have a huge effect because after I told her many times to be more independent and to not rely on me so much she still asked for my help to this day. Should I have the right to be irritated by her or am I being like a bit mean? Because when its really on my nerve I would say to her figure it out yourself, then feel guilty, then answer her question. That happened quite a few times and Im afraid she might get upset or feel insecure or something.",26Apr2020,1
745,"Yeah that’s it really, I woke up suddenly last night and felt I couldn’t breathe properly and a massive urge to sit up, which I did, and gasped for air for a bit until I felt like I was getting oxygen in, lay back down and still felt a little short of breath but fine enough and went back to sleep. Feel perfectly normal today. I had some decent levels of anxiety the evening prior if that is somehow linked. (I don’t have anxiety nor have I been anxious like that for a long time.)

748,"This guy Ive been friendly with, on multiple occasions, has alluded to his attraction to little girls. I could potentially get him to open up more on the subject, but that would mean I would need to maintain his level of trust in me by acting like I'm okay with whatever he is telling me, which would be extremely difficult. 

I'm not sure if this is something I can/should go to the cops with or what. He works with children as a sub elementary school teacher. (He previously went to seminary school to be a priest, but was rejected for some reason), and he gives me the creeps. He has said creepy things. We dated briefly, and I'm not really sure why I keep in contact with him. At one point I decided I would stay friendly to just keep an eye on him but haven't had the stomach to really dig on the topic. Its a weird situation. Is there anything I could/should do here? Admitting that he has that attraction isnt a crime, but something isn't right here. To work for schools, I know they do background checks, but I recall a time when he sent me a photo of a young girl he was babysitting who was about 3... And he really should not be alone with children. I dont know what to do about this from a legal standpoint. I dont want to ruin his life if he isnt an abuser, but the idea of him being around children doesnt seem safe to me.",26Apr2020,1
749,"So lately I've been dealing with these urges to constantly bring up my past to my boyfriend ... doesn't sound too harmful until you realize I'm confessing everything to him. Well everything was fine afterwards, I felt mentally better until the other day when I was researching ""intrusive thoughts"" and how to get rid of them. 
It was like I flipped a switch ... a horrible, demonic switch in my head. I was taking a walk thinking about all of the articles I read about those thoughts and was like ""well at least mine aren't sexual/perverse or violent."" And boom. It started with unwanted phrases dealing with sexual things, then everything I've seen on movies/heard about involving sexual violence. It was really disturbing so I kept trying to put it out of my head.. then I started feeling better until my brain started to put thoughts of all of the horrific things I could do in terms of inappropriate conduct, violence, sex, I mean any awful thing you can think of.. I've thought about it. 
So my question is: how on earth do I get these thoughts out of my head before I go mentally insane? I've thought about just ending it all because I must be a pervert or pedophile or serial killer the way that I'm thinking about things. It's like a mental game almost.. every time I think ""wow it's getting better,"" another thought pops in my head.. each one worse than the other until today.

754,"im just gonna be 100% honest here. i've tried writing this maybe 12+ times before at various points in my life but always end up deleting it because i think it's too long and doesn't accurately depict everything that's happened.

i'm 20, male. doing a course i don't want to do (maths) at a university i don't even want to be at (not that i wanted to be at university anyway) and this is my second time. the pressure is insane.

rewind back to me as a kid in primary school: i grew up an extremely shy and sensitive kid who loved to sing his hard out when no one was home, dance by learning off of youtube, act (even tho i tried to deny it due a topically masculine standard), draw - basically i was a suppressed artsy kid. supressed because, aside from being unbelievably shy, i come from a traditional family which doesn't accept such things and doesn't understand the notion of 'passion' or 'purpose'. instead, i was pushed to excel in academia. dad left during secondary school and my 2 brothers and my mother have been broke ever since. 

i was lucky in that i was naturally gifted (or something?) in sports, so as a youth who's true passions were suppressed, i started to excel in sports. meanwhile, the pressure to excel in academia also worked and i topped my school in terms of secondary education grades. i fell off my sports by 14 when i got a back injury and 15 when i dedicated all my waking hours for this bullshit notion that academics was 'my thing'. the whole time i felt unhappy, nothing felt right. the first time i felt truly depressed was when i was 7, i don't know why. but the first time i considered suicide was at 12 in year 8. 

anyway, i excelled, blah blah blah, got into college (a school for junior and senior years of high school for the americans here) did ok the first year but my depression destroyed me, and i went from interviewing for a place at the university cambridge in my 2nd year to almost being kicked out of college (so happy i didnt get into cambridge), to then somehow finding the strength to push a bit more and finished college having good grades. i decided i didn't want to go to university and to finally pursue my passion of music. i spent the whole summer (later june to september 2018) trying to secure a job with no success. that summer was fucking dreadful, i literally just spent my days indoors because i was broke and my mental health suffered because of it.

that september i went to university. once again, at the demands of my mother, but also because we didn't have the funds for me to stay at home anymore. university became more of a means to survive and a stable roof over my head than an education. also, my home environment became EXTREMELY toxic over the years after my dad left - we're barely a family anymore. i survived a month at university studying computer science (i couldn't give less of a shit about it) before i forced my way home pretty much, but i got some heavy debt after i was suckered into forex trading and lost my entire £1500 student overdraft as well as £2300 of my £2900 student loan just trying to become financially independent and the rest on contributing to the bills at my house. dumb, i know. i spent november 2018 - march 2019 job-searching again as well as trying to pay off my loan at £5/month for dropping out early, and my total debt at this point was a £1500 overdraft + £2900 loan + interest = £4400 + interest. again, because i had no funds, i couldn't leave my house to do shit during this time, so while tension and toxicity built to extreme highs in my house, my mental health deteriorated more. 

i secured a job at a call centre for 2 weeks in march before being laid off. i managed to earn £550 (£140 went to bills n whatnot) but in another desperate bid to become financially independent so i can move out and pursue my dreams of music, i invested that into currencies and lost it all. i spent april jobless and job-searching, and landed a second call-centre job march to mid-july 2019. i earned £1600 over that entire period, but was paid weekly, and each week i would try to invest that money into currencies and lose it. i look back and think it was stupid from me, but when you're desperate you do dumb shit. but that was next-level stupid. didn't enjoy a single £ of my hard earned money, but that was my choice.

all the while, my friends were doing very well for them selves. 1 took a gap year to work as a web-developer before going to university, another worked web-dev before moving to canada recently. i spent the rest of summer (mid-july to end of september 2019) crippled with depression and anxiety about how my life turned out the way it did and regretting choices i made from the age of 7/8, with only temporary relief here and there.

late september i move to my second university to study computer science again. shit happens, i end up forced to study maths. not that i truly give a shit tbh, it's not like any of those things matter to me. my 1st semester was hell because i just couldn't do it, i was somewhere i wasn't supposed to be, doing something i wasn't supposed to do with heavy pressure from the higher ups because i was absent 99% of the time and not submitting assignments. college and university maths showed me that i was never gifted in academia, secondary school was just easy enough for me to do well.

2nd semester, i haven't attended a single lecture, i have a 5 month long group project due in 3 weeks that i haven't done, i'm screwed for my mid-terms starting tomorrow (online), i'm stressed as fuck and i literally don't know what i've got left in me. i don't want it to seem like i haven't tried at all this whole time, i have TRIED AND TRIED AND TRIED AND TRIED ***believe me*** \- i don't think i know anyone with more will power than i have, but we all have our limits. i have a bunch of money now, 20% of which is mine, 20% of which is a grant and 60% of which is a loan. i'm almost certainly going to fail this year and my loan will have to be repaid immediately.

this is all doing so much damage to me mentally (and physically, subsequently) and i feel like i'm losing my spark. over time, suicide went from a daily consideration to something i'd think about 5+ times a day. i even left to go on a walk once and ended up at a train station waiting for a train that wasn't scheduled to stop at the station so i could jump - i couldn't tell if i would have done it had that train arrived that day. one of the shittest parts of all of this is being 20.5 years old and feeling 15 because i genuinely spent the last 5 years dead and the 8 years before that barely living to my full extent. i don't feel that i've lived those years and that is one of the worst feelings, along with all the regret, stress n depression i feel. something else that's shitty, is knowing the way people (mother, brothers, family, friends) see me now after ***literally*** 'peaking in high school' academically, physically and socially. i used to feel at least a little bit alpha, now (and for the last 3 years) i'm just filled with self-doubt and hate myself.

i literally grew up believing i had the potential for greatness, that i would change the world in someway as long as i worked tirelessly and here i am. there's days i feel like i'm just trying to pass the time until my inevitable death as deep as that sounds - i'm just trying to be straight to the point, sorry if this was a weird read.

757,"My parents, now that I'm older, always say that I have to work for stuff I want. Ok, that's reasonable. My friend's birthday is coming up and I decided to get her a few things for a gift, amounting to $40. I never get any money whatsoever throughout the year besides a couple holidays. So that means I get about 20-40 bucks a year. Not enough to serve my needs through a whole year, but whatever.

So this past month, I did more chores and asked my parents to pay me. They said yes, but this would be the only time they do it. I also traded in gift cards too. So I bought the items online and they came. But now that they're here, my dad says that I shouldn't be giving a $40 gift to a kid. *Then why the hell didn't you tell me that before you let me by it?* I asked. He said he had been thinking about it. That kind of pissed me off. I personally don't think there's any problem whatsoever with spending $40 on a gift. What makes me more upset is the fact that he's saying I should let my sister give one of the things I bought. SHE NEVER EVEN TALKS TO MY FRIEND! That, and she didn't pay for the gifts. I did. So why should I let her give it?

I know this is seems doltish of me or completely stupid in general considering what's going on, but this is someone I really care about, and I never get freedom like this. I'm just aggravated by my dad's inconsistencies. Can anyone tell me how I can, at the very least, convince my father to let me gift this thing?",26Apr2020,1
758,So my cousin responded to my private message and was completely defensive and basically was making excuses for her father having an affair with her stepmother who later became her stepmother.

I have unfriended her as I don’t need her stupid ass on my Facebook nor do I want her in my life.,26Apr2020,1

760,"Throwaway since I really don’t want this on my main account

Let me preface this by saying I don’t want to end up on r/humblebrag, please refrain from saying things like “oh you’re so nice” etc etc in the comments, I really just want the hard bitter truth and reality, I just want discussion strictly on how my behavior should be. For reference, I’m 17M


I think I give away too much. I always feel stupid afterwards because it seems I threw away extra money for absolutely no reason. I don’t know why but I even actively manipulate my friends into taking more from me than they would by taking steps to make sure they don’t think I’m giving away as much of what I have as I do. If a friend mentions they’re saving up their allowance to buy x game, I sometimes just buy it for them. Sometimes it’s justified, as one of my older friends had their dog poisoned about a month ago and therefore had to spend a lot of money for treatment, and they couldn’t afford the new animal crossing game they were meaning to buy so I got it for them instead. Sometimes they just simply have a bad day so I treat them to something like a meal out or even a present. I feel like this is all pretty normal to do.


But sometimes it gets mote ridiculous, like I’ll gift them a game on steam just because I want to play it with them, or I’ll try to low key cover most of a restaurant bill without them knowing, or that time I gifted 90% of the money I got from older family during a holiday and just gave it to my best friend because he broke his tv. I even ship shit to long-distance friends, like I shipped plushies to one of my friends because they frequently complained about having trouble sleeping, so I sent them something to sleep with. Extremely dumb shit in hindsight, I say to myself every time I do it, but then I do it again and again.


And this shit doesn’t just apply to real life, it applies to games too. I mentioned animal crossing earlier, and I play it as well. I waste a ton of my currency in that game while trading with other people just to “tip” them, especially if they’re newer players. Gave someone 5x the agreed price just because when I visited them I noticed they were new and had an underdeveloped island. I frequently give players extra big tips on a trade just because they say “I’m saving up for X!” so I’m like “Oh in that case have some extra to help you reach that goal!”...EVERYONE HAS A GOAL IN THIS GAME THAT’S THE POINT. I start kicking myself later when I go broke because I spent all my money 150% faster than if I just paid the normal price and stopped being a charity. 


Sometimes I don’t even need something anymore and buy it anyway just so the other person doesn’t get sad! For example if I asked someone for an item and they don’t respond, so I go to someone else and get that item. 3 hours later the first person responds saying “Yes! I do have the item, do you still want it?” I say yes and buy it again even though I already have it.


And if the real life situations seemed underwhelming price wise, I’ll restate I’m just 17 with an allowance. 40-60% of my money goes straight to my friends, and I don’t know why I do this shit. I’m about to be an adult and I’m still an idiot wasting away my money. I am absolutely incapable of haggling, or questioning the pricing of something. I see online many places being scammers especially real estate, contract work, or just 90% of services I’ll need when I’. an adult I’ll just get completely fucked because I can’t see through stuff like that.


What should I do about this?",26Apr2020,1

762,"We live in Louisiana, and there’s a [stay home order until April 30](https://gov.louisiana.gov/assets/Proclamations/2020/JBE-33-2020.pdf). Even after that I want to stay home a bit since literally nobody around me is obeying besides people in my age range :( my dad went golfing with his friends yesterday, my mom continues to host friends over for brunch, my brother goes out and parties with his friends and girlfriend (all of whom work in the food industry and thus are essential and continue to work). 

I have done the whole “haha maybeee” thing, and sent the link to the stay at home order. I’ve even sent screenshots of the order with red circles around the important parts. They always say “you don’t understand it, we’re older and more mature and thus really understand the order” but have no further insight into what they’re “understanding” better. 

They’re pretty clingy and controlling. They’ve been badgering us about watching their DAILY live vlog on Facebook (I don’t even have Facebook...) and I just say “ah no got busy sorry” when they ask. I’m a student and we have a 3 year old, it’s not a lie. They’re also insisting everyone come to a Sunday evening “family meeting” every week on zoom. Which is annoying because usually I’d just ignore it but they spam our phones with “WHERE ARE YOU?? MEETING STARTED!! PASSWORD 1234” over and over until we join, and if we DONT they get pissy and take it out on my siblings who are forced to stay around them (sister is underage and brother doesn’t have enough money saved up to leave yet). 

They “dropped by” to give my son a snack yesterday and were extremely pushy about us coming to their pool. I kept having to pull my son back from the door because they inched closer and closer (we don’t allow anyone past 6 feet from the door) and reached out their arms for hugs. It was very uncomfortable. Usually they’re somewhat bearable but this whole virus is making them impossible. 

Anytime I say “I don’t wanna catch it” or similar things, it’s always “we don’t have it! You can stay 6 feet away from us in our backyard too!!” or “you don’t understand what the governor is *really* saying.” 

I have ocd and general anxiety, and this pushiness is making me more and more anxious with passing time. They keep dropping by (we’re gonna pretend we don’t hear them knocking from now on) and the stress is making me withdrawal from them. I screen every call from my family, even my siblings now since they’re being used to guilt us. They say “mom says to ask if you’ll come over” type things. And my sister keeps having friends over because my mom keeps planning sleep overs and stuff, and my brothers VERY high-risk girlfriend (works in the major grocery store of our city and doesn’t follow protocol like wearing masks and gloves). 

I literally don’t know how to word “Stop asking us to come over” in a way that won’t sound too aggressive. The whole family reads into every little thing so unless it’s worded very nicely it is a whole family issue. :(",26Apr2020,1
763,"I've had this problem my entire life. I know it is bad for me, but I cannot seem to stop doing it.

The large problem is that I compare myself to more successful people, such as my younger brother, leading me to always feel inferior or lacking as a person for not having accomplished much in life.

Lately, however, I've found that I compare myself to people in different ways. For whatever reason I feel that I somehow can relate to people with severe mental disabilities or psychological problems. My cousin, for example, has a lot of trouble with basic English and arithmetic and can only find employment at a local Walmart doing manual labor. Even people like infamous internet personality Chris-chan, who suffers from autism; I find myself relating to in some strange way, thinking that my current life is just so close to being like their lives when any rational person would see that it isn't.

So how do I stop this? I know that it's harmful but I can't seem to stop that line of thinking",26Apr2020,1

767,"Me and my parents don't necessarily have the best relationship. I feel useless and pathetic, since i have done nothing to make them proud yet, they don't say it to my face but i just know that i am a great disappointment, if you get what i mean. At times they are fine and pretty normal parents . But at times..they can be...Harsh and i'm having trouble figuring out my feelings and if I'm being a bratty teenager

One time,I vividly remember when i was about 10, my mum was helping me with homework. I struggled to spell certain words. I made this error many times and I ended up being locked in my room in the dark and i was beaten, in hopes that i would learn my lesson- i cried the whole night. The next day, my mum apologised for what had happened, i had forgiven her but i still feel hurt to this day.

Through out the years my relationship with them has gotten worse, and through out those years i lost myself, as cheese as it is. I became a rebellious child too since i felt like nothing i did was good enough for them. I don't want to, but like i feel i have no choice.

Another time I had lied to my parents, me and my friends had planned to surprise my other friend for her birthday to see a movie she really wanted to watch. But my parents they would have never let me go unless an adult was accompanying me. So for the sake of my friends i lied to my  dad saying my friends older sister (who's 21) was coming. (in my defence she was coming but then she wasn't so... it wasn't a complete lie). So they let me go.  But they asked  to meet them, and i knew i was doomed. My dad found out and completely embarrassed me in front of my friends parents, who were dropping them off. He shouted at  them telling them that kids our age (we were 13 BTW) shouldn't go out alone and they're parenting was bad. I was so so embarrassed and after my dad dragged me to the car park i literally begged him to let me go, because i really still wanted to surprise my friend and do something special for her. Somehow my dad agreed but when we got home that night, i was beaten and didn't talk to me for next few days and i felt guilty for it and i was sorry because i had also embarrassed him too.

(Idk i feel like i made this too dramatic, i want to believe that they are good parents)

Anyways what my problem is though, is that they give me mixed feeling. They do all these hurtful things but still show me love and stuff. I keep blaming it on hormones and ""the teenage phase"", since i feel like i am being too sensitive. It is my fault and i deserve it... and in the end they are just looking out for me...

769,"Due to current events (social distancing) a married couple friends of mine with a 3 (almost 4 y/o) have me babysitting for them a few times a week while they work from home.  I'm paid well, I love them, I love the kid, but I don't think I can sit for them anymore.  People think I'm great with kids and that I'd make a great kindergarten teacher.... And while that may be true ( most days) it's not how I feel, particularly at this point because I do not have insurance and have run out of my antianxiety and depression medication.

This is compounded by the child mentioned above being extremely strong willed and the parents ( from my point of view) being extremely lax in disciplining.  I basically feel like the child has no idea that I am an authority figure when I'm there but just someone there to play with them. (I don't mind playing all day, but the whining and screaming that occurs when I ""don't play right"" or do exactly as they want makes me not want to be around them at all.) To make things worse, lunch time is extremely difficult because they want to help but there's only so much they can do without getting hurt/destroying the kitchen and when I explain this or they don't get what they asked for it's meltdown mode.  The problem is that my hands are tied because if I try to discipline, they run to the parents who talk to them coddling-ly or barter with them (essentially give them what they want with minimal ""payment"" ie... One bite of nutrious food for a whole dessert type of situation).  And I feel like I'm drowning, I adhere to the rules that the parents set for the child, but they don't.  I would never lay a hand on the kid but I do have the urge to in the moment. I feel like if it were my child things would be different, I know everyone says that but I have to believe it right now.

So my question is, how do I tell my friends that I can't sit for them anymore ( except for emergencies)?",26Apr2020,1

I was like a big sister to her, but she was very mature when she was around me and it felt natural. Her family was like my family, so when i had a falling out with her mom ( I am 13 btw ), I didn't know where my friend stood. She didn't text me when i texted her once saying sorry for something stupid that my brother did, and i made it really friendly. You know, laughing emojis and the like. She didn't respond. That hurt me, because i thought that she was cool with me. Yesterday, i was outside with my brother and dad and she was outside too. She kept looking at me, and i dont know if she wanted to wave to me, or if she was waiting for me to wave, but it was really confusing because she was really like staring at me.

779,"I am a 19M college student. As my shitty freshman year comes to a close with even shittier online classes, I feel backed in to a corner. Almost everyone I know knows exactly what they want to do in life for a job, they’re starting to take major classes and move on in to doing something they enjoy. I feel stuck and I hate myself for it. 

I’d like to explain something, this is the way I view things and it may be flawed, and causing me the problems I feel now but this is what I’ve come to cling to based on experience. There are two types of people in the world: those who are more inclined to math, and those who are more inclined to language. I fall on the language side 100% and I hate it so much. 

I’m a great talker, I never struggle in history, english, or any rhetoric based /// written information type classes. When it comes to math, and most sciences, I just can’t do it. Believe me when I say it’s not for a lack of trying. I’m sitting here typing this with my last econ quiz tomorrow, and I’ve put in at minimum 35 hours over the last week and a half studying. I understand the theory behind everything, but I can’t for the life of me do anything with graphs and calculations (outside of very simple ones).

The thing is though, this is what I’ve dealt with my entire life. I’ve always been advanced in reading and writing. But I’ve always been behind when it comes to math. I’ve been made fun of for being stupid, I’ve been made to feel like garbage from math teachers who have scolded me for not trying when I do to the point where I feel hopeless. I try so hard but no matter what it just never clicks for me. 

On the other hand, I have friends come to me when they need help writing essays, or when they need help with any subject in that field. For whatever reason, I can just tell when something isn’t grammatically correct in peer written essays, even if I can’t specify the exact mess up (I’m not checking this for grammar so if I fuck up just ignore it). I hate to say it, but it’s just easy for me, and it just clicks.

This is my problem. I feel like the entire world caters to the people who are more math oriented. It’s easier to get jobs because it’s easier to take more difficult math based classes. Meanwhile I’m over here listening to people shit on english degrees.

My parents tell me to “take classes in subjects that are harder for me because it will challenge me” and I agree to some extent, but it’s so unfair to see my friends and peers who are naturally inclined to that stuff just blow through it, and be fine because they can rest assured they can do most any major they want, and can get a good job at the end of the day. My friends never have to “take classes in subjects that challenge them” because they’d be taking English classes that have no affect on any lucrative job that they could already get with their math skills.

I’m so sick of it. I’m sick of being forced to take classes that are 1000x harder for me than my peers, put 1000x more effort in to them to the point where I miss out on anything pertaining to a social life, and then still do terribly. 

I don’t even know what kind of question I should be asking. I’m just tired of having other people not understand why I can’t understand. Any advice for coping with this would be greatly appreciated.",26Apr2020,1

781,"I live in a 2 bedroom apartment with my bf and his stepbro(we'll call him Bob), their parents allowed them to take it over after they moved out. About 8 months ago, my bf's dad asked us if it would be okay if my bf's biological sister(we'll call her Mary) could stay on our couch for a few til she could save money for her own place. The answer was a resounding no, at least in the back of our minds. But alas, she was allowed to move in. 

Fast forward to now, the Quarantine. Bob and Mary do not wash their hands, not even after using the bathroom. Bob doesn't even shower at all really, or do laundry or brush his teeth. Everyone except for me smokes cigarettes as I am 7 months pregnant :), so they're constantly going in and out of the same door all day, touching the same handle, again no one washes their hands, putting cigarettes into their mouths. I'm always complaining to my bf about how them being so reckless is a hazard for us, especially me. I and my bf for a majority of the lock down have been laid off of work, so we've really been staying home unless going to the an OB appointment, or grocery store. Bob and Mary have both been working this whole time going out potentially being exposed to the virus. Mary has even gone to a coworkers house and spent multiple days their being around at least 2 adults and 2 kids that I know live there. 

Rewind to a month before the virus hit a head in the US, Mary meets this random guy at work, they start talking or whatever. Not knowing this guy long at all, she asks if he can stay here too?!?! Again no, I don't know how he slipped through the cracks but he did stay her for only a few days til the cops picked him up and arrested him. He was in jail from then til 3 days ago. Before he got out she made a comment about him staying here again and this time she was told clear as day that he was not allowed to stay here. We don't know this guy, how can we trust him, and the parents still have valuables here as well. 

The first night he was out he stayed here with her, fine. The next morning my bf(who returned to work a few days ago), Bob, and Mary all went to work, her fake bf wasn't here, cool. Don't you know a couple hours later I'm woken up from my nap by knocks on the door, I knew it had to be him. I felt so compromised I let him in, there would of been drama if I didn't. So now I'm home alone with a guy I don't know. He went out last night to god knows who's house, was drinking and hanging out whatever. He's been under a hole apparently cause thats not the way a quarantine works. Also I'm very paranoid about the doors being locked, am I supposed to go out of my way to worry about him being able to get in?

Now last night Mary apparently was throwing up and had to call off work.......Need I say more? This is too much stress for me, I don't know what to do. I feel like no one has my back or the balls to do anything about it. This environment is so unhealthy for me and my baby. I feel like I have to wear a mask and gloves when I leave my room.

I've noticed how video games have slowly played a larger and larger role in my life over the course of the last 10 years, to a now unnaceptable degree. It's messing with my social life, my exercise and my uni life. 

I'm not even talking about social games, but replaying single player games from when i was 12-15, when I still got any form of satisfaction from gaming.

So i deleted all of it. A semi-impulsive decision, but a necessary one, I believe. I'm going cold turkey.

My question is, where do I go from here? Video games have pushed out most of my other hobbies. I've begun reading more, than I did before, watching some old classic movies, and doing a bit of jogging, but I fear I will relapse sooner than later, especially since I can barely leave my apartment due to quarantine.

And even if I hadn't crippled the size of my social circle, by shutting myself in for years, I still can't meet up with more than a few, due to quarantine.

So what do i do? Where do i go from here? Has anyone fought addiction like this before?

I know I can do better, and I know that I want to be better, because I was once better than this. So what do i do to beat addiction?",26Apr2020,1
785,"For as long as I can remember, I've fantasised about being small. I'm talking around an inch in height. Colloquially, it's called a 'giantess' fetish and has always been a great source of shame for me. I have never told anyone about it.

Obviously, this fantasy is unattainable, and imagined scenarios are the closest one can come to achieving it.

Unfortunately, the fetish has led to a twisted perception of what a compatible partner would be; i.e: at least 10 times taller than myself. Like I said, this is either something I was born with or developed very early on in life, and not something picked up through porn consumption, which makes me doubt it being 'curable'.

This leads me to my point: I've never really felt comfortable in romantic situations. I've never had a crush, let alone been in love. I've often felt uncomfortable- even guilty- on dates, as I've never seen my desires as compatible with those of the girl I'm with, and so wasting their time as well as my own.

Even when in sexual situations, I've always felt clueless, not driven by any particular instinct, and instead mechanically going along with what I think is meant to be an intimate experience driven by passion.

This has of course led to feelings of borderline eunuchoid romantic and sexual inadequacy. While I've attempted no-fap (and am currently), I've found only adverse effects in the past. My thoughts become increasingly intrusive as each day goes by, which in turn makes me feel increasingly guilty and detached from reality for having them.

Ultimately, my main sentiment tends to be that I simply am not made for love and romance, through misfortune of hard-wired psychological circumstance. When I was younger, I tried to get rid of it through various, sometimes dangerous, means, and was often suicidal.

I've now come to accept it as part of me. Contrary to what you might think having read the post, I live a very happy, social, productive, and fulfilling life in all areas other than the aforementioned (romance and sex).

I still want to believe that I can belong, but I don't know how. Maybe I just really haven't met the right person, but I doubt it. I think the problem lies at a deeper level of my mentality and attitude towards relationships; I just don't know what I need to do to fix it.

Any and all responses will be greatly appreciated.",26Apr2020,1
786,"My family is abusive and psychotic. I could go into each one  but id be here for hours, so I'll try to focus on one event. I have not seen any of them since something that happened on my birthday last june. However, every day is a new problem. Just this week they told everyone i know that they think im pregnant, so i got calls from relatives i havent seen in a while thinking im pregnant and it was humiliating. They tell me that they need my help, whether it be money or a ride home at midnight or a place to stay. They guilt trip me constantly about not seeing them, making up all these reasons why. Today, i got sick of it and called my boyfriend to talk and cry. My dad had sent me a screenshot of a conversation with ny mother in which she told him that i told her that i wasnt talking to him because i think hes a ""sick fuck"" and that i never want to talk to him again. He went on about how it must be true and how ive hurt him. This upset me so much because 1. It simply isnt true and 2. I already. Feel guilty/selfish enough for trying to protect myself. When i called my boyfriend he said that he was going to call them and tell them to never bother me again. I begged him not to, he doesnt understand that they are actually crazy, theres things i havent told him, and that you cant rationalize with them. He said he wouldnt call them, but that someday its going to happen and theres nothing i can do about it. He says he just wants to protect me, but i do not want him associated with my family in any way, it will only hurt me if he does that. I dont know what to do now. I dont wsnt him talking to them, but i feel like in order to make sure that doesnt happen i cant talk to him.about them anymore which means i need to deal with all of this alone. We had a huge argument about it and i got off the phone sobbing exhausted. I want them to love me so i stick around hoping theyll change, itd be too difficult for me to drop them, im not ready. But hes ready, hes tired of hearing about them.i feel like i need to choose. I dont know what to do and i  need help. I dont have any friends that i can talk to about this, please help.me. i dont need your sympathy i tried to explain in a way that was short and didnt seem like a pity party but im so mentally exhausted right now i might not be making sense.

787,"Hello,

I hope I am posting this in the correct sub -- but please direct me if I should post this elsewhere.

I saw that an OLD email and password combo (which I have used in the past on a few different websites — but like more than a decade ago), recently came up in a data breach on a “dating combo list” somewhere on the darkweb apparently. The password is one that I used on at least two websites (and neither one was a dating website — but admittedly, one was for a porn website). Again these passwords were from more than a decade ago.

I have read about cyber blackmail and am concerned because I have never used a dating website, but here my info is apparently on a data breach that was for dating websites.

I have searched my info online (using “forgot password” links) and typed in my e-mail, and none have come up yet as far as showing that I have a dating profile.

What possibilities are there for my email and password combo being on that data breach? Is it possible a non dating website username/password somehow got mixed up in it? Could someone have used my exact email and password to sign up for one? Really scratching my head over this and don’t want any trouble isn’t he future.

Thanks in advance!",26Apr2020,1
788,"A few days ago in my apartment complex in Houston, TX , I walked outside of my apartment to find my neighbors car, my truck  and wooden storage closet/garage roof pretty much completely obliterated. Somebody had driven at a high speed and collided with my neighbor, my garage and my truck (in that order) and proceeded to leave and *drive through a fence* nearby to a side street  (I’m not making this up) and got into another crash where I think two other vehicle were involved. And guess what. He abandoned his vehicle. That’s right. Somebody saw this POS crash his car onto the side of the road, stumble out, and walk off. 

In this person’s smashed up vehicle, *clearly dangling from his broken tail window* was his work badge, and later something addressed to his apartment was discovered (the names matched up on his badge and the address). 

Apparently this person does not have insurance, but had recently purchased or was using a vehicle that still had paper license plates. So it was a *new* used car.

What are my options?

Keep in mind that my truck is a 25 year old classic Ford in great condition with a lift kit. The right side except my front end is smashed in. The tailgate (which I had replaced about a year ago) is now damaged and will need replacement. All in all, with my vehicle included, this person caused possible tens of thousands of dollars of worth a damage in under a minute. And he fled the scene.

Does anyone have any advice that can give me a silver lining? I don’t believe I have personal damage insurance.

790,"Here is a little bit of some backstory it’s lengthy so just bare with me. 

I am the result of a pregnancy trap. When my mom and dad first met they became friends and then overtime friends with benefits. During that time my mom was falling in love with my dad. My dad didn’t reciprocate those feelings and only saw her as a friend. My mom was desperate for him to like her back. He kept saying he was going to leave her and every time she would do something insane like, lock herself in the bathroom and threaten him that she was going to kill herself. My dad kept staying with her but he never really liked her like that and was just their to fool around. Well after him wanting to leave for good she pregnancy trapped him. (The reason I know all of this is because my dads best friend, who is now my uncle, lives with us and my dad told him to which he told me) My dad still didn’t like her and definitely didn’t love her but he wanted to be their to raise me so he stayed. Her plan ended up backfiring and when I was born my dad instantly fell in love with me before her. My mom was furious and they fought A LOT! Also my dad is African American and my mom is Caucasian so when she got pregnant with me her whole family disowned her. So she has always had this hatred towards me because of that too. So fast forward I am now 17 years old and me and my mom have never had a relationship. She has only been their to discipline me or make rules. That’s it’s really.
She has tried to “be there for me” or “comfort me” sometimes but her efforts are “suck it up” or “I have been through much worse then you have!” 

So I want to get some things off my chest about my mother because people see her “good Christian woman” side of her and think she is a great person. I feel so alone because of her and no one really ever sees what she does so I’m just gonna say it.

First off (this is short and petty but) she is an ultimate Karen. One day she got Mexican takeout from one of favorite restaurants and she always gets the salsa and chips. Well the salsa didn’t taste exactly how she is used to and called them and demanded them to make her a new salsa. She was at the grocery store and saw that self service wasn’t open and was furious cause she had to wait in line like everyone else and left the line to go find the manager because she didn’t want to wait! If the food is not exactly how she is used to or she doesn’t like it she always asks for the manager. Oh can’t make this up but she loves her essential oils and is anti-vaccine! (Thankfully after I got all of mine) 

Secondly she is manipulative and terrible with money. I got my first job over a year ago and was so excited about it and when I first started I worked every single day over the summer and even got promoted. So because it was my first job I didn’t have my own bank account and shared it with my parents I saved up my money and got over $500 I was ecstatic and I worked really hard for that money. Well when I asked for it to be transferred to my now own bank account she spent it all on herself. I was devastated but wasn’t surprised. From ages 12-14 I saved up all of my birthday money and hid it in a jar in my room. I had a good amount of money saved in their from all of my family members and it’s was around $345. One day I went to go check my jar to get some money and all of it was gone. I immediately went to my mom and she said “oh yeah I needed to “borrow” it. I will pay you back though.” She never did. She always asks for money and tells me all the time to give my younger brother some (who she adores) anytime he asks. I am now homeschooled but went to a Christian private school for about 4 years. Well I hated it. I was bullied a lot and sexually harassed most of the time. I would get in the car crying and she would just yell at me and tell me to suck it up because she is paying a lot of money for me to go their. We would fight every day and she would get so mad at me about my grades when I have always struggled with school work because I have learning disability’s. 

Third she just hates me. My younger brother was born with health conditions so she had to be with him and take care of him all the time. Right after he was born my parents got married and my dad found Christ so they were all happy and in love. She favors him so much and baby’s him all the time. She always compares me to him and gets him the most expensive things and lets him do a lot. My brother was caught looking at pornography and to punish him for it she bought him a laptop. He gets things on my birthday just so he doesn’t feel “left out.” I didn’t get anything from my parents for my birthday this year. She talks bad about me when she thinks I can’t hear her with her friends a lot. My dad always defends me against her and every time they get into a fight because of it and she always storms off and leaves the house. She tells me all the time how I ruin her day or almost ruin her marriage. One year we had one of our biggest fights. She called me out on something that wasn’t true and I said she was wrong and she lost it. She threatened to send me to a mental hospital or call the cops because I kept arguing with her. She just said I was ruining her life and her marriage and was evil. She use to call me a demon or curse words a lot. So I attempted suicide. I locked myself in the bathroom with a bottle of pills and was just praying to God for my suffering to be over but before I could take my third one my dad already busted down the door and they just yelled at me. My mom went off about how bad it would make her look if I killed myself. So every time we have a fight and I walk away for some space she says “you’re not gonna go kill yourself are you?” 
So that’s pretty much been my whole life. I hate her and she hates me. I lost my relationship with my dad because he is exhausted from her antics and doesn’t want to fight with her anymore to defend me and just stays on her side. 

I feels so lost rn and I just don’t know what to do anymore. I could really use some advice or just someone to talk to. I have been trapped in this house with her for so long I’m going mad. All we do is either fight or avoid each other. I know that was a lot and I’m sorry but it just feels good to put that out there. So thanks for listening to my vent session. Also she believes this whole thing going on is a hoax and she goes out all the time to buy stuff so please feel free to roast her too! I could really use a good laugh!",26Apr2020,1

And here’s the thing....

So we’re currently in a pandemic and like this boy I was talking to who I’ve slept with before was like begging me to meet up and I said no no no quarantine well a month later I was like okay as long as we take precautions.

So basically I booked a hotel room (140$) and then drove there myself and blah blah blah. So I did that and brought alcohol because I asked him to and he said no I don’t want to wait in line and I was like okay whatever be a baby (I tried to convince him) anyways he comes, gets his nut, doesn’t even try to please me and then complains that he’s hungry. I order food and he literally ordered for himself and didn’t get my anything on my fucking account.

So basically I was pissed and he was acting confused and he’s like no matter what I do you just want to be mad... and I’m like what the fuck do you not see how wrong you are. Anyways I ended up leaving and everything and I told him like that wasn’t fair to me and honestly I’m out of his league like if we’re being real here.... like I didn’t judge him he gained a bit of weight and I’m like whatever but like I’m not ugly, I’ve done this for him before but I thought this time he’d be like idk... a gentleman.

796,"I'm a junior in high school and I've been thinking about college for years now, mostly to get away from home. My home situation is toxic and I don't want to be near them much. My parents have made it clear that if I go to a college far from home they won't be helping with any payments, and I'd be on my own. Not sure if this really matters but I'm looking to do pre-med as an undergrad and then hopefully medical school later on.

The thing is, the school that I *really* want to go to (Ohio State Uni) is just 15 minutes away, meaning if I were to get accepted into that school, my parents would force me to stay in this house. I'm not going to go into details; I don't want to live with them for four more excruciating years, but I don't want to make them upset to the point of pretty much disowning me because I ""abandoned"" them and ""disrespected their home by leaving."" It's pretty wack.  I have a mediocre income from doing art commissions, but definitely not enough to afford to live on my own with the added school costs, so I feel like going to OSU but living in an apartment or on campus isn't a good option, unless anyone has experienced otherwise.

My other option is going to the same university that my older brother currently goes to. It's around two hours away from home and he and his girlfriend are willing to let me live with them in their apartment if I go to that uni. Cons? Though not huge cons, it's a 5-year undergrad program instead of 4, and I'll be leaving pretty much most of my friends behind.

Tl;dr - If I go to my dream college I'll have to live with my toxic parents and be in a horrible mental state for another four years, or I can attend a less prestigious school but live with my brother and be in a better place. Any advice as to what college to attend, how to get out of this kind of situation with things working in my favor, or just advice in general, would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.",26Apr2020,1

I live in a very expensive city (Vancouver) and most of my friends will go to University. I have a passion for music production, even though it doesn't pay nearly enough as any other job, and would only require going through some non-university training. My sister went to university with a Psych major and got a BA and is going back to a tech university next year.

In my opinion, she wasted a lot of money getting that BA. A lot of my friends already know what they want to be and already picked their courses n prepare to fit that. I try to fit my courses so I can get accepted to a BSc major if I change my mind. However, it would just be a ""f*** it"" moment if I go. I don't have a major passion for science or any major, that's why I am unable to choose a major or even a degree.

Anyways, long story short, I do not want to go to university even though my parents would like to follow that path. I would like to go to music school for production and pursue that career even if it doesn't pay as much or hold as much prestige.

A few days ago I was talking to my boyfriend and we wanted to see each other. Now his family is very conservative and religious way more than mine. Anyways he asked “what are you gonna tell your mom? Like where would we go?” I said “I’d tell her we will drive around and maybe go for a walk” he was kind of shocked and said “so shes okay with her daughter getting dicked down?!” I was taken aback by it and just did not know what to say because my mom is not “okay with me getting dicked down” but respects my decisions and does not control me from exploring my sexuality. So I replied “well I am pretty sure she knows we have sex, she just doesn’t talk to me about it”.

A few days go by and I tell him “how about we hangout tomorrow?” And he got excited and was like “really!! Thats great!!” And then said jokingly “so your mom is letting her daughter get fucked tomorrow”. That was the line for me. I told him not to say that ever again and he immediatly recognized that he was wrong he apologized and said “yeah that was disrespectful, I’m sorry”. Well the sorry was not enough I needed some time to process. So I took a day to think and he gave me space.

He recognized this and apologized more than once. He told me that this will never happen again and he did not mean to disrespect my mom. He made a stupid joke that was not funny and was genuinely sorry. He asked me if I needed a few days off from talking but I didn’t want to do that. I told him that it will take me time to really trust him again. He understood. I now feel really weird and I don’t know how to process what happened.

805,"
I'm in my early 20s. About a year ago I was hospitalized at a mental hospital for the first time ever. What happened was one night my mother was being abusive and my brother hit me. I called the police and they didn't believe me but saw that I was very emotional and stressed and my mother told them that she had never been abusive (which was a lie) and that I needed psychiatric help. I was taken to the mental hospital and committed. The experience was so horrific it actually caused me to become so depressed. The loss of autonomy, being forced to take medication, the clearly overworked and some even unprofessional staff, being around violent patients, etc. I didn't feel human. It's been a full year since that and I still haven't moved on from what I'd call an ordeal. I couldn't wait to get out of there and even when I was out I found that life meant so much less to me.

It's interesting because before the night I was committed I had several jobs that I really liked, a good amount of money, I had colleges lined up to choose from (I didn't go to college straight out of high school), and I was overall in one of the best if not the best period of my life. I went from the best time of my life to literally the worst time. I lost all my jobs due to either being fired or quitting because I was so stressed and didn't care anymore, and it showed to my employers and coworkers. I committed a petty crime that I'm now on probation for. I spent all my money because I didn't see myself living much longer and I thought I'd be dead by now due to suicide from the sadness. I would literally spend hours just walking around my town and other towns and going on buses and trains and to shops not doing anything, searching for purpose and to feel something; I was once stopped by an authority and was told to stop coming to the area so much without doing anything because ""it's unsettling"" and then asked me if something was wrong. I have nightmares frequently about this and I think about it literally every day.

I'm in college now. I would get therapy but I can't afford it. My insurance only covers part of it and I have no job. I really can't get a job now due to the state of affairs and it would take a while before I had enough money put aside to do this. I can't even drive.

I, a male, have been working for a torturing company for almost 2 years now and switching to a new location last October. I've always had many parents and kids, from kindergarten to high school, thank me personally for how I help their families through academic troubles.
When I switched over to this new location, the owners a exhibited a few red flags when they were telling me of some their policies such has always having a female present during closing. When that policy came up a few more times over the months I asked the owners personally what that policy was for and I got the response of along the lines of ""So parents don't feel comfortable only having men around their small children"".  This exploded the red flag in my face, being backround checked and having a long history of experience.

Fast forward to now, where we are doing online tutoring services with video and audio calls, the new policies indicate that new students along with a big selection of younger children will only be with a select female tutors one of which is 2 weeks new. 

I am really not trying to disregard any of my colleagues in this but the policies in place themselves are making workers like me feel uncomfortable and self doubting. I am trying to figure out a way to confront them about this as I'm on the verge of jot wanting to work here anymore.

 He would text me however I cant bring myself to talk to him as it was too painful for me. It's not his fault after all they never met. What do I do?...I cant keep this up.

815,"Honestly what is wrong with me? I have not been rejected by a guy in my life or have had none lose interest. I’ve lost interest in a guy or rejected others before though so maybe it comes from that.

I am seeing this very handsome and very sweet guy. We haven’t kissed yet because he said he wants it to come natural rather than forcing it because the date is ending. It’s honestly really great because it takes a lot of pressure off.

He compliments me a lot and always says he wants to see me again. He’s already getting kind of protective over me and has admitted he didn’t think it would happen so quickly. We both really have a good time together. He said he might kiss me next time (tomorrow) because he can’t wait any longer and I’m not complaining.

So WHY do I think he has lost interest if he doesn’t text me back immediately? He’ll reply within 5 seconds 9/10 times. Or like if he opens a snap and doesn’t reply. Every time we’ve gone out he texts me 5 minutes after and my mind goes “this is it, he’s going to say he just wants to be friends.” Every time he says “I had such a good time, I can’t wait to see you again.”

Is this trust issues? He seems genuinely respectful and over all sweet which none of my exes were. Is it a “this is too good to be true kind of thing”? I can’t work on it if don’t know why

816,"I work as an arborist for a very small company. There are only 4 employees, 2 of which are the bosses (a married couple), me, and one other guy.

We have been off work since the end of March because, as I'm sure everyone is aware, we are in the middle of a pandemic. I live in Ontario, so we are still in a ""state of emergency"" right now. Tree work is sort of in a grey area for what is considered essential services. Things like storm damage, high risk tree removals, or mitigaring immediate hazards are seen as essential, whereas things like regular pruning for appearance or most preventative tree work does not. 

My bosses and the other employee all want to return to work starting next week. The plan is to all take separate vehicles to whatever site we are working at, each of us will have our own gear bag with our stuff in it (as well as hand sanitizer and wipes), and we will sanitize equipment after using it. We also will all be wearing gloves all day, and driving to our own homes if we need to use the washroom, and of course keeping proper social distancing while working (which I think will be the biggest challenge, but also the most important factor).

Don't get me wrong, I really miss working. I hate being stuck inside, and climbing trees is fun. That being said, I'm really nervous to break isolation and go back to the *OuTsIdE wOrLd*.

Here are a few of my concerns:

1. Tree work is exceptionally dangerous as is. I think the stat is that there are 1.5 fatalities every 3 days in this industry alone. I'm worried that having our minds slightly shifted to maintaining safe distances from each other/ following covid protocols, we will be increasing our risk of a tree work related incident. I also feel like my brain is mush lately, and that is a huge factor in our day to day safety. 

2. I don't think we will have an easy time keeping 2m minimum distance for some of the things we need to do. I also think that we will start out doing our best, but become complacent and slip up. It'll be especially hard because my married bosses obviously live together, and they will be fine to be near each other, so I think it'll be easy to feel complacent. 

3. We have to go to a different place every day to work. I know we are working outside, but that's a new location that new people could potentially be in contact with things every day. Is it unsafe for our customers? Am I being overly paranoid about this? Probably. Do I think it feels irresponsible anyways? Yes.

4. The married couple live alone together, I live with my partner (who isn't working and won't be for quite a while), and the other coworker lives with his partner and their parents. I believe at least one of those parents is still working, so he is being exposed to whatever that person working is also. I dont fully know the situation, but when we had a video call today to discuss things he also mentioned a family member recovering from pneumonia, which was the first I was hearing about that. 

5. My parents are a bit older and my dad is still working. My sister has MS and is pregnant, and I am currently the only person aside from her husband that she has that has been properly isolating. If I start working again I'm worried that something may come up and I wont be able to help. I've been helping the two of them run errands so that they can remain safe at home, and I hesitate to close that door and leave them to fend for themselves, or keep it open and potentially expose them to something. 

6. My mental health is clearly not great right now. This situation is hard on all of us, and I have been starting to find ways to cope with the anxiety that have been really beneficial. Going back to work will take the time away from my ability to continue with these coping mechanisms. I feel pretty anxious and fragile going out into the world. 

7. Though the curve in Ontario is flattening out, I fear the second wave of the virus is going to hit when we all start returning to work. I saw that this is likely going to start happening in the next couple weeks, and they aren't sure what the outcome will be in terms of number of new cases. I don't want to return to work with everyone else and be one of the second wave victims.

8. My one boss is a giant ball of energy that can't sit still for more than a second, and he's pushy. He forces situations in such a way that he always gets his way. I know that while we are supposed to only be doing essential work, he will find a way to sneak in regular jobs so that we can keep full hours. In some ways that's great for me, but it also means that we aren't following what we are being asked to do. There are massive fines being handed out to people working non essentially, or for working and not following proper distancing. 

I'm worried he wants to go back to work because he is antsy sitting around, and the company/ his own finances are suffering, and not because it's the right time to do so. He is looking to grow the company, and keeps saying they want to find a way to ""grow from all of this"". Seems to me like he wants to snag the jobs that are piling up from other companies not working, and come out of this with more money than our competitors, which feels gross to me. 

Obviously I understand that at some point I will have to go back to work. I'm not trying to needlessly extend my time off or anything out of all of this. I just worry that it's too soon to return, and that I'm opening the door for myself &amp; my partner getting sick. It also means that I won't be able to help my sister and her husband out anymore, and that's a concern for me. 

So what should I do? Should I go back to work, or wait until more people have returned to work and the numbers are staying low? Am I being overly paranoid, or practical? 

tldr; I'm an arborist that works for a small company. My bosses want to go back to work full time, but I'm worried it's too soon to return in the pandemic. Am I being paranoid or practical?",26Apr2020,1

I also do admit since she’s one of the prettiest girls i’ve matched with, i was playing it safe and not being my usual self in tears of messing it which was probably the wrong move.

820,"I did something so silly and stupid, but my intentions were not bad. 

A guy (A) I’ve been talking to made me so upset. 

And after our phone call ended, which left me speechless and upset. My friend (B) and I wanted to go on live Instagram, it’s something we always do. And I wanted to get my mind off what just happened.

During our live, I expressed how hurt I was and talked about the situation. I mentioned A’s first name, not thinking it would be a problem because it’s a common name. And I made sure I knew the people who were in the live before I spoke out.

The next day A received an anonymous message by a guy making fun of him telling him what I did/said (and somethings were not true) and saying mean things to A. I have no idea how this person found his links to his social because I DONT EVEN HAVE HIS ACCOUNTS!

He got so upset and mad at me and lost his trust, which I UNDERSTAND. (Again my intentions were not bad and I just talked about the situation and why it upset me) and he was ready to drop me.

He finally, like, gave me a “chance” but like it’s not the same, he doesn’t give me any “ويه”(face). Like how can I make it up to him when he’s trying to avoid me. He answers me with like one or two words. He doesn’t wanna call as much/or at all. Like he doesn’t even wanna talk to me as much. I’m trying. And I understand he has a right to be upset, but how can I fix things when he’s not like giving me ويه(face)??????????? 

Again, he has every right to be upset. But this wouldn’t have happened if he didn’t leave me so upset. Like he was coming off as so disrespectful, and left me speechless and crying and I just needed to let my feelings out. But then again, he wouldn’t have received that message if I didn’t speak about my feelings. But I didn’t know what to do. 

Should I just deal with it for awhile, and if nothing changes, I’ll leave? Like I’ve been thinking a lot and I genuinely don’t think I’ll ever get into a relationship again. I’m young but my luck with guys is so shit. I’m such a headache. My intentions were not bad I was just so sad and the way I let go is by expressing my feelings.",26Apr2020,1

822,"Will be a freshman in college next semester. Provided that we'll actually be able to go on campus, I will have an internship with the governor that I'll have to commute to almost every day, approximately 5 hours round trip. Given that it's already a bit of a hassle, I figured it would be more convenient to just wear a suit the entire day rather than changing. That way, I can head to the train station right after classes rather than going back to my apartment.

For reference, here's what I would be wearing: dress shoes, gold watch, black, gray, or navy jacket &amp; pants, and a black, white, blue, pink, etc color shirt, usually sans tie and top button or two unbuttoned. More casual that if I were wearing a tie, but still fairly formal compared to what your usual guy in college would wear.

While it's convenient, I figure it might make me stand out in a bad way at school. I fear I might look like a douche/snob strutting around campus in a suit, and I'd hate to drive people away by doing that, especially girls. In your opinion, what would you think if you saw a college guy wearing a suit daily or near-daily? On the days I wouldn't wear suits, I'd still be semi-dressy-- think Oxford shirts, chinos or black jeans, Vans/Sperrys, and a gold watch.",26Apr2020,1
823,"so basically, i have spent 3 hours chatting with his girlfriend

by «him» i mean my crushs ex..

his girlfriend is there to protect him cause i sent some photos of him and my crush being together..

i used a fake account but SUDDENLY his girlfriend and himself sent a follow request to my instagram LIKE HOW? I took the train after school (to go home from school)

Then i suddenly saw my crush also take the train. i was worried she was here to see her ex (because he also takes that train)

But she sat alone (i dont think she sat next to her ex) in the back (i was in the middle room of the train)

So, the train finally arrived home, THEN i see her ex walking alone in front of me so i was HAPPY he was alone

THEN i see my crush walk past me AS IF I DONT EXIST

- THEN i see her running to her ex.. he was a little ahead of her

- I FOLLOWED THEM

I took my PHONE out and took pictures and videos through Snapchat and SAVED it on my phone

- They went to a singing/church club activity... (They go to that together)

829,"Hi guys.

(I'm 18M gay) So basically, there's this guy (18) that is quite popular and is friends with a lot of my mates that is gay (or bi) but only a handful of people know, including me, and I really want to help him accept it. I first encountered him on an app that isn't specifically for dating, but for meeting new friends. At first, it seemed like he was gay (he didn't know me at the time but I had heard about him because of my friends telling me stories) but then when we traded our social media, I asked him and he denied it. That's when my best friend told me that he was. We kept talking for quite a while, we have quite a few things in common, and I liked him. 

We stopped talking, and just today I realised he had been messaging me on an actual gay dating app. For information, I'd just like to say I'm not out to everyone, but to quite a lot of my friends, and this guy knows. He didn't know it was me when he messaged me on the app because I don't have any pics of my face on my profile. So now, I'm stressing out because I really want to talk to him and let him know who I am and let him know that it's okay, but I don't want him to freak out because I know so many of his mates and block me or something (I doubt he would because we will bump into eachother one day inevitably). So how do I talk to him? Do I tell him who I am? Do I not and just keep talking to him for a bit without revealing and then eventually tell him? Any advice would be appreciated.

830,"I’ve always been the type of person that just is not good with people. I don’t mean that in the way that people don’t like me, the people I hang out with accept my presence and seem to like me, but I’ve always been nervous with people and it’s hard for me to feel completely comfortable around people, even when I’m already acquainted with them. I eventually got sick of being the lonely weird kid so I went to therapy in an attempt to work through my nerves and such. My therapist recommended a teen group for me and I met my current girlfriend there. We talked for a good bit before she asked me out and I said yes. It’ll be ten months on May 14. 

Now down to the problem. I’m the type of person who takes between five to ten minutes to respond to each text, twenty to thirty if I’m busy. She texts me in the mornings between 10:00 and 11:00 and I don’t respond until around the afternoon. We FaceTime in the evenings because I have things to do during the day, and I have a tendency to get uncomfortable during FaceTimes due to confidence issues, which she knows about. It’s not always like this, I have FaceTimed her midday and I have spent all day on the phone with her, it’s just that I’m not comfortable with constant interaction and I like to be by myself sometimes, which she also knows. 

She, on the other hand, wants constant interaction and is afraid of being alone. She has problems with depression and anxiety, which isn’t helped by the fact that she doesn’t respond to words like she does to physical touch, which creates a whole other problem because she lives in a different city and we can’t see each other because of the quarantine. She can’t talk to her mother either because she berates her for showing emotion, and her father doesn’t understand depression so he can’t help. I’m literally the only one she can talk to and not have to worry about judgment. 

If I don’t already seem like a dick, this is gonna fix that: I sometimes don’t call her because I’m afraid she’s gonna get upset about something and start crying. Her moods change constantly and I still have no idea what to do when she’s upset. Even when I do something, once she’s feeling better I’m mentally exhausted and have a headache, so on top of my own confidence issues I have other selfish issues for not wanting to help her. And I often feel like I can’t tell her anything because she’s very sensitive and I know I can very easily upset her. 

She’s also a hypocrite, which may be harsh, but I don’t know how else to put it. Sometimes when I’m busy and taking twenty minutes to respond to her texts, I apologize because I know she doesn’t like it, and she says something like “busy happens.” Other times she gets upset and starts sending shorter responses, sometimes one word answers. One time she hung up on me because I left FaceTime a few times to respond to my mothers text messages. Her response was that “she doesn’t want to talk to a screen that says paused.” Then a week later she was doing the same thing to me. One time she berated me for not wanting to text her for a day because she kept me up all night because she was upset and wanted company, I even told her I needed the day to myself. She’s done that same thing to me without giving a single warning. She’s told me that if I’m upset and need to leave a call, regardless of how she is, I can. I usually wouldn’t, but I gave in four times and three out of the four times she freaked out. 

This probably makes me a bad person, but I’ve thought of breaking up with her several times. I like her, but she exhausts me. The only thing stopping me is that I’m afraid she would do something to herself. She’s harmed herself five times since we’ve been together, and I’m afraid she would do it more if I told her I didn’t want to be together anymore. She’s never threatened to do it, but she told me a few times while we were FaceTiming and I was successfully calming her down that she would probably be doing it if I wasn’t there, which scares me. I sometimes wish I just never said yes to going out with her, which is just as bad because she told me she thought she was unlovable until me. 

I also always feel tired when I’m with her because she has a much higher libido than me, and because of my confidence issues sex can be hard. When we have sex, I’m always the one pleasing her and I’m always turned off, but I still do it because I feel like I have something to prove. I feel like I can’t turn her down because not doing anything to satiate her feels like quite a blow to my masculinity. 

It also doesn’t help that she’s my first real intimate relationship. She knows the most about me than anyone and she’s the one who took my virginity, I should feel great about this relationship but I feel tired because of it.

Since I live alone now that I'm in college, I dont get to travel often with my parents. But there are times I need to meet them and it must be confidential as always. I missed many of my friends birthdays and my boyfriends mother's funeral and I couldnt come up with any excuses.

I hate lying to people and people are getting really suspicious about my sudden dissapprarences.

I feel bad and I dont want to hide something that covers half of my life from the people I care about.

Open to any suggestions.

Sincerely.",26Apr2020,1
837,"This question is based off a Reddit thread about exes that disturbed me: /r/AskReddit/comments/oahvp/reddit_do_you_have_an_ex_that_you_will_never_be/. If no love is ever as strong and special as the first, do I need to resign myself to a secure, but bland, love in the future? Will my future boyfriend or husband for sure be holding a small candle for a lover long ago? I hear a lot of “I’m in love with my wife, but...” or “the first one just never leaves you.”

I am 26 years old and have quite a few exes. I miss one of them in particular when I feel lonely or nostalgic. I’ve done so much work growing and evaluating his character and the unhealthy patterns he perpetuated inside of me, that when I am in a good place I do not miss him. I am thankful for this.

So, do a lot of people still have special and magical feelings for an ex-lover, even as they’re walking down the isle? If it’s true that the most alive and in-love you’ll feel is in the past, then that is quite discouraging for my romantic future.

What do you all think?",26Apr2020,1
838,"I’m feeling really alone right now and am just looking to talk/vent.

I miss the days before I was this broken person. I pretty much spend the whole day being miserable, and then I spend the whole night thinking about how miserable each day has been. And then I get up the next day and do it all again. Living is the hardest challenge I've faced so far, and it's a thankless task.
 
Growing up was hard. Constant rejection. Completely Dysfunctional family. I’m so used to hiding myself at this point, only showing parts of the real me at times.
 
I’m completely dependent on my parents due to chronic pain problems and I’m losing hope its ever going to change. I was supposed to be graduating this year and moving out. All my appointments are all postponed because of COVID, and waiting sucks knowing you can’t do anything to change your situation.",26Apr2020,1

So was a volunteer last summer at a cool fest, and i want to do it again this year. there was this guy 2-3 years older than me, from a different city, that kept trying to convince me to sleep with him, and i refused for all the 3 days of the fest. after a while he wrote me, seemed friendly, and started asking me about school, while i was trying to tell him about my school life he just started sending me d pics and telling me to send him stuff too, and constantly told me to go visit his city (very far from mine). I stopped responding or reading his messages, and he kept saying ""ohh, you'll see next year when i'll be in your city"". And almost the same thing happend with another guy from the fest, besides the pics.

840,"The last time I spoke with my friend Dylan and her friend group( we are all female) was over 13 years ago when we were 16. I was sexually assaulted, our friends group didn't believe me so they kicked me out. I ended up dropping out because the bullying was so bad.

 I will note that I have high functioning autism. I can pass as neurotypical if I do my best, but I can be a little awkward.

They spread rumors about me in the smallish town we lived in, Anything awful I apparently did it, from being addicted to pills to sleeping around. All lies.


I had a reputation and it followed me into my early 20s and even today. People would call me names and spit in my food in the community. I had no friends and no one wanted anything to do with me. I was hospitalized multiple times because I was suicidal.

Eventually I left the town, but I'm trying to come to terms with some information i learned from a trusted  contact. Dylan doesn't care what she did to me. None of my old friend group feel remorse for what they did to me. They believe in their hearts that I deserved to be treated the way I was. They blame me for what happened to me. And they still continue to make up rumors about me when I go back into town. It makes me so angry and upset. They made me look like I was the bad guy when in fact they were the ones bullying me.


It makes me feel like a middle schooler being picked last in gym, like a total hurt child. And it makes me angry that people view my old friends as good people when in fact they ruined my life.

I also got some further info on Dylan. She may or may not have borderline personality disorder. She threatens to kill herself or to cut herself when she doesn't get her way, as an example. People have described her as not being very stable and prone to erratic behavior she is also abusive towards other people and previous partners. Now I'm not trying to villanize people with bpd, but I'm trying to rationalize and understand why she is the way she is.


I don't really know about the rest of the women, but I just know don't understand how people can lie about someone and just not feel remorse. And I don't understand how people can go out of their way to bully someone.",26Apr2020,1
842,"I’m a girl who have always liked both boys and girls. Like, in elementary school when someone once asked me which classmate I’d want to kiss, I said a girl’s name, but my first big infatuation was a boy. I started to say I was vi when I was 13 and realised I had a crush on a fictional woman and was kinda attracted to a girl in school that kinda looked like her, but all of my big infatuations had been on boys (although now that I think back to it, those feelings were mostly anxiety mixed with my desire to find true love. I’ve never been in love with a girl or had a huge infatuation with one unless she was fictional. I have also heard ”I thought You were gay until you said you had a crush on a guy” from people a lot. 

Now though I think I’m slowly turning into a lesbian (I’m 18) because it’s been a year since I was in love and I liked him in the first place because he was feminine and the only boys I’ve felt attracted to since have been fictional and feminine. I No longer feel any desire to have sex with a guy, but I do with girls and I can only imagine myself getting married to a girl. I’ve never been a fan of mlm in fiction, but have always loved wlw stuff. I’ve also recently found myself being overly supportive of lesbians. I No longer have little to No interest in guys.

843,My family has made the decision of letting my uncle stay in my house until he gets back on his feet. It has been about 6 months and he refuses to get a job and steals money from the people in the household. We even think he has been stealing things such as high quality ear buds. But we have no proof. He has been a complete nuisance and has even kicked down our door once. We called the police and he attempted to lie to get us out of trouble. Everyone wants him out but he refuses. I've thought about getting him out with legal help. Is there any way to get him out without this. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 😊,26Apr2020,1

why? okey, i got problems like every person in this planet and special, people in my age range. No friends,feeling alone,doubts about what to do in your life etc  but my really problem is my **family.** I'm from  unstructured and low-mid family. In my house we are 4 and none of us speak with the other **never** because we hate between us, except my mom (the only person of my whole family that i ""love"" even she don't give a fuck about me) my brother,my dad and me just speak with my mom. You can't imagine how desesperate is this situation. I dont have a moment  of peace.

I tried to go out 3 times even with very few money, but always had to comeback to my home for the money. In my country (Spain)  there arent so much work i worked but in temporary work companys where they kicked out in the mounths.

I dont have studies, i'd like to study but i'm always in a tension-duality of want study to form my future and my ambitions and get anyway to get out from this house.

When i see some positive side of life and i get some strenght to do something to change my life, the dark thought of living here surrounds me (not just the thought, noise,screams etc from my family reminds me that).

I have suicidal thoughts every day,even i planned it in my head very times, and i'm depressed every day  i can't be a stable person so i can't make friends or be a good person to be with him.

  
I'd take drugs all day but they give me a really really anxiety. Just alprazolam helps me and i cant get it more.

847,"The product we make is revolutionary for a specific industry (i.e. it solves a very big problem). We've been in stealth mode so no one knows about it yet. 

We were about to launch the product this month but because of everything, we haven't been able to order anything. We basically built 2 prototypes, figured out what we were going to get and everything stopped.

The markets, shutdowns etc. make it a buyers market for manufacturers. I've tried explaining before that I've already seen dips in prices and if we take our time we could potentially save a lot of money and increase quality. 

He seemed to be on board with that and as I began researching and finding better sources, he came back with ""We don't have time!""

This is a very important business relationship and I can't walk away from it. I want to make a quality product and because we haven't launch and no one knows about us, there is no harm in waiting. He is still operating 2 successful businesses (over 5 mil) and I have still have a great day job.

850,"A little bit of related info: I used to be a lot smaller and skinnier back in my early years of high school due to eating small portions of food and regularly exercising on the treadmill I have at home and at gym class. Unfortunately starting my junior year of high school, I didn't know how to handle the stress from AP classes, volunteering three times a week, after school cram schools for the SAT/ACT (my parents made me take the SAT 7x and ACT 5x because my scores did not meet their expectations). I stopped exercising so I can focus on doing homework, and began stress-eating to cope with my stress and constant pressure. This continued for nearly 3 years, in which I gained around 30lbs (116lbs to 142lbs, height 5'2). It's pretty obvious that I am very very self-conscious about my weight. In the summer of 2019, I moved into my apartment complex, which has a gym, and I began exercising in 2020 because my bf loves running and helped motivate me to do so. 

Due to quarantine, I moved back to my parents' home because I didn't want to live alone in my apartment near campus (housemates moved out before I did). I'm constantly doing assignments and succumbing to unmotivation so I spend a lot of time in my room and sitting. I will admit I did binge-eat the first 2 weeks of me being home because my house has a lot of junk food and me being unable to cope with the sudden change from in-person classes to online classes, and unable to properly cope with isolation. 

About the middle of April, I began trying to incorporate exercising into my life again. I wore the usual leggings and sports bra and walked over to the treadmill in my house. I had to walk past my mom since her desktop is in the living room. She sees me and calls me ""Porky"" and that I needed to exercise more because I'm starting to become ""really fat"". I knew that I probably gained 2-3 lbs due to eating so much in the beginning of quarantine but I was no longer binge-eating by this point. I just excused myself and ran on the treadmill, but it hurt a bit on the inside because I really didn't need to hear that at the time. Unfortunately, the fat-shaming just seemed to increase in such a short time after that. After I ran that night, I went to go refill my water bottle and opened the fridge to see if there was any fruit, and my mom just something along the lines of ""Wow, how are you going to lose weight if you eat so much after exercising? Like a cow"" (loose translation from Viet). Everyday, I get a barrage of comments regarding my weight at all times of the day whenever I go to the kitchen. 

This past Tuesday I decided to hang out at the dinner table to chat about dumb things with my parents after dinner. Somewhere in conversation, I slouch a bit when I was refilling my water bottle and my dad commented on how I was getting a big stomach, only for my mom to reiterate her point that I was eating like a cow and not exercising because I was lazy. I got pretty uncomfortable but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to ruin the mood.

 I think the breaking point for me was yesterday morning. I woke up and headed to the kitchen to grab breakfast. Had to walk through the living room to get to the kitchen. Before I even got the the fucking kitchen, my mom has the fucking audacity to tell me that I needed to exercise more and that a I do is eat, eat, eat, eat. I didn't even eat breakfast yet and I got told I was fucking fat again. I yelled at her that had just woken up and stormed back into my room. My dad got mad at me for yelling at my mom like that and I was being disrespectful/overreacting to a small comment my mom made. ""She's worried for your health"". I didn't fucking care anymore. I just felt so little and that I was ugly and fat.  I cried myself to sleep until I was called for lunch. I ate lunch but felt disgusting so I did the worst thing I could've possibly done and forced myself to vomit it out after I finished. Yesterday's dinner I was able to keep down but I wasn't in any mood to eat. 

Today, I woke up late and at lunch time, but I didn't feel hungry at all. My family had phở and instead of being able to eat the usual amount (a regular size bowl), I could only physically stomach a quarter of it before feeling nauseous. I don't know how to bring it up that their comments hurt me a lot because I have in the past, and they disregard it, saying that I'm still their ""beautiful daughter"" regardless, and that they didn't mean for it to hurt but that it's true. I didn't have to deal with that for long because I moved away to live in a college dorm my freshman year. I feel like it's gotten a lot worse following quarantine so I'm hoping to become financially independent in the near future so I can move out.",26Apr2020,1

852,"My (f20) parents have been on the brink of divorce for a year and it’s really affecting my mental health. 

My mom had an online affair last year around March, because she felt that she deserves better and went about it in a completely backwards way. She had her reasons for this, and while I don’t believe it was justified, I understand. My dad was initially suicidal, paranoid, overall just a huge mess about it. Since then, he’s gotten better, but still thinks about it often and asks to check her phone. 

The thing is, nothing is getting better between them. They tried marriage counseling and that didn’t last and as I type this, I can hear them arguing again. I’m still waiting for the official news of divorce paperwork, but there’s nothing, and meanwhile, my home has gotten worse.

I’ve avoided it for the most part since I’ve been away at college, but I moved back after the huge shutdown COVID-19 caused. I used to avoid visiting home because this has been a problem. 

Neither of them empathize or respect each others’ boundaries. My mom won’t acknowledge she fucked up and that makes it even harder to work through this. Yet they’re still living in the same house, and it makes home feel like a total wreck. 

I’ve watched my dad cry about it, he vents to me all the time. My mom acts like she did nothing wrong, and puts my dad down for all the effort he makes to try and win her back. They’re both just wearing each other down and while I try to be above it for my younger siblings, I wonder if I’m internalizing it more.

People of reddit, how the hell do I deal with this? I’ve tried talking to them both, to no avail. I have nightmares of my mom leaving my family. My dad comes to me for help and doesn’t take my advice. I’m at a total loss and I don’t know how to deal with all the stress this is causing me.",26Apr2020,1
854,"I have a very obvious porn addiction. On my phone alone, a good 90% of the media is porn. My collection is easily past 50k photos, videos, and otherwise. Hell, my current phone easily has 3k photos and vids on it. 
But I can't tell if this is a problem.
On the one hand (pun entirely intended), it's a useful tool to help me relax, it's an interest of mine (composition and photography of it are genuinely fun to critique and discuss), and it's better than any of the other addictions that run in my family (at my age, my late father was slinging and using everything but heroin. And I do mean EVERYTHING.)
On the other hand, its obviously a horrific addiction. People cant use any of my devices or they'll notice. I feel completely isolated on my interest, as I take it as more of an artform than anything else. It has completely warped how I view sex and love (to the point I've entirely decided to remain single, purely because I dont want to hurt anyone). I dont like going more than a day without it, and have had to set up different social media accounts just to keep myself ""clean"" in public. I've gotten to the point where I can look at it while talking to people and they dont notice.
I feel trapped, but, okay with being trapped. It's like being an introvert on house arrest. It has opened my eyes to kinks and other enjoyable things I could experience, but I feel like it's also a crutch. Its kept me from indulging in most other addictions (save for food, but I'm actively dealing with that), but it's also keeping me from dating (which is not entirely good or bad from my perspective).

855,"Hi all,

I am hoping to get advice as I stand in a place where my life is wide open and I can go anywhere/do anything.

Background:

I (25 F) have my bachelor's in international security with a minor in Arabic. I will be graduating with my master's in cybersecurity in May of 2021. I have work experience in retail, but more recently as an accountant. At this time, I am completing an internship as an IT auditor with a major international company, and in a few months I will be taking on another internship (this one more focused in management, but technology to some degree as well) with a defense company. 

Even though I'm still young, I've gotten a little experience under my belt. I've traveled, gone through a couple serious relationships, and faced various struggles throughout my life (loss of family, homelessness, working 3 jobs at a time, etc.). While I am always growing and learning, I'm old enough by now to have a decent sense of who I am, what I like, and what I want. This is as follows:

**My number one priority is making money and building my career. I want to go down whatever career path is going to allow me to climb the ladder and work toward a career where I make $200K+ per year.**

I'm a hard worker, borderline workaholic, and I'm very happy that way!

I like technology, math, etc. well enough, but I really thrive when working with people in a management capacity. I'm very organized, ambitious, and on top of it. 

That being said, I can learn pretty much anything, and I'm willing to do just about any job if that's what I need to do to make the money/progress I want to make.

I don't want the traditional husband and kids set up, although I would love to adopt one day. This affords me the flexibility to move around and tailor my life to the career and income I want to earn.

I love traveling, I'd be more than happy to work abroad. I speak Spanish and Arabic functionally.

I am investing, and have been for several years. I know that income from a single job is often not enough to provide financial security anymore.  

**My question is this:**

What should I do? The road ahead of me is wide open. What experiences/education/qualifications should I look into as I strive to earn that high-earning career I'm after?

Thank you in advance for any guidance!",26Apr2020,1

857,"Sorry in advance that this is somewhat lengthy. I’m very frustrated with my family and I’m not sure if there’s anything I can do. 

My mother is 65 years old and has been smoking for about five years. This makes her pretty high-risk for COVID-19. I love her so much, but she is a very stubborn woman, made clear by her refusal to stop smoking.

When COVID-19 first got reported in the US, she was very good about social distancing, wearing a mask, and refusing to see anyone else in the family besides my father. However, now that we’ve been under the stay-at-home order for a while, she’s starting to become less careful. I found out that she met my adult sister and her three kids at the park, and hugged them all, even though they haven’t been social distancing. And, today she informed me that she is on her way to my brother’s house, in a city with over 5,000 confirmed cases. 

I’ve tried talking to her and my father. My father agrees with me and refused to go with my mother to my brother’s house, but my mother is insistent. I know that my mother is her own agent and it’s not my job to control her actions, but it really worries me that if she gets COVID-19 as a result of her not social distancing, I may never get to see her again. I am the youngest of my siblings and it frustrates me that my two older siblings are enabling her reckless choices. 

Am I overreacting? Is it my place to say anything? Have any of y’all experienced at-risk family members who aren’t taking this as seriously as they should be?",26Apr2020,1

860,"For as long as I can remember, I've fantasised about being small. I'm talking around an inch in height. Colloquially, it's called a 'giantess' fetish and has always been a great source of shame for me. I have never told anyone about it.

Obviously, this fantasy is unattainable, and imagined scenarios are the closest one can come to achieving it.

Unfortunately, the fetish has led to a twisted perception of what a compatible partner would be; i.e: at least 10 times taller than myself. Like I said, this is either something I was born with or developed very early on in life, and not something picked up through porn consumption, which makes me doubt it being 'curable'.

This leads me to my point: I've never really felt comfortable in romantic situations. I've never had a crush, let alone been in love. I've often felt uncomfortable- even guilty- on dates, as I've never seen my desires as compatible with those of the girl I'm with, and so wasting their time as well as my own.

Even when in sexual situations, I've always felt clueless, not driven by any particular instinct, and instead mechanically going along with what I think is meant to be an intimate experience driven by passion.

This has of course led to feelings of borderline eunuchoid romantic and sexual inadequacy. While I've attempted no-fap (and am currently), I've found only adverse effects in the past. My thoughts become increasingly intrusive as each day goes by, which in turn makes me feel increasingly guilty and detached from reality for having them.

Ultimately, my main sentiment tends to be that I simply am not made for love and romance, through misfortune of hard-wired psychological circumstance. When I was younger, I tried to get rid of it through various, sometimes dangerous, means, and was often suicidal.

I've now come to accept it as part of me. Contrary to what you might think having read the post, I live a very happy, social, productive, and fulfilling life in all areas other than the aforementioned (romance and sex).

I still want to believe that I can belong, but I don't know how. Maybe I just really haven't met the right person, but I doubt it. I think the problem lies at a deeper level of my mentality and attitude towards relationships; I just don't know what I need to do to fix it.

Any and all responses will be greatly appreciated.",26Apr2020,1
861,"So lemme start this off by saying before quarentine my mom was a perfectly normal single mom with 3 kids she was also and atheist my whole life she never went to church with me my sister and my dad when we were younger or anything. She’s got a good job and we weren’t bad off by any means. So after this quarentine shit my other post on this account I wrote about how she was talking about political revolutions and how things are never gonna go back to normal. Now she’s just gone batshit insane the other day I had her drive me to a spot that was a nice walk and she was just gonna pick me up whenever I texted her this was at like 6. Then at 6:45 I asked her to pick me up cause it was my dads day and I wanted to go over to his house. So she said yea coming and she said she was on a walk cause God told her to. So at this point I was like wtf ok whatever then she said otw and then o was like where are you then she said that she went back home to pray. At this point it was like 7:20 and I had been waiting on the side of the road for 45 min and I was starting to get pissed off. So I kept trying to call her and she wouldn’t answer. So I texted her to come and she said that she was having god show her where to go to find me and I was like wtf is wrong with you and I shared my location with her and she pulled up at like 8. Next thing you know she got out of the driver seat and made me drive I’m 14 I’ve never even tried driving before and she told me that god would tell me how to drive oh and not to mention my almost 3 year old baby sister was in the passenger seat unbuckled and she always makes her go in a car seat no matter what. So I drove about 2 feet then slammed on the brakes and my sister hit her head on the front of the car and I felt terrible she didn’t get hurt or cry but still. Then after that she started driving and we got a couple blocks to our house and I told her to bring me to my dads then she said ok (they only live a couple blocks apart) and then she stopped at a road inbetween the houses and just took a right out of no where cause god told her to. And I was like ok wtf is wrong with you and then I said sarcastically “gods telling me to tel you to take a left” towards my dads house and she said nope and took a right and went to her house so I walked over and it’s not a long walk but still it was so fucking weird. At some point in that car ride she told me she’s living a Christ based life whatever tf that means. Then I spent the weekend at my dads house and I’m gonna go back there today and my older sister already went back and my mom told her some crazy shit too. This part is coming from my sister on the phone so I’m not sure of the whole picture but this is what I got from our conversation. My mom thinks we’re descendants from a witch family and that we all have magical powers and we’re in the 1% of people who have them. And she said that we’re gonna be rich and move California within the next month and we’re gonna be like the kardashians. Oh and get this Courtney said she’s been staring direct into lightbulbs and she’s been seeing colors and her past life and our future. So yea my moms losing her mind and I have no idea what to do about any of it and I’m sorry this was so long but I honestly don’t know what to think of it but when I go back I’m gonna tell her to talk to a therapist and see where it goes from there.

TLDR my moms going insane and ditched me on the side of the road for over an hour and thinks we’re descendants of witches and we’re gonna be rich in a month and move to California",26Apr2020,1
862,"Over a year and a half ago, I joined this little group of people with the same interest and with the motive to make some friends. It was 13 people including me, and it worked out really well. We spoke to each other everyday, shared secrets and bonded over so many things. Our friendship was so enjoyable we video chatted nearly everyday, and it was so comfortable to the point where I met up with one of them to spend a bit of new years with, since we both lived in the same city. The time was very meaningful to me, I was one of the youngest (we’re all around the same age group) and they all took care of me, and made me feel so loved and special. I felt like the happiest person on the planet. They always wondered where I went when I had to go to school (I always turn my phone off) and or when I have no access to the internet. They miss me, they’re always wanting to continue their conversations with me, they loved me. Never in my life I have felt this heart-beating feeling before, it was all so foreign but I loved and smiled through all of it. They were my beautiful friends. Quarrels broke out between the moderators and a few people I’ve been extremely close to as well. Over unfairness and abuse of power. I was so puzzled and scared, it was an absolute nightmare. After people left the chats, I created another one with them, because I was fearing that I’m going to lose them at some point. A few months had passed, I was still talking to the original chat as well as the one I made with the others. I guess you could say I was two-timing, but they were both aware I was communicating with the other group. More time passes as fights were more often, and I happened to get dragged into it as well. Me and the mods then broke off and I went back to the separate chat, with some more of the people added from the original. We eventually stopped texting each other around summer 19’, I’m still in contact with two of them, one of them being my now best friend. But everyday since the incident, ever since we had the fight where we cut ties with the mods, its been haunting me ever since. Everyday single goddamn day I think about them, I think about how happy I was when everyone was together. I took it for granted, and for that I’ve faced never-ending waves of pain and emotions. Its been more than a year and everyone else would’ve moved on by now, why not me too? It’s so frustrating I‘m not able to keep walking down my own separate path of life,  I’m still stuck here and I don’t know what to do. This is my first time posting on reddit, but however, Dear Redditors, what can I do to move on from this period of my life? I’ve never come across this obstacle in my life, as I’m a bit lost. I appreciate everyone’s thoughts and comments",26Apr2020,1
863,"so back in early January, me and my dad got into a really big fight (we get into big fights like every three months now) and long story short: we fought, he destroyed my room, took my computer that I paid for 100% and built about a year and a half previous, smashed it against the fence and left it in the rain and mud for about a week while I was kicked out.  Like I said, this happens a lot so I'm fairly used to it, but this is the first time he's really destroyed something of mine that can't just be  fixed. at school my grades were going down because I didn't have  a computer to do homework on and of course, like everything, this was my fault. (and yes, him destroying my pc was somehow my fault.) after everything kinda went back to normal he said he would fix it but since then we've gotten into more fights, and the last one ended up with me taking a piss on his truck for no reason other then a nice ""fuck you"" after he put me to sleep with a 2x4 beam. I've overheard him telling my mom that he's ""never buying that little n\*\*\*er a fuckin computer"" and that's an exact quote. What should I do. I can't leave until the quarantine is over,  I can't  just get a job and get a new pc considering jobs aren't exactly a thing anymore. I'm about to turn 16. help.",26Apr2020,1

865,"this post is a semi-vent i suppose so it'll be a bit heavy, mentions of body image, mental health and suicide

so i was quite a happy kid despite having some pretty severe body consciousness issues throughout my life; during my earlier years all the way through secondary school/high school i was tidy, clean and despite the occasional ""depressive"" episode i was quite happy. i bathed daily, cleaned my room daily and did chores with only a slight grudge. i moved country in the early summer of 2017 at the age of 15 and left all my friends, memories and family (other than my mum, stepdad and siblings) behind. the year following that was pretty rough for me mentally; i started a new school and got bullied and eventually stopped going because my anxiety would cause me to seize up and panic at the thought of even leaving my house. not going outside for so long &amp; not speaking to any of my friends for so long took a really big toll on my mental stability and i ended up ODing in january 2018. i survived (luckily), but the progressing years only seemed to bring more challenges. 

despite moving again to start at college and further my education, i didn't feel myself getting better. every day i had to battle myself to get out of bed and convince myself education was worth it. i started showering less &amp; my room got messier &amp; i put on several kilograms of weight. despite this, i was happier than before and that's what i clung onto for hope. i enjoyed my new college &amp; made a new friend who i consider very dear to me now and i felt myself improving.

however, i started a new college course in 2019 at a new college and my mental health took another decline, this time i feel it was very extreme. the work was overwhelming for me and i seemed to be sabotaging myself - i wasn't studying or writing my notes, i would sleep late because i couldn't find it in me to close my eyes and eventually it got to the point where going to sleep was so difficult for me that i wouldn't wake up on time and so i wouldn't go into class. on days i /did/ go in, i was late &amp; i was getting constantly scolded. 

honestly, i didn't think it could get worse from there, but then i checked my weight again and i had gained another 10kg &amp; couldn't really stand the sight of myself anymore. in february of this year i feel like i lost all hope. i tossed all the mirrors in my house because i'm so ashamed of looking at myself now, and my motivation for doing anything has left me. i have online college work to do to get a passing grade that i cannot be bothered to do. i haven't showered in upwards of a week, my room looks like a genuine pigsty, trash, cutlery and plates are piling up around me and my bed is unmade and has been unmade for weeks now. i feel disgusting, honestly, and my brother doesn't fail to mention how gross my living situation is any time he comes into my room. i don't really eat anymore &amp; when i do it's only very small snacks or microwave meals, and i spend so much time sleeping that my family has to wake me up at 7pm sometimes just to remind me to eat. and even though i'm aware of all this, i can't seem to convince myself i deserve to be happy and clean and tidy. 

i want to get better, but i truly don't know where to start &amp; it's already embarrassing enough as it is. is there anyone else who has experienced this and gotten through it? it would mean a lot if i could at least relate to someone and know i can get better.",26Apr2020,1
866,"A few weeks ago, this man on Instagram messaged me saying that he knew me from a Cosplay Convention I participated in back in 2018. I do not remember him at all nor I do not have any mutual friends with him. It is also pretty hard to find my social media accounts as my account is private and I never post pictures of me cosplaying. 

Yesterday, he got drunk and spammed a bunch of random texts where he asked me out and cut himself when I rejected him. He went off, saying that I didnt like him because he was disabled and proceeded to blame me for his cuts. After a few minutes, he sent me a photo of his foot and told me that he had eaten a mosquito. Which is really confusing and I am not sure if he is mentally stable. Then he proceeded to ask me where I live. I gave him a very vague answer but he asked if I lived in [insert my locality] and went on to pinpoint the exact house. He said that he had seem me in front of that house once and deduced that it was my house just from that??? Which isn't very believable because I look very different in cosplay and I doubt that if one sees someone in front of a random house they'd immediately think 'oh, that is probably [insert person]'s house'. This was really strange because it all happened on the same night, in the span of a few hours.

I don't know how to put the screenshots of his texts here and I am not sure if the English I'm using is understandable because I do not come from an English speaking country and English is the third language I know. But I hope the story is readable(?). 

I am not really concerned about him breaking into my house or anything like that because it is quite secure thanks to my father's old zombie phase. 

But I would really like some advice on how to approach this situation. 
He is a very sensitive person (he thinks he's emo) and uses the 'I'm disabled' card every time I try to talk to him which makes it quite frustrating.

She’s currently getting her masters in psychology so I don’t understand how she can’t handle anything. Lately she gets upset over the tiniest thing.

870,"30M and feel like its too late to change my life around. I grew up with abusive siblings who would constantly put me down and it had a lasting impact on my self-esteem. I've never been a confident person and my friends never saw me as an equal and would occasionally put me down. That's my fault for never standing up for myself bc I think what's the point my life sucks. I've been alone for pretty much most of my twenties, and by that I mean very rarely have gone out socially.  I'm a virgin and only been on a few dates despite not being ugly. Ive had girls interested the few times I've gone out socially but still harbor such terrible self-esteem Ive never been able to let anyone close. I vividly remember years ago telling myself the same thing that its too late to change etc and WISH I could turn back the clocks and change shit up years ago. Im back in school (graduating in the fall) and I really don't have any social life atm. I'm just afraid even if I work on changing my life its TOO late to do a damn thing about it. My biggest goal right now besides graduating is finding a girlfriend bc that will significantly improve things for me. My scumbag friends have been getting girls their entire life and I get so depressed thinking how much time I wasted. Ive been pretty much treated like shit my entire life

Here's some of the negative thoughts I deal with daily:

* I'll never be in my twenties with a girlfriend dating like normal human beings
* I was probably better looking 4-5 years ago so why didn't i change shit up then
* I don't have a social circle for even beginning to meet women. Online dating is impossible
* Why am I back in school if I'm still gonna be alone 
* I need a girlfriend to start becoming more confident, yet to get one I irst need confidence

Theres more but I wanna keep this short. The big thing holding me back is the time I wasted when my life could have been a lot different. Even if things change for the better now, I could have done all of this years ago if only I sought out therapy or just didn't have such low self-esteem. 

Thought I'd post this here cause its much cheaper than seeing a therapist",26Apr2020,1
872,"This is my first post ever so please excuse any wrongdoings, also I’m on mobile. 

I (25f) have always kind of wanted to shave my head and have made the occasional comment about it around my family who I am very close to. I moved to a new city beginning of March and probably had about a week or 2 here before lockdown. Today I thought again about shaving my head as this would be the perfect time because I can make a plan if I don’t like it.

I asked my mom quite seriously what she thought as I value her opinion. She basically told me that she would cry every day until my hair grew back. I said that it will grow back. She repeated that she will cry every day until it grew back and ended the conversation. 

I have curly hair, sort of like Zendaya, so it might look funny as it starts growing again but I realise that and am keen to experiment with fun party wigs and luckily I have quite the bucket hat collection which I already wear often. I just don’t understand how my decision about my own hair can affect her so deeply. I don’t want to upset her if it really means that much to her but also it’s my hair, I’m a grown adult, it will grow back, and I really do think it will feel quite freeing. 

I would like advice on what I can do to get her on board so that I can be fully confident and happy to actually just do it.",26Apr2020,1

875,"Burner   account, need advise. My roommate suggested this community of advice   givers! haha. I (28, F) have just finished my student teaching   experience as part of my masters program to become a licensed teacher. I   was suppose to be student teaching with my cooperating teacher until   April 24th and then would have spent an additional 60 hours with a   cooperating teacher in another subject. However, the the school down  March 16th because of the global crisis. My university voided the last 5  weeks of  student teaching for our entire cohort and required everyone  who was  perusing two subjects to create two addition lesson plans and  film  ourselves teaching. I was able to finish edTPA so I am officially   licensed to be a teacher and have completed requirements for my Masters   program.

Here is where I need  some  advise: during my student teaching experience, my cooperating  teacher  (39, M) was completely inappropriate towards me. He would find  reasons  to touch me, be alone with me, call me after working hours or  on  weekends, invite me out for drinks, buy me things, cry in front of  me,  be possessive if I talked to other teachers or asked others for  advice,  talked to me about not having sex with his wife, would  require  me to come in an hour before everyone else in the school (often  I would  be the first person in the building), and at one point was  trying to  spend $300 on me to go to an educational conference with him  and was  trying to get me to share a hotel room with him. I told another teacher (33, F) that I trusted in the building and planned on  informing my  university and the principal at the school I was interning  at so that he  will not be placed with another female student teacher. I  felt  extremely uncomfortable around him and could not wait to get out  of that  classroom by the end. As soon as the school closed, my  requirements  with him were met and I was extremely relieved. He has  called me  multiple times since the school closure wanting me to grade  work for  him, which I have helped him with. After I submitted my edTPA  he wanted  me to work on remote learning with him (I think he just wants  me to do  his online grading, which he hates doing). When I told him  that I had  completed my requirements he got really aggressive and made  rude  comments to me and told me when he completed his student teaching  he  stayed on longer than his whole cohort to finish out the year with  his  school until June. I was completing student teaching as part of a   requirement for my program, not as a volunteer. I do not want to work   with this teacher anymore and I feel like he is trying to take advantage   of me. He got off the phone angrily by saying ""I will call you to   arrange picking up my stuff"" (school laptop and some textbooks). He is   my most important reference because he is the main person who has seen   me teach every day, and I am a brand new teacher with no experience   other than my student teaching in the field of education. I want to   write an email thanking him for the help he as offered and apologizing   that he had different expectations from me that are not going to fit   into my life at the moment.

876,"As my aunt is a legal US citizen,  she got a green card for family reunification and moved to the US a year ago to be closer to her family. 

My grandmother works as a caregiver (legal work permission). 

The problem is that my aunt and her husband don’t have health insurance except for their children. 

Two weeks ago, my younger cousin was feeling very sick and was taken to the hospital- Corona test was negative, but as a result when she was brought back home the whole family fell ill. 

My grandmother has been suffering from [hypertension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension) for a very long time now. 

When she moved to the US, we explained to her how costly US healthcare is, but she decided against staying in our home country because she was feeling lonely there and wanted to be closer to her grandchildren. My aunt and her husband were the ones who offered her to stay with them after my grandfather passed away.

Just a few days ago she received a letter that her health insurance was denied. So, she is working and living with no health coverage. My aunt wants to take legal action against that decision. 

After the whole family fell sick, my grandmother's blood pressure went very low. Now a doctor, a family friend, told us that there’s reason to assume that she might have a heart disease and risk for a stroke. If there wouldn't be a lockdown, my grandmother would fly to her home country and go to a doctor there.

Now, I fear that: 

* In case of an emergency, my grandmother won’t be able to get any help
* In case she gets help she’ll put my aunt into enormous debt

My aunt signed that she will provide (financially?) for my grandmother, which was a requirement for the green card. 

What is the best thing for me to do? I was thinking of sending my grandmother medication from where I live as the cost here is much lower, but besides that I don’t know what else I could do. 

Also what is the best thing my aunt can do apart from taking legal action?",26Apr2020,1
877,"&amp;#x200B;

So for a few months now , as I have explained to a different post, I have been in a skinship with a former roommate of mine .I am 21 , he is 22 and we are both men and as far as I know both straight.

 Namely  , him and I have been napping and sleeping together whenever we felt like it. I m not sure how to explain it , I guess we were both lonely and single for too long and we miss affection and human touch in general. Personally I was pretty deprived and most of my nights felt crazy lonely until we started this. Some nights we would even have lengthy conversations about ourselves while cuddling. He would run his fingertips accross my back or rub my hands , scratch my neck and my hair softly and all of those endearing gestures that just felt like a form of care . I d do the same for him and literally spent a lot of time on top of him , resting on his chest or his stomach or the nape of his neck. I know it sounds weird, it probably is , but it felt like we both needed this really bad. Sometimes I would return from class and I d just go straight up to his room and ask him to cuddle for a bit to get the stress out of my head .

It became a habbit , we started hanging a bit more outside of our cuddle sessions too whenever there was time but it always involved some sort of touching like brushing or locking fingers . I only noticed myself when a mutual friend pointed out we were toying with each other's fingers for an hour while we were out. Its bizarre to me , I don't get why we both have the need to be so close to each other bodily, this doesnt happen with any other guys I know but with him it's just natural and calming and it makes me feel warm and safe. I don't think its a sexual thing or whatever since I haven't been getting aroused by any of that and we havent done anything like kissing , it just felt like a special form of closeness.

We are currently separated because of the ourbreak and we are communicating via messages and video calls.  I decided I should talk to him properly about it since I have been feeling confused about whether  this form of connection with another guy is natural or not. These are the messages we exchanged M is me and Him is H.  

M: Don´t you think its weird? 

H:  I MEAN I guess but I don’t hate it , I VE told you before it feels good for me , do you find it weird ?

M: Its just unusual for two men , wont you rather do this with a girl?

H: I m not rlly looking for a gf right now

M:Not girlfriend, just a girl to cuddle with

H: I don’t have a problem with you , if that’s what you wanna know 

M: I know that lol 

H: So why are you asking me then? You WANNA stop?

M: I was just thinking some stuff and what if one of us gets a girlfriend? Wont we have to stop then?

Η: Are you dating anyone or sth all of a sudden?

Μ: Νο 

H: Dude, you are being weird if you wanna stop just say so

M: You wont mind?

H: Want me to be honest? I will , a lot, it feels crazy good holding you and I miss you insanely much but if that’s what you wanna do guess I cant stop you , not rlly 

M: the way you say things like that just confuses me you know, you make it sound hella gay

H: oh plz , as if you don’t say such things, if I sound gay , so do you 

M: sometimes I wonder if I am 

H: gay?

M: yeah

Η: …

H: Why are you telling me this?

M: I didn’t mean it in a weird way, just sometimes I wonder cuz I do weird stuff like this

H: You mean you cuddle with other guys too?

M:No, would you mind?

H: Yeah 

M: Really?

H: Kinda , this is special to me so I wouldn’t like you to share it with anyone else.

H: wow I do sound gay 

Μ: lol 

M: Honestly … I wouldn’t like you doing this with somebody else either … it feels very intimate for me and the idea of you doing it with someone else or stopping it completely makes me wanna vomit . I probably sound too dramatic but it just feels wrong . I don’t mean to freak you out just… I think I should tell you about it before we grow closer and this turns into a mess…

H: I m not freaking out , kinda like that you said that

Η: Let me ask you sth.Do you want a gf right now?

M: I don’t know, honestly I m confused. Because If I got one I would have to let go of you and the idea really sickens me.

H: Have you thought of us 

H: ever?

Μ: What do you mean?

Η: Being more 

M: Swear you wont tell anyone 

H: I wont , we already have one secret anyways 

Μ: Υeah but you re gonna have written proof of this one

Η: I don’t fancy humiliating people over things like that

M: Okay so , I ve thought of it , a lot lately actually because I started contemplating about all these feelings but I know none of us is gay so I don’t really see it as an option

H: I ve thought of kissing you 

M: what

Η: Your lips are so close sometimes it crossed my mind, they look soft … this is the first time I say sth like this to another man so spare me , but yeah, I don’t really fantasize about anything else but I ve thought what it would be like kissing 

M: do you like men?

H: Not really , I just thought maybe if it was you …I wouldn’t mind doing more, like try kissing and stuff, see how we feel about it and proceed accordingly

M: You are saying you wanna kiss me?

H:  If its not too weird for your scardy ass

M:Wait, I m confused, does that mean you like me?

H: Oh god you are such an idiot aren’t you? Ι just said I wanna try kissing you , what do you think?

M: Ι don’t fucking know! Maybe you want to experiment or sth 

Η: Would that be so bad? It’s the first time I have thought of experimenting with another guy, I don’t necessarily mean do more than we feel comfortable with but I m certain that kissing is a mild way to figure out how we feel. Unless its too much for you ofc in which case I wont mention it again

Μ: Ι dont know what to tell you, I m confused.

Η: Look, I don’t mean to be a creep , if you think I m being out of line here I ll stop

Μ: No , you are not , I didn’t think you were a creep 

I included the most important parts of our conversation. I m meeting him next week and I m feeling baffled and confused and I could really use some advice from someone who has been through something similar or knows how to not freak out in such situations. I can’t really talk to any close friends because my whole social circle is filled with straight people and I just never had that sort of experience before. I Don’t wanna be judged for it. My family is not really open to homosexuality or anything related to that and I m worried what will occur from our encounter.

I felt better after we talked, we had developed a skinship for months and I really felt uneasy to the idea of him finding a partner and stopping , I am glad he has the same concern as me and we share a mutual feeling. Other than that I m petrified. I m wondering whether I have a crush on him and if its possible to have a crush on a guy but not get aroused by him? And what if that changes later ? I don’t know, most people my age have this sort of thing all figured out and I m struggling so hard and I feel ashamed. I desperately need some insight.

878,"My husband needs time to cool off when we fight and it really throws me for a tailspin.  When I was growing up and did anything my mom didn't approve of, she would give me the silent treatment for days, sometimes for a week or more.  The silent treatment would only end when I apologized to her for whatever I had done.  It was common enough that my sisters and I would say, ""You know how mom is, you fight, she refuses to talk to you, you apologize and she'll talk to you again.""  There was never an apology from her.  When I got a divorce (which she deeply disapproved of), she didn't talk to me for almost a year.  We still really aren't on the best of terms, but it is what it is.  She always claimed it was so ""she didn't say anything that she couldn't take back"" but if that were the case, she would come to you when she calmed down, not the other way around.  So to me that seems like it's just an excuse to justify shitty behavior.

She made it perfectly clear that love is conditional and dependent on appropriate behavior and that affection is a tool that can be withheld to ensure that you agree with her and she continues to be right.  In my head, I know that this is wrong and what she did isn't the way a loving relationship is supposed to be.  It made me incredibly conflict-avoidant (one of the things that led to my divorce) because I feared ""messing up"" so badly that my partner would no longer love me.  It also led to being incredibly co-dependent in past relationships to not upset my partner along with all the other self-esteem issues that come with it.  

The problem is that my husband needs time to cool off when we fight and all those feelings of worthlessness and abandonment come flooding back.  It makes me physically ill (gives me migraines) and he knows this.  We've tried a couple of things- I've just powered through and talked to him anyway (this is the worst one and leads to huge escalations in our fights, but obviously works out the best for my messed up brain because at least he's forced to interact with me), we've decided on a 12 hour time limit, but that still causes the migraines.  Our new tactic is a ten minute time out to regroup and we have yet to try it.

I just feel like this whole thing is my fault for being so messed up.  Normal people don't act this way when their partners don't talk to them for a day or so.  They just chalk it up to that person being pissy and move on with their day.  I can't.  I get stuck in this self loathing spiral of not being good enough or worth enough.  In my head, I know that it's not the same thing, that he isn't using his silence to get me to agree with him, but that doesn't stop the flood.  How can I move on and just be normal?  I'm so tired of being messed up by this small simple thing.",26Apr2020,1

883,"And it is disgusting. My mom is slowly coming around to see it. My sister is 14, can be boy crazy and she has an older half brother that is 17. They meet a while ago and he is staying with us since his parents don't trust him to take care of himself and not make a mess of the house if he is left alone. They are out of state for awhile so. 










Anyways, my sister hates affection. She won't hold my hand without a struggle and definitely wont cuddle with me. If I lay my head on her shoulder, she will instantly run off. She is like this with everyone, me and my mom and even our older brother. This boy comes in and bam, she is like a gum under his shoe. I would be fine with it if she wasnt always holding her hand, constantly kissing her brother's cheek before she leaves somewhere, etc. He encourages it too. He does the same to her and would sneak into her room in the middle of the night. They'd end up sleeping at like 6 am and wake up at 2 or 3 in the afternoon. 










My sister is the biggest mental health and equality for all advocate. Her brother has a reputation online because of the shit he pulled at his school. He would bully kids, put pretty racist stuff (my family (including sister) are hispanic so) on there and is just a dick. I showed my little sister, she cried and ignored both of us for a couple of days. She talked to her brother after a few but just barely started speaking to me again 2 days ago. 











It is getting worse and escalating to a bigger issue. They keep sneaking off to each other's room and I even once saw them kiss (not french, just those small pecks) on the lips. I am sure they do it more because they just rolled their eyes when I confronted them. Remember how my sister used to hate physical contact? I saw him rubbing circles on her back yesterday. Like on her bare back, it was under her shirt. I am starting to get worried. My mom knows and she is coming around slowly but I am scared that it'll be too late by the time she actually does something and realizes the situation entirely. I keep telling my sister that she can talk to me no matter what but she never does. I don't know what to do and I am starting to doubt everything I know. A part of me wants to stay and stop it but another just wants to give up and let her suffer the consequences of it.",26Apr2020,1
884,"Since quarantine hit, I’ve realized that I’ve become pretty clingy to some people over text and snap. I’ve been snapping people 4-5 times a day every day for the past 6 weeks.

Originally, I knew I would come off as overly needy but I thought it would be justified because it would keep me sane being in isolation.

But now I realize how much damage I have probably done to one of my friendships. The problem is that before quarantine, I was not like this. But now I can tell he is dropping hints he wants me to leave him alone, but he is too nice to tell me.

And I feel like a jerk. I didn’t respect his time, I started using texting to say more intimate things about how I feel about the friendship  and I’ve said things like “I miss you” and “love you brotha” too much.

I feel like I’ve overstayed my welcome in his life and now I want to give him space, and if I do that I think we could drift apart.

When I say I am being too clingy, it’s not so much that I’m blowing up his phone; I always follow the “don’t talk to them until they respond to you” rule. 

It’s more that I think I’m making him sick of me because we obviously have no way to be physically present, and I have been trying to vent the built up feelings of loneliness and my need to show affection to him via social media.

I am considering not talking to him for 5 days minimum so I can give him space. But I also fear either he will mistake that hiatus in contact for anger toward him or that I’ll just be even more annoying when I contact him again.

Should I just take a break from talking to him? Or will that cause more harm than good? 

It is a petty question but the quarantine has been screwing with my emotions and my mind and it’s brought me down to being conscious of how I communicate with my friends. In normal life I hardly use social media and I’m usually independent and the least clingy person you could find. But now that snap is my main mode of communication I’ve used it too much.

I just want to save the friendship because it’s one I highly value and I don’t want to lose it over the current global situation and my cluelessness when it comes to keeping in touch.

I strove to be independent after I had a really bad falling out with a friend years ago because of clinginess. In fact I did so much to improve my character after that, I was sure I had rid myself of my codependency issues. I was finally making good friends and they felt natural, and I was really good at maintaining boundaries and not being needy.

Now I’ve failed and I’ve resorted back to what I thought I had conquered within myself. I can’t lose this person like I lost the other friend or I might actually go insane.

1. First off school ended super abruptly. Graduation got cut short and cancelled and I wasnt ready for it. The fact that even after I worked my ass of for 12 years in school and that traditional graduation ceremony is probably off the table was super disturbing. Whats even more disturbing is the fact that my underclassmen friends will experience what its like to be behind the podium. Its gotten easier to deal with but what was really sucky was that none of my relatives or role models knew what I was going through or gave me sound advice. They just said that it wasnt that great but that didnt help. At least they got to experience. My plans to see my family for graduation got cut short because of whats going on now. Its gotten easier but it was a huge let down

2. My moms been seeing a guy for a few months and it hasnt really hit me that we might start separating energetically (if that makes sense) shes still around most of the time, but its still strange. Ever since we moves away from my dad its been me and her against the world, and we’ve been joined by a chain for a while. And I know that thats not the healthiest thing for someone of my age but it just sort of happened that way. The fact that she has someone new to make her happy is strange and I don’t know who to turn to for support and advice. I cant go anywhere and the one friend who I can see during (all this) was having his own issues and I couldn’t see him. (Even though I know its kind of a no no.) I find it difficult to be alone sometimes and the thought of my mom having fun without me makes the loneliness more painful.

890,"I'm 17 right now, so college is sort of something I need to get figured out really soon! And so sorry that this post is extremely long, I tried to tidy everything up but there's a lot that goes into this decision... I put headings as a little TR&amp;DR above each paragraph because I ended up spilling everything out here.

At first I thought ""I'll be a mental health counselor!"" but then  I decided to pursue my passion for art and video games to become a concept artist/character designer/etc, and then I realized I really, really just want to do both.  I do know I'm going to do art as a freelance artist, cosplay, etc. no matter what, bottom of the line. 

I need help, anybody who's been through college or has any advice at all, what should I do?

\--

The problem is that SCAD is expensive, but potentially doable without debt if I do well in scholastics this year.

Some colleges in Florida I could potentially get into nearly 100% free as long as I get my 100 hours, which I'm absolutely going to do, of course. That's free tuition! and only about 3.5k if taken by SCAD.

\---

\[can't go study to do both\]

The problem is... I can only really go to college for either or. There's no dual enrollment for SCAD, and I haven't found a college in Florida yet that'll let me take classes for both, and even if there were, many non-art colleges don't have specific art classes like SCAD, and if I go for mental health counseling, I don't really want to extend my stay by several years just to take art classes that aren't specific to my passion)

\[love to work from home\]

I would also really love to work from home in the future, because I plan on fostering kittens. It seems a bit random, but between commissions, fostering kittens, fursuit making and other freelance work, working from home would be the best option for me. Being a video game artist wouldn't be too hard so long as I didn't work for a company that demanded my presence like Nintendo (as much as I'd love to work for Pokemon). Indie companies would probably be my best friend here. It's possible to have an at-home office (security issues aside) as a mental health counselor too. Con- I plan on living by myself besides my cats/foster kittens (could look into training a therapy cat too). Pro- that means no issues from spouse/family working from home. 

\--

I plan on going to a community college first, because the one nearby I think has a ""promise"" which literally lets me take the first two years free if I know what career I'm taking after I leave. (granted, there's more complexities to it I'm sure)

&amp;#x200B;

If I went to SCAD to become a video game artist...

\[cons\]

\- I couldn't be a mental health counselor

\-more expensive, out of state

\-I doubt video game art is as stable of a job as a mental health counselor

\[pros\]

\-art would improve far faster

\-get to be a video game artist! a job doing my passion- art.

\-Savannah is really nice in general, get an art college experience splitting an apartment with other students who likely share similar interests as me.

\-4 years

\-more likely to work from home

&amp;#x200B;

But if I go to a college to become a mental health counselor...

\[cons\]

\-work would be far less entertaining

\-1000 hour requirement of probably unpaid work in the field to be certified

\-scared I'll mess up and only make it worse for my clients

\- art improve far slower than at SCAD

\-could potentially absolutely backfire and I fail

\-two extra years in college compared to SCAD

\-what if I don't actually like being a counselor? what if I'm bad at it?

\[pros\]

\- bright futures scholarship (almost all tuition paid)

\- can still work on art

\-I could potentially still also be a video game artist

\- a bit selfish, but I'd get to sort of be known as a professional and not just a freelance artist in the communities I'm active in. 

\-I have a keen interest in psychology and would love to help people, as I myself have mental health issues/insecurities. 

\- more stable job if I do actually get the degree

894,"I’ve read that antiperspirants and deodorants are different because antiperspirants block sweating from happening while deodorants do not stop it and make it not smell bad.

&amp;nbsp;

Here’s what I’m confused about: I shower every day at night, put on antiperspirant (stick) and I sometimes still sweat where I’ve applied it under my arms (even through my undershirt and my shirt over that). Also, I’m very paranoid about if I smell bad. People have made comments but don’t tell me if I smell. I’ve even asked like 3 people and they ALL say I don’t smell (family/friends I mean, not people who have made comments). I’ve used stick antiperspirants since I was like 13 (I’m now 18) rather than stick deodorant and I’ve read that antiperspirants can somehow make you smell WORSE long term. How does this make sense???

&amp;nbsp;

Also, the Men’s Dove Antiperspirant stick I’m using (and any antiperspirant stick I’ve used) has a scent to it to mask the smell of sweat and body odor. I’m very confused because I’ve read that ONLY deodorant has a scent to mask the smell of body odor and sweat. My Antiperspirant only says Antiperspirant, not Antiperspirant + Deodorant. So, WHAT is the difference between Deodorant and Antiperspirant if they both mask the smell of sweat and body odor with a pleasant scent? Is it just that Antiperspirant usually has aluminum to prevent sweating in the first place? I am so confused because I still sweat.

&amp;nbsp;

I tried wearing Dove Men’s Deodorant stick instead of Dove Men’s Antiperspirant stick but I thought it might have not been working at all somehow when I used it, so I stopped. Also, it’s like Antiperspirant sticks are ALL I can use on my skin because my skin is sensitive to deodorant sticks, even kinds meant for sensitive skin apparently. So, it’s not like I can just not use Antiperspirant sticks. I am so confused. Do I now smell **worse** when I’m not using an Antiperspirant stick because I’ve been using Antiperspirant for so many years? Like, do I just smell worse forever now? I read that it’s possible to smell worse like that when using antiperspirant daily, which I do.

&amp;nbsp;

Doesn’t like the whole world use antiperspirant sticks daily??? I’m so confused what my problem is here. Please help. Why do I still sweat when wearing Antiperspirant? I’m also confused by the fact that apparently only deodorant should give a scent that covers body odor and sweat, because I’ve only ever used antiperspirant that also has a scent.

905,"I (18F) am not exactly a social person and it takes me a lot of time and courage to open up to other people. In my life I only considered 2 people my true friends, up until recently. Let's call these girls Jenna and Grace. We met at school 5 years ago but became friends about 3 years ago. I don't think we are a perfect match, we three have completely different interests and I think it was a coincidence that we became friends, but we stuck together so I didn't question it that much. Now Jenna and I go to the same school, but we all three see each other regularly. 


Last year was really hard for me. A year ago my beloved grandma passed away. That left me devastated, I was too torn up to tell anyone, even Jenna and Grace. As I said before I am very withdrawn person and these were the hardest moments of my life. It's not that I lied to them, I just didn't tell them anything. It happened on Saturday and my parents decided that it was better for me to go back to school on Monday. On this day I met Jenna at the school corridor. It must had been showing that I had a rough time because she asked if something bad had happened. I said ""yes, something happened"" and I just physically couldn't say anything else. Jenna didn't push on me and never brought that up again. I was kind of glad because I wasn't able to talk about it. Besides I didn't want them to treat me differently because I was in mourn, I wanted to have normal life around them because I thought that would make it more bearable. It took me 6 months to tell anyone about my grandma. I talked about it with Jenna and it was hard for me, but afterwards I was relieved. I never told Grace because I couldn't go through it second time. 11 months passed and I started to come to terms with the loss. 


Two months ago I lost my close uncle. It was really sudden, he was young and healthy man. He died in his sleep. It was another tragedy in my family. It happened on Thursday and Jenna, Grace and I were supposed to meet on Saturday to celebrate Grace's birthday. My uncle lived in a different city, so we left our city right away after we received the message. So of course I canceled our meeting and this time I decided to tell them what happened right away (this time I knew it would only get worse and worse if I didn't tell anybody). The only way to do it for me was to message them on our group chat (I know it's bad but I had no choice). They didn't write back. And I mean ANYTHING. No ""sorry for your loss"", no ""if you want to talk about it, I'm here for you"". Nothing. I absolutely didn't want them to pity me, but it's a common decency to offer one's condolences, for god's sake! And we considered each other friends. I felt horrible.


A few days later they started to use group chat like nothing had happened. When I went back to school after a few days Jenna caught me on the corridor. I didn't want to talk to her. She said ""I haven't seen you for a while"" and I just said ""that's because I haven't been going to school"" and went to my class. 


And then I just let it all slide, because all I wanted to do was go back to normal. Then quarantine happened and it generated more problems for me and my family. I guess the situation is bad for anyone and it pushed me to confront my friends about their behavior. 


A group chat is our only way to communicate for now. So today Grace was complaining about some problems she had with her education path. She does that very often, but I try to cheer her up when I am able to. So I also did it this time, but she said my words were not helpful. I got hurt because I tried to help her out. I acted on emotion and wrote a long message. I said that at least I had tried to help and then told Jenna and Grace that I feel like I can't talk to them about my problems because of how they ignored me after I told them about my loss. 


Then Grace said that we also ignore her problems (I know that I am biased and angry but I think her problems are minor. That doesn't mean she can't feel ignored sometimes, but I think ignoring some school drama once doesn't exclude you from being a decent human and ignoring your friends loss does.)


Jenna said she was sorry and that she should have reacted differently. She said that she is not good in showing emotion and compassion (which is true, but I don't think it justifies her action). 


I don't know what to think of this situation. Did I overreact? Was it a right to confront them about that? Is this how true friends behave? Should I try to fix our friendship or move on? 




tl;dr: my best friends didn't say anything and didn't try to help me when I lost a family member. ",26Apr2020,1

Just looking for some advice of anyone who works in the medical field but without a medical degree or training. 

I completed my undergraduate degree in 2017 in Political science. My main focus was in global inequality and international development. After graduating I started to work as an Auxiliary Nurse for the NHS, first in DME and currently in Emergency. I always wanted to study Medicine but it wasn't something that was encouraged whilst I was growing up so I took a different direction. I've applied to medical school twice sine graduating. First time I obtained an offer but missed my conditions by one mark in Chemistry. Second time round I've got an offer but Corona is giving me a lot of doubts that it will work out. 

Just wondering if this is a sign and I should look into something alternative that's medical related. I love my job at the moment because of the level of clinical practice I get but starting to think that I might have to sacrifice that for career development. Thought about nursing but having worked with some incredible nurses over the past few years, I just cant bring myself to commit to a career that takes that much but gives so little while I still have other options and potential. Nurses with years worth of experience and knowledge are being paid the same as newly qualified, any additional training isn't being recognised financially or within banding, and their work load continues to grow with little to no recognition of that. 

Anyone out there got any advice? Ideally I'd like something research based with the scope for development and progression!",26Apr2020,1
909,"Throwaway because I'm a coward. Anyways, to make a long story short, 2 years ago (when I was 18) my friend and I got into an argument with this kid in a group chat and my friend started to bother him by pretending to speak chinese to him (he was Asian but idk if chinese). Because I was a dumb teenager who thought extremely selfishly, I joined in. He ended up leaving the chat and ever since then I have felt extremely guilty. I no longer have contact with the guy but if I could I would want to apologize.

Lately I've been obsessing over this and I can't help but worry that I'm some kind of secret racist. I haven't done anything like that before/since then so it was super out of character for me. But now I'm thinking...what if that's just my true nature? Am I some closeted racist? I keep trying to tell myself I only did it out of ignorance and not hate but I can't seem to convince myself. Why would I do such a thing? To go out of my way to hurt someone? I feel like a horrible person...I honestly feel like I'm as bad as a white supremacist. I seriously feel like the worst person in the world.

It hurts even more knowing that was my last interaction with the guy. He will only remember me as the racist chick who mocked him for no reason. I feel selfish for thinking this but, I wish I could give him something better to remember me by...knowing he will remember me like that for the rest of his life eats away at me. But I guess that's my price to pay. At the end of the day though, I just wish I could move on from this. But I feel so guilty...and I'm so scared. I don't want to be a hateful person. Do I even deserve to forgive myself?

Sorry this is so depressing...this has been weighing me down lately. I'm not looking to excuse myself or look for pity btw - I did something bad and wrong and now I have to reap what I've sown. I just want to see if anyone has done something similar (I doubt it but you never know)? Or maybe advice on how to start moving on from this? And maybe how to (eventually) forgive myself?

TLDR; I did something racist to someone two years ago. I feel really guilty about it and I'm nervous that I'm actually a secret racist and that was my true nature coming out.

911,"         ⚠️WARNING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  ⚠️ 
my cousin used to babysit me when I was in 1st-3rd grade, she was in high and She watched me all the time almost everyday. She had a boyfriend and she would take me over his house or he would come to mine since she watched me there most of the time. He was abusive and very possessive, he was like at first that I knew of. they would yell and it was very scary. She usually would tell me to go down stairs or I would leave, so they could argue but sometimes she forgot I was there and it would get out of hand. 

     This one time we was over his house in his room and he came in and they started arguing in front of the door so I couldn’t get out of the room they started yelling then fighting and he started choking  her.I was like 6 or 7 they I was small I didn’t get my growth spurt yet so I wasn’t that big. I couldn’t do anything or leave so I balled up and the corner and started crying. He eventually stopped and left. She had a busted lip and a black eye and bruise around her neck. That was the first time I saw it happen but I heard it numerous times and had nightmares that he would come for me. I think he raped her a couple of times  but I don’t really remember well , I blocked it out all I remember is the screams, I wasn’t in the room during this but I could hear. He never touched me she wouldn’t let him but he would threaten her that he would if she didn’t listen. I was afraid of loud sounds and yelling because of this he stopped coming around after he beat her in front of me.
       I think they broke up but when I was in 3rd grade it happened again she moved bc she was in college. I was with her He found her. Broke into her apartment forced his way inside and beat her again I called the police this time he got arrested she went to the hospital. My mom never knew about it because she told me it was our secret and I couldn’t tell. She told my mom that it only happened once which was a lie. My mom didn’t seek help for me and now when I see a man and a women and her sounds of distress I freeze  and start crying and get scared I’m 17 now. 

  I know I need help, how do I tell my mom I went through all this she’s kinda hard to open up to? 
She’ll focus more on the i didn’t tell her, rather then the situation. I tried to tell help before. I gave up for awhile. deep down I scared he’ll come for me. I saw him the other day at the store he recognized me I ran away before he said anything. I thought I forgot but he triggered the memories. I started having nightmares again. How should I tell her this happened and I need help, she’ll go to the police and cause a big scene he already went to jail. I don’t talk to my cousin anymore I run away from her as well when I see her. my cousin is married and has kids, she doesn’t like talking abt or bringing up the past.

912,"I don't know what to do. I'm kinda mentally ill, my mind feels blank most of the time and I feel like I'm watching myself, not living life. I wasn't always like this. I guess this is a symptom of ADHD which I have been diagnosed with, and anxiety/depression. Also been diagnosed with bipolar II but that has been disputed. Gonna go back to school in the summer. I have no motivation to do anything and it's hard for me to talk to people so I don't really have any friends and my family all either never spoke to me in my life (dad's side) or are scared of me because I threatened to stab myself one time. They are all weird narcissists anyway so it's not a big deal. I have been taking antidepressants and a low dose of Seroquel but it didn't help, I quit and started jogging and I feel better. The depersonalization is going away slowly. I still feel really terrible all the time, no friends or girlfriend since like 2011. I know I'm not retarded but I abused Benadryl for like six months and it fucked up my brain. Memory is damaged. I'm also broke, I survive off food stamps and $150 I get each month. I have like a mental health service that pays my rent thank god. Applied for SSI but it's a long process. On top of the child abuse, total social isolation, I just can't take it anymore. I need an alternative treatment for my mental problems, I plan on ketamine treatment when I have the money. Also interested in psychedelics. Never been psychotic or anything, no record, just sad and bored all the time, suicidal, socially isolated, constantly thinking of suicide and I don't know what to do. Weed helps a lot but it's expensive. I need to make a change. As my mental health improves I wake up more to the reality of my life which kinda makes me even more depressed, but I guess it's a good sign.",26Apr2020,1

I can't and don't want to get diagnosis. It's too expensive, waiting time is at least a year, and I'll never take pills anyway. 

I grew up with no acceptance of excuses, with any mental health issues classifying someone as faulty and useless. Yet I don't want people to assume I am purposefully slacking off.

915,"Lately I’ve been feeling very lonely and neglected by my family and today has been a very bad day. My parents know I’m struggling with depression but they don’t reach out to me to ask how I’m doing or what they can do and I don’t know how to reach out to them. It sounds really stupid and childish but to me, asking for help or comfort is so hard that I either don’t say anything or do things to make them come to me. Today after dinner I sat at the dinner table just twirling my spoon around a bowl for a long time. Everyone had already left the table but every now and again they passed it, but ignored me. After awhile my mom simply told me to stop it. So I did and went to my room. I usually cry quietly but tonight I felt like crying out loud so maybe my parents would come and check up on me. They didn’t. After that I was just wishing for them to come and say goodnight but I just went downstairs and noticed they’ve already gone to bed. I don’t know what to do with myself, I keep crying and having negative thoughts. I just needed a hug or something from someone I love but I feel so unwanted by everyone.",26Apr2020,1

919,"Our neighbours drive us mad. 

Context to our relationship with them: They are really old and kind of racist and backwards. I don't subscribe to the school of thought where it's fine to be racist/sexist/homophobic/etc because you are old. Not mean, just ignorant (asked me when I learnt English...I was born in England but I am brown). They also have no boundaries. We were playing Just Dance one morning (...lockdown life) and turned around to her IN OUR KITCHEN  having come through the open patio doors. They come through the garden to talk to us about shit like wheelie bin schedules, and let our dog out (who is a rescue pup we have had just 4 months). The man yelled at my partner once because he wants to ""say hi then just get straight in the car"". My partner was furious, as he isn't obliged to stand around talking every morning before work. Last year we boarded up the spaces between planks in our fence because we couldn't stand them speaking to us every time we went into our garden. When my partner's Dad visited to put up some decking, the man walked into the garden to see what was happening and called my partner's Dad ""bloody rude"" for not saying hello (we was drilling in a patio and hadn't even noticed our neighbour).

So, recently the husband had a stroke and it triggered fast progressing vascular dementia. He is becoming more aggressive every day. Yells at his wife, argues loudly in the garden all day, calls her a useless bitch and lazy woman and tells her to fuck off. The other day he fell and I went into his garden to help him up. He said it was his wife's fault for shutting the door and he would ""deal with her inside"". Day in and day out he screams these things and it's highly concerning. They have no family, just a kid who fell out with them and hasn't spoken to them in almost a decade.

I phoned the Red Cross for advice about local dementia services and they said I should speak to social work and gave me a number. I rang and spoke to the social work hotline who said they would visit immediately and try to arrange support. I feel like I should do more, especially with the lockdown, but they were so toxic before the lockdown/dementia I don't want to go near them.

When I told my family about the situation just in a general group chat they were angry with me and thought I was being selfish and rude. They said I should have spoken to the neighbours before phoning social services. They also said I should try and get in contact WITH THEIR ESTRANGED  DAUGHTER to tell her first. I don't even know where I'd start with that mission. My Grandmother got really into lecturing me about what it means to be a good neighbour. I explained that I'm worried about the wife not having enough support with his aggression and they thought I shouldn't have phoned social work but offered to do their shopping/help with housework/etc. I am a primary teacher and pointed out that if I had the same concerns regarding a child I would be negligent not to report it. I'm really hurt they are making out I'm being selfish. 

Some other perspectives on this please? My fiance says just because we live next door doesn't mean we need to be on call carers, especially considering the past relationship with them. We are shopping for 2 other households (one sick and transport less and the other has a new born) during the lockdown as it is, while both working from home. But maybe we are just being as my family thinks 'selfish spoilt millennials'. Please tell me honest takes on the situation!

TLDR: Our neighbours are difficult and toxic. The husband now had a stroke and now has fast progressing dementia. He is becoming very abusive to his wife. I phoned social care. My family think I'm in the wrong.",26Apr2020,1

I want to back out of this plan I clearly don’t need, I believe I was falsely diagnosed with ADHD and it has literally ruined my life. I’ve been In special ed for literally no reason at all and I am miles ahead of my peers in almost everything. They finally let me out after  me literally getting a 3.8 gpa for 4 mps. I now hold a 3.3 gpa in general classroom setting and have been doing fantastic. I want to tell them at this meeting I don’t need the support I can do it myself and I want to be able to select my classes. It’s my fucking future and I am sick of being told what I can and can’t do. I scored decently high on the IQ test and everything points towards me not needing this stupid plan but they refuse. I am towards the point where I may just tell them to go fuck themselfs and not even go to the meeting. It’s through a video call. They told me they’ll let me make the jump to 2 CP classes and my response to my case manager was that do I need to get another 3.8 gpa before you let me decide my future? I want honors I love history so much and I really can’t explain why honors history would be without a doubt fantastic. I read the sophomore year English book in 7th grade! (1984) I took the Junior AP final and Senior AP final and got one question wrong on both of them. (My case manager from middle school use to teach high school AP classes) I am so much smarter then what they are giving me credit for. They think I am a some useless bastard with no place in this world. Maybe there right maybe I have no future but I could give 2 shits. I know what I am capable of and I will literally drag that meeting on for hours if I have to, I know what I want. I am under the impression that I could easily take a AP course right now in history sophomore year. They won’t let me but that’s understandable, but they won’t let me even take the tests for them.

I felt like ive been doing all of this out of being pressured into it, i dont feel comfortable moving to new york city at this time, I still have a year left of college and my mental health is crumbling everyday. The city is really terrible, and on top of that moving into bushwick makes me feel like a shitty gentrifier in a time where people need this space more than ever. 

I can't even come to a final decision about this, I've sat here since 1PM deciding. I really don't want to go but I have this fear of missing out on something and that it would be stupid to not take up the opportunity, It's so hard to decide. For background my family doesn't come from money and I'll have to get a job either way, no matter if i stay upstate or not.

My mother says I can stay here over the summer and look for a regular job when things re-open and to not worry as I have a year left of school, but my Father and his wife keep badgering me about this job and to take it, saying things like ""the pandemic will blow over, its not that bad, etc etc, take the risk). They are also telling me to consider finishing school part time online, I think this is all just a ploy to get me off their back financially, I've always felt like a burden to them. Both my parents kindve suck at emotionally supporting me and this makes me feel crazy, and really mentally weak, I feel like a weakling loser right now but I'm extremely stressed here. 

I don't know what the right move is, but something about staying upstate, collecting my mental health and not having to work full time through a pandemic seems good and nurturing and caring of myself, then finding a random job and going back to school, but then again, i keep going back on it thinking im a weakling and lazy, because im being made to feel that way.

I am planning on going to University in September but I have my doubts. I haven’t been feeling passionate about what i’m going to study. If i’m being honest, I feel like the only thing I’m excited for is the social aspect, moving away and partying. I guess i’ll never feel confident about what I want to study but going to Uni in September feels rushed and it doesn’t feel 100% right to me. 

I have two options:
1) I go to University this September. 
or 
2) I take a gap year, move away with my parents and maybe get a job there and do things like getting my driver’s license. Then go to University next year. 

Each option has its pros and cons. If I take option (2), I think i’d really miss not socialising like my friends will be in University this year and I don’t know if i’ll be able to handle another year living with my parents. But if I don’t take option (2), then I feel i’m missing an exciting opportunity to travel with my parents, live in a different country and having the time to explore.

I was just in a horrible place. There was one girl that thought I was cute. Originally, I thought she was only a year younger than me. We started talking and eventually started talking everyday. We were really close friends and it was obvious we were both trying to date each other, until the subject of birthdays came up, which was 3 or 4 months down the line. How it never did, I honestly have no clue. We knew it would most likely never work out because of the age gap of 2 and a half years and cut things off.

Depending on which kind of school you go to (Realschule/IGS or Gymnasium) , you rather graduate after 10th grade and go do something else (getting a job, doing a so-called ""Fachabitur"", etc) or directly continue after 10th grade till 12th grade (can also be 13th, depends) to get an Abitur (which is considered as the highest education grade, while the Fachabitur is only the second highest). 

Since I go to a Gymnasium, I'd be continuing next year with my school activity here and do my Abitur. But I have been struggling with some stuff for a while now and it's been getting worse again since last year and school is just putting even more stress on me and makes it even more difficult for me to handle/cope with everything. I feel like I can't physically do anything anymore and everytime I try to do some work I can't concentrate and focus, take any information in or even process it and get so incredibly overwhelmed by the smallest things. When I sit here and look at tbe stuff I have to do, I just break down. And as if it wasn't already difficult before, quarantine just put me in a really bad place again and it's already too much to handle for me. I don't really want to do my Abitur and I don't care about it, the only reason I wanna keep going is for my friends and also bc I feel like it would be a waste of those years I've been going to a Gymnasium, just to graduate? after 10th grade bc I could've just gone to a IGS then. But I also think I can't really go on and take much more anymore, so I'm kinda conflicted rn bc maybe it'll be easier next year? It seems to become more chill in 11th grade but idk. The thought of having to physically go to school again next week (or rather the week after next week) makes me just want to dig a hole in the ground and never get out of there again. But I'm also kinda scared bc I don't really know what I'd do if I'd quit now. Should I stop now or should I try and keep going? I really don't know what to do. 

TL;DR: Struggle with mental health stuff, which makes school too much to handle but not sure if I should really call it quits or try and keep going?",26Apr2020,1
941,"Me and my uncle share a very close bond with each other. And ever since I can remember I’ve always been fascinated by his Swiss Army knife.

So, when I turned twelve, he made the drive down to where I live (about a two and a half hour drive) to surprise me with my very own Swiss Army knife with my initials professionally engraved into the blade. Also, it’s the real deal so it wasn’t cheap.

It was really personal and it still is my absolute favourite gift that I’ve ever received.

But, about two months later me and my family went on a family holiday to Hungary, and without my knowledge my father packed my knife in the suitcase, and once we got to the hotel and I realised he had packed my knife I was understandably annoyed at my father.

And after about a week abroad it was time to go back home and I made my dad check that my knife was in the suitcase, and he reassured me it was. So, one we get home we start to unpack and once all of our stuff is unpacked I realised that my knife wasn’t there.

But, my dad tells me that he was ‘sure it was going to turn up’ . But, low and behold almost one year hast passed and no knife.

And it not like I can get a new one easily because of the engraving, and I’m really annoyed at my dad for bringing MY knife on a holiday because ‘it might come in handy’

Also I completely HATE lying to my uncle but I have to keep coming up with excuses for fear of his reaction and my family’s reaction. ( my family has fallen out of smaller things than this so it scares me to think what might happen ).

So, Reddit, what do I do, I can keep lying to my uncle about the knife hoping he never finds out?

Or do I face the music and tell my uncle that my knife is somewhere in Hungary.",26Apr2020,1

In the past, we've both expressed attraction for each other, but I'm still nervous to take the plunge, more so than if I was asking out someone I didn't know as well.

He says his relationship with her is special and has never had a connection with anyone like he he with her. He even went far as going across the country to meet her one time. Now she is engaged and he is depressed and says he doesn’t care about anything anymore. He makes Facebook statuses like “loving you is killing me” and “you’ll never how much I love and care about you”. I tell him to snap the fuck out of it and it’s even real and he just gets mad and says “you don’t know what it’s like to have a true connection with someone”. He is ready to kill himself over this girl. Does anyone have any advice??? He is acting sad every time we hang out and won’t get over the fact he will never be with her.

945,"
My whole life i was working for achieving my dream, to be the one who is heard. I have my own story, my feelings, my emotions... i wanted to share them with the whole world, so people can find it helpful for themselves.
Im a musician, songwriter and singer..
I started to sing, when i started to talk.
At the kinder-garden, schools i was always shining on events, always singing, dancing. I was talented, i was loved, but at the same time, i was alone. I got bullied. When i was younger, people of my age never understood me. Since they all were interested in love life, i was just having fun, making music, working, singing, making money by concerts in pubs, bars, Cafés and by teaching to play instruments.
That was really cool, i had a lot of friends, i really did, but i always felt so lonely, because i don’t need 1000 friends, no, just one, but real friend was enough for me.
I was working crazy, at the same time i was working as a chef in a restaurant to make money, so i can help my family, and to get everything i need for my Musical needs as a technique and etc.
I was not studying very hard at school, i always got every information very easily so i was not doing anything to have good grades and etc...
So i got accepted to one of the best colleges in the world with full scholarship.
That was a whole new chance for me to get better.And i did it.
I recorded bunch of good songs, i made them with my whole soul, i was recording, playing singing, mastering and mixing everything by myself, I’ve learned to do it better and better by the time.
People around me were saying that im incredibly talented, and i will have the best future. 
It was really hard, constructing the time for education, music, and personal life.
I was in a big depression.
My love life ugh...that was great, im good looking, so i never needed man’s attention, i was not really interested. But i fell in love for real just 1 time, i had many other relationships but i can call real just one of them and that was the one which hurts  me the most...you’ll never imagine kind of a love story, people can write books and make movies out of it. But it had a bad bur right end, so i continued to live without loving anyone again.
And now im still doing my job, having some concerts, but i can’t see any results. I did a lot of things, i made my songs like my own kids, raised them, shared them. But still i don’t have much opportunity to be heard more. I appreciate what i have, i really do... but now i feel that i did so many things for no reason..
When i was a kid i was imagining like im a Freddy Mercury, standing on a stage of a huge stadium, and the crowd is singing with me my songs, i was feeling it..
How im playing my guitar and singing at a big stage, evening, rain, crowd, music... i was dreaming, and crying because in my imagination i felt every second of it. I wanted to make it real. I wanted to be a legend. I was born for it.
But now i feel that... it was nothing, im nothing, and my life is useless, i don’t have much money, to go and get a contract with a big label, i don’t see music as a business and a music making machine.. i will do it for free... just for my feelings..
I wanted my kid self to be proud of me. To feel that i did it, that all the bullying was not right, and i deserve to be what i want...
Im losing my self, im losing my passion, i don’t see meaning to live..
Maybe that’s right, i don’t want to wait for death to come, i will just do it and get rid of those feelings cause im tired of trying.
Thats my story and I’ll leave it here.
Thank you for reading.",26Apr2020,1

My father died of health issues and diabetes runs in the family, so I'm trying to prevent that by eating healthier and exercising. I woke up late today at 12:00 pm. Because of that I only ate some pineapple for breakfast. Since I woke up late lunch came shortly after and because of the pineapple I didn't have much room for lunch but still took a bite or two. Keep in mind I usually eat so much because of my mother and I always feel like throwing up because of overeating...

950,"I (m21) have always been kind of a loner. There are several reasons for this, but suffice it to say I've never had a real girlfriend and I'm not invited to much by my regular friends. People seem to like me just fine, but there must be something about me idk.

Anyway, this is important because the girl became the first real friend of mine in a long time. She would ask me to hang out with her, shed look like she was listening to me, and she seemed to care about me. I tried not to make assumptions, because not only am I no stranger to rejection, but I've never actually received a ""yes"" in that category of life.

To make a long story short, she eventually stopped hanging out with me, despite my efforts to continue our friendship. I never made a romantic move on her. I had no choice but to accept it after about a month and a half of ""sorry, I'm busy"". Eventually (about 8 months after meeting her) she asked if I wanted to hang out again, and of course I said yes. We started hanging out once more, and she told me I was her best friend multiple times. 

One night we drank together, heavily. Neither of us are very heavy (145 and 120lbs) but we finished a full bottle of tequila and a bottle of whiskey. We were pretty drunk. She confessed she used to have a crush on me, which led to me confessing my crush on her. She said so many great things about how she really liked me, and wanted to go out, but she had trust issues, so she wanted to hang out more first. She even made a video of her saying ""if we hang out more, I will 110% date [me]."" She eventually left for home.

After that night I messaged her when we weren't drunk to see if she meant it. She said she did. I was ecstatic. But we never hung out after that. Much later, quarantine started, and I got a cat named Caroline that means the world to me, and I finally grew the balls to tell her all the things I was feeling, even if it was over text. 

Do you think I did the right thing? The problem is I know shes a good person, the problem is she has a bad habit of telling people lies she thinks they want to hear to make them feel better. In my case, it ripped me apart. Shes messaged me, but I cant summon the nerve to look at it because I'm afraid I'll forgive her if she starts doing what she normally does (cry and beg forgiveness). I dont want to go through this anymore.",26Apr2020,1

952,"Okay so I'm a 25(f) I'm currently struggling a lot with my mental health. So I'm going to start this off for a majority of my life I struggled to make friends due to my mom being drug addict(meth) that also struggles with self harm and my dad not being there for me(he raised my step sister and younger half brother) which led to my grandparents raising me since I was 2 years old. The way I coped with a lot the stuff relating to my parents was self isolating myself,taking care of my dog, put myself into art and I really only hung out with my older brother and my younger sister and their friends outside of school with the one exception of my best friend who I rarely hung out with. When I was 18 my best friend passed away in a car accident and I didn't try making any friends until I was 23. I got to know my dad when I was 19 but he passed away from cancer when I was 20.

When I was 23-24 years old I dated a guy that told me I'm to clingy/demanding(I don't think I am and neither does my therapist). Now while I dated him my dog died and my mom was diagnosed with cancer. I was called too emotional by him(My therapist has found it strange that I haven't cried to her once about anything and that their seems to be a emotional blockage). Well that guy told me things like my career I wanted to do wasn't a career(flight attendant), that I was a lowered standard, he called me a cumdumpster. When I broke up with him he told me I'd be better off if my mom would kill herself.

Now I thought I made good friends at my previous job, would hang out with them outside of work. I even briefly dated one but that is where I screwed up and soon a false pregnancy rumor about me happened(a girl got mad I was dating the guy) which resulted in me getting in trouble at work, as well as the guy ending things with me and it got back to my grandparents who I live with who are very anti sex before marriage so I almost got kicked out of my house I ultimately ended up quitting my job because I realized it was a toxic environment and people were not talking to me in fact one of the girls threw hot water on a coworker and didn't get in trouble. 

Well since all this stuff happened I've been really down. I lost my whole friend group and I don't know anyone. The last two years my art has been non existent as well as interests and other hobbies now that I'm on anti depressants it's getting better. I'm really scared to make friends again because everyone stopped talking to me. I just feel worthless as a person and other things. I don't know where to start I'm now jobless at 25. I'm going to weekly therapy appointments now which is helping, I'm   
 looking for a job but the corona virus has a lot of places shut down.

953,"I am 18 (m) and a straight white Christian. I, like most, am quarantined and that has allowed me to look back at the last year and a half of my life. I was talking to one of my friends who is a feminist and very vocal about it. The other day I vaguely suggested that I am struggling emotionally, hence the post. She didn't provide any help, in fact she got mad at me that I take what I have for granted.

961,"I (M:17) had been playing GTA with this group of people for a few weeks, and we were good friends (at least in my eyes). We would always invite each other to chats etc as soon as we got online and we would always have a great time. However, yesterday I did something that ended all of that. 

We were just doing one of the missions we always used to do, and everything was going on as usual. Then it came to the part where we would steal a getaway vehicle. I found one that would fit all of us, so I told them that and I jumped in the driver seat. I asked them to jump in, since we all needed to go to the same point on the map anyway. One person, let's call him Roy, said: ""If you are the one driving, I'm not riding with you"". I asked him why he said that, but he just continued to look for a car. I found it arrogant (which was probably not what it was), so I said without thinking: ""Ok, f@k you then you piece of shit"". That's where I messed up. 

He went quiet for a bit, so I asked him why he was so silent. He told me that I shouldn't be surprised if people don't talk to you after you call them 'a piece of shit'. If I'm being honest, I forgot that I had even said that, cause it just sort of slipped out of me. I didn't really mean anything bad towards him when I said it (I know that sounds like the biggest pile of bullshit ever, but it's true), but I understood that I messed up. I said ""Look dude, I'm sorry for that. I just don't get why you just wouldn't jump in so we could get this mission over with"" (A vague apology). He didn't say anything. As soon as we finished the mission, he left the party chat and invited everyone else to a locked one that I couldn't join. 

I tried to talk to Roy through text messages. I tried to give him a more nuanced apology, but he just wouldn't accept it. I then saw that he removed me from his friends list. I told him that I was upset, but that I understood that I didn't really have a say in it. I apologized to him again, and the other two people that were in the session at the time. I thought I would just give him some space, so I could come back later to fully prove that I was actually sorry. 

However, every mutual friend of Roy and me has now either removed me from their friends list, or just outright blocked me. I guess he decided to tell everyone what happened from his view. I can still contact Roy, but I don't know where to go from here. I know I messed up, I have tried to apologize but nothing I do seems to help. At this point I don't want to be forgiven, I just want him to know that I am sorry.

965,"I (24M) got into a relationship with my long-distance bf (29M) about two years ago. Early on, he revealed to me that he is polyamorous. I've learned to be okay with this, though sometimes the silly emotions of jealousy and doubt make me struggle. About a year or so into our relationship, he got back together with an ex of his (29? M) that he had previously been with for about 6 years, part of that time spent with another partner (in a three person relationship. They are not long-distance.

This was fine with me. I finally met my bf earlier this month. About a week before seeing him, his other partner broke up with him, saying that he is no longer sure about how the polyamorous life is healthy for him. However, he seemed to be flip-flopping, as a few days later, he changed his mind. I did see him once when I visited my bf. He was awkward, and put on this sort of ""I'm tough"" persona to mask his nervousness. 

When I returned home, he privately messaged me to tell me that he definitively has broken up with my bf, and that he has zero desire to be sexually intimate with him anymore, and for outside reasons that I don't believe are relevant to this, can't trust him romantically. Imagine my shock when my bf texts me not 6 hours later saying that this other guy now is asking to have sex with him! No! What??
They said they had a long talk about boundaries, and that they both believe that pursuing their relationship fueher would be unhealthy. This ex later told me he asked my bf about sex ""to see if he would be faithful to me."" Which sounds like something he made up after the fact.

Today, though, my bf texted me *again* that his ex wants to have a talk with the three of us. Presumably about getting together with him again. This not only is getting really tiresome, it's making me anxious and paranoid. Almost like this guy is acting indecisive and irratic to make me want to dip so he can have my bf to himself or something. Honestly, after going on a long shpiel about how he *definitely* doesn't want to be with my bf anynore and less than half a day later wanted to have sex with him makes me not trust him at *all.* I've been being friendly to keep the peace, but at this point I don't want to be around him.   It feels like such a huge red flag. 

What makes it worse is that my bf is moving in with him in a month because his current lease will be up, his roomies want to have a place to themselves, and he's the only viable option for a roommate right now...

I don't kniwbhow to express all of this. I feel like if my bf is having this conversation if the first place, it means he at least is considering getting back together with this guy. And if they both want to and I say no, won't I be the bad guy? How would I get over the idea that, what if they're messing around behind my back anyway?

This feels so complicated and stupid. I really resent this ex for doing this. I don't know what to say in our conversation later.",26Apr2020,1
966,"Sometimes thinking about starting things makes me anxious. It’s either “you don’t have time to do that, do it another day”, “it’s not gonna turn out perfect and you’re going to fail”, or a constant feeling of I’m wasting my time and need to do more “important things”. What’s worse is it makes me more anxious when I stop doing things and just sit and do nothing. It’s not that these things are unimportant, I bet they would make me happy but the moment I wanna start the anxiety sets in and then I stop. Does anyone have advice for this and some type of affirmations to tell myself to approach it in a different way?",26Apr2020,1

Ill give some context so u know the situation better. He cheated on his wife with my mom, and i was born as a result. He went back to his wife, and I grew up with my mom and my stepdad, who joined us when i was about 1. Ive never had any sort of confidence around him, everything feels so artificial. I got myself to call him my dad, but it never felt right. We took a trip together once, and it was extremely awkward. At 15 I got tired of his shit, and I told him he had to be better if he wanted to ever see me again. Things got better, sorta. We went out together sorta regularly, but mostly went to have lunch at fancy restaurants, as if nice food would make up for everything. 

I didn't plan to stop seeing him for a while, it just sort of happened because I really disliked being around him, and it snowballed. Im about to hit the 2 year mark, and he's texted me a lot of times. I havent answered to anything, thats probably unfair to him, but i just dont feel like. A part of me wants to make it right, and try to build a proper relationship. My shitty relationship to him has fucked up me up many ways, and im sick of it. The other part knows that he's an emotionally detached robot, and having the sort of relationship im thinking of will never be possible. If I were to go through with it, how should I do it? Im bad at boundaries and knowing what I have a right to ask for too, so giving me some advice on that regard would be nice (i know little about building good relationships honestly lol).

She's still required to do online learning, and the superintendent says this week they'll be adding more to her current lesson plan as of this week because of the extended school closure. She's in third grade, very smart but she definitely needs help. My brother stays home with her during the day, but he's up until about 6 a.m. and then sleeps all day. This means she doesn't have a lot of social interaction, or help, direction, even motivation to get up when I set her alarm. I leave for work at about 530, before she gets up. I'm thinking of applying for unemployment through the new what I think it's called cares act. For people that dont traditionally apply for unemployment, and I do not since I am considered an essential worker my boss will not lay me off.

He said the sooner we return all the paperwork, the faster the process will be. We really wanted the place and didn’t think too much of it and did everything we needed to do and even gave the security deposit check that same night and he said if everything goes well I should be able to know if I’m approved by the next day... I texted him today and it said he read my message but hasn’t responded and it has been almost 3 hours since he read it. I started to overthink because he has a check of ours with a big amount of money and have no response from him, so I decided contact the owner of the property to see if he sent them our application paper like he said he would. The owner said she didn’t receive anything and that I shouldn’t have given a security deposit, but said not to worry that she will contact him and see what is going on... I am a bit worried because we were trying to move ASAP and can’t take a loss of this huge amount of money....

983,"I have a lot of trauma surrounding friendships. I was best friends with a someone for years while they emotionally abused and manipulated me and it gave me a really skewed idea of what friendship is supposed to look like. Now, I have a lot of trouble telling if I'm overreacting to small changes due to trauma or if there's actually nothing wrong and I'm overanalyzing. 

My really good friend, I would say my best friend, who I have known since the beginning of last semester (around the end of august) does not know any of this about me. Since around Easter, maybe a week or so before, I have noticed changes in the way she's interacting with me.

It's like she just doesn't want to talk to me. She doesn't reply to my texts often and she doesn't answer my facetimes, and considering that is the only way we can talk right now, it's a bigger deal than it usually would be. When she does reply, it's super short and cold, nothing like how she usually is with me.

I didn't want to jump to conclusions, so I have been periodically checking in on her to make sure she's okay, because I thought maybe the difference was due to her going through something, but she always says she's good and it sounds genuine.

990,"trigger warning : talk of self harm 
sorry for the long post 
 right, bit of a backstory - i(19,F)’ve had issues associated with self-harm and body dysmorphia from around ten. i did hide it from my family the entire time, either by strategically wearing clothes to cover the area or applying concealer over large areas of my body, however, i did live with my family for eight of these years and there were times where they saw them. 

i know this because if at any point they were showing, my mom would take note of where they were, wait until we were in a place with lots of people (family gathering, if my dad had work friends over, at my grandmothers birthday,etc), most of the time in front of elderly family members or young children, and create a scene by dramatically calling me out for it. my dad usually tried to calm her down but didn’t really try to help me either. 

the first time this happened, i presumed that my mom was going to confront me again in private, but it never happened. every time she brought it up in public, everyone would just act like it hadn’t happened afterwards. sometimes, i would get really angry at her because she wasn’t actually trying to help me in a productive way, she was just letting me know that she knew and then doing nothing to help me. if i confronted her, she’d always just divert the conversation to something different id done wrong and then pretend it never happened. 

this ended when i left for university, mainly because i don’t see them enough for it to be an issue. having left what was a pretty toxic high school environment my strange home environment, and being able to express myself properly, my self harm hasn’t been as much of a problem and i’ve been pretty much clean the entirety of quarantine :)

i’m home from uni with my parents and my family (two sisters under the age of 11) because of the current situation. all had been fine for about a month until i was out with my mom and sisters a few days ago and decided to wear shorts. i positioned them so that my scars were all hidden, and honestly, i was quite proud that my family relationship had come so far that i could now comfortably wear shorts around them. 

i sat down on a concrete slab in my neighbourhood to tie my lace and my mom pointed out my scars in a loud voice, loud enough that my sisters could hear. i was confused, because i knew none of them were visible, there were only stretch marks on my inner thighs, which clearly looked like stretch marks and not like sh scars. i told her that and she said she didn’t believe me and asked to take pictures to ask my dad ( he’s a doctor ) i of course said no, and  we both acted like nothing had happened. 

later, i confronted her like always, she wouldn’t listen to what i had to say and kept on telling me that she hoped i knew i was ruining my skin for the rest of my life, and that i should feel bad for ruining myself.
 
i had forgiven her, and we’ve been getting on fine. today, after having a nice evening with my parents, i headed to my room to finish an essay i’ve been writing and then go to bed. there was a wrapped box on my desk. i’m not sure why, but i got really excited - i thought that my mom was appreciating that she had been wrong and got me a present or something? 

i opened it and it was bio oil (which is this treatment that’s meant to get rid of stretch marks and scarring). i was so annoyed and when i asked my parents about it, my mom said that she was trying to fix me and that i should be grateful that she spent $20 to make me better. in all honesty, i have been using a treatment similar to bio oil since i was young, because i am self conscious, but in a strange way, i like my scars because they remind me of how far i’ve come.as much as i want them gone, in a weird way they make me feel strong and empowered.  it really annoyed me that my mom thought she had the right to ‘fix me’, i don’t think it’s her choice to make. i told them this and said that if they wanted to help they could’ve asked me first. my mom said she would take it back and she was annoyed she wasted money on me. my parents are very angry at me and i don’t see this ending any time soon. 

i’m so sorry for the long post, i’m sorry that it’s not a juicy secret, but some opinions or insights would really help. thanks :)",26Apr2020,1
991,Me and my girlfriend have been together for a year and a half. I lied to her about smoking and drinking some time ago and she caught me. Ever since then I've been lying again and saying I haven't done it when I have. Ever since she caught me the first time she's never trusted me. Even when it seemed like she did trust me she didn't. She had been emotionally abusive because of that. Constantly calling me a liar and a cheater and causing arguments over it. One night she started an argument and I got so sick of fighting with her I said I was done. Now she's sad because I want to leave and she keeps telling me she won't act like that anymore. I can't man up and tell the truth about me lying because she'll tell my grandparents which I am currently living with and they will be infuriated. Now I'm faced with 2 decisions. I leave her and block her and try to get over it. Or I stay with her and continue to lie and hope I never get caught.
